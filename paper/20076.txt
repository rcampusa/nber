                                          ABSTRACT

We show that firms’ idiosyncratic volatility obeys a strong factor structure and that shocks to the
common factor in idiosyncratic volatility (CIV) are priced. Stocks in the lowest CIV-beta quintile
earn average returns 5.4% per year higher than those in the highest quintile. The CIV factor helps
to explain a number of asset pricing anomalies. We provide new evidence linking the CIV factor
to income risk faced by households. These three facts are consistent with an incomplete markets
heterogeneous-agent model. In the model, CIV is a priced state variable because an increase in
idiosyncratic firm volatility raises the average household’s marginal utility. The calibrated model
matches the high degree of comovement in idiosyncratic volatilities, the CIV-beta return spread,
and several other asset price moments.

1       Introduction

We present new empirical evidence regarding the behavior of idiosyncratic risk and document
the implications of this behavior for asset prices. First, we show that the idiosyncratic
volatilities of U.S. firms are synchronized. Second, we show that this common idiosyncratic
volatility (CIV) is correlated with various measures of household labor income risk. Third,
we find that exposure to CIV shocks is priced in the cross-section of stocks.

    We then propose a heterogeneous-agent model with incomplete markets that offers an
economic rationale and quantitatively accounts for these three facts. The key novelty in
the model is that households’ consumption risk inherits the same factor structure of the
idiosyncratic cash flow risk of firms. Common fluctuations in firm-level risk thus enter the
pricing kernel of households and, as a result, CIV is a priced state variable. Stocks that tend
to appreciate when CIV rises are valuable hedges to increases in households’ marginal utility
and earn relatively low average returns, consistent with our empirical findings.

    We start by documenting an extraordinary degree of comovement among the idiosyncratic
volatilities of more than 20,000 CRSP stocks over a long sample spanning 1926 to 2010. A
single factor explains 35% of the time variation firm-level idiosyncratic risk. At first sight, a
factor structure in return volatilities may not appear surprising. After all, many finance the-
ories posit that returns are linear functions of common factors and, if the factors themselves
have time-varying volatility, then firm volatility naturally inherits this factor structure.1
However, we emphasize that this is comovement in idiosyncratic volatility, defined as the
standard deviation of residuals from factor model regressions. Volatility comovement does
not arise from omitted factors; even after saturating the factor regression with up to ten prin-
cipal components (and showing that model residuals are virtually uncorrelated), the residual
firm volatilities continue to display the same comovement seen in raw return volatilities.

    We also show that comovement in volatilities is not only a feature of returns, but also of
the volatility of firm-level cash flows. We estimate volatilities of firm fundamentals such as
sales or earnings growth using quarterly Compustat data. Although these volatility estimates
    1
   Prominent factor models in finance include the CAPM (Sharpe 1964), ICAPM (Merton 1973), APT
(Ross 1976), and the Fama and French (1993) model.



                                               1
are noisier and less frequently observed than those for stock returns, we again find a strong
factor structure among firms’ idiosyncratic cash flow volatilities. The common factor in
fundamental volatility follows the same low frequency patterns as the common factor in
idiosyncratic return volatilities – the two have a correlation of 65%. This suggests that
return volatility patterns identified in this paper are not attributable to shocks to investor
preferences or other sources of pure discount rate variation. Instead, they measure the
volatility of persistent idiosyncratic cash flow growth driven by firm-level productivity and
demand shocks.

  Persistent, idiosyncratic cash flow shocks that hit firms are an important source of undi-
versifiable risk to households. We present evidence showing that the CIV factor proxies for
idiosyncratic risk faced by households. Individual income data from the U.S. Social Security
Administration from Guvenen, Ozkan, and Song (2014) shows that the cross-sectional dis-
persion in household earnings growth rises and falls with CIV measured from stock returns
– they share a correlation of nearly 60% in changes. Similarly, dispersion in firm-level em-
ployment growth (from Compustat) and in sector-level employment growth of both private
and publicly firms (from the Federal Reserve) are also strongly correlated with CIV. Finally,
CIV shocks are positively correlated with shocks to the dispersion in wage and house price
growth across metropolitan areas.

  How are persistent firm-level shocks transferred to households? Perhaps the main source
of transmission is through the labor income that households derive from firms that em-
ploy them. For example, when workers possess firm-specific human capital, shocks to firm
value are also shocks to workers’ human wealth (Becker 1962). Other transmission channels
include under-diversified equity positions in own-employer stock and the influence of firm
performance on local wages and residential real estate values. And while firms provide em-
ployees with some temporary insurance against idiosyncratic productivity shocks, workers
have little protection against persistent shocks, which ultimately affect compensation either
through wages or layoffs.2 Because households cannot completely insulate their consumption
from persistent shocks to their labor income (Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston 2008), the
volatility of households’ consumption growth distribution inherits the same factor structure
  2
      See, e.g., Berk, Stanton, and Zechner (2010) and Lustig, Syverson, and Nieuwerburgh (2011).

                                                     2
as the volatility in firm-level returns and cash-flow growth.3 As the volatility of firm-level
growth rates rises, investors face more idiosyncratic risk that is not fully hedged, increasing
the dispersion of their consumption growth rates. Because increases in CIV represent an
increase in consumption risk for the average household, they adversely affect its marginal
utility.

   This effect of a change in CIV on the marginal utility of the average investor is reflected
in asset price data. Differences in firms’ betas on CIV shocks are strongly associated with
differences in expected returns. The top CIV-beta quintile earns average returns 5.4% per
annum lower than firms in the bottom quintile. We show that this fact is not due to high
CIV-beta firms having high exposure to the market return, a size or value factor, or a
market variance factor. Instead, incorporating CIV innovations as a new asset pricing factor
can account for the CIV-beta return spread, and also helps to explain the cross-sectional
differences in average returns on book-to-market, size, earning-to-price, and corporate bond
portfolios. Replacing CIV with a factor based on the cross-sectional dispersion in household
income growth or in firm size growth recovers many of the same asset pricing facts. This
provides additional evidence for the connection between household risk and CIV.

   Finally, we rationalize these empirical facts regarding idiosyncratic volatility comovement
and asset prices in a heterogeneous agent incomplete markets model. In our specification,
households’ equilibrium idiosyncratic consumption growth process possesses the same volatil-
ity factor structure as firm-level cash flow growth. We derive equilibrium asset prices on
stocks whose cash flow growth features common idiosyncratic volatility, and who differ in
their exposure to CIV shocks. In the model, CIV shocks carry a negative market price of risk.
Our calibration shows that the return spread on high-minus-low CIV-beta stocks observed
in the data is quantitatively consistent with the model, as are the return volatilities on the
CIV-beta sorted stocks. We also match the cross-sectional dispersion of household income
growth, the mean and persistence of CIV, the cross-sectional spread in CIV betas, and the
equity risk premium on the market portfolio, while respecting the properties of aggregate
consumption and interest rates. One important reason why stocks have negative CIV-betas
   3
    Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante (2014) estimate that more than 40% of persistent labor income
shocks are passed through to household consumption.


                                                  3
in the model is that their dividend growth rate is negatively predictable by the lagged CIV
factor. We provide direct evidence for this cash flow predictability channel and calibrate the
model to be consistent with it.

   The connection between firm-level volatility, household-level risk, and asset prices estab-
lished in our paper suggests that CIV is a plausible proxy for dispersion in consumption
growth, which the key ingredient in heterogenous agent asset pricing models. The advan-
tage of CIV as a household risk proxy is that it is constructed from reliably measured stock
return data and is observable at high-frequencies, in contrast to the noisy and infrequent
consumption survey data typically studied.


Related Literature This paper relates to several strands of research. The APT of Ross
(1976) shows that any common return factors are valid candidate asset pricing factors. The
idiosyncratic return residuals will not be priced, because they can be diversified away. This
logic breaks down in a world with non-traded assets, such as human wealth, in which case
factors driving commonality in residual volatility may be valid asset pricing factors. We
show that CIV is such an asset pricing factor.

   Several representative agent models explore the role of aggregate consumption growth and
market return volatility for explaining asset pricing stylized facts.4 We focus on exposure to
idiosyncratic volatility instead, which in our model is not fully diversifiable. To make this
distinction clear, the model features a constant market variance. In our model, investors seek
to hedge against idiosyncratic volatility shocks even if they are indifferent about the timing
of uncertainty resolution, though a preference for early resolution of uncertainty magnifies
the price of CIV risk. In our empirical work, we contrast the separate asset pricing roles of
the CIV and market variance (MV) factors. While both help to explain the cross-section of
returns, the CIV factor appears to be the stronger pricing factor.

   Our model builds on Mankiw (1986) and Constantinides and Duffie (1996) who explored
   4
    Most recently, Bansal, Kiku, Shaliastovich, and Yaron (2014) and Campbell, Giglio, Polk, and Turley
(2014) present evidence regarding the effects of aggregate market volatility for the time series and cross-
section of equity returns. Earlier work includes Campbell (1993), Coval and Shumway (2001), Adrian
and Rosenberg (2008), among many others. Pastor and Veronesi (2005, 2006) suggest that time variation
in stochastic discount factor volatility (and hence market return volatility) can drive time variation in
idiosyncratic stock return volatility.

counter-cyclical dispersion in consumption growth as a mechanism to increase the equilib-
rium equity premium. As an empirical matter, we find that the market portfolio has little
exposure to changes in CIV, making exposure to CIV unsuitable to explain the equity risk
premium. In contrast, CIV exposure is useful to explain the cross-section. Constantinides
and Ghosh (2014) explore the asset pricing implications of counter-cyclical left-skewness in
the cross-sectional distribution of household consumption growth, but they do not study the
association with the common idiosyncratic volatility of firms, which is the focus of our paper.

   Testing such consumption-based incomplete markets models is challenged by the poor
quality of household level consumption data.5 Our incomplete markets model, which ties
together idiosyncratic risks of firms and households, allows us to avoid consumption survey
data. It suggests CIV, measured from daily stock returns, as a reliable high-frequency
alternative to measure the consumption growth dispersion. This opens up new possibilities
for empirical work that aims to test consumption-based asset pricing models and for research
that studies the connection between inequality and financial markets. This proxy could be
of independent interest to the consumption literature.6

   Finally, our paper connects to a large empirical literature that studies the role of idiosyn-
cratic return volatility. Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, and Xu (2001) examine secular variation
in average idiosyncratic return volatility, but do not study its cross-sectional properties.7
   5
     Koijen, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Vestman (2013) compare high-quality tax registry-based consumption to
survey-based consumption data for a panel of Swedish households and find large discrepancies. In the U.S.,
existing sources (PSID and CEX) produce conflicting pictures of the evolution of consumption inequality.
Furthermore, several authors report a growing discrepancy between survey and aggregate consumption data
from NIPA; see, e.g., Attanasio, Battistin, and Leicester (2004).

     See Vissing-Jorgensen (2002), Brav, Constantinides, and Geczy (2002), and Malloy, Moskowitz, and
Vissing-Jorgensen (2009) for recent examples of work linking individual consumption data to stock returns.
In the same spirit as our exercise, Malloy, Moskowitz, and Vissing-Jorgensen (2009) project consumption
growth on stock returns to derive a higher-frequency measure of consumption growth, and to extend the
time series farther back in time.
   7
     Several papers explore this fact further, such as Bennett, Sias, and Starks (2003), Irvine and Pontiff
(2009), and Brandt, Brav, Graham, and Kumar (2010). In contemporaneous work, Duarte, Kamara, Siegel,
and Sun (2014) estimate a principal components model for idiosyncratic return volatility, but do not study
cash flow volatility, volatility factor pricing, or the association between firm and household idiosyncratic risk.
Wei and Zhang (2006) study aggregate time series variation in fundamental volatility. Engle and Figlewski
(2012) document a common factor in option-implied volatilities since 1996, and Barigozzi, Brownlees, Gallo,
and Veredas (2010) and Veredas and Luciani (2012) examine the factor structure in realized volatilities of
intra-daily returns since 2001. Bloom, Floetotto, Jaimovich, and Terry (2012) show that firm-specific output
growth volatility is broadly counter-cyclical. Jurado, Ludvigson, and Ng (2014) studies new measures of
uncertainty from aggregate and firm-level data and relates them to macroeconomic activity.

Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006) show that stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility
earn abnormally low average returns, while Chen and Petkova (2012) argue that this fact
can be explained with an average volatility factor. Double-sorted portfolios on CIV-beta
and idiosyncratic volatility display return spreads in both directions, so that both anomalies
co-exist. Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2010) and Atkeson, Eisfeldt, and Weill (2013) study the
firm volatility distribution to understand credit risk and debt prices. Kelly, Lustig, and Van-
Nieuwerburgh (2013) propose a network model in which firms are connected to other firms
in a customer-supplier network, and show that size-dependent network formation generates
a common factor in firm-level idiosyncratic volatility.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the common idiosyncratic
variance factor in U.S. stock returns and firm-level cash flows. Section 3 provides evidence
linking the CIV factor to dispersion in household income shocks. Section 4 demonstrates that
CIV is a priced factor in the cross-section of stock returns. Section 5 presents and calibrates
the heterogeneous agent model with CIV as priced state variable. Section 6 concludes.



2       The Factor Structure in Volatility

In this section we study idiosyncratic volatility in the annual panel of U.S. public firms.
We first discuss data and how we construct volatilities, then describe the behavior of the
volatility panel.


2.1     Data Construction

We construct annual volatility of firm-level returns and cash flow growth. Return volatility
is estimated using data from the CRSP daily stock file from 1926-2010. It is defined as the
standard deviation of a stock’s daily returns within the calendar year.8 We refer to these
estimates as “total” return volatility.

    Idiosyncratic volatility is the focus of our analysis. Idiosyncratic returns are constructed
    8
   A firm-year observation is included if the stock has a CRSP share code 10, 11 or 12 and the stock has
no missing daily returns within the year.


                                                   6
within each calendar year τ by estimating a factor model using all observations within the
year. Our factor models take the form


                                         ri,t = γ0,i + γ ′i F t + εi,t                                    (1)


where t denotes a daily observation in year τ . Idiosyncratic volatility is then calculated as the
standard deviation of residuals εi,t within the calendar year. The result of this procedure is
a panel of firm-year idiosyncratic volatility estimates. The first return factor model that we
consider is the market model, specifying that F t is the return on the CRSP value-weighted
market portfolio. The second model specifies F t as the 3 × 1 vector of Fama-French (1993)
factors. The third return factor model we use is purely statistical and specifies F t as the
first five principal components of the cross section of returns within the year.9

   Total fundamental volatility in year τ is estimated for all CRSP/Compustat firms using
the 20 quarterly year-on-year sales growth observations for calendar years τ − 4 to τ .10
We also estimate idiosyncratic volatility of firm fundamentals based on factor specifications.
Since there is no predominant factor model for sales growth in the literature, we only consider
principal component factors. The approach is the same as in equation (1), with the exception
that the left hand side variable is sales growth and the data frequency is quarterly. F t
contains the first K principal components of growth rates within a five-year window ending
in year τ , where K equals one or five, and residual volatility in year τ is the standard
deviation of model residuals over the five-year estimation period. The sales growth volatility
panel covers 1975-2010.
   9
      Robustness tests using 10 PCs produce quantitatively similar results, hence we focus our presentation
on 5 PCs. If the true underlying factor structure is non-linear then the linear regression models we estimate
are misspecified. However, the principal components approach captures non-linear dependencies to some
extent through the inclusion of additional principal components. When using five or ten components, we
find qualitatively identical results to those from lower-dimension factor models such as Fama-French, which
suggests that model misspecification is unable to explain our findings. In addition, results are qualitatively
unchanged when we allow for GARCH residuals in factor model regressions.
   10
      The data requirements for a non-missing sales growth volatility observation in year τ are analogous to
those for returns: We use all Compustat firms linked to CRSP and possessing share code 10, 11 or 12, and
require a firm to have no missing observations in the 20 quarter window ending in year τ .




                                                      7
2.2     The Cross Section Distribution of Volatility

The cross-sectional distribution of estimated firm-level volatility is lognormal to a close
approximation.11 An attractive implication of this result is that dynamics of the entire
cross-sectional distribution of firm volatility can be described with only two time-varying
parameters: the cross-sectional mean and standard deviation of log volatility.12 It also
demonstrates that the average volatility levels calculated throughout this paper are not
driven by extreme behavior in cross-sectional distributions.


2.3     Common Secular Patterns in Firm-Level Volatility

2.3.1    Return Volatility

Firm-level volatilities share an extraordinary degree of common time variation. Panel A
of Figure 1 plots annual firm-level total return volatility averaged within start-of-year size
quintiles. Stocks of all sizes demonstrate very similar secular time series volatility patterns.
The same is true of industry groups. Panel B reports average total return volatility among
the stocks in the five-industry SIC code categorization provided on Kenneth French’s web
site.

   The common time series variation of total return volatilities by size and industry groups is
perhaps unsurprising given that firm-level returns are believed to have a substantial degree
of common return variation, as evidenced by the predominance of factor-based models of
individual stock returns. If returns have common factors and the volatility of those factors
varies over time, then firm-level variances will also inherit a factor structure.
  11
      Figure A1 in the Appendix plots histograms of the empirical cross-sectional distribution of firm-level
volatility (in logs). Panel A shows the distribution of total return volatility pooling all firm-years from
1926-2010. Panel B shows the distribution of total sales growth volatility (in logs) pooling all firm-years
from 1975-2010. Panels C and D plot histograms of idiosyncratic return and sales growth volatility based
on the five principal components factor model. Overlaid on these histograms is the exact normal density
with mean and variance set equal to that of the empirical distribution. Log volatilities demonstrate only
slight skewness (less than 0.4) and do not appear to be leptokurtic (kurtosis between 2.9 and 3.2). The cross
section volatility distribution also appears lognormal in one-year snapshots of the cross section, as shown in
Appendix Figure A2 for the 2010 calendar year.
   12
      The distribution of idiosyncratic return volatility estimated from the market model and the Fama-French
three-factor model are qualitatively identical to those shown in Figure A1.

 Figure 1: Total and Idiosyncratic Return Volatility by Size and Industry Group
The figure plots annualized firm-level volatility averaged within size and industry groups. Within each
calendar year, volatilities are estimated as the standard deviation of daily returns for each stock. Panel A
shows firm-level total return volatility averaged within market equity quintiles. Panel B shows total return
volatility averaged within the five-industry categorization of SIC codes provided on Kenneth French’s web
site. Panels C and D report the same within-group averages of firm-level idiosyncratic volatility. Idiosyncratic
volatility is the standard deviation of residuals from a five-factor principal components model for daily
returns.

removing common factor from returns is surprising. Panels C and D of Figure 1 plot av-

Panel A shows the average pairwise correlation for total and idiosyncratic returns within each calendar year.
Panel B shows the cross-sectional average annualized firm-level volatility each year for total and idiosyncratic
returns. Idiosyncratic volatility is the standard deviation of residuals from the market model, the Fama-
French three-factor model, or a five-factor principal components model for daily returns within each calendar
year.

principal components factor model for returns. The plots show the same dynamics for all
groups of firms when considering idiosyncratic rather than total volatility. The correlation
between average idiosyncratic volatility within size quintiles one and five is 81%. The min-
imum correlation among idiosyncratic volatilities of the five industry groups is 65%, which
corresponds to the health care industry versus the “other” category (including construction,
transportation, services, and finance).

       Common variation in idiosyncratic volatility cannot be explained by comovement among
factor model residuals, for instance due to omitted common factors. Panel A of Figure
2 shows that raw returns share substantial common variation, with an average pairwise
correlation of 13% over the 1926-2010 sample (and occasionally exceeding 40%). However,
the principal components model captures nearly all of this common variation at the daily
frequency, as average correlations among its residuals are typically less than 0.2%, and are
never above 0.9% in a year. The same is true for the market and Fama-French models.
Moving to a higher number of principal components, such as 10, has no quantitative impact


                                                                           10
on these results. Indeed, the Fama-French model and the five principal component model
appear to absorb all of the comovement in returns, making omitted factors an unlikely
explanation for the high degree of commonality in idiosyncratic volatilities.

   Despite the absence of comovement among residual return realizations, Panel B of Figure
2 shows that average idiosyncratic volatility from various factor models is nearly the same
as average volatility of total returns. In the typical year, only 11% of average total volatility
is accounted for by the five principal components factor model, with idiosyncratic volatility
inheriting the remaining 89%. The same is true for the market model and Fama-French
model, with 8% and 9% of average volatility explained by common factors respectively.13

   The analyses in Figures 1 and 2 use return volatility estimated from daily data within
each year.14 We find very similar results when estimating volatility from 12 monthly return
observations within each year. First, firm-level total and idiosyncratic return volatilities share
a high degree of comovement. The average pairwise correlation of idiosyncratic volatility
among size quintiles is 84% annually, while the average correlation of idiosyncratic volatility
for industry groups is 83% (based on residuals from the five principal component model).
Second, the vast majority of correlation among monthly returns is absorbed by common
factors. Pairwise stock return correlations are 30% on average based on monthly data,
dropping to 0.4% for monthly Fama-French model residuals. Third, most of the average
firm’s volatility is left unexplained by common factors – the ratio of average Fama-French
residual volatility to average total volatility is 67%. See Appendix Figure A3 for additional
detail.

   The strong comovement of return volatility is also a feature of portfolio returns. Figure
A4 in the Appendix reports average volatility and average pairwise correlations for total
and residual returns for 100 Fama-French size and value portfolios. Portfolio return volatil-
ities show a striking degree of comovement across the size and book-to-market spectrum,
even after accounting for common factors. Like the individual stock results above, common
  13
     We calculate the percent of average volatility explained by common factors as one minus the ratio of
average factor model residual volatility to average total volatility, where averages are first computed cross-
sectionally, then averaged over the full 1926-2010 sample.
  14
     It is standard practice in the literature to estimate idiosyncratic volatility from daily data. See, for
example, Ang et al. (2006).

Figure 3: Total and Idiosyncratic Sales Growth Volatility by Size and Industry
Group
The figures plot firm-level volatility averaged within size and industry groups. For each calendar year τ ,
volatilities are estimated as the standard deviation of 20 quarterly year-on-year sales growth observations in
years τ −4 to τ for each firm. Panel A shows firm-level total volatility averaged within market equity quintiles.
Panel B shows total volatility averaged within the five-industry categorization of SIC codes provided on Ken
French’s web site. Panels C and D report the same within-group averages of firm-level idiosyncratic volatility.
Idiosyncratic volatility is the standard deviation of residuals from a five-factor principal components model
for quarterly sales growth. The components are estimated in the same 20-quarter window used to calculate
volatility.

year for total and idiosyncratic sales growth. Idiosyncratic volatility is the standard deviation of residuals
from a one-factor principal components model for quarterly sales growth. The components are estimated in
the same 20-quarter window used to calculate volatility.

commonality – the average pairwise correlation among size and industry groups is 85%
and 53%, respectively. Panels C and D show within-group average idiosyncratic volatility
estimated from a five-factor principal components model for sales growth. Comovement in
residual sales growth volatility is nearly identical to total sales growth volatility. This is
because total sales growth rates have very low average pairwise correlations (1.6% annually),
as shown in Figure 4. After accounting for one sales growth principal component, the average
pairwise correlation drops to 0.7%. This fundamental volatility behavior is not specific to
sales growth, but is also true of other measures of firm cash flows. For example, the average
variance of firms’ net income growth is 67.4% correlated with that of sales growth.15 In
summary, strong comovement is not unique to return volatilities, but also appears to be a
feature of fundamental volatility.
  15
    The common net income variance factor explains panel variation in firm-level net income variance with
an R2 of 28.5% on average. See appendix Table A1, Panels B and C, for volatility factor model estimates
based on net income growth and EBITDA growth.

The table reports estimates of annual volatility one-factor regression models. In each panel, the volatility
factor is defined as the equal-weighted cross section average of firm volatilities within that year. That is, all
estimated volatility factor models take the form: σi,t = intercepti + loadingi · σ ·,t + ei,t . Columns represent
different volatility measures. For returns (Panel A), the columns report estimates for a factor model of total
return volatility and idiosyncratic volatility based on residual returns from the market model, the Fama-
French model, or the five principal component models. For sales growth (Panel B), the columns report
total volatility or idiosyncratic volatility based on sales growth residuals from the one and five principal
components model (using a rolling 20 quarter window for estimation). The last column of Panel B reports
results when using only the four quarterly growth observations within each calendar year to estimate total
volatility. We report cross-sectional averages of loadings and intercepts as well as time series regression R2
averaged over all firms. We also report a pooled factor model R2 , which compares the estimated factor
model to a model with only firm-specific intercepts and no factor.

2.4        Volatility Factor Model Estimates

We next estimate factor regression models for firm-level volatility. We consider total volatility
as well as idiosyncratic volatility estimated from a Fama-French three-factor model or a
five-factor principal component model. In all cases, time series regressions are run firm-
by-firm with volatility as the left-hand side variable. The factor in each set of regressions
is defined as the equal-weighted average of the left-hand size volatility measure. This is
approximately equal to the first principal component of a given volatility panel, but avoids
principal components complications arising from unbalanced panels.

   Panel A of Table 1 reports volatility factor model results for daily return volatilities.16
Columns correspond to the method used to construct return residuals. The average univari-
ate time series R2 is 36.2% for the total volatility model, and close to 35% for the idiosyncratic
volatility models. The pooled panel OLS R2 is between 33% and 35% (relative to a volatility

       Average intercept and slope coefficients differ from zero and one due to unbalanced panel data.

model with only firm-specific intercepts).17

      In Panel B of Table 1, we show volatility factor model estimates for sales growth volatility.
The first three columns report results based on panels of total volatility and idiosyncratic
volatility from one and five principal component models. The last column reports model
estimates for an annual volatility panel that estimates volatility from only four quarterly
year-on-year sales growth observations within each year.18 Due to the small number of
observations used to construct sales growth volatility, we might expect poorer fits in these
regressions, yet the results are closely in line with those for return volatility. The time series
R2 for raw and idiosyncratic growth rate volatility ranges between 17.8% and 29.9% on
average. The pooled R2 reaches as high as 31.5%.

      The common factor in fundamental volatility follows the same low frequency patterns as
  17
     For portfolios rather than individual stock returns, we find even higher volatility factor model R2 values.
Based on the Fama-French 100 size and value portfolios, the average univariate R2 is 70.8% for total volatility,
49.7% for market model residual volatility, and 39.4% for Fama-French model residual volatility (see Panel
A of appendix Table A1).
  18
     This model avoids the issue of overlapping regression observations that arises from our rolling 20-quarter
volatility used elsewhere. The similarity of these results with the first three columns of Panel B indicate
that the strong factor structure in sales growth volatility is not an artifact of overlapping observations.

the common factor in idiosyncratic return volatilities, sharing a correlation of 64.6% with
the common factor in Fama-French residual return volatility. This suggests that the return
volatility patterns identified in this section are not attributable to discount rate shocks, but
rather they measure the volatility of persistent idiosyncratic cash flow growth shocks at the
firm level. If the shocks were largely transitory, they would have only a minor impact on
returns.

    Panel A of Figure 5 plots the level of average annualized idiosyncratic volatility (labeled
CIV) against the volatility of the value-weighted market portfolio (MV). The two series
possess substantial common variation, particularly associated with deep recessions at the
beginning and end of the sample (correlation of 63.8% in levels). Panel B reports changes
in CIV, as well as residuals from a regression of CIV changes on changes in MV. The two
sets of innovations share a correlation of 67.0%, indicating that the behavior of idiosyncratic
volatility shocks is in large part distinct from shocks to market volatility. The asset pricing
tests of the next section document important additional differences in the behavior of CIV
and MV.



3     Idiosyncratic Risk of the Firm and the Household

The evidence presented in Section 2 indicates that firm-level idiosyncratic volatilities possess
a high degree of comovement that is aptly described by a factor model. The commonality
in firms’ idiosyncratic risks hints at the possibility that income and consumption growth
realizations experienced by households also possess common variation in their second mo-
ments. That is, households may face common fluctuations in their idiosyncratic risks, even
though their individual consumption growth realizations themselves may be (conditionally)
uncorrelated. This seems plausible since shocks to households labor income, human capital
and financial capital derive in large part from shocks to their employers. In this section, we
investigate the empirical association between fluctuations in firm-level idiosyncratic volatility
and idiosyncratic consumption and income risk faced by households.




                                               16
3.1     Theoretical Connection

Individual household income and individual firm performance are linked through a number
of channels. First, households may be directly exposed to the equity risk of their employers.
A large theoretical literature beginning with Jensen and Meckling (1976) predicts that man-
agement will hold under-diversified positions in their employers’ stock for incentive reasons.
This prediction is born out empirically.19 Benartzi (2001), Cohen (2009), and Van Nieuwer-
burgh and Veldkamp (2006) show that non-manager employees also tend to overallocate
wealth to equity of their employer and offer behavioral or information-based interpretations
for this phenomenon.20

   Firm-specific human capital (Becker 1962) is a second channel tying household idiosyn-
cratic outcomes to those of the firm. Hashimoto (1981) notes that “The standard analysis
of firm-specific human capital argues that the cost of and the return to the investment will
be shared by the worker and the employer.” The typical employee’s wealth is dominated by
her human capital (Lustig, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Verdelhan 2013), implying that shocks
to an employer’s firm value and human wealth shocks of its employees move in tandem.
This mechanism is empirically documented in Neal (1995) and Kletzer (1989, 1990). These
studies also emphasize that the firm-specific human capital mechanism leads to protracted
and potentially permanent income impairment following job displacements, consistent with
the evidence in Ruhm (1991) and Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993). Furthermore,
the probability of job displacement, defined by Kletzer (1998) as “a plant closing, an em-
ployer going out of business, a layoff from which he/she was not recalled,” is directly tied to
firm performance. In addition to job loss risk, the empirical findings of Brown and Medoff
(1989) suggest that employees at larger firms enjoy a wage premium, presenting a mech-
anism through which employee income shocks may be correlated with idiosyncratic firm
shocks. Theoretical work of skilled labor compensation in Harris and Holmstrom (1982),
  19
     Demsetz and Lehn (1985), Murphy (1985), Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny (1988), Kole (1995), and others.
  20
     A large literature including French and Poterba (1991), Coval and Moskowitz (1999) and Calvet, Camp-
bell, and Sodini (2007) indicate that the typical household is exposed to idiosyncratic stock risk above and
beyond that due to overallocation of savings to the equity of one’s employer. Home and local bias repre-
sent additional ways through which domestic and local shocks that hit firms affect the financial income of
households.



                                                    17
Berk, Stanton, and Zechner (2010) and Lustig, Syverson, and Nieuwerburgh (2011) finds
that employers optimally insure some but not all productivity shocks, leaving employee
compensation exposed to firm-level shocks.

   A large literature documents that shocks to individual labor income growth translate
into shocks to individual consumption growth because of incomplete risk sharing. Blun-
dell, Pistaferri, and Preston (2008) and Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante (2014) show
that permanent shocks to labor income end up in consumption, while transitory shocks are
partially insured.


3.2     Empirical Evidence

Our empirical analysis suggests that common idiosyncratic return volatility is a plausible
proxy for idiosyncratic risk faced by individual consumers. We present four new results
consistent with this interpretation.

   Our first result documents a significant association between shocks to firm-level idiosyn-
cratic risk and data on idiosyncratic household income risk. Our measure of idiosyncratic
firm risk is the equally-weighted average of firm-level market model residual return vari-
ance.21 The highest quality household income growth data come from the U.S. Social Se-
curity Administration; Guvenen, Ozkan, and Song (2014) report cross-sectional summary
statistics each year from 1978-2011. In Figure 6, we plot yearly changes in CIV alongside
yearly changes in the standard deviation and interdecile range of the cross-sectional earnings
growth distribution for individuals. All series are standardized to have zero mean and unit
variance for comparison. CIV innovations have a correlation of 57.9% (t = 3.8) with changes
in idiosyncratic income risk measured by the cross-sectional standard deviation of earnings
growth, and a correlation of 46.7% (t = 2.8) with changes in the interdecile range.22
  21
      Residuals are based on market model return regressions. Results are quantitatively similar and qual-
itatively the same if using an alternative definition such as variance of Fama-French model residuals. We
compute a monthly, quarterly and annual version of average idiosyncratic variance to conform with various
data sources that are available at each of these frequencies.
   22
      The Guvenen et al. measures are also correlated with market variance (MV) innovations. For example,
innovations in the cross-sectional standard deviation of household earnings growth have a correlation of
42.8% with MV innovations (t-statistic of 2.6). Because MV and CIV innovations are positively correlated,
it makes sense to disentangle the contribution of each through two orthogonalizations. Innovations in the


                                                   18
       Figure 6: CIV and Dispersion in Individual Household Income Growth
The figure compares yearly changes in CIV with yearly changes in the standard deviation and interdecile range of the individual
earnings growth distribution. CIV is the equal-weighted average of firm-level market model residual return variance each year.
Individual earnings data is from the U.S. Social Security Administration and summarized by Guvenen, Ozkan, and Song (2014).
Each series is standardized to have equal mean and variance for ease of comparison.

   Our second finding is that changes in CIV are significantly associated with employment
risk. We calculate firm-level employment growth rates growth for U.S. publicly-listed firms
from 1952-2010 using Compustat data for number of employees. Then, to proxy for employ-
ment risk, we calculate the cross-sectional interquartile range of employment growth rates
each year. Changes in CIV share a correlation of 26.8% with changes in employment growth
dispersion (t = 2.1). The drawback of Compustat data is its restriction to the universe of
public firms. The Federal Reserve reports monthly total employment for over 100 sectors
beginning in 1991, aggregating both private and public firms, and we use this data to cal-
culate log employment growth for each sector-year. Changes in CIV and changes in the
cross-sectional standard deviation of sector-level employment growth have a correlation of
cross-sectional standard deviation of household earnings growth have a correlation of 38.7% (t-statistic of
2.3) with CIV innovations orthogonalized to MV innovations and a correlation of 4.3% (t-statistic 0.2) with
MV innovations orthogonalized to CIV. Thus, the correlation is stronger with CIV than with MV. The same
pattern holds for the other four correlations discussed below.

41.8% (t = 1.9).

    A large fraction of household wealth is invested in residential real estate, leaving individ-
uals exposed to idiosyncratic wealth shocks deriving from fluctuations in the value of their
homes.23 Local house prices also reflect local labor market conditions (Van Nieuwerburgh
and Weill 2010). Our third and fourth findings relate CIV to the cross-sectional disper-
sion of house price growth and wage-per-job growth across metropolitan areas. House price
data are from the Federal Housing Financing Agency and wage data from NIPA’s Regional
Economic Information System. The merged data set contains annual information from 1969-
2009 for 386 regions. The correlation between innovations in CIV and innovations in the
cross-sectional standard deviation of house price growth is 23.2% per quarter (t = 2.7), and
the correlation with innovations in the cross-sectional standard deviation of per capita wage
growth is 15.2% per quarter (t = 1.7). This evidence offers further support of a link between
the cross-sectional income distribution of firms and of households.



4      CIV and Expected Stock Returns

In this section, we document that stocks’ exposure to CIV shocks helps explain cross-sectional
differences in average stock returns. Then, Section 5 rationalizes these asset pricing findings
and the empirical association between CIV and household income risk in an equilibrium
incomplete markets model with heterogeneous agents.

    We start by exploring average (abnormal) returns on portfolios sorted on stocks’ CIV
exposure. We then conduct a formal asset pricing test using a Fama-MacBeth analysis in
which CIV shocks are the key asset pricing factor. Using this analysis, we ask whether
CIV shocks also price other stock and corporate bond portfolios that have been deemed
anomalous. Finally, we ask whether direct measures of household income dispersion price
the cross-section of stock returns.
  23
   For the median household with positive primary housing wealth in the 2010 wave of the Survey of
Consumer Finance, the primary residence represents 61% of all assets. For 25% of households it represents
90% or more of all assets.




                                                   20
4.1     CIV-beta Sorted Portfolios

Our asset pricing analysis is conducted using monthly returns, so the results of this section
use a monthly version of common idiosyncratic variance (CIV) described earlier.24 We con-
struct CIV shocks as monthly changes in CIV. Similarly, we construct a monthly measure
of the market variance (MV) from daily value-weighted stock market returns, and construct
MV shocks as monthly changes in MV. For each month from January 1963 until December
2010, we regress monthly individual firm stock returns in excess of a risk-free rate on CIV
innovations and MV innovations using a trailing 60-month window.25 We refer to a firm’s
exposure to the CIV shock as its CIV-beta and to its exposure to the MV shock as its
MV-beta.

   In a first exercise, we sort stocks into quintiles based on their CIV-beta each month, form
an equally-weighted portfolio of the stocks in each quintile and hold that portfolio for one
month. Panel A of Table 2 reports the average excess return of each portfolio, as well as the
return on a strategy that goes long the highest CIV-beta quintile and short the lowest CIV-
beta quintile. It shows that average returns are decreasing in CIV-beta. Stocks in the first
quintile have negative CIV betas and thus tend to lose value when CIV rises. In contrast,
stocks in Q5 tend to hedge CIV increases, paying off in high volatility states. The long-short
strategy has an average annualized return of -5.41% per year with a t-statistic of -3.94. The
second and third rows report the abnormal return of each portfolio relative to the CAPM
and Fama-French (1993) three factor model, respectively. The spread portfolio has a CAPM
alpha of -4.77% (t-statistic of -3.52) and three-factor alpha of -3.29% (t-statistic of -2.50).
Panel B shows similar results for value-weighted portfolios; we focus on equally-weighted
portfolios in what follows.

   In Panel C, we purge the CIV-beta quintile portfolios from their heterogeneous exposure
  24
     Each month, we estimate a regression of daily individual firm returns on the value-weighted market
return for all CRSP firms with non-missing data that month. We then calculate CIV (in levels) as the
equal-weighted average of market model residual variance across firms. The monthly nature of our return
tests highlights an attractive feature of CIV estimated from returns – it is a plausible proxy for idiosyncratic
household income risk while being easily observable at high frequencies.
  25
     We use all CRSP stocks with share codes 10, 11, and 12, and include a stock in portfolio sorts if it
had no missing monthly returns in the 60-month estimation window. The inclusion of MV shocks in a
multivariate regression is equivalent to estimating univariate betas with respect to CIV shocks that have
been orthogonalized to MV shocks.


                                                      21
to the MV shocks, following the approach in Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006). Specif-
ically, we double-sort stocks first into MV-beta quintile portfolios, and then, within each
MV-beta quintile, into equally-sized CIV-beta portfolios. For each CIV-beta decile, we then
combine all stocks in the five MV-beta quintiles, collapsing the double-sort back to a single-
sort. We verify that this produces CIV-beta portfolios with essentially equal MV-betas. We
call these CIV-beta sorted portfolios controlling for MV-beta. The long-short strategy has an
average return spread of -4.35% per year with t-statistic of -3.10. The spread portfolio has
a CAPM (three-factor) alpha of -3.14% (-2.05%) with a t-statistic of -2.38 (-1.64). In unre-
ported results, we find that sorting stocks into deciles rather than quintiles leads to similar
simple CIV-beta spreads, but larger CIV-beta spreads controlling for MV-beta. Specifically,
the portfolio that goes long the tenth CIV-beta decile and short the first has an excess return
of -5.76%, a CAPM alpha of -4.33%, and a three-factor alpha of -3.16%, all of which have
t-statistics in excess of two. They are also larger than for the simple CIV-beta decile sorts.

  In Panel D, we report average excess returns on 25 double-sorted CIV-beta and MV-beta
portfolios (5 by 5). They are the same portfolios as described in the previous sorting exercise,
except that we do not collapse them back down to a single dimension. High CIV-beta stocks
continue to earn substantially lower average returns within each MV-beta quintile. The Q5-
minus-Q1 CIV-beta strategy has returns ranging from −2.8% to −5.7% per year depending
on the MV-beta quintile, and is significant for all MV-beta quintiles except for the fifth. The
reverse is not true: controlling for CIV-beta exposure, the return spread between the first and
last MV-beta quintile is not statistically different from zero in any of the CIV-beta sorted
quintiles. We obtain similar results when we sort independently on CIV- and MV-betas.
These double-sorts raise an interesting question of whether exposure to MV risk is priced
once exposure to CIV risk is controlled for. We return to this question in the Fama-MacBeth
analysis below.

  We conclude that stocks with more negative CIV exposure carry economically and sig-
nificantly higher returns than stocks with less negative or positive exposure. This is true
after accounting for their exposure to the market factor, the size and value factors, and their
exposure to the market variance shocks.

The table reports average excess returns and alphas in annual percentages for portfolios sorted on the basis of monthly CIV
beta for the 1963-2010 sample. Panel A reports equally-weighted average excess returns and alphas in one-way sorts using all
CRSP stocks. Panel B reports value-weighted averages in one-way sorts. Panel C shows equally-weighted one-way sorts on
CIV-beta that control for MV-beta, as explained in the main text. Panel D shows equally-weighted average excess returns in
sequential two-way sorts on CIV-beta and MV-beta.

   The appendix investigates the robustness of these results. Table A2 shows results for two
subsamples as well as for single-sorts on CIV-beta, estimated without controlling for MV
shocks in the firm-level regressions, and from single-sorts on MV-beta, estimated without
controlling for CIV exposure. The results are present in both subsamples, and stronger in the
second half of the sample. Only CIV sort is associated with a significant (abnormal) return
spread, but not the MV sort. Together, they suggest that variation in CIV, as opposed to
MV, is the primary driver of average return differences in Table 2. Table A3 studies several
other double sorts where we add log market equity, idiosyncratic variance, VIX-beta, and the
(Pastor and Stambaugh 2003) liquidity beta, always in addition to the CIV-beta. The results
show that significant CIV-beta return spreads are present after accounting for betas on VIX
and the Pastor-Stambaugh liquidity factor, and for firm size and idiosyncratic variance.26

       Specifically, Panel A compares the CIV result to the size effect using two-way independent sorts on


                                                             23
4.2     Pricing CIV-beta Sorted Portfolios

Next, we perform a two-stage Fama-MacBeth estimation to formally explore the ability of
the CIV factor to explain the abnormal returns associated with CIV-beta sorted portfolios.
In the first stage, we estimate the factor betas by regressing monthly excess returns for each
test asset on a constant and asset pricing factors. In the second stage, we estimate a single
cross-sectional regression of the average excess test asset returns on the factor betas and a
constant. Panel A of Table 3 shows the risk premia estimates from that second stage. The
estimation uses the same monthly portfolio returns, CIV and MV innovations, and sample
as in the previous section.

   As a benchmark, the first column reports the results for the CAPM where the market
excess return is the sole asset pricing factor. The second column adds the CIV innovations
as a second factor. These CIV innovations are the same ones used in the portfolio formation
stage. This two-factor model is the model suggested by our theory in the next section. The
third column adds the MV innovations to explore whether MV innovations help to price
the cross-section of test assets. The table reports Newey-West t-statistics (with 1 lag), the
R-squared statistic, and the root mean squared pricing error among the test assets. The row
labeled bM V is the point estimate of the price of risk associated with MV in the SDF. When
CIV-beta and log market equity. The CIV-beta spread is large and significantly negative in all size quintiles,
ranging between −3.2% for the largest firms and −4.8% per year for the smallest. Panel B reports double sorts
on CIV-beta and stock-level idiosyncratic variance, providing a comparison to the idiosyncratic volatility
puzzle of Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006). Idiosyncratic variance is defined as a stock’s standard
deviation of daily market model residuals each month. The CIV-beta return spread is between −2.1%
and −5.5% per year depending and significant in every idiosyncratic volatility quintile. The idiosyncratic
volatility effect also shows up with high idiosyncratic variance stocks having lower average returns than low
idiosyncratic variance stocks in all CIV-beta quintiles. However, the latter differences are not significant.
Using value-weighted portfolios instead of equally-weighted portfolios leads to the same conclusion regarding
the CIV-beta direction, but results in somewhat more negative and borderline significant spreads along the
idiosyncratic variance direction. Panel C conducts two-way sorts of CIV-beta and the beta on monthly VIX
changes. This provides a comparison with the market variance factor tests of Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang
(2006) who use the VIX to proxy for market variance. The monthly VIX series is available from the CBOE
web site beginning in 1990. The CIV beta spread ranges from −6.5% to −9.4% and is significant in every
VIX-beta quintile. High VIX-beta stocks have lower average returns than low VIX-beta stocks in every
CIV-beta quintile, but the return differences are not significant. Panel D sorts on a stock’s CIV-beta and
beta with respect to the Pastor-Stambaugh liquidity factor. The average returns on Q5-minus-Q1 CIV-beta
portfolios range from −4.1% to −6.7% per year and are significant in every liquidity-beta quintile. The
CIV-beta spread is larger for low-liquidity stocks. The spread in the liquidity-beta direction is insignificant,
controlling for CIV-beta. Finally, Table A4 reports the cross-sectional correlation between CIV-betas and
the other sorting variables used in Table 2.

factors are correlated, this risk price differs from the risk premium λM V reported in the top
part of the table. Testing whether MV helps to price the test assets is done by testing the
null hypothesis bM V = 0. The t-statistic below bM V is the relevant one for that test.27

   The first column uses 10 simple CIV-beta sorted portfolios as test assets. We use decile
rather than quintile portfolios to have a large enough cross-section. It shows that the CAPM
fails to price the CIV-beta sorted portfolios. The cross-sectional R2 is low and the pricing
errors large. The second column shows that CIV is priced with a negative and highly
statistically significant risk premium λCIV of -0.073. Adding CIV as a pricing factor increases
the cross-sectional R2 by 86% points and reduces the average pricing error to a mere 32
basis points per year. The third column shows that adding MV does not improve the fit any
further. The pricing error falls by less than a basis point, and while the point estimate on
MV is negative, its t-statistic is only -0.74. MV does not help to price the test assets, as the
t-statistic on bM V indicates that we fail to reject the null that bM V = 0.

   Panel B of Table 3 shows the Fama MacBeth results for 10 CIV-beta sorted portfolios that
control for MV-beta. The table shows that, while the CAPM does better explaining these
test assets (column 4), CIV innovations still add substantially to the pricing performance
(column 5). Pricing errors are cut in half to 61 bps per year and CIV comes in with a
similar -0.077 risk premium estimate, which is highly significant. MV innovations now also
carry a negative and significant risk premium (column 6). However, we fail to reject the null
hypothesis bM V = 0. Furthermore, adding MV only reduces pricing errors by 4 basis points.

   Panel C shows that CIV innovations price the 25 double-sorted portfolios on CIV-beta
and MV-beta with a negative and significant risk premium (column 8), again substantially
improving on the pricing ability of the CAPM (column 7). Adding the MV factor (column
9) only marginally reduces the pricing error and marginally increases the cross-sectional
R2 . While the risk premium on the MV innovations is negative and significant, we still

the factors are correlated, the λs are linear combinations of the risk prices b. Cochrane (2005, pp. 260-
261) explains that testing whether MV helps to price the test assets is done by testing the null hypothesis
bMV = 0. When asking the different question of whether MV is priced, one tests λMV = 0 instead.

  Table 3: Fama MacBeth Analysis: CIV Single- and Double-Sorted Portfolios
The CIV-beta and MV-beta for each stock are estimated in a multiple 60-month rolling window regression. The dependent
variable is the excess return while the independent variables are the CIV innovation and the MV innovation. The set of test
assets in Panel A are decile portfolios sorted on CIV-beta. The test assets in Panel B are decile portfolios sorted on CIV-beta,
controlling for the MV-beta. Specifically, we first sort stocks into MV-beta deciles. Then, within each MV-beta decile, we sort
stocks into CIV-beta deciles. For each CIV-beta decile, we then collect all the stocks in the ten MV-beta deciles. The set of
test assets in Panel C are 25 portfolios double-sorted on CIV- and MV-betas. We first sort stocks into five MV-beta quintiles.
Then, within each MV-beta quintile, we sort stocks into five CIV-beta quintiles. All portfolios are formed each month and held
for one month. The Fama MacBeth estimation sample is 1963.01-2010.12. The model in columns 1, 4, and 7 contains the excess
market return as the factor. The model in columns 2, 5, and 8 contains the excess market return and the CIV innovation as
factors. The model in columns 3, 6, and 9 contains the excess market return, the CIV innovation and the MV innovation. The
table reports the risk premia estimates (λ) and Newey-West standard errors (with one lag) from a cross-sectional regression
of average monthly excess portfolio returns on factor exposures. The second to last row reports the cross-sectional R2 and
the last row reports the root mean-squared pricing error, expressed as an annual return. The bottom panel also reports bM V ,
the market price of risk of MV and its associated t-statistic. The market prices of risk b are estimated from a cross-sectional
regression of average excess returns on the test assets on the (univariate) covariances of the returns with the factors.

   In conclusion, exposure to CIV shocks goes a long way towards reducing CAPM pricing
errors associated with CIV-beta sorted portfolios. We estimate a significant and negative
risk premium associated with CIV shocks.


4.3       Pricing Anomaly Portfolios

It is natural to ask whether CIV is a risk factor that can help to explain other test assets whose
returns are anomalous relative to benchmark asset pricing models. Table 4 summarizes our
findings. Panel A studies the standard 10 book-to-market (BM) sorted portfolios. Column
2 shows that adding CIV to the CAPM dramatically reduces pricing errors from 189 to 86


                                                                26
bps per year and increases the cross-sectional R2 from 1% to 80%. Interestingly, the risk
premium associated with CIV innovations is -0.069, a similar point estimate to the one we
obtained on the CIV-beta sorted portfolios in Table 3. It is highly statistically significant.
In column 3, we add MV as a pricing factor and find that it is not priced and that it barely
lowers pricing errors. The market price of MV risk, bM V has the wrong sign, but is not
different from zero.

   Panel B studies 10 size portfolios. The CAPM in column 4 does substantially better
for these portfolios and leaves only 54 bps unexplained. Yet, adding CIV lowers the pricing
errors further to 39 bps. CIV enters with the right sign and is significantly different from zero.
Its point estimate is substantially smaller here than for the BM- or CIV-sorted portfolios,
however. MV also prices the size portfolios with a significantly negative λM V . The estimate
for bM V is also significantly negative, so that we can reject the null that MV does not add
pricing power to the other factors for size portfolios.

   In Panel C, we add corporate bond portfolios. We use data from Citibank’s Yield Book for
four investment-grade portfolios: AAA, AA, A, and BBB. Return data for these portfolios
are available monthly from January 1980 until December 2010, which restricts our estimation
to this sample in columns 7-9. Because we cannot identify risk prices off four test assets and
because it is recommended to use large and diverse cross-sections of test assets (Lewellen,
Shanken, and Nagel 2010), we combine the 10 size, 10 value, and 4 corporate bond portfolios
in Panel C. We find that CIV is priced with a significantly negative risk premium while MV
is not. Inspection of the betas reveals that growth stocks have mildly positive CIV betas
(0.005-0.009 for BM1-BM5) while value stocks have negative CIV-betas (around -0.03 for
BM6-BM9 and -0.09 for BM10). Small firms have negative CIV-betas (-0.13 for ME1, -0.07
for ME2), while large firms have less negative or even positive CIV-betas (0.01 for ME10).
Finally, corporate bond portfolios of high credit quality have positive CIV-betas (0.013 for
AAA) while corporate bonds of firms with lower credit quality have negative CIV-betas
(-0.03 for the BBB portfolios). These patterns in CIV-betas help to explain why the CIV
factor contributes to resolving the value, size, and credit spread anomalies.

   We conduct several robustness checks in the appendix. We use traded versions of the CIV

The set of test assets are decile portfolios sorted on book-to-market ratio in columns 1-3, on size (market capitalization) in
columns 4-6, the book-to-market deciles, size deciles, and 4 corporate bond portfolios sorted by credit rating in columns 7-9.
The estimation sample is 1963.01-2010.12 in columns 1-6 and 1980.01-2010.12 in columns 7-9. The model in columns 1, 4, and
contains the excess market return as the factor. The model in columns 2, 5, and 8 contains the excess market return and CIV
innovation as factors. The model in columns 3, 6, and 9 contains the excess market return, the CIV innovation and the MV
innovation. The table reports the risk premia estimates (λ) associated with the factors and their Newey-West standard errors
(with one lag) from a cross-sectional regression of average monthly excess portfolio returns on factor exposures. The second to
last row reports the cross-sectional R2 and the last row reports the root mean-squared pricing error, expressed as an annual
return. The bottom panel also reports bM V , the market price of risk of MV and its associated t-statistic. The market prices of
risk b are estimated from a cross-sectional regression of average excess returns on the test assets on the (univariate) covariances
of the returns with the factors.

and MV factors. The traded CIV (MV) factor is the return on a portfolio that goes long the
tenth CIV-beta (MV-beta) decile and short the first CIV-beta (MV-beta) decile. Table A5
contains the results. The risk premium estimate on the traded CIV has the interpretation of
a monthly excess return. We estimate an average value of around -0.005 or -6% annualized.
This is consistent with the average return spread on the 10-minus-1 CIV-beta portfolio of
-5.4% per year. In contrast, the risk premium on the traded MV factor is always positive,
which is the wrong sign.

    We also investigate the pricing ability of CIV and market variance for the same set of
test assets as in Table 4, but using the Campbell, Giglio, Polk, and Turley (2014) measure
of market variance, called NV . The results in Table A6 show that CIV continues to carry a
negative and significant risk premium for all sets of test assets, even after inclusion of the
traded NV factor.

    Finally, we have studied earnings-price sorted portfolios, idiosyncratic volatility sorted


                                                               28
portfolios, and momentum portfolios. The results for earnings-price portfolios look very
similar to those for book-to-market sorted portfolios. In contrast, CIV has no pricing ability
for the idiosyncratic volatility and momentum portfolios.

   We conclude that CIV innovations have pricing ability for value, size, and corporate bond
portfolios over and above the pricing ability of the market variance factor. This strengthens
the appeal of CIV as a new asset pricing factor.


4.4     Household Income Growth Dispersion As Pricing Factor

The positive correlation between CIV shocks and shocks to the dispersion in household
income growth (Section 3), couples with the significant asset pricing power of CIV, suggest
that CIV proxies for partially uninsurable idiosyncratic consumption risk of households. To
support this view, we document that direct measures of household income risk help price the
cross-section of returns. Unfortunately, our measures of income dispersion are only available
at annual frequency and for a relatively short sample. We explore two ways to overcome this
difficulty.

   First, we find a proxy for the cross-sectional dispersion of firm employment growth (such
as the Compustat or BEA measures used in section 3) that is available at high frequency.
We use the market value of the firm’s equity as a proxy for its number of employees. We
calculate the cross-sectional standard deviation of the growth rate in firm size at the monthly
frequency. We refer to monthly changes in this size dispersion as the FSD factor. We estimate
a firm’s FSD-beta in a multiple regression of excess returns on FSD and MV factors, and then
sort stocks into deciles by their FSD-beta. Stocks with low FSD-beta have excess returns
that are 4.6% higher than stocks with a high FSD-beta. This spread is similar in magnitude
to the CIV-beta spread (t-statistic of -2.86). Moreover, the CAPM and three-factor models
leaves the entire return spread unexplained. The αCAP M spread is -5.8% (t-statistic of -3.7)
and αF F spread is -4.6% (t-statistic of -3.02).28

   Second, we construct a traded version of the shocks to the Guvenen et al. (2014) household
  28
     The Fama MacBeth analysis in Table A7 shows that FSD prices the 10 FSD-beta sorted portfolios, the
10 value portfolios, and the full cross-section of 34 test assets that also includes 10 size portfolios and 4
corporate bond portfolios with a negative and significant risk premium.

                                                     29
income growth dispersion measure, which we refer to as the GID factor.29 We show that the
GID factor prices the cross-section of annual test asset excess returns.30 Despite the short
sample for the Guvenen measure, these results provide additional support for the mechanism
in the paper.



5      Model with CIV in Household Consumption

Motivated by the three sets of facts presented in Sections 2, 3 and 4, this section of the paper
develops an incomplete markets asset pricing model where a common idiosyncratic volatility
factor is the key state variable driving both residual stock return volatility and the dispersion
in household income growth. Innovations to this factor represent bad news and carry a
negative price of risk. Stocks with more negative exposure with respect to this innovation
in turn earn a higher risk premium. We show a calibration that quantitatively accounts for
the cross-sectional differences in average returns across CIV-beta sorted portfolios. In the
interest of space, the model details and parameter sensitivity analysis are relegated to the
appendix.


5.1     Model Setup

There is a unit mass of atomless agents, each having Epstein-Zin preferences. There is a large
number of securities in zero or positive net supply. Agents are endowed with an equal fraction
of these securities and with a labor income process of the form Ij,t = Stj Ct − Dt , where S j
denotes agent j’s consumption share and per capita dividends are Dt . As in Constantinides
and Ghosh (2014), given the symmetric and homogeneous preferences, households choose
not to trade away from their initial endowments. That is, autarky is an equilibrium and
individual j’s equilibrium consumption is Cj,t = Ij,t + Dt = Stj Cta . Following Constantinides
and Duffie (1996), we interpret the equilibrium consumption process Cj,t as the post-trade
  29
     That is, we first estimate GID-betas for each stock using firm-level regressions of annual returns that
control for the MV factor. Second, we form the return on a portfolio that goes long highest GID-beta decile
of stocks and short the lowest GID-beta decile of stocks.
  30
     Table A8 shows that the GID factor is significant and negative in 7 out of 8 specifications. MV innovations
are significant in 2 out of 4 specifications.

consumption that obtains after households have exhausted all insurance options and the
temporary innovations to labor income have been smoothed out. It reflects the permanent
innovations to income that are not insurable and thus passed through to consumption.

  Relative to the literature, and motivated by the empirical evidence in section 3, the
novel ingredient in the model is the link between the firms’ dividend growth process and the
households’ individual income growth process. The common idiosyncratic volatility factor in
firms cash flows is also the driver of the cross-sectional dispersion of household consumption
growth rates:

                                                                              1 2

                                                                              2

All shocks are i.i.d. standard normal and mutually uncorrelated. The process σg,t+1 is the
cross-sectional variance of the individual log consumption growth process. Equation (2)
assumes this dispersion follows an AR(1) with innovations wg,t+1 . The wg,t+1 shock is the
key source of aggregate risk in the model. As will become clear below, it maps one-for-one to
the CIV shock. The only other aggregate source of risk is the usual aggregate consumption
growth shock ηt+1 in equation (3). When φc < 0, aggregate consumption growth is negatively
correlated with shocks to the cross-sectional dispersion of individual consumption growth.
This counter-cyclical variation in idiosyncratic risk is a mechanism familiar from Mankiw
(1986) and Constantinides and Duffie (1996). Our main pricing predictions do not require
this channel (i.e., we can allow φc = 0), but it helps the quantitative fit of the model.

  Equation (4) describes the dividend growth process for a stock i.

                                                                                             (4)


Dividend growth is affected by the two sources of aggregate risk. There is a traditional
leverage effect with respect to the ηt+1 shock (ϕ > 1) and a possible negative correlation
with the CIV shock wg,t+1 (φi < 0). Dividend growth is also subject to two sources of
idiosyncratic risk. The κi eit+1 shock is orthogonal to all other shocks in the economy, but its


                                               31
          2
variance σgt is common across firms. In contrast, the ζi εit+1 shock has a variance σit2 that is
firm-specific. Each stock’s σit2 process follows an AR(1), described in the appendix. Thus,
firm i’s idiosyncratic cash flow growth risk is Vt κi σgt eit+1 + ζi σit εit+1 = κ2i σgt
                                                                                      2

specification captures the factor structure in idiosyncratic variance documented in Section 2,
where the first term captures the common idiosyncratic variance (CIV) factor. Thus, wg,t+1
                                                                               2

shocks are perfectly correlated with innovations in CIV. Finally, the term χi σgt
for predictability of dividend growth between t and t + 1 by the CIV level at time t. Apart
from mean dividend growth µi and a common leverage parameter ϕ, the key cash flow
parameters are Θi = (χi , φi , κi , ζi ).

   The market portfolio follows a similar dividend growth process as in equation (4), except
without the idiosyncratic risk terms which are diversified away. The conditional variance of
the dividend growth on the market portfolio, just like that of aggregate consumption growth,
is constant. This implies that the aggregate stock market variance (MV) is constant over
time. We make this assumption to keep the model simple and to highlight the role of CIV.


5.2     The Cross-Section Of Equity Risk Premia

The log stochastic discount factor innovations can be written as:


                           −mt+1 + Et [mt+1 ] = λη σc ηt+1 + λw σg wg,t+1 ,                          (5)

                                                                           1

The appendix provides the derivation and the expression for the risk-free rate rtf . Equation
5 shows that there are two priced sources of aggregate risk: shocks to aggregate consump-
tion growth carrying a price of risk, λη , equal to the coefficient of relative risk aversion γ,
and shocks to the CIV factor carrying a market price of risk, λw . All three terms in the
λw expression are negative, provided that the agent has a preference for early resolution of


                                                   32
uncertainty (ψ −1 < γ), indicating that an increase in the cross-sectional volatility of con-
sumption growth is bad news for investors. The first term in λw captures precautionary
motives against changes in consumption risk sharing and is the main pricing effect of CIV
shocks. The second term compensates for exposure to counter-cyclical cross-sectional varia-
tion in idiosyncratic risk. Both terms appear when utility is time-additive. The third term
arises from Epstein-Zin preferences, inducing investors to care not only about current but
also about future cross-sectional dispersion of consumption growth. The size of this effect is
governed by the persistence of the idiosyncratic volatility factor, νg .

   We exploit the normality of the shocks to guess and verify that the log price-dividend
ratio on a stock is affine in the CIV factor and in firm-specific variance: pdit = µpdi +

The first two terms in equation (6) reflect the role of aggregate risks in a stock’s return
variance. The variance of idiosyncratic stock returns is given by the last three terms. Id-
                                                                      2
iosyncratic return variance is driven by the common variance process σgt and a firm-specific
variance process σit2 .

   Defining the CIV factor as the average of firms’ idiosyncratic return variances, as we did
                                                       2
in the data, equation (7) shows that CIV is affine in σgt . In Section 2, we demonstrated
the presence of a large first principal component in both total and idiosyncratic return
variance, and showed that it was the same component in both. We also showed that total
and idiosyncratic return variance at the firm-level were nearly identical. This fact justifies
our assumption of constant market variance. Finally, we showed that there was a common


                                                    33
component in firms’ total and idiosyncratic cash flow (sales) growth, and that the common
component in cash flow growth and return volatilities where highly correlated. This model
generates all these features. It associates the common component in idiosyncratic return
variance with changes in the cross-sectional dispersion of consumption growth across agents,
a connection for which we provided support in Section 3.

   The equity risk premium on stock i is:

  h          i
    i
Et rt+1 − rtf + .5Vt [rt+1
                       i                                i
                           ] = Cov(−mt+1 + Et [mt+1 ], rt+1        i
                                                            − Et [rt+1 ]) = βη,i λη σc2 + βgs,i λw σg2 .


The first term is the standard (consumption-) CAPM term. The second term is a new
term which compensates investors for movements in the cross-sectional consumption growth
distribution, today and in the future. Stocks that have low returns when the cross-sectional
dispersion of individual consumption growth increases, i.e., stocks with βgs,i < 0, are risky
and carry high expected returns because λw < 0. Because βη,i is constant across stocks,
heterogeneous exposure to CIV shocks is the sole driver of differences in risk premia across
stocks.

   Equation 8 shows the model-implied CIV-beta. There are three mechanisms that con-
tribute to a negative βgs,i . First, a sufficiently negative means that periods of high CIV
predict low future dividend growth. Below, we show that CIV negatively forecasts dividend
growth in the data and we choose χi to match the slope of the predictive relationship. Sec-
ond, if positive shocks to CIV coincide with low dividend growth realizations (φi < 0), then
that stock has a more negative βgs,i . Third, a stock with lower κi , or lower cash flow exposure
to the common idiosyncratic risk term, will have a lower βgs,i . Intuitively, when there is a
positive shock to CIV the quantity of idiosyncratic risk goes up more for stocks with greater
exposure κi . As a result of convexity in the relation between growth and terminal value, this
raises the price more of those high volatility stocks, increasing their βgs,i , and lowering their
equilibrium expected return.31
 31
      A similar convexity effect is explored by Pastor and Veronesi (2003, 2009).

5.3     Quantitative Implications of the CIV Model

We use our model to evaluate if the average return spreads across CIV-beta sorted portfo-
lios documented in Section 4 are quantitatively consistent with the extent of idiosyncratic
volatility comovement documented in Section 2. A detailed discussion of the calibration and
a sensitivity analysis are in the appendix; our benchmark parameter values are in Table 5.
The calibration respects the mean and volatility of aggregate consumption growth and the
risk-free rate. The average cross-sectional standard deviation of consumption growth is set
at 10% to reflect the partial pass-through of household income shocks to consumption.32 The
persistence of σgt is chosen to match that of CIV (annual autocorrelation of 0.6). Unlike
other state variables in the asset pricing literature, this variable moves at business-cycle fre-
quencies. We also match the mean of the observed CIV process. The consumption leverage
parameter ϕ and risk aversion parameter γ are chosen to match the equity risk premium on
the market portfolio of 5.5%. Because the exposure of the aggregate market portfolio to the
CIV shock, βgs,M , is close to zero in the data, most of the equity risk premium on the market
portfolio must come from the standard consumption-CAPM term. Given the low volatility
of aggregate consumption growth, this requires a risk aversion coefficient of 15.

   The main question is whether the model can generate the observed differences in average
returns between stocks with low and high CIV-betas, documented in Section 4. To speak to
the quintile portfolio evidence, we solve our model for a representative stock in each of the
CIV-beta quintiles portfolios. That is, we choose five sets of four cash flow growth parameters
Θi , and price the resulting cash flows inside the model. The four cash flow parameters are
chosen to match four moments, for each quintile portfolio and the market portfolio. Those
are the CIV-beta, βgs,i in equation (8), the slope of a regression of dividend growth on lagged
CIV, and the slope and R2 from a regression of stock return variance (in equation 6) on the
CIV factor (in equation 7). While these are four simultaneous equations, χi mostly affects
  32
    As discussed above, Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston (2008) and Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante
(2014) provide empirical support for the partial pass-through of permanent income shocks to consumption.
Given that the cross-sectional standard deviation of household income growth is 53% on average according to
Guvenen et al. (2014), this assumes that one-fifth of income shocks are uninsurable. We perform sensitivity
with respect to this parameter in the appendix, considering higher values that match the average cross-section
dispersion in household-level consumption growth.

the dividend growth predictability slope, κi governs the portfolio’s return variance exposure
to CIV, ζi affects the R2 of that relationship, and φi is chosen to match βgs,i given the other
three parameters. Rows 5 and 6 of Table 6 show that the calibration indeed matches the
CIV betas. Rows 14-17 shows that the model matches the slope and R2 of the regression
of return variance on CIV. Finally, rows 18 and 19 show that the calibration matches the
dividend growth predictability by lagged CIV. We note that dividend growth is much lower
on the low CIV-beta stocks following an increase in CIV than it is for the high CIV-beta
stocks.

    The main result of the calibration exercise is that the model is able to match the 5.4%
spread in excess returns on the CIV beta-sorted portfolios. It generates a monotonically
declining pattern in excess stock return from Q1 to Q5 (row 2). While the average excess
return levels are too low, the model exactly matches the return spread between portfolio
5 and portfolio 1 (row 1). As rows 3 and 4 make clear, the common level of the equity
risk premium comes from compensation for η-risk, while the entire cross-sectional slope in
excess returns is due to differential exposure to the wg -risk. The stocks in portfolio Q1 (Q5)
have negative (positive) exposure to the CIV factor (row 6). Their returns fall (rise) when
the cross-sectional vol increases, making them risky (a hedge). As a result, they carry the
highest (lowest) risk premia.

This table reports moments from the model and compares them to the data. The first two rows report the
average excess return. The next two rows split out the equity risk premium into a contribution representing
compensation for η risk and a compensation for wg risk. Rows 5 and 6 report CIV-betas, where model betas
have been scaled to ensure that the innovation volatility of CIV is the same in model and data. Rows 7 and
8 report stock return volatilities, followed by a breakdown of volatility into its five components in rows 9-13
(see equation 6). Since the variance but not the volatility components are additive, we calculate the square
root of each variance component, and then rescale
                                               h        iall components so they sum to total volatility. Rows 14

   The model accurately matches total return volatilities of the CIV beta-sorted portfolios,
shown in rows 7 and 8 of Table 6. Annual return volatilities for the typical stock in each of
the quintile portfolios range from 45% to 65%. They are highest for portfolios Q1 and Q5.
The market portfolio has a volatility of 15.7% in the data and 14.1% in the model. Rows
9-13 break down total return volatility into its five components. As in the data, most of
total return volatility is idiosyncratic return volatility. The common idiosyncratic and firm-
specific idiosyncratic components contribute about one-third and two-thirds, respectively,

                                                      37
to idiosyncratic firm volatility (rows 11 and 12). The model matches the persistence of the
various volatility components as well as the relative amount of variation that comes from
the common and the firm-specific volatility components.

    The model has additional testable implications. In the appendix, we find that the log
price-dividend ratio predicts CIV with a positive sign, consistent with the model. The point
estimate in the data is significant for quintiles 1-4 and the predictive R2 ranges from 11%
to 29%, which is substantial. Also, the model predicts a negative relationship between real
rates and CIV, resulting in a downward term structure of real rates. This is a prediction
it shares with the model of Bansal and Yaron (2004). Verdelhan (2010) shows a significant
downward slope for 1983-1995 for the U.K. and a flat yield curve from 1995 to 2006. The
evidence for the U.S. shows a modest upward sloping yield curve.

    The appendix explores several sensitivity analyses. In one exercise, we increase the mean
of the σgt process, σg , thereby increasing the amount of labor income risk that is passed
through to consumption. We increase σg from 0.10 to 0.42, thereby matching the cross-
sectional dispersion of observed consumption growth. Interestingly, the model matches the
asset pricing results as well as in the benchmark calibration. We also consider a calibration
with lower risk aversion, which implies a lower equity risk premium but a similar return
spread on the high-minus-low CIV-beta portfolio.



6     Conclusion

We document strong comovement of individual stock return volatilities. Removing all com-
mon variation in returns has little effect on volatility comovement, as residual return volatility
possesses effectively the same volatility factor structure as total returns. Volatility comove-
ment is also a prominent feature of firm-level cash flows. We find a strong factor structure
in total and idiosyncratic sales growth volatilities. Shocks to this common component of
idiosyncratic volatility (CIV) are priced. Sorting stocks on their CIV-beta results in a sub-
stantial return spread of about 6%; the spread survives inclusion of common risk factors.
The CIV factor is also helpful to understand return differences on other stock and corpo-


                                               38
rate bond portfolios. Finally, we establish an empirical connection between CIV shocks and
shocks to the cross-sectional dispersion of household income growth.

   We account for all three facts in a model with heterogeneous investors whose consumption
risk is linked to firms’ idiosyncratic cash flow risk. CIV is a priced state variable: Increases
in CIV lead to an increase in the dispersion of consumption growth across households and
are associated with high marginal utility for the average investor. Stocks whose returns rise
with CIV hedge against deterioration in the investment opportunity set and thus earn low
average returns. The calibrated model quantitatively matches the observed return spread
and volatility facts.

   Our work empirically documents a link between the volatility in firms’ returns and cash
flow growth and the cross-sectional volatility in household consumption growth. A large
literature argues that shocks to firms have important effects on both the labor income and
financial income of their employees. Another literature documents that households cannot
or do not fully insure against their labor income shocks. One valuable direction for future
work is to provide further evidence on the joint dynamics of the distributions of firm output
and household income and consumption. A second direction is to use CIV as a measure of
consumption growth dispersion in tests of consumption-based asset pricing models and in
work that studies income and consumption inequality.

          Figure A1: Log Volatility: Empirical Density Versus Normal Density
The figure plots histograms of the empirical cross section distribution of annual firm-level volatility (in logs) pooling all firm-year
observations. Panel A shows total return volatility, calculated as the standard deviation of daily returns for each stock within
a calendar year. Panel B shows total sales growth volatility, calculated as the standard deviation of quarterly year-on-year
sales growth observations in a 20 quarter window. Panels C and D show idiosyncratic volatility based on the five principal
components factor model. Overlaid on these histograms is the exact normal density with mean and variance set equal to that
of the empirical distribution. Each figure reports the skewness and kurtosis of the data in the histogram.

                                      Figure A4: Volatility of 100 Size and Value Portfolios
The figures plot volatility of total and idiosyncratic returns on 100 size and value portfolios. Within each calendar year, total
return volatilities are estimated from daily returns for each portfolio (Panel A), while idiosyncratic return volatility is the
standard deviation of residuals from the three factor Fama-French model (Panel B) estimated within each calendar year. Panel
C shows average pairwise correlation for total and idiosyncratic returns on 100 size and value portfolios within each calendar
year.

                              Table A1: Volatility Factor Model Estimates
The table reports estimates of annual volatility one-factor regression models. In each panel, the volatility factor is defined as
the equal-weighted cross section average of firm volatilities within that year. That is, all estimated volatility factor models take
the form: σi,t = intercepti + loadingi · σ ·,t + ei,t . Columns represent different volatility measures. For the 100 Fama-French
returns (Panel A), the columns report estimates for a factor model of total return volatility and idiosyncratic volatility based
on residual returns from the market model, the Fama-French model, or the five principal component models. For net income
growth (Panel B) and EBITDA growth (Panel C), the columns report total volatility or idiosyncratic volatility based on sales
growth residuals from the one and five principal components model (using a rolling 20 quarter window for estimation). The
last column of Panels B and C reports results when using only the four quarterly growth observations within each calendar
year to estimate total volatility. We report cross-sectional averages of loadings and intercepts as well as time series regression
R2 averaged over all firms. We also report a pooled factor model R2 , which compares the estimated factor model to a model
with only firm-specific intercepts and no factor.

The table reports average excess returns, CAPM alphas, and three-factor Fama-French alphas for equally-weighted portfolio
sorts in annual percentages. Panels A and B report one-way sorts on CIV beta using all CRSP stocks in the 1986-2010 and
1963-1985 subsamples, respectively. Panel C reports sorts on CIV-beta, where CIV-betas for stocks have been estimated from
univariate regressions of monthly excess returns on CIV changes, without controlling for exposure to MV shocks. Panel D reports
sorts on MV-beta in the full 1963-2010 sample, where MV-betas for stocks have been estimated from univariate regressions of
monthly excess returns on MV changes, without controlling for exposure to CIV shocks.

          Table A3: Portfolios Formed on CIV Beta: Additional Double Sorts
The table reports average excess returns for several double-sorting exercises. In each panel we sort stocks first into quintiles
sorted on a factor, and then within each quintile, sort stocks in quintiles based on their CIV-beta. We form equally-weighted
average returns for all 25 portfolios, expressed in annual percentages. The second factor is size (log market equity) in panel
A, the level of idiosyncratic variance in Panel B, the VIX-beta in panel C, and the Pastor-Stambaugh liquidity factor-beta in
panel D. The sample is 1963.01-2010.12, except for panel C which is for 1990.1-2010.12.

                          Table A4: Correlations Among Sorting Variables
In each month we calculate the cross-sectional correlation between the sorting variables used in Panel E of Table 2 and in Table
A3. The table reports an average of these correlations over all months in the 1963-2010 sample. The CIV-beta and MV-beta
are obtained from a multiple regression of individual stock excess returns on CIV shocks and MV shocks. All other betas are
obtained from single regressions of individual stock excess returns on the asset pricing factors. The correlation between the
CIV-beta and the single-sorted MV-beta is (not reported).

                       Table A5: Fama MacBeth Analysis: Traded Factors
The set of test assets are decile portfolios sorted on exposure to CIV innovations in columns 1-3, decile portfolios sorted on
book-to-market ratio in columns 4-6, decile portfolios sorted on size (market capitalization) in columns 7-9, and all of these
30 assets plus 4 corporate bond portfolios sorted on credit rating in columns 10-12. The estimation sample is monthly from
1963.01-2010.12 in columns 1-9 and 1980.01-2010.12 in columns 10-12. The model in columns 1, 4, 7, and 10 contains the
excess market return as the factor. The model in columns 2, 5, 8, and 11 contains the excess market return and the return on a
portfolio that goes long in the tenth decile of CIV-beta stocks and short in the first decile of CIV-beta stocks (CIVtr) as factors.
The model in columns 3, 6, 9, and 12 contains the excess market return, CIVtr, and MVtr, where MVtr is the return a portfolio
that goes long in the tenth decile of MV-beta stocks and short in the first decile of MV-beta stocks. The table reports risk
premia and Newey-West standard errors (with one lag) estimated from a cross-sectional regression of average monthly excess
portfolio returns on factor exposures. The second to last row reports the cross-sectional R2 and the last row reports the root
mean-squared pricing error, expressed as an annual return. The market prices of risk b are estimated from a cross-sectional
regression of average excess returns on the test assets on the (univariate) covariances of the returns with the factors.

         Table A8: Fama MacBeth Analysis: Guvenen - Anomalies Portfolios
The set of test assets are decile portfolios sorted on exposure to innovations in the dispersion of household income growth by
Guvenen et al. (2014) (GID) in columns 1-3, decile portfolios sorted on book-to-market ratio in columns 4-6, on size (market
capitalization) in columns 7-9, and all of these 30 assets plus 4 corporate bond portfolios sorted by credit rating in columns
10-12. The GID-beta sorted portfolios are formed as follows. We estimate multiple regressions of annual excess returns of
individual firms on annual GID innovations and annual MV innovations. Annual MV innovations are formed as the difference
between MV in the last month of the year and MV in the last month of the preceding year. We estimate rolling-window factor
betas using 15-year rolling windows. That implies that only firms with 15 years of return history are included. Once the betas
estimated, we sort firms into deciles based on their GID-betas and calculate equally-weighted portfolio returns. We form a
traded risk factor, GIDtr, by going long the highest and short the lowest GID-beta decile portfolio. This traded risk factor
return is available monthly, even though the underlying betas are estimated at annual frequency. In essence, the composition
of the underlying decile portfolios is constant within the year. The estimation sample is 1978.01-2010.12 in columns 1-9 and
1980.01-2010.12 in columns 10-12. The model in columns 1, 4, 7, and 10 contains the excess market return as the factor. The
model in columns 2, 5, 8, and 11 contains the excess market return and GIDtr as factors. The model in columns 3, 6, 9, and 12
contains the excess market return, GIDtr, and MVtr, defined in Table A5. The table reports market prices of risk and Newey-
West standard errors (with one lag) estimated from a cross-sectional regression of average monthly excess portfolio returns on
factor exposures. The second to last row reports the cross-sectional R2 and the last row reports the root mean-squared pricing
error, expressed as an annual return.

B       Model Appendix
This appendix solves the model sketched in the main text. It then discusses the benchmark model calibration.
Next, we test the model’s implication that price-dividend ratios predict CIV in the data. Finally, it provides
sensitivity analysis to the benchmark calibration.


B.1      Model Setup and Solution
B.1.1     Setup
There is a unit mass of atomless agents, each having Epstein-Zin preferences. Let Ut (Ct ) denote the utility
derived from consuming Ct . The value function of each agent takes the following recursive form:
                                                                                     θ
                                         
                                                    1−γ                      θ1  1−γ
                                                                       1−γ
                               Ut (Ct ) = (1 − δ)Ct  θ
                                                          +δ       Et Ut+1                .

where θ ≡ (1 − γ)/(1 − ψ1 ). The time discount factor is δ, the risk aversion parameter is γ ≥ 0, and the
inter-temporal elasticity of substitution (IES) is ψ ≥ 0. When ψ > 1 and γ > 1, then θ < 0 and agents
prefer early resolution of uncertainty.
    Aggregate labor income is defined as It . There is a large number of securities in zero or positive net
supply. The combined total (and per capita) dividends are Dt . Aggregate dividend income plus aggregate
labor income equals aggregate consumption: Ct = It + Dt . Individual consumption is given by Stj Ct , where
S j denotes agent j’s consumption share, and individual labor income is defined by

                                              Ij,t = Stj Ct − Dt

    All agents can trade in all securities at all times and are endowed with an equal number of all securities
at time zero. Labor income risk is, however, uninsurable. As in Constantinides and Ghosh (2014), given the
symmetric and homogeneous preferences, households choose not to trade away from their initial endowments.
That is, autarky is an equilibrium and individual j’s equilibrium consumption is Cj,t = Ij,t + Dt = Stj Ct .
   We use lowercase symbols to denote logs. We impose the same idiosyncratic volatility factor struc-
ture on investor consumption growth and firm dividend growth by adopting the following specification for
consumption growth in aggregate and for each agent j:

                               ∆cjt+1   = ∆cat+1 + ∆sjt+1
                               ∆cat+1   = µg + σc ηt+1 + φc σg wg,t+1
                                                        1 2
                               ∆sjt+1             j
                                        = σg,t+1 vt+1 − σg,t+1                                            (9)
                                                        2 
                                2
                               σg,t+1   = σg2 + νg σgt2
                                                        − σg2 + σw σg wg,t+1 .                           (10)

All shocks are i.i.d. standard normal and mutually uncorrelated. While aggregate consumption growth
is homoscedastic, household consumption growth is not. The cross-sectional mean and variance of the
consumption share process are:
                             h       i        1 2                h      i
                           Ej ∆sjt+1   =     − σg,t+1 ,        Vj ∆sjt+1 = σg,t+1
                                                                            2
                                                                                  .
                                              2
where Ej [·] and Vj [·] are expectation and variance operators over the cross-section of households. Thus,
the process σg,t+1 measures the cross-sectional
                                      h i       standard deviation of consumption share growth. The mean
consumption share in levels is one (Ej Stj = 1). As an aside, our results are robust to changes in the timing
of the consumption share growth process in equation (9). The consumption share growth dispersion could
be modeled either as σg,t or as σg,t+1 . This changes the expressions in the model as well as the calibration,


                                                      55
but it doesn’t affect our quantitative results. We prefer the current timing because it allows for shocks to
the σg process that occur between t and t+1 to affect the cross-sectional dispersion of consumption growth
between t and t+1. Because CIV is the state variable that forecasts future dividend growth, σgt shows up
in the dividend growth equation (4).
   Dividend growth of firm i is given by:

B.1.2     Claim to Individual Consumption Stream
We start by pricing a claim to individual consumption growth, using the individual’s own intertemporal
marginal rate of substitution. We conjecture that the log wealth-consumption ratio of agent j is linear in the
                2
state variable σgt , and does not depend on any agent-specific characteristics: wcjt = µwc +Wgs σgt
                                                                                                  2
                                                                                                    − σg2 . We
                                                                                                 j   j
verify this conjecture evaluating the Euler equation for the consumption claim of agent j: Et [Mt+1 Rt+1 ] = 1,
          j
where Mt+1 is agent j’s stochastic discount factor (SDF). Under symmetric preferences, this conjecture
implies that the individual wealth-consumption ratio does not depend on agent-specific attributes, only on
aggregate objects.
   The beginning-of-period (or cum-dividend) total wealth Wtj that is not spent on consumption Ctj earns
                j                                                         j
a gross return Rt+1 and leads to beginning-of-next-period total wealth Wt+1  . The return on a claim to
consumption, the total wealth return, can be written as
                                                    j             j      j
                                         j         Wt+1          Ct+1 W Ct+1
                                        Rt+1 =               =                   .
                                                 Wtj − Ctj       Ctj W Ctj − 1

We use the Campbell (1991) approximation of the log total wealth return rtj = log(Rtj ) around the long-run
average log wealth-consumption ratio µwc ≡ E[wtj − cjt ]:
                                         j
                                        rt+1 = κc0 + ∆cjt+1 + wcjt+1 − κc1 wcjt ,

where the linearization constants κc0 and κc1 are non-linear functions of the unconditional mean log wealth-
consumption ratio µwc :
                                  eµwc                                    eµwc
                         κc1 =          > 1 and κc0 = − log (eµwc − 1) + µwc    µwc .
                                 eµwc−1                                 e    −1

   The return on a claim to the consumption stream of agent j, Rj , satisfies the Euler equation under her

where the second equality applies the law of iterated expectations, and the last equality applies the cross-
sectional normality of consumption share growth.
   We combine the approximation of the log total wealth return with our conjecture for the wealth-
consumption ratio of agent j, wcjt = µwc + Wgs σgt 2
                                                      − σg2 , and solve for the coefficients µwc and Wgs
by imposing the Euler equation for the consumption claim.
                                                                                   j
   First, using the conjecture, we compute the individual log total wealth return rt+1 :
   j
  rt+1   =    κc0 + ∆cjt+1 + wcjt+1 − κc1 wcjt
                                          

where r0c = κc0 + µg + (1 − κc1 ) µwc − 12 σg2 .
   Second, Epstein and Zin (1989) show that the log real stochastic discount factor is

                                                                           
                       =
                                                             2

                                                                                2

where µs = θ log δ − γµg + (θ − 1)[κc0 + (1 − κc1 )µwc ] + γ 12 σg2 is the unconditional mean log SDF.
   Third, using the individual stochastic discount factor and total wealth return expressions, we can compute
elements of equation 14. Specifically, we have that:

   Finally, we can use the above equations to solve the Euler equation 14. Using log normal properties, we
can take the expected value conditional on time t information and compute the Euler equation. Applying

method of undetermined coefficients, the following equalities hold:

and

If the IES ψ exceeds 1, then Wgs < 0. Plugging the Wgs expression as well as κc0 and κc1 back into equation
(15) implicitly defines a nonlinear equation in one unknown (µwc ), which can be solved for numerically,
characterizing the average log wealth-consumption ratio.


B.1.3     Aggregate SDF
Since all agents can invest in all risky assets, the Euler equation has to be satisfied for any two agents j and
j ′ and for every stock i. This implies that the average SDF must also price all financial assets i:

   Once we have solved for the individual stochastic discount factors, the common log real stochastic discount

Interest rates contain the usual impatience and intertemporal substitution terms. They also capture the
precautionary savings motive: when idiosyncratic risk is high, agents increase savings thereby lowering
interest rates.
   The maximum Sharpe ratio in the economy is:

B.1.4      Firm Stock Return
Turning to the pricing of the dividend claim defined by equation (11), we guess and verify that its log
price-dividend ratio is affine in the common and idiosyncratic variance terms:

                         and k0i = log(1 + exp(µpdi )) − k1i µpdi are approximation constants. Plugging in the

B.2      Calibration
Table 5 shows our benchmark parameter choices; the model is calibrated to match moments of the data
for the 1963-2010 period and simulated at an annual frequency. Risk aversion γ is set to 15 and the inter-
temporal elasticity of substitution ψ is set to 2. The high value for γ is needed to generate a high equity
risk premium for the market portfolio. A richer model with time variation in market variance and/or with
a slow-moving component in expected consumption growth as in Bansal and Yaron (2004) would allow us
to match the equity risk premium with lower risk aversion, but at the expense of higher model complexity.
We perform sensitivity with respect to the parameter γ.
    The time discount factor δ = 0.875 is set to produce a mean real risk-free rate of 1.5% per year, given
all other parameters. The model produces a risk-free rate with modest volatility of 1.25% per year. Mean
consumption growth µg is 2% per year and σc is 0.0247 per year. We set φc equal to −0.04 to capture the
negative correlation between aggregate consumption growth and the cross-sectional volatility of consumption
growth. Aggregate consumption growth volatility is modest at 2.5% per year.
    We set the mean of the cross-sectional dispersion in consumption growth, σg , to 10%. One valid inter-
pretation of σg in the model is as the mean dispersion of those household income growth shocks that are
uninsurable and that end up in household consumption growth. The labor economics literature has found
that transitory income shocks are more easily insured than permanent shocks (Blundell, Pistaferri, and
Preston 2008). In the same vein, Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante (2014) find that 40% of persistent
wage fluctuations end up in consumption, while the rest are effectively smoothed. Incomplete pass-through
of income shocks to consumption therefore motivates values for σg that are lower than household income
growth dispersion of 53%. Our approach is to consider two extreme cases. In our benchmark case, we assume
that all but one-fifth of the income growth shocks are insurable. In our sensitivity analysis below, we assume
that none of the income growth shocks are insurable. We find that the asset pricing implications are very
similar for both extreme cases and for the intermediate cases we studied as well.
   The persistence of the cross-sectional dispersion process, νg , is set to 0.6 per year, a value equal to the
annual persistence of the CIV factor in the data. This choice implies that our main state variable moves at
                                                                                                     2
business cycle rather than at much lower frequencies. We set σw to 1.47%. This ensures that σgt        remains
positive. The time series standard deviation of σgt is 0.94%.
   The model results in a market price of CIV risk of −4.82. The first component of λw contributes -1.77,
the second one -0.59, and the Epstein-Zin term -2.46. The model has a substantial maximum conditional
Sharpe ratio of 0.61 per year.
    To represent the typical stock in each of the CIV-beta sorted quintile portfolios, we solve our model for
five assets that differ in terms of their cash-flow growth process (equation 11). We also consider the market
portfolio, which is an asset whose cash flow growth has no idiosyncratic shocks. We set mean dividend
growth µi equal to the values observed for the CIV-beta sorted portfolios and the market portfolio in the
data.
    We set the consumption leverage parameter ϕ equal to 5.69 for all portfolios. By setting this parameter
equal for all portfolios, we impose that all differences in risk premia across portfolios arise from differences
in exposure to the wg,t+1 shocks. The choice is such that the model matches the equity risk premium for the
market portfolio of 5.50% exactly, given all other parameters. The contribution to the equity risk premium
from the η-term is 5.21% per year.
   The other parameters that we hold fixed across portfolios are the parameters governing the σit process


                                                      60
in equation (12). We set σi to 0.4%, νi to 0.15, and σiw to 1.5e-6. The persistence of σit is much lower than
that of σgt , consistent with the data. We choose σiw such that σit never becomes negative in simulations.
Finally, the value for σi is chosen to match the mean of the observed annual CIV process of 0.254, given all
other parameters.
   The four key cash flow parameters for each quintile portfolio are φi , χi , κi , and ζi . We pin down these
four parameters to match four moments. The first is the CIV beta, βgs,i , in equation (8). The second is
the slope of a regression of dividend growth on lagged CIV, ensuring that the model respects the dividend
growth predictability patterns observed in the data. The third and fourth moments are the slope and the
R2 from a regression of idiosyncratic stock return variance on the CIV factor:
                                          h        i
                                            idio,i
                                       Vt rt+1       = ai + bi CIVt + νti .                               (18)

While these are four simultaneous equations, χi mostly affects the dividend growth predictability slope, κi
governs the portfolios’ return variance exposure to CIV, ζi affects the R2 of the regression in (18), while φi
is chosen to match βgs,i given the other three parameters. The last four rows of Table 5 show the chosen
values for these four parameters for each portfolio.


B.3       Stock Prices Predict CIV
In the spirit of Beeler and Campbell (2012), we test whether the price-dividend ratio on stocks predicts CIV
or idiosyncratic household risk. Indeed, in the structural model the log price-dividend ratio on a stock of
                                                                                             2
firm i, pdit is linear in the cross-sectional dispersion in idiosyncratic income growth σgt    as well as in the firm-
                                     2                          2                     i
specific idiosyncratic variance σit (equation 16). Since σgt is persistent the pdt ratio today should forecast
         2                                                             2
future σg,t+1   . In the model, the relationship between pdit and σgt    is given by Aigs . Since Aigs is positive, we
expect a positive sign in the predictive relationship. Finally, because the log price-dividend ratio also depends
                                                 2
on the firm-specific idiosyncratic variance σit    , the regression should control for idiosyncratic variance.
    To implement this test, we start by constructing the log price-dividend ratio for each CIV beta-sorted
quintile portfolio from cum-dividend and ex-dividend portfolio returns, aggregated up from cum- and ex-
dividend returns of the stocks in the portfolio. The dividend is a cumulative twelve-month dividend, and
monthly dividends are not reinvested. We calculate the return variance of each stock in the portfolio and
                                                      2
orthogonalize it to CIV to obtain a measure of σit      . We average this residual variance across the stocks
in each portfolio. We use this residual variance as a control in the predictive regression, as suggested by
the theory. Omitting this control has little effect on the results. Panel A of Table A9 shows the results
of predicting CIV one-month ahead. The sample is 1963-2010, for consistency with the other asset pricing
results. We find that the log price-dividend ratio on all portfolios predicts CIV with a positive slope and
the point estimate is significant for quintiles 1-4. For those portfolios, the predictive R2 ranges from 11% to
29%, which is substantial. Panel D shows that the predictive ability is even stronger in the full 1926-2010
sample with higher point estimates, t-statistics, and R2 values.
    It is instructive to compare the predictability of CIV to the predictability of MV. The evidence is reported
in Panels B and E. We find some evidence for predictability of MV by the log pd ratio in portfolios 2, 4, and
5 in Panel B, but the t-statistics and R2 values are substantially lower than for CIV. The same is true for
the longer sample in panel E.
    Finally, we look at whether the log pd ratio also forecasts employment growth dispersion. This is the
series with the longest available sample: annual data from 1950 until 2010. Panels C and F show that pdit
significantly predicts employment growth dispersion with t-statistics ranging from 2.1 to 5.0 in the shorter
sample and 4.4-8.4 in the longer sample. The R-squared values range from 11% to 38% in the shorter
sample and 30% to 55% in the longer sample. This predictability evidence provides further support for the
mechanism and the model we propose.

The table reports results from predictive regressions of the log price-dividend ratio for future values of CIV (Panels A and D),
MV (Panels B and E), and employment growth dispersion (Panels C and F). The sample is 1964-2010 in Panels A, B, and
C, 1926-2010 in Panels D and E, and 1950-2010 in Panel F. CIV and MV are the levels (not the innovations) of the common
idiosyncratic stock return variance and market return variance. The regressions predict one month ahead in panels A, B, D,
and E, and one year ahead in Panels C and F. The Compustat data used to construct the employment growth dispersion are
only available annually from 1950 until 2010. The columns Q1 to Q5 refer to the five CIV-beta sorted quintile portfolios. For
each portfolio, we calculate the log price-dividend ratio from the cum-dividend and ex-dividend portfolio returns, which are
constructed from the cum-dividend and ex-dividend returns of the individual stocks in that portfolio. Dividends are summed
over twelve months (no reinvestment within the year). The regression controls for the idiosyncratic variance of the portfolio
return. This idiosyncratic variance is constructed by regressing each individual stock’s variance on CIV, and averaging the
residual among all the stocks in the portfolio. The t-statistics in panels A, B, D, and E (C and F) use Newey-West standard
errors with 12 (1) lags.

The first robustness exercise is with respect to the parameters of the key state variable σgt , which is pro-
portional to CIV. We explore increasing the mean of this process, σg to 0.42. This value is implied by the
cross-sectional labor income growth dispersion in Guvenen et al. (2014) and a labor income share of 80%
(Lustig, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Verdelhan 2013). When labor income makes up 80% of total income, log
consumption growth dispersion equals log labor income growth dispersion divided by 1.25. This results in
a cross-sectional consumption growth dispersion of 0.424. This 42% is close to the 38% value for the cross-
sectional dispersion in consumption growth we measure in the Consumption Expenditure Data (CEX) for
the period 1984-2011. The quantitative results are similar if we calibrate to a value of 38%. However, we
prefer not to rely on the CEX due to the measurement error issues discussed above.
    When increasing σg , we lower the innovation volatility σw to keep the risk premium λw associated with
wg shocks unchanged. This change lowers the volatility of the model-implied CIV process. We also change
the time discount factor δ in order to continue to match the observed mean risk-free rate. Higher values for
σg results in lower values for δ. The market price of CIV risk of −1.41. The first component of λw contributes
-0.34, the second one -0.59, and the Epstein-Zin term -0.48. The model has a maximum conditional Sharpe
ratio of 0.66 per year. We recalibrate the cash-flow parameters (ϕdi , φi , χi , κi , ζi ) following the same procedure
outlined in the main text. The parameters are listed in Table A10.
    The results are reported in Table A11. This calibration generates the same CIV-beta return spread as
in the benchmark case, and continues to match the CIV betas and the moments in rows 14-19 relating
to regressions of idiosyncratic return volatility on CIV and the regression slope of a dividend growth pre-
dictability regression on CIV. The only difference with the benchmark model is in the return volatilities
of the portfolios. The overall volatilities are very similar (about 1-2% difference on a baseline volatility of

45-65%). A larger fraction of the return volatility now comes from the common idiosyncratic risk term (ei )
and a smaller fraction from the firm-specific idiosyncratic risk term (εi ). The model continues to match the
observed mean CIV by virtue of a higher κ̄. Therefore, this exercise shows the same asset pricing performance
for a calibration where the average amount of idiosyncratic household risk is higher but its innovations are
less volatile.
    Our second robustness exercise is with respect to the coefficient of relative risk aversion γ. We explore
lowering it from 15 to 8. We keep the consumption leverage parameter and the aggregate consumption
growth process the same as in the benchmark model. As a result, the equity risk premium on the market
portfolio drops from 5.5% to 1.2%. We keep the average consumption growth dispersion at σg = .42,
and keep the innovation volatility at the benchmark value of σw = 1.47%. The parameters are listed in
Table A12 while the calibration results are in Table A13. While the model no longer matches the equity
risk premium, it still generates a large spread of -5.23% between the high and the low CIV-beta quintile
portfolio. It also continues to match return volatilities, dividend growth predictability slopes, and slopes and
R2 of idiosyncratic volatilities of the quintile portfolios on CIV.
