Post-Secondary Education and Increasing Wage Inequality
Thomas Lemieux
NBER Working Paper No. 12077
March 2006
JEL No. J3

                                          ABSTRACT

The paper presents descriptive evidence from quantile regressions and more "structural" estimates

from a human capital model with heterogenous returns to show that most of the increase in wage

inequality between 1973 and 2005 is due to a dramatic increase in the return to post-secondary

education. The model with heterogenous returns also helps explain why both the relative wages and

the within-group dispersion among highly-educated workers have increased in tandem over time.

These findings add to the growing evidence that, far from being ubiquitous, changes in wage

inequality are increasingly concentrated in the very top end of the wage distribution.

In the early 1990s, the consensus in the literature was that the large increase in wage
inequality of the 1980s was ubiquitous in the sense that all dimensions of inequality were
growing. For example, in a simple human capital model, wage inequality can increase
because returns to education and experience increase, or because residual or within-group
inequality increases. Chinhui Juhn, Kevin M. Murphy and Brooks Pierce (1993) showed
that all of these dimensions of inequality had been growing over time. They attributed
this to a pervasive increase in the relative demand for all dimensions of skill (education,
experience, unobserved ability, etc.). Other studies argue that skill biased technological
change (SBTC) was the main driving force behind the rise in the relative demand for skill
(e.g. Alan B. Krueger, 1993, and Eli Berman, John Bound and Zvi Griliches, 1994).
       More recently, however, a number of challenges to this “1990s consensus” have
emerged. One challenge that I do not explore in this paper has to do with the timing of
the growth in wage inequality. In particular, David Card and John DiNardo (2002) and
Paul Beaudry and David Green (2005) argue that much of the increase in the return to
education was concentrated in the 1980s. In a similar vein, Thomas Lemieux (2006a)
shows that the growth in residual wage inequality also appears to be concentrated in the
1980s once composition effects are controlled for. This evidence is difficult to reconcile
with a simple SBTC story that would likely predict a continuing and steep growth in
wage inequality throughout the 1990s.
       Mounting evidence also suggests that, far from being “ubiquitous”, the growth in
wage inequality is increasingly concentrated in the top end of the wage distribution. For
example, Jacob Mincer (1998) and Olivier Deschênes (2002) show that (log) wages are
an increasingly convex function of years of education. In other words, the wage gap
between college post-graduates and college graduates has increased more that the wage
gap between college graduates and high school graduates, which has itself increased
more than the wage gap between high school graduates and high school dropouts.
Looking more broadly at the distribution of taxable earnings, Thomas Piketty and
Emmanuel Saez (2002) also find that relative wage gains are disproportionally
concentrated in the very top of the earnings distribution. Changes in residual inequality
also appear to be concentrated at the top end. For instance, Lemieux (2006a) shows that
within-group inequality grew substantially among college-educated workers but changed



                                             1
little for most other groups. A related finding by David Autor, Lawrence Katz, and
Melissa Kearney (2005) is that “top end” residual inequality (e.g. the difference between
the 90th and 50th percentile of the distribution of residuals, or the “90-50” gap) increased
substantially while residual inequality at the low end (the 50-10 gap) actually declined.
       These recent findings are clearly inconsistent with a standard human capital
model where wages depend on different skills, and where the return to all these
dimensions of skills is growing over time. The main equation I ask in this paper is
whether there is an alternative but still parsimonious way of describing changes the wage
structure over the last three decades?
       I show that the changes in wage inequality and in the wage structure can indeed
be described in a remarkably simple way. Like Mincer (1998) and Deschênes (2002), I
find that the return to post-secondary education increased sharply while returns to lower
levels of education remained relatively unchanged. Using quantile regressions, I show
that the return to post-secondary education has increased even more in upper quantiles
(like the 90th quantile). The return to post-secondary education has also increased in
lower quantiles (like the 10th), but by a smaller amount than higher up in the distribution.
But other than for this increase in the return to post-secondary education at various
quantiles, the rest of the wage structure has remained remarkably stable over the last
three decades. For instance, the experience-earnings profile, both at the mean and at
various quantiles, has remained essentially unchanged since the early 1970s.
       I then propose a simple explanation for these changes using a standard human
capital model with heterogenous returns in both experience and education. As is well
known in the returns to education literature (e.g. Gary S. Becker, 1967, David Card,
2001), there is not such a thing as a single “return to education”, but rather a distribution
of returns across heterogenous individuals. This model implies that returns to education
at all quantiles are linked, and that groups (like college post-graduates) experiencing
relative increase in average wages should also experience increasing within-group wage
dispersion. I estimate this model using a variance components approach and conclude
that, holding the education and experience distribution for the workforce constant,
increases in the return to post-secondary education accounts for most of the growth in
wage inequality over the last three decades. As in Lemieux (2006a), most of the



                                              2
remaining change in wage inequality is due to composition effects. The increase in the
return to other characteristics (experience, primary and secondary education, and
unobserved characteristics) only accounts for about 10 percent of the growth in wage
inequality.
        The above results are all based on an analysis of hourly wage rates measured
using the May and outgoing rotation group (ORG) supplements of the Current Population
Survey (CPS). I present additional results from the March CPS that also show that
increases in the return to post-secondary education is the most important factor in the
growth in wage inequality since the 1970s.


1. Data and descriptive evidence based on quantile regressions
The empirical analysis is based on data on male hourly wages from the May and ORG
supplements of the CPS. I use these data instead of the commonly used March
supplement of the CPS for reasons discussed in detail in Lemieux (2006a), but also
provide additional evidence from the March CPS in Section 5. I look at long run trends
in wage inequality by comparing the earliest available years of data from the May CPS
(1973-75) to the latest years available in the ORG CPS (2003-2005).1
        Unlike in the ORG and March supplements of the CPS, in the 1973-78 May CPS
wages were not allocated for workers who refused to answer the wage questions. To be
consistent, I only keep workers with non-allocated wages in the 2003-2005 ORG
supplement. Following most of the literature, I trim extreme values of wages (less than
$1 and more than $100 in 1979 $), adjust top-coded earnings by a factor of 1.4, and
weight wage observations by hours of work (in addition to the usual CPS weights). I also
keep workers age 16 to 64 with positive potential experience and recode education into
nine categories that are consistent throughout the 1973-2005 period.2 Pooling three years
of data yields large sample in both the base (65,150 observations in 1973-75) and end
(161,164 observations in 2003-2005) period.

  I only use data for the months of January to October in 2005 since the November and December data had
not been yet been released at the time I wrote this paper.

  Education has to be recoded to remain consistent over time because of major changes in the education
question in the CPS starting in 1992. See Lemieux (2006a) for more details about this and other data
processing.


                                                   3
         Most of the literature has emphasized three key elements of the wage structure:
the return to education, the return to experience, and residual (or within-group) wage
dispersion within narrowly defined education-experience groups. A common way of
summarizing the changes in the first two components is to either present estimates from a
Mincer-type equation, or to report standard wages differentials such as the college-high
school gap and the gap between older and younger workers. Similarly, residual or
within-group inequality can be summarized by various measures of the distribution of
residuals (the variance or the 90-10 gap) for all workers.
         An important shortcoming of these descriptive measures is that they may not
adequately capture long-run changes in wage inequality that appear to be heavily
concentrated in the upper end of the wage distribution (see above). In the case of the
return to education and experience, however, higher growth in wage differentials at high
values of education and experience are easily captured by a flexible function of
experience and education in a standard Mincer-type equation. As it turns out, the Mincer
equation fits both the 1973-75 and 2003-2005 data fairly well provided that a quadratic
(or linear spline) function of years of education is used instead of the traditional linear
specification.3 A useful way of summarizing these changes in the wage structure is to
plot the fitted values of the regression as a function of experience and education in the
base and end period.
         I use quantile regressions to extend this graphical approach and show how within-
group dispersion also depends on experience and education.4 Just like an OLS regression
provides a parsimonious relationship between the conditional mean of wages and
education and experience, quantile regressions show how any conditional quantile
depends on education and experience. For instance, Figures 1 and 2 show the fitted
values from quantile regressions for the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile of (log) wages as
a function of education and experience. Within-group wage dispersion is captured by the
difference between the 90th and the 10th percentile, while the “standard” return to
education and experience is summarize by the fitted values of the median (50th percentile)

3
  Table 1 below shows that this simple model (with a quartic in experience) explains over 97 percent of the
variation in the conditional mean of wages estimated using a highly flexible specification). See Lemieux
(2006b) for more discussion of how well Mincer equation “fits” recent U.S. wage data.

regressions.

regression.5 The explanatory variables used in the quantile regressions in both 1973-75
and 2003-05 are a quadratic function of years of education and a quartic function of years
of potential experience. The results reported in Figures 1 and 2 are normalized relative to
the median wage for an “average” worker (high school graduate with twenty years of
potential experience).
        Figure 1 shows the fitted values of the quantile regressions for 1973-75 and 2003-
05 as a function of years of potential experience. Except for a modest upward shift in the
90th percentile, the figure suggests that both the return to experience (as captured by the
median) and the relationship between wage dispersion and experience have remained
remarkably stable between over the last 30 years. To help interpret the figure, remember
that the base group consists of high school graduates with 20 years of experience. By
definition, the median is normalized at zero in both years for this group. The fact that the
10th percentile is essentially unchanged over time at 20 years of experience means that
the 50-10 gap has not changed for this group between 1973 and 2005. By contrast, there
is a 5 to 10 percentage point increase in the 90th percentile over time, which means that
the 90-50 gap has increased by that magnitude between 1973 and 2005. Since the 90th
percentile shifts up by about 5-10 percentage points for all values of experience while the
curve for the 10th percentile is essentially unchanged, it follows that, for high school
graduates, the 90-50 gap increases by roughly the same amount at all experience levels
while the 50-10 gap is essentially unchanged (at all experience levels). So while Figure 1
suggests that the part of the wage structure linked to experience is very stable over time,
there is also some evidence of increasing inequality in the upper tail of the residual wage
distribution (as in Autor, Katz, and Kearney, 2005).
        A very different picture emerges in Figure 2, which shows the fitted values of the
quantile regressions as a function of years of education. As in Mincer (1998) and
Deschênes (2002), the figure shows that wages have become a much more convex
function of education in 2003-05 than in 1973-75. For example, the conditional median
is essentially a linear function of years of education in 1973-75. Back then, the return to
a year of primary or secondary education was very similar to the return to a year of post-


5
 The fitted values for the median regression are very close to those from a standard OLS regression for
conditional means.


                                                     5
secondary education. By 2003-05, however, the return to post-secondary education is
much higher than the return to elementary and secondary education. In fact, I later show
in Table 1 that the return to post-secondary education almost doubled over time, while
the return at or below high school remained essentially unchanged.
        A second striking feature of Figure 2 is that changes in wage dispersion (the 90-
10 gap) closely mirror the change in the return to education. Just like the median, the 10th
and the 90th percentiles are remarkably stable over time for up to 12 years of education.
Above 12 years of education, however, the return to education at the 90th percentile
increases much more than the return to education at the 10th percentile, leading to a large
increase in the 90-10 gap.
        Another way of summarizing the figure is to say that only workers with post-
secondary education experience a substantial change in their relative wages between
1973 and 2005. Furthermore, among workers with post-secondary education, relative
wage gains are higher for those higher up in the residual distribution. For example,
relative wages of college post-graduates increase by a stunning 51 percentage points at
the 90th percentile, by 39 percentage points at the median, and by 27 percentage points at
the 10th percentile.
        Taken together, Figures 1 and 2 confirm the recent evidence that, far from being
ubiquitous, changes in relative wages are highly concentrated at the top end of the wage
distribution. The figures also add to the existing evidence by highlighting the crucial role
played by post-secondary education in changes in the wage structure. Relative wages are
remarkably stable for workers without post-secondary education, irrespective of their
experience level and of their position in the residual wage distribution. This strongly
contradicts the view that returns to all dimensions of skill have been increasing over time,
and that highly paid workers have experienced large relative wage gains irrespective of
why they are earning high wages. For example, workers with 10 years of education at the
90th percentile of the distribution earned about the same a median college graduates in
1973-75. Between 1997 and 2005, however, the relative wage of median college workers
increased by more than 20 percent, while workers with 10 years of education at the 90th
percentile of the distribution did not experience any relative wage gain.

2. Human capital model with heterogenous returns
The changes in the wage structure documented in Figures 1 and 2 are hard to reconcile
with standard human capital pricing models typically used in the inequality literature. To
see this, consider the (log) wage equation:
       wit = αtai + βtSi + γtXi + eit,                                                 (1)
where ai represents unobserved ability or skills; Si is years of education; Xi is years of
experience; eit is a measurement error. Note that Si and Xi are entered linearly to simplify
the exposition. I replace the linear specification by low order polynomials in the
empirical implementation of the model.
       Holding the distribution of ai, Si, and Xi constant, changes in the wage structure
are driven by changes in the three “price” terms αt, βt, and γt. This simple model is not
consistent with the fact that residual wage dispersion increases at higher values of
education (suggesting that αt is increasing), but does not increase at lower values of
education (suggesting that αt is not increasing). A richer model is clearly required to
capture the changes documented in Figures 1 and 2.
       As it turns out, equation (1) is a popular but highly restrictive version of a human
capital pricing model as it imposes that the return to education (βt) and experience (γt) is
the same for all workers. By contrast, Mincer (1974) argues that returns to potential
experience are higher for individuals who invest more in on-the-job training (OJT) than
for workers who invest less in OJT. Similarly, Becker (1967) develops a human capital
investment model where workers have heterogenous returns to education (and
heterogenous discount rates). The fact that different people face different returns to
education is also front and central in the literature on the estimation of the causal effect of
education on earnings (see, for example, Card, 2001). Incorporating heterogeneity in the
return to experience and education to equation (1) yields the random coefficient model:
       wit = αtai+ (βtbi)Si + (γtci)Xi + eit,                                          (2)
where bi and ci are the person-specific return to education and experience, respectively.
The interesting implication of this model is that an increase in the price of education, βt,
increases both the relative wage of more educated workers and the residual variance due
to the heterogenous return component bi. Consistent with Figure 2, the model also




                                                7
implies that the increase in the residual variance is larger for more- than less-educated
workers.
        To see this, consider the conditional mean and variance of wages under the
assumption that the random effects ai, bi, and ci are uncorrelated and that they have a
mean of one (normalization):
        E(wit | Si, Xi) = αt + βtSi + γtXi,                                                     (3)
        Var(wit | Si, Xi) = αt2σa2 + (βt2σb2)Si2 + (γt2σc2)Xi2 + σt2,                           (4)
where σa2 = Var(ai), σb2 = Var(bi), σc2 = Var(ci), and σt2 = Var(eit). Consider the variance
term linked to education, (βt2σb2)Si2. Since this term depends on education squared, it
follows that 1) the variance should be larger for more- than less-educated workers, and
2) that the variance should increase more for more- than less-educated workers when the
price of education, βt, increases.6
        A related implication of the model is that when the price of experience, γt, is
constant over time, the effect of experience on residual dispersion is also constant since
the variance component (γt2σc2)Xi2 remains unchanged. The fact that wage dispersion
does not increase for less-educated workers also suggest that the return to unobserved
ability, αt, does not change over time.
        In summary, a human capital model with heterogenous returns to education (and
experience) suggests that changes in the price of education can provide a very
parsimonious explanation for the changes in the wage structure since the early 1970s. I
estimate such a model in the next section to test whether changes in the price of
education, and in particular in the price of post-secondary education, account for the bulk
of overall changes in wage inequality between 1973 and 2005.


3. Variance Components Model
Equations (3) and (4) show the implication of the model of equation (2) for the first and
second order conditional moments of wages. This suggests a simple way of estimating
the model using a method-of-moments approach. Intuitively, equation (3) captures the
“between-group” variation of the model. It can be estimated by fitting the predicted


6
 This point is closely related to Mincer (1998) who uses Becker-type model with heterogenous returns to
education to study the sources of change in the variance of wages.


                                                   8
wage, pit, using OLS, where wit = pit + rit, and where rit is the residual. Similarly,
equation (4) captures the “within-group” part of the model and can be estimated by fitting
a regression model to the squared residual, rit2.
        A number of implementation issues have to be addressed before estimating the
model. First, a more flexible specification has to be used to capture the fact that both the
effect of education and experience is non-linear. As in the quantile regression models of
Figures 1 and 2, I use a quadratic specification for education and a quartic specification
for experience. I also present estimates with a linear spline in education that allow for
different returns to education above and below twelve years of education. This yields
the following empirical model:
        pit = αt + β1tSi + β2tSi2 + γ1tXi + γ2tXi2 + γ3tXi3 + γ4tXi4 + uit,                     (5)
        rit2 = αt2σa2 + σb2(β1tSi+β2tSi2) + σc2(γ1tXi+γ2tXi2+γ3tXi3+γ4tXi4) + σt2 + vit, (6)
where uit and vit are two idiosyncratic error components.
        A second implementation issue has to do with dividing the wage into a predicted
and a residual component. I do so using a highly flexible specification in education and
experience.7 Third, I jointly estimate equations (5) and (6) by non–linear least squares
since many of the model parameters are shared by the two equations.
        A final implementation issue has to do with the specification of the “unobserved
ability” component ai. In the simplest version of the model where ai is homoskedastic
(σa2 is the same for all age and education groups), it is not possible to separately identify
changes in the price of unobservables (αt) from changes in the measurement error
variance (σt2). In this simplest version of the model, I thus assume like Juhn, Murphy and
Pierce (1993) that all the residual variation is due to unobserved ability (or skills) and that
there is no measurement error (σt2=0).
        Assuming that unobserved ability is homoskedastic is clearly a strong assumption.
This amounts to forcing all the heteroskedasticity in the model to come through the
heterogenous return components bi and ci. One concern is that this assumption may tend
to overstate the importance of the variance due to these heterogenous return components
through the parameters σb2 and σc2, and understate the importance of the more traditional


7
 As in Lemieux (2006a), I use a regression model with a full set of experience and education dummies,
plus interactions between education dummies and a quartic in experience.


                                                   9
unobserved ability component ai. Indeed, Chay and Lee (2000) use a model in which ai is
heteroskedastic. They also show how the heteroskedasticity can be exploited to
separately estimate changes in the return to unobserved ability (αt) from changes in
(homoskedastic) measurement error (the σt2 term in equation (6)).
         Allowing for arbitrary heteroskedasticity in ai makes it difficult to separately
identify the effect of the heterogenous return components (bi and ci) and of ai on the
overall variance of wages. I thus consider an intermediate case where σa2 is allowed to
depend linearly on experience and education. As in Chay and Lee (2000), it then
becomes possible to separately identify changes in the price of unobservable skills, αt,
from changes in measurement error variance, σt2, once ai is allowed to depend on
education and experience.8 I thus present results both with and without the measurement
error variance term to probe the robustness of the main estimates.


4. Estimates of the Model and Decomposition of Changes in Wage Inequality
Table 1 shows estimates from three versions of the model. All models include a quartic
function of experience but the estimates change very little over time and are not reported
in the table. Note also that education is normalized to be zero at seven years of
education, which is set as the “base” level of education, since only few people have not
completed this level of education, even in 1973-75. This normalization is not innocuous
in interpreting the results since education is interacted with several other terms in
equations (5) and (6).
         The more restricted version of the model where ai is constrained to be
homoskedastic is reported in column 1. As expected, the effect of education is much
more convex in 2003-05 then in 1973-75. While the quadratic term is positive and
significant in both years because of large sample sizes, convexity is economically
negligible in 1973-75. For instance, the 1973-75 estimates imply that the return to
education at 12 years of schooling is 0.068, compared to 0.070 at 16 years of education.
By contrast, the 2003-05 estimates imply that the return to education at 12 years of
schooling is 0.080, compared to 0.100 at 16 years of education.

8
  Intuitively, changes in αt can be recovered by looking at changes in the linear effect of education and
experience in an extended version of equation (6), while changes in σt2 can be identified from changes in
the intercept.


                                                    10
         The estimates of all three variance components are large and statistically
significant, suggesting that both the traditional unobserved ability term ai and the
heterogenous returns bi and ci are important determinants of wage inequality. Since the
variance of bi and ci are interacted with education, experience, and the return to these two
variables, it is difficult to assess the precise contribution of each component to the growth
in wage inequality. I return to this issue below by presenting a detailed decomposition of
the sources of change in wage inequality.
         It is nonetheless clear from the results that the traditional return to unobserved
ability, αt, plays little role in the growth in wage inequality. In fact, column 1 shows that
αt slightly declines from its normalized value of 1 in 1973-75 to 0.97 in 2003-2005. This
finding is not very surprising in light of Figure 2, which shows that residual dispersion
(the 90-10 gap in the figure) declines slightly over time for workers with very low levels
of education. Intuitively, the way the model “fits” the data of Figure 2 is by letting the
component αt2σa2 capture the decline in residual dispersion at low values of education,
while letting the component σb2(β1tSi+β2tSi2) capture the strong growth in residual
dispersion at higher values of education. Intuitively, β1t and β2t are identified from the
conditional mean model (equation (5)). The estimate of σb2 is then chosen in a way that
explains well the differential growth in residual dispersion by education level. If residual
dispersion did not move in tandem with the return to education, the model would tend to
set σb2 to zero. This would happen, for example, if residual dispersion was growing at
the same pace at all education levels.
         Column 2 shows what happens when the variance of unobserved ability is
allowed to linearly depend on education and experience. Not surprisingly, allowing for
this more general specification tends to reduce the importance of heterogenous returns to
education and experience (lower variances of σb2 and σc2), which are no longer the sole
source of heteroskedasticity in the model. Most of the other estimates are relatively
unchanged, except for the return to unobserved ability αt, which now increases over time,
but not significantly so.9

  Note that σa2 is also smaller because it now represents the variance of unobserved ability for a base
worker with 7 years of education and no experience. The effect of education on the variance is 0.015
(standard error of 0.001) and the effect of experience is 0.0009 (standard error of 0.0001). This means that


                                                     11
        The last row of the table indicate that the simple “Mincer-style” model for
conditional means with quadratic education and quartic experience fits the data very well
and explains 98 percent of the total between-group variance. A very similar fit is
obtained using the alternative specification of column 3 where a linear spline model is
used for education instead of a quadratic function. The main advantage of the spline is
that the estimated coefficients are more easily interpretable. For instance, column 3
shows that the return to a year of primary and secondary education in 1973-75 was 0.066,
while the return to post-secondary education was only 0.007 higher. By 2003-05,
however, the return to post-secondary education is twice as large (0.069+0.065=0.134) as
the return to primary and secondary education (0.069). Since the spline model is more
easily interpretable and provides a similar fit than the quadratic model, I use this model to
present a detailed decomposition of the sources of change in the variance of wages
between 1973 and 2005.
        Table 2 presents the decomposition. The table shows the respective contribution
of price effects (the set of αt, βt, and γt parameters in equations (5) and (6)) and
composition effects to the change in the between-group, within-group, and total variance.
The price effects are simply computed by replacing the base period coefficients by the
end period coefficients. Take, for example, the case of experience. The experience price
effect in Table 2 shows by how much the base period variance is changed when the set of
base period coefficients (γ1t, γ2t, γ3t, and γ4t for t=1973-75) are replaced by the end period
coefficients (γ1t, γ2t, γ3t, and γ4t for t=2003-05). Since the between-group variance is
Var(pit) while the within-group variance is E(rit2), it is straightforward to compute the
counterfactual variances by “plugging-in” different parameters into equations (5) and (6),
and recomputing the between- and within-group variances accordingly.
        In addition to price effects, the variance may also be changing because of changes
in the distribution of education and experience of the workforce. Replacing all the base
period parameters by their end period counterpart yields the variance of wages that would
have prevailed in 1973-75 if the wage structure had been as in 2003-05. Remaining




the variance of unobserved ability for an “average” worker with 12 years of schooling and 20 years of
experience is 0.140, which exceed the 0.087 estimate of column 1.


                                                   12
differences relative to the actual 2003-05 variance are thus due to changes in the
distribution of education and experience, i.e. to composition effects.
        Consistent with the existing literature, Table 2 shows a large increase in the
variance of wages over time. As a benchmark, the total variance was about 0.25 in 1973-
75. As shown in the last row of the table, the 0.108 change thus represents an increase of
more than 40 percent in the variance of wages. While both the between- and within-
group component increased over time, most of the growth is due to the between group
component that almost doubled between 1973 and 2005. Furthermore, column 1 shows
that almost all the increase in the between-group variance is due to the dramatic increase
in the return to post-secondary education documented in Figure 2 and Table 1. By
contrast, changes in the return to experience and primary and secondary education play a
negligible role in the growth in the between-group variance. The only other noticeable
factor is composition effects that account for 15 percent of the growth in the between-
group variance.
        While the growth in the between-group variance is mostly due to price effects
(growing return to post-secondary education), composition effects account for more than
two thirds of the growth in the within-group variance. This finding is very similar to
Lemieux (2006a) who also find large composition effects using a very different
decomposition procedure. Composition effects are due to the fact that both the level of
education and experience has been growing over time. Since within-group dispersion is
much larger at higher than lower levels of education, the secular growth in education has
resulted in a large spurious growth in the residual, or within-group, variance over time.10
         Leaving composition effects aside, a very large fraction of the increase in both
the between- and within-group variance is linked to increases in the return to post-
secondary education. Even in the case of the within-group component, two-thirds (20 out
of 32 percentage points) of the growth in the variance is due to the increase in the return
to post-secondary education. Remember from equation (2) that the heterogenous return
10
  Since education has a larger effect on the within-group variance in 2003-05 than in 1973-75, composition
effects are larger when applied to the 2003-05 wage structure (as is done in Table 2) than when applied to
the 1973-75 wage structure. Performing this alternative decomposition reduces composition effects from
15 percent to -6 percent for the between-group component, and from 68 to 52 percent for the within-group
component. This decline is essentially all offset by a larger contribution of the price of post-secondary
education that now accounts for 97 percent of the growth in the within-group variance, 34 percent of the
growth in the within-group variance, and 70 percent of the growth in the total variance!


                                                   13
component bi multiplies the “price” of education βt. This means that when βt doubles
over time (as it does for post-secondary education), individuals with a return to education
of 5 percent in the base period now face a 10 percent return, while individuals with a 10
percent return in the base period now face a 20 percent return. As a result, wage
dispersion among people with different returns increases over time. The decomposition
results suggests that this is the leading channel for the growth in within-group inequality,
as opposed to the traditional “unobserved ability” channel where within-group inequality
increases for all groups, irrespective of their levels of education.
        As discussed earlier, the multiplicative feature that drives this result comes
naturally from a human capital model with heterogenous returns to education. The
multiplicative feature also comes naturally in an efficiency-unit model of education
where bi captures differences in school quality and where the overall schooling input is
equal to biSi. If individuals who went to a good college experience a twice as large return
to education than individuals who went to a bad college, it is natural to expect that the
return will remain twice as large when overall returns to college double. In this setting,
within-group inequality increases among college graduates because college quality, just
like college education per se, is now more highly valued in the labor market. This
provides a simple intuition for why the standard return to college and wage dispersion
among college graduates should move in tandem, as they do in Figure 2 and in the
models estimated in Table 1.


5. Comparison with the March CPS
The above results are all based on an analysis of hourly wage rates from the May and
ORG supplements of the CPS. Lemieux (2006a) and Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2005)
show, however, that within-group wage dispersion grows more in the March than in the
May/ORG CPS. Despite these differences, Figure 3 shows that the quantile regressions
for the March CPS look qualitatively similar to those for the May/ORG CPS reported in
Figure 2.11 As in the case of the May/ORG CPS, the striking feature of Figure 3 is the
dominant contribution of post-secondary education to changes in the structure of wages.


11
  The data use are the March 1976, 2004 and 2005 CPS for the earning years 1975, 2003, and 2005. The
data were processed in the same way as in Lemieux (2006a).


                                                 14
Relative to the May/ORG CPS, however, there is also a noticeable increase in within
group dispersion (the 90-10 gap here) even for workers with a high school diploma or
less. As a result, a formal decomposition like the one carried through in Table 2 gives a
more important role to increases in the “standard” price of unobserved ability. Overall,
changes in the return to post-secondary education nonetheless remain the most important
factor in changes in the variance of wages.12
         Reconciling differences between the May/ORG and March CPS is explored in
detail in Lemieux (2006a) who shows that wages are more precisely measured in the
May/ORG CPS because it asks the hourly wage directly to workers paid by the hour
(most of the workforce). It is more difficult to understand, however, why inequality
grows more in the March CPS, though Lemieux (2006a) argues that changes in
measurement error in the March CPS are a likely culprit.13
         Remember from Section 3 that it is possible, in principle, to estimate changes in
measurement error separately from changes in the return to unobserved ability. Estimates
from this richer model are quite imprecise but nonetheless indicate that the variance of
measurement error increased by 0.019 in the March CPS (standard error of 0.011) but
decreased in the May/ORG CPS by 0.025 (standard error of 0.006). Taking these results
at face value suggest that, because of changing measurement error, the growth in within-
group inequality is understated by about the same amount in the May/ORG CPS as it is
overstated in the March CPS. So while the contribution of increases in the price of
unobserved ability may be a bit understated in the May/ORG CPS, the conclusion that
increases in the return to post-secondary education accounts for the bulk of the increase
in wage inequality remains very robust.


6. Concluding Comments
Descriptive evidence from quantile regressions and more “structural” estimates from a
human capital model with heterogenous returns both suggest that most of the increase in
wage inequality between 1973 and 2003 is due to a dramatic increase in the return to


12
   Compared with column 3 of Table 3, the contribution of the return to post-secondary education drops
from 54 to 44 percent while the contribution of the price of unobservables increase from 4 to 38 percent.
The role of composition effects also declines from 37 to 20 percent.
13
   This conclusion is challenged by Autor, Katz and Kearney (2005).


                                                    15
post-secondary education. The human capital model with heterogenous returns also helps
explain why both the relative wages and the within-group dispersion among highly-
educated workers have increased in tandem over time.
       These findings add to the growing evidence that, far from being ubiquitous,
changes in wage inequality are increasingly concentrated in the very top end of the wage
distribution. The paper adds to this growing literature by showing that post-secondary
education plays a crucial role in explaining this phenomenon. By contrast, labor market
experience, primary and secondary education, and the position of workers without post-
secondary education in the wage distribution play very little role in explaining changes in
the wage structure over the last 35 years. The human capital model with heterogenous
returns provides a possible channel for understanding these dramatic changes. It remains
to be understood, however, why post-secondary education, as opposed other observed or
unobserved measures of skills, plays such a dominant role in changes in wage inequality.
In a standard demand and supply model, this suggests that, for some reason, the relative
demand for post-secondary education has increased dramatically over time, while the
demand for other dimensions of skills hardly changed at all. Understanding why this is
the case should be an important topic for future research
