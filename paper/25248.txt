                                         ABSTRACT

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect in the European Union in May
2018. We study its short-run impact on investment in new and emerging technology firms. Our
findings indicate negative post-GDPR eff˙ects on EU ventures, relative to their US counterparts.
The negative effects manifest in the overall dollar amounts raised across funding deals, the
number of deals, and the dollar amount raised per individual deal.

1     Introduction

The rise of big data in the global economy has transformed marketplaces, altering the ways
in which firms and consumers interact. Individuals are no longer mere consumers of goods,
information and services, but public producers of often valuable data. These data have
become key inputs in technology-driven innovation, spanning industry sectors from health,
advertising, and security, to e-commerce, transportation, and banking. These data are also
key inputs in the matching processes among consumers and firms, as well as between firms
and other firms. For individual firms, data is a valuable asset to monetize, especially if
the data is personally-identifiable, real-time and of high-frequency. Individuals’ traits and
attributes, their behaviors and online footprints, their comments and photos, their work and
leisure habits, and more, are increasingly regarded as business assets that can be used to
target services or offers, to provide relevant advertising, financial offerings, and healthcare,
or to trade with other parties.
    In an effort to leverage the value inherent in the data created by individuals, new services,
companies, and markets are emerging. The services, tools, and products being made possible
by the increased availability of data are bearing benefits for data subjects and data holders
alike. These benefits include tailor-made recommendations, digital personal assistants, new
products and offerings, and easy access to previously thin or unavailable markets. The
Federal Trade Commission’s 2016 report on big data (FTC, 2016) highlights a number of
benefits to underserved populations, including increased educational attainment, access to
credit through non-traditional methods, specialized health care for underserved communities,
and better access to employment.
    Despite those benefits, public concerns over the use of personal data have increased.
Recent Pew surveys find that 91% of respondents believe they have lost control over how
personal information is collected and used, 61% would like to do more to protect their privacy,
and 66% said current laws are insufficient for protecting their privacy and would support



                                                2
more regulation.1 These concerns are amplified by recent incidences of data breaches and
data misuses, and a lack of regulatory actions after these scandals.
      Those concerns are not without merit. The Commission’s earlier report (FTC, 2014)
indicates that data brokers collect and store billions of data elements covering nearly every
U.S. consumer, with one data broker holding information on more than 1.4 billion consumer
transactions and 700 billion data elements, while another broker added more than 3 billion
new data points to its database each month. Another report found that 95% of the top 200
free iOS and Android apps exhibit at least one risky behavior including location tracking,
access to social networks, and disclosing the user’s personally identifiable information.2 The
FTC’s 2016 report also highlights possible risks that could result from biases or inaccuracies
about certain groups, including more individuals mistakenly denied opportunities based on
the actions of others, sensitive information being exposed, existing disparities being rein-
forced, increased targeting of vulnerable consumers for reasons such as fraud, an increase in
prices for goods and services in lower-income communities, and the weakening of consumer
choice.
      Against this backdrop, the General Data Protection Regulation was adopted in the Eu-
ropean Union on April 14, 2016, becoming enforceable two years later on May 25, 2018.
The regulation aims to protect data by ‘design and default,’ wherein firms are obligated
to handle data according to a set of principles and safeguards. GDPR mandates a higher
degree of privacy, data management, and control, requires informed opt-in consent for data
collection, and assigns substantial liability risks and penalties for data flow and data process-
ing violations. Under the regulation, firms that process personal information must develop
protocols to respond to individual data requests within a month, appoint a data protection
officer to oversee compliance activities, audit internal data processes, and take proactive

steps to anonymize and secure personal data and minimize its collection. In the event of
a data breach, organizations must promptly notify the regulator and affected individuals.
The regulation requires that users have the rights to access, correct, and erase their personal
data, and imposes fines up to 4% of global revenue for any violation.3
       The enactment of GDPR is particularly likely to influence technology firms, given an ever
increasing need for the use of data as a core product input. This study presents an analysis
of the impact of the rollout of GDPR on new technology venture investment in the EU.
Our findings indicate a negative differential effect on EU ventures after the rollout of GDPR
relative to their US counterparts. These negative effects manifest in the overall number of
financing rounds, the overall dollar amount raised across rounds, and in the dollar amount
raised per individual round. Specifically, our findings suggest a $3.38 million decrease in the
aggregate dollars raised by EU ventures per state per crude industry category per week, a
17.6% reduction in the number of weekly venture deals, and a 39.6% decrease in the amount
raised in an average deal following the rollout of GDPR.
       We then proceed to break down these effects by two crude industry categories and four
firm age groups. Somewhat surprisingly, we do not identify particularly different effects for
ventures that fall under the healthcare-financial category, despite the existence of arguably
stringent regulations that govern data flows in those industries in the US. However, we
do find that the negative effects of GDPR on technology investment appear particularly
pervasive for nascent, 0-3 year old ventures. We use our results to provide a back-of-the-
envelope calculation of a range of job losses that may be incurred by these ventures, which
we estimate to be between 3,604 to 29,819 jobs, corresponding to 4.09 to 11.20% jobs created
   3
     On June 28, 2018, California adopted a data regulation law (the California Consumer Privacy Act of
2018, A.B. 375) that is set to take effect on January 1 2020. The law, as currently written, would require that
firms provide consumers with the ability to port their profiles to other providers, be informed about what
personal data are stored about them, why they are collected, request their deletion, and opt out of their sale.
The legislation is still subject to amendments, and it is widely understood that the version that was passed
is highly likely to change based on input from stakeholders before its implementation in 2020. On November
1, 2018, Senator Ron Wyden’s office began circulating a discussion draft of a bill tentatively-named the
“Consumer Data Protection Act,” which aims to introduce similar and other protections at the federal level.

1.1       Literature Review

The literature that examines the implications of data policies and data regulation is growing
(Acquisti et al., 2016, offer a recent survey). Goldfarb and Tucker (2011, 2012) examine the
effects of the implementation of the EU Privacy Directive and find some evidence that after
the Privacy Directive was passed, advertising effectiveness decreased significantly. They
argue that digitization means that privacy policy is now a part of innovation policy, an
assertion that is in line with our analysis. More recently, Goldberg et al. (2018) examine the
impact of the GDPR on online web traffic, sales, and third-party tracking. Using proprietary
datasets, they show that for EU firms, recorded pageviews fall by 7.5%, recorded conversions
fall 12.5%, and third-party tracking falls 6.2% after the rollout of GDPR.4 They demonstrate
that beliefs about local regulatory strictness plays a factor in firms’ reactions. Their results
are complementary to our findings. In particular, while their focus is on the health and
regulatory compliance of both online publishers and e-commerce sites, our focus is on the
broader tradeoff between innovation and data regulation, for which specific considerations
such as ad tracking are one of many data monetization components. Moreover, rather than
focus on existing firms, our study focuses on emerging ventures that are typically much
smaller.
       In this regard, our analysis more closely maps the theoretical works of Krasteva et
al. (2015) and Campbell et al. (2015), who show that compliance costs and data regula-
tion, respectively, can create barriers to entry and may thus hurt innovation. In particular,
Campbell et al. (2015) show that though privacy regulation imposes costs on all firms, it
is small firms and new firms that are most adversely affected, particularly for goods where
   4
    In a related paper, Tucker (2014) uses a randomized field experiment to show that users are more likely
to click on personalized ads once they are given more control over their personally identifiable information,
a change that was only driven by the change of user perception of privacy control, as the website did not
change how advertisers used data to target and personalize ads.



                                                     5
the price mechanism does not mediate the effect, such as the advertising-supported internet.
Krasteva et al. (2015) show that as the costs of compliance by small firms increase, more
innovations will be developed within established firms.5
       As far as health-related data regulation, using variations in state medical privacy laws,
Miller and Tucker (2009, 2011) show that privacy regulations restricting a hospital’s release
of patient information significantly reduced the adoption of electronic medical records. This
reduction is costly, as a 10 percent increase in the adoption of such systems can reduce
infant mortality by 16 deaths per 100,000 births. A related issue is an insurer’s access to
information about a person’s genetic test results and subsequent price discrimination. In
the US, most states have banned the use of genetic information by health insurers; however,
some theoretical results show that inefficiencies may arise when test information is private
relative to when it is public (Hoel and Iversen, 2002), and some empirical findings identify
relationships among how consumers are informed, the control they have over their private
information, and whether consumers elect to partake in genetic testing and share their
information with providers (Miller and Tucker, 2017).
       Data regulation has also been studied in financial markets. Kim and Wagman (2015)
theoretically show that an opt-in approach for information trade in financial markets can lead
to higher prices, and empirically demonstrate their results in the market for mortgages, with
indications of higher mortgage rates, lower mortgage underwriting standards, and potential
downstream foreclosures. Pagano and Jappelli (1993, 2002) predict that if banks share
information about their customers, they would increase lending to safe borrowers, thereby
decreasing default rates. Other studies focus on the effects of credit bureaus and creditor
rights using data from a cross-section of countries (see, e.g., Djankov et al. 2007; Qian
and Strahan 2007). Hertzberg et al. (2011) and Doblas-Madrid and Minetti (2013) analyze
micro data to show that the effect of lenders’ information sharing is to reduce incidence of
   5
    While one may argue that higher compliance costs may have a positive effect on innovation (e.g., Porter,
1991), Jaffe and Palmer (1997) find little evidence that industries’ inventive output (as measured by patent
applications) is related to compliance costs.


                                                     6
delinquencies and defaults, but lenders may reduce credit in anticipation of other lenders’
reaction to negative news.
        The aforementioned works largely examine a specific aspect or implication of data regu-
lation, such as advertising, pricing, defaults in financial markets, and the impact on medical
effectiveness. Our work is complementary, in that our analysis centers around the effect of
data regulation on technology ventures and the nascent firms that data regulation is most
likely to affect. We demonstrate that younger firms are particularly susceptible to the con-
sequences of data regulation. Our findings are thus in line with Kortum and Lerner (2000)
who show that the industrial innovations that venture capitalists help facilitate is a multiple
of the ratio of venture capital to R&D expenditures, as well as with Kerr et al. (2014), who
suggest that the bundle of inputs that angel investors provide have a large and significant
impact on the success and survival of new ventures.
        The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data and Section
3 presents the overall empirical approach. Section 4 provides results at the aggregate level,
and Section 5 gives sub-sample results broken down by crude industry category and firm
age. Section 6 discusses implications for employment and Section 7 concludes.



2         Data

Our primary data source is Crunchbase, a platform for tracking information about technology
businesses, particularly nascent ventures.6 We collect data on all technology-venture related
activity in the EU and US from July 2017 to September 2018, including the parameters of
venture financing rounds, such as venture information (name, location, operating category,
founding date, financing dates, and a range on the number of employees) and funding infor-
mation (the size of the funding round in USD, the date each round was announced, the type
of financing round such as seed, Series A, Series B, and the number, names, locations, and
    6

                                                   7
types of the participating investors). Each venture in the dataset is also tagged with a few
relevant product keywords (e.g., ‘software’, ‘e-commerce’, ‘finance’, etc).
       We treat each funding round observed as a ‘deal’ event, tallying deals per week in each
crude industry category and in each US state or EU member state (henceforth, state).7 Since
each deal is tagged with product keywords, we further group ventures into either healthcare-
financial or other technology. We choose to group the data into these two crude categories,
partly because healthcare and finance are subject to industry-specific regulations in the
US,8 thus comparing them against other technology firms allows us to detect a potentially
differential effect of GDPR on healthcare-financial firms. Another reason is that the industry
mix of ventures varies greatly across states, but every state has at least one deal in each of
the two crude categories throughout the sample. Hence, the two-category grouping helps us
construct a balanced sample at the aggregate level by week, state and category. We further
collect local macroeconomic controls such as unemployment rate, CPI, interest rate, and
GDP, for each state in which a venture is located.9
       Table 1 reports the summary statistics at the aggregate level in the EU and US. Panel
A indicates that our sample comprises 24 EU member states. On average, both the weekly
dollar amount raised (in millions) and the number of deals per state per category are similar
between the EU and US. Panel B reports summary statistics for each of the two categories
we track. Figure 1 depicts weekly trends for the number of deals and dollar amount raised
for the EU and US. From both the aggregate and average aspects, there are no noticeable
differential trends in the EU and US.
   7
      Despite Brexit, we include Great Britain as part of the treatment group due to its adoption of a GDPR-
like regulation in the same time frame as the rest of the EU, and due to the fact that it is still bound
by GDPR during our sample. In addition, the few observations we have for Bulgaria, Cyprus, Malta, and
Lithuania are removed because some macroeconomic variables were not available for those member states at
monthly frequencies.
    8
      In the US, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) governs data collection,
data use and data security for health care, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley (GLB) Act governs similar issues
for finance.
    9
      For a few months in 2018 for which macroeconomic data was yet available (August and September for
CPI and unemployment; July through September for GDP), we extrapolated macroeconomic variables by
using their corresponding growth averages from 2017 and 2016.



                                                     8
       At the individual-deal level, we remove observations with missing dollar amounts or
missing funding types (e.g., ‘angel’, ‘seed’, ‘Series A’, etc).10 We calculate a venture’s time-
variant age based on its founding date.11 We consider four different age categories: new firms
(0-3 years old), young firms (3-6 years old), established firms (6-9 years old), and mature
firms (9+ years old). Firms may consequently switch between age categories in our sample.
We also group deals, based on their funding type group, into three unique funding stages of
pre-stage, main-stage, and late stage.12
       Summary statistics at the deal level are also in Table 1. Panel C of the table indicates
that the average dollar amount raised per deal is similar (about $22 million) in the EU and
US in our sample. Its distribution is highly skewed in both the EU and US, with the median
dollar amount raised per deal ($1.42 million for the EU and $3 million for the US) much
lower than the average. The average firm age is about 3 years in both the EU and US when
excluding mature (9+ year old) firms. Category-specific deal-level summary statistics are
presented in Panel D, where it can be seen that the average funding size for a healthcare-
financial venture is larger in the EU than in the US. Panel E suggests that most funding
deals take place in either the pre-stage or in the main stage. Panel F provides information
about the distribution of firm ages in our dataset. While they are similar, the US has a
larger proportion of 9+ year old firms. The EU, in contrast, has a larger proportion of firms
in the 0-3 and 3-6 age groups, firms which may be particularly susceptible to an increase in
the costs of compliance. Of particular interest is the fact that close to 70% of technology
ventures in the EU and US in our sample are relatively young, 0-6 year old ventures. It is
  10
     There are 21,726 deal observations in the overall sample. Of those, 4,358 observations are missing
dollar amounts and an additional 175 observations are missing funding types, which together amount to
about 20% of the overall sample. Dollar-amount specifications thus use 17,192 observations; number-of-deals
specifications use the full sample comprising 21,726 observations.
  11
     There are some cases where a founding date is unavailable or when a venture’s first financing round
predates its founding; in those cases, we use the venture’s first financing round as its founding date.
  12
     Specifically, we group angel, seed, pre-seed, convertible note, and product crowdfunding into pre-stage,
we group series A, B, C, bridge series A-B, initial coin offering, and equity crowdfunding into the main stage,
and we group series D and later, private equity, debt financing, and other post IPO activities into the late
stage. The precise grouping of funding types does not change the nature of the results.




                                                      9
also apparent that the older the firm, the higher the average dollar amount raised per deal.



3        Empirical Approach

We aim to study the effects of the rollout of GDPR in May 2018 on venture financing in the
EU. We do so by contrasting venture activity in the EU with the US before and after the
rollout of GDPR. While GDPR was enacted in April 2016, its enforceability began to take
hold in May 2018, with mandatory implementation by EU member states and mandatory
compliance by firms. Our hypothesis is that as GDPR’s enforceability came into place,
entrepreneurs and investors both realized the actual compliance and implementation costs,
as well as the ex-post implications of GDPR. This is particularly evident in the month
immediately before the GDPR effective date, as major platforms like Google, Facebook,
Amazon, and Apple, on which a vast number of technology ventures rely, began to reveal
the ways in which they were tightening their platforms and app stores with new data sharing,
data portability, and data liability rules.13
       We test the effect of GDPR using a difference-in-differences methodology (DID). We carry
out the empirical analysis at two levels. At the aggregate level, each observation is defined by
week-state-category, while the dependent variables are either the total dollar amount raised
across all deals in that week-state-category, or the number of deals reached in that week-state-
category. Both could be zero if no venture in the state had any deal in that week-category.
At the deal level, the sample includes every deal that has non-missing amount raised and
  13
    Examples include SafeDK in 1/25/18 documenting that more than half of mobile applications are
not GDPR ready (https://www.mobilemarketer.com/news/study-55-of-apps-may-not-meet-gdpr-privacy-
standards/515546/), and numerous examples from May 2018. Those include Apple reportedly removing
apps that share location data (https://www.idownloadblog.com/2018/05/09/apple-removing-apps-location-
data/) and updating its privacy terms (https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/23/apple-introduces-new-privacy-
portal-to-comply-with-gdpr/), Facebook announcing that “Businesses may want to implement code that
creates a banner and requires affirmative consent? Each company is responsible for ensuring their own compli-
ance” (https://developers.facebook.com/ads/blog/post/2018/05/10/compliance-protections-gdpr/), Shopify
updating its app permissions for merchants and developers (https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/gdpr-
compliance), Google releasing new consent requirements to developers (https://bit.ly/2ziUgJA), all shortly
before GDPR took effect on May 25, 2018.



                                                     10
non-missing funding types. By definition, the dependent variable (amount raised per deal)
is always positive. Since both levels of analysis use samples derived from the same raw
data, we consider the total dollar amount raised per week-state-category an overall metric
of venture investment, which encompasses an extensive margin (total number of deals per
week-state-category) and an intensive margin (amount raised per deal conditional on having
reached a deal).
   Our treatment group comprises EU ventures and our control group comprises US ven-
tures. While the treatment group does have lower levels of venture activity than the control
group, there does not appear to be a differential pre-trend that would violate the common
trend assumption in our DID analysis. At the aggregate level, Figure 1 depicts trend lines
of the weekly total amount raised in the EU and the US, the weekly total number of deals
in the EU and the US, the average amount raised per week-state-category, and the average
total number of deals per week-state-category from July 2017 to September 2018. All four
subfigures suggest that some sustained divergence took place between EU and US ventures
around the time that GDPR came into effect. Both EU and US trends also track each other
closely otherwise, and particularly so up until May 2018. At the deal level, Figure 2 confirms
that there are no differential trends between the EU and US in the frequency of deals or in
the average dollar amount raised per deal.
   For aggregate-level analysis, the specification is given by:


                       ysct = αs + αc + αt + δXst + βGDP Rsct + εsct,


where s denotes state, c denotes category, t indexes week, GDP Rsct indicates whether the
state s is located in the treatment group (EU) and subject to GDPR at time t. Ysct is the
dependent variable of interest, which is either the total dollar amount raised or the number
of financing deals in each week-state-category. Week, state and category fixed effects are
denoted by αt , αs and αc , respectively, whereas Xst are state-specific macroeconomic control


                                              11
variables (monthly unemployment rate, CPI, interest rate, and quarterly GDP), and εsct is an
error term. We use a Tobit specification censored at 0 for dollar amount regressions because
we only observe deals that go through. We use a Poisson specification for the number of deals
regressions due to a relatively large number of zeroes at the week-category-state observation
level. In all cases, we obtain similar results with OLS.
       At the aggregate level, the coefficient β captures the effect of GDPR across both cate-
gories. Standard errors are clustered at the state level, because the GDPR requires state-
specific enforcement and the heterogeneity is confirmed in market perception.14
       Figure 3 depicts coefficient plots of the monthly pre-treatment tests for the number of
deals and dollar amount raised using Poisson and Tobit specifications, respectively. To per-
form pre-treatment tests, we run the same specification for the pre-GDPR data, including a
full set of interactions between the dummy of EU and each monthly dummy. The coefficients
of these interactions are shown in the figures, along with their confidence intervals. Figure
3(a) shows that there is no pre-existing differential trend between the EU and US in the
number of deals before May 25, 2018, confirming the observable trends in Figures 1(a) and
1(c). Figure 3(b) suggests there is no pre-existing differential trend between the EU and US
in the aggregate dollar amount raised per week before April 30, 2018. It is possible that
due to some of the major platforms announcing their data-related policy changes in early
May 2018, some market movement may have taken place earlier than May 25. As robust-
ness checks, we report the results excluding May 2018 and they are largely unchanged. For
heterogeneous effects by category, we apply the same specification to healthcare-financial
  14
    Despite GDPR applying to all EU countries, the policy change is at the state level. This follows from
the definition of the ‘lead supervisory authority,’ which has the “primary responsibility for dealing with
a cross-border data processing activity, for example when a data subject makes a complaint about the
processing of his or her personal data.” The location of the lead supervisory authority is based on a firm’s
main establishment location. Recital 127 further states that: “Each supervisory authority not acting as the
lead supervisory authority should be competent to handle local cases where the controller or processor is
established in more than one Member State, but the subject matter of the specific processing concerns only
processing carried out in a single Member State and involves only data subjects in that single Member State.”
Goldberg et al. (2018) additionally demonstrate that GDPR suffers from implementation heterogeneity across
EU countries, heterogeneity that lines up with traditional member state enforcement behaviors.

and other technology separately. For heterogeneous effects by firm age, we reorganize the
aggregate data by week, state and firm age (0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9+). We then apply the same
specification to each group of firm age separately.
       For each aggregate-level regression, we perform pre-treatment tests by quarter. To con-
duct such tests, we run the same specification using pre-GDPR data only, include interactions
between the EU dummy and quarterly dummies (2017Q4, 2018Q1, 2018Q2 while 2017Q3 is
the default), and test whether the coefficients of these pre-treatment interactions are jointly
zero.15 The test-statistics is never significant above the 90% confidence level. In few cases,
the pre-treatment test gets close to be significant at the 85-90% level, mostly because the
negative effect of GDPR started to appear a few weeks before May 25, similar to what we
have shown in Figure 3(b). For this reason, the reported estimate of β is likely a conservative
estimate of the true effect.
       At the deal level, we use the specification:


                       ln(yjsct ) = αs + αc + αt + δXjsct + βGDP Rjsct + εjsct,


where j identifies deals according to their assigned unique identifier, the dependent variable
ln(yjsct ) is log of the dollar amount raised in deal j, Xjsct denotes deal-level variables such as
funding type, investor type, and firm age, αt , αs , and αc are week, state and category fixed
effects, GDP Rjsct is a dummy variable that equals one after May 25, 2018 if applicable to
deal j in state s and zero otherwise, and εjsct is an error term. We use the log of the amount
raised per deal because the amount raised is always positive but its distribution is highly
skewed. As a robustness check, we also report results that top-code the amount raised at the
95 percentile of the sample. The same specifications apply to the subsamples by category
and by firm age. In all regressions, we cluster the error term by state.
  15
    We test quarterly instead of monthly or weekly interactions because the more we zoom in a particular
subsample, the more spontaneity there is in a short time window. Quarterly gives us a reasonable time frame
to average over these idiosyncrasies, across all types of samples.

4     Overall Effects of GDPR

We begin by examining how the aggregate weekly dollar amount for each state in each
category changes from the pre to the post period of the implementation of GDPR. Column 1
of Table 2 reports the results of our baseline specification. We focus on the marginal effects
computed from the estimated coefficients of GDPR according to the Tobit specification.
It can be seen that on average, each category in each EU state incurs a $13.90 million
decrease after the rollout of GDPR. In Column 2, we right censor the weekly aggregate
dollar amount at the 95-percentile value ($175 million) to reduce the influence of outliers.
Column 2 suggests that each category in each EU state, after top coding, experiences a $3.38
million decrease following the rollout of GDPR. The effects do not change when adding a
linear trend (column 3 of Table 2).
    As previously indicated, our pre-treatment tests suggest that the effect of GDPR’s rollout
on EU ventures may have started earlier in May. Column 4 demonstrates that when May
is excluded, the estimated effect is even stronger, suggesting a $4.49 million decrease in the
aggregate dollar amount per state per category after the rollout of GDPR. Using an OLS
specification, Column 5 indicates that the aggregate dollar amount for each state in each
category faces a 26.5% decrease after the rollout of GDPR. This marginal effect on dollar
amount is computed from the estimated coefficient of GDPR, accounting for the fact that
the dependent variable is log of one plus the dollar amount.
    The aggregate dollar amount estimation combines extensive margin (number of deals)
and intensive margin (dollars raised per deal) effects. To decompose them, we estimate
the effect of GDPR’s rollout on the number of deals per week-state-category, and on the
dollar amount per deal. Since the number of deals per week-state-category is an integer
count (including zero) but the dollar amount per deal is always positive, we use a Poisson
specification for the former (at the aggregate level) and the log linear specification for the
latter (at the deal level).



                                              14
    Table 3 reports the effect of GDPR’s rollout on the aggregate number of deals. We focus
on the marginal effects computed from the estimated coefficients of GDPR according to the
Poisson specification. Our baseline model suggests a 17.6% decrease in the number of EU
venture deals. Column 2 adds a linear trend to the baseline specification, and Column 3
excludes May observations. Both specifications give similar results (in the case of Column 3,
excluding May gives a greater decrease of 22.82%). An OLS specification with the dependent
variable of ln(1 + # of deals) in Column 4 indicates a 9.07% decrease. The marginal effect
on the number of deals is computed from the estimated coefficient of GDPR, accounting for
the fact that the dependent variable is log of one plus the number of deals.
    Table 4 provides the results of the deal-level log linear specification. Our baseline model
in Column 1 suggests a 39.6% decrease in the dollar amount per deal after the rollout of
GDPR. Column 2 summarizes a similar estimation when right censoring the sample at the
95-percentile level, and suggests a similar reduction of 38.0%. Column 3 adds a linear trend
and Column 4 excludes May from the sample; the results are similar in both cases.



5     Heterogeneous Effects of GDPR

While the overall effects we measure may be negative and statistically significant, there may
exist heterogeneity both at the aggregate level and at the deal level in the effects across firm
technology category types and firm age groups. This section applies the baseline specification
to some of these subsamples. An example of such heterogeneity is presented in Figures 4 and
5, where the weekly trends of the number of deals and dollar amounts for the EU and US
are plotted separately for healthcare-financial and other technology. There is no apparent
differential trend between the EU and US prior to May 2018, and GDPR seems to have
had effects in both category groups. Figure 4 in particular demonstrates that the sample
comprises some significant outliers and, as such, right-censoring the data to mitigate the
impact of outliers on our dollar amount estimations is likely necessary.


                                              15
   Table 5 reports the baseline model specification for the number of deals, the aggregate
dollar amount raised (with right censoring at the 95-percentile level), and the dollar amount
raised per deal for healthcare-financial and other technology, respectively.
   Columns 1, 3 and 5 of Table 5 indicate that GDPR had negative effects on the number
of deals, the aggregate dollar amount raised, and the dollar amount raised per deal by EU
ventures in the healthcare-financial category. The three columns suggest a decline in the
number of deals of 18.86% and reductions of $5.22 million and 56.6% in the aggregate dollar
amount per week and in the dollar amount per deal, respectively. For the group comprising
all other technology, Columns 2 and 6 suggest large negative effects for the number of deals
and dollar amount per deal; however, the effect on the aggregate dollar amount per week is
insignificant in Column 4. We believe this is possibly because of a large standard deviation
on the aggregate dollar amount per week in this rather broad category.
   The somewhat comparable negative effects on ventures in healthcare-financial versus
other technology may be perceived as surprising, in light of the seemingly stringent health-
care and financial data privacy laws in the US (HIPPA and GLB). However, those laws are
arguably older and systems to comply with them have been in place for a number of years.
Moreover, HIPPA, for instance, allows providers to require consent prior to providing ser-
vices, a requirement that GDPR explicitly prohibits. GLB, for instance, adopts an opt-out
approach, where information is collected by default and consumers have a limited ability to
opt out. GDPR, in contrast, mandates an informed opt-in consent for each type of data
collected, and further requires data management, data auditing and classification, data risk
identification and mitigation, and data interfaces for users to easily obtain their own data
and request that it be deleted. GDPR also imposes substantially larger penalties of up to
4% of a firm’s global revenues. Hence, our results potentially indicate that GDPR is widely
transformational across the technology sector in a rather broad way, even when compared
to existing strict data regulations of US firms.
   Another example of subsample heterogeneity is presented in Figures 6 and 7, where the


                                              16
average weekly number of deals and aggregate dollar amount raised, respectively, are depicted
for four different age groups of EU and US ventures. Similarly to the preceding analysis,
we also examine the heterogeneous effects of GDPR across these firm age groups. Under
the aggregate dollar amount per week specification, when examining subsamples according
to firm age groups, Column 1 of Table 6 suggests that GDPR had a negative effect on the
aggregate dollar amount invested per week in the new (0-3 year old) firm subsample, with
a reduction of $0.9 million per week. Columns 2 and 3 indicate insignificant effects for
firms in the 3-9 year old age group, and Column 4 indicates a larger negative effect of $7.1
million per week for firms in the 9+ year-old age group. Under the number of deals per
week specification, Table 7 presents similar findings. Columns 1 and 4 indicate significant
reductions in the number of deals for firms in the 0-3 and 9+ year-old subsamples of 19.02%
and 29.53%, respectively, and Columns 2 and 3 indicate insignificant effects for firms in the
intermediate (3-9 year old) subsamples.
       At the deal level, Column 1 of Table 8 suggests a negative effect under the deal-level
dollar amount specification for firms in the 0-3 year old subsample, with a reduction of
27.1% per deal. Columns 2 and 3 suggest negative effects for firms in the 3-6 and 6-9 age
groups, with reductions of 31.4% and 77.3%, respectively. Due to the absence of significant
aggregate effects for these age groups in terms of the weekly number of deals and total dollar
amounts invested, we believe these reductions may be the result of the more sporadic nature
of deals for firms in these age groups.16 Column 4 indicates an insignificant deal-level effect
for the subsample comprising 9+ year-old firms.
       Ventures in the 0-3 year old group in our sample are those ventures that primarily seek
seed, series A and series A-B bridge rounds, as indicated in Figure 8 — rounds where angel
investment and venture capital begin to overlap for the first time, with venture capital
replacing funding that was previously raised from angel investors. In the figure, the circles
  16
    Firms in the 0-3 age group comprise 46% of our observations, whereas 3-6 year-old firms comprise 28%,
and 6-9 year-old firms comprise 10.5%.

depict the relative numbers of observations, with larger circles indicating more deals. The
numbers of seed, Series A, and Series A-B deals in Figure 8(a) for 0-3 year old firms are
significantly larger than their corresponding numbers in Figures 8(b)-8(d) for 3+ year-old
firms. The combined estimates of Tables 6 through 8 thus suggest that those nascent firms
that most critically depend on angel investment as well as those firms that are in the process
of making the transition from angel investment to venture capital are particularly susceptible
to a negative effect from GDPR.



6       Implications for Employment

For each venture, our dataset provides a range on the number of employees (e.g., 1-10, 10-50,
50-100, etc). However, this range is time-invariant as of the composition time of our dataset,
October 1, 2018; thus, we do not have historical ranges. In other words, as of October 1,
2018, we have the total dollar amount raised by each firm and a range on its current number
of employees. We can use this information to provide a back-of-the-envelope measure of the
average dollar amount raised per ‘current’ employee as a function of the firm’s age. We focus
on new (0-3 year old) ventures, because the literature has demonstrated that they tend to be
the primary job creators,17 and we focus our analysis on EU ventures to assess the potential
for EU technology job losses as a result of GDPR.
      To provide a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the effect on jobs, we calculate the
average dollar raised per deal and the total number of deals in the post-GDPR period by 0-3
year old ventures. Columns 4 and 5 of Table 9 show our calculations. In the third quarter
of 2018, 0-3 year old ventures raised on average $3.32 million per deal, with 690 deals made
by 0-3 year old ventures. Once the estimated reduction in the dollar raised per deal and the
reduction in the number of deals are applied to those firms’ totals, the predicted overall dollar
amount suggests a $1589.77 million decrease for 0-3 year old firms. This is corroborated at
 17
      See, e.g., Haltiwanger et al. (2013).



                                               18
the aggregate level when using estimates of the change in the total weekly dollar amount
invested per state per category to estimate the decrease in the aggregate amount invested
in 0-3 year-old EU firms after GDPR, suggesting $1217.70 million decrease for 0-3 year old
firms, in line with the first approach. To extrapolate these losses to an entire calendar year,
we examine the ratio of EU venture activity in June through September 2017 to the rest of
calendar year 2017 for new ventures, and apply the same multiplier to these totals.
       To identify the average bounds on the annualized dollar amount raised per employee, we
focus on EU ventures founded on or after 2015. An advantage of focusing on 0-3 year old
firms is that our dataset can provide their total amounts raised since their founding. The
average age for ventures in this group is 1.21. For each firm in this group, its total dollar
amount raised is divided by the bounds on its employee range, which provides a lower and
upper bound on its total dollar amount raised per current employee. We then obtain the
average lower and upper bounds across this subsample and divide it by the average firm age
to obtain a crude back-of-the-envelope calculation of the dollar amount raised per employee
per year. This calculation gives an average lower bound of $0.123 million and an average
upper bound of $1.02 million for 0-3 year old firms.
       We can use these average annualized bounds of dollar amount raised per employee and
the estimated annual investment losses following the rollout of GDPR to obtain a back-of-
the-envelope estimate of the number of technology venture jobs lost in the EU. We obtain a
lower bound of 4,705 jobs lost and an upper bound of 38,931 jobs lost from our first approach
(using the number of deals times the dollar amount per deal), and a lower bound of 3,604
jobs and an upper bound of 29,819 jobs by using the total dollar amount approach. We
tally up the ranges of employees for all firms founded since 2015 in our sample.18 Using
the approach based on the aggregate dollar amount invested, as a percentage of the total
  18
    Firms that are missing employee ranges in the subsample are counted by assuming they have the sub-
sample average employee range. This may mean that our results are understated since some of those firms
may have ceased operating. Constructing the subsample with firms founded on or after January 2015 may
also understate our results since some of those firms may be entering their fourth year of operation in 2018.

range on employment by EU ventures in the subsample comprising firms in this age group,
the estimated job loss bounds translate to a 4.09%-11.20% loss in the number of individuals
employed by those firms.



7     Conclusion

We presented analyses of the short-term effects of the rollout of GDPR on investment in
technology ventures. We found evidence suggesting negative and pronounced effects following
the rollout of GDPR on the number of venture deals, the size of those deals, and the overall
amount of dollars invested. We broke down those effects according to two venture categories
and four venture age groups, and presented a rough estimate of the effect on the number of
jobs for 0-3 year old technology ventures.
    It is important to emphasize that our dataset is not a complete universe of venture
funding, but rather a partial snapshot of primarily venture capital and angel investments in
technology ventures. As such, our results must be taken with a bit of caution, given that
the effects we observe may be incomplete. At the same time, our findings indicate that it is
exactly those nascent ventures that are in the process of transitioning from angel to venture
capital that may be most impacted by GDPR.
    Another caveat is that the impact estimated on EU ventures is relative to their US
counterparts. To the extent that capital flows freely across continents, it is unclear whether
the reduced investment in the EU may have in tandem translated to additional support for
US ventures or that it reflects the reluctance by investors to invest anywhere. If it is the
former, our estimates may have overestimated the effects of GDPR; if it is the latter, our
estimates may be conservative as our sample does not include ventures that could serve EU
residents but are based in other countries.
    While our analyses concern the amount of dollars invested in technology, they are not
necessarily translatable into welfare implications. For instance, a reduction in investment


                                              20
dollars in technology ventures could benefit welfare if firms that are potentially harmful from
a societal perspective do not come to fruition. Similarly, it could be that data regulation
encourages new types of innovation further down the road.
   It is also important to emphasize that given our data, our measure of the effect on jobs
can only provide rough back-of-the-envelope ranges on job loss estimates. This is because, on
the one hand, we have no insight into whether investors are taking a wait-and-see approach
nor do we know the outside options of affected firms or of those individuals who would have
been employed by the firms in our dataset had it not been for GDPR. There may also be jobs
created as a result of GDPR (for instance, data privacy compliance officers, data security
and management ventures, etc). On the other hand, the potential for job losses may well
extend and intensify past our four months post-GDPR dataset period, in which case the
effect on jobs is understated. Moreover, our estimates do not incorporate potential foregone
related job creation (for instance, downstream jobs to service the additional employees that
may have been employed had it not been for the rollout of GDPR). The long-term impact
of GDPR on the EU technology venture scene will become clearer in the years ahead.

 Note: The estimates of the effects on the $ mm raised per deal, # of deals, and aggregate $mm in the post-
 GDPR period are used for back-of-the-envelope calculations of the effect on jobs. First, an estimate decrease in
 total $mm invested due to GDPR is calculated. Next, ventures founded on or after 2015 are used to calculate
 the average $ amount raised per employee (total $ amount raised by each firm divided by the firm’s employee
 range). Those bounds are averaged and annualized. A job-loss range in 2018 Q3 is obtained by dividing the
 total $mm reduction by the annualized $mm/employee range. We extrapolate 2018 Q3 to an entire calendar
 year by using the ratio of deals in 2017 Q3 to 2017 in order to annualize the job loss bounds. In the final step,
 these bounds are given as % of the total range on the # of employees for ventures founded on or after 2015.
