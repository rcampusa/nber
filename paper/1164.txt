    Unionism, Price—Cost Margins, and the Return to Capital




                                 ABSTRACT




        This   paper examines available industry data on two

profitability measures, the price—cost margin and the ratio of quasi—

rents to capital, for the purpose of determining the effect of unionism

on profits. Jt finds that unionism reduces profitability and that this

effect occurs in highly concentrated industries. The effect of

unionism is quite substantial in most calculations, suggesting that the

fraction organized in a sector be included in standard Industrial

Organization profitability calculations in the future.

        Despite a widespread belief among economists and businessmen

that trade unionism is inimical to profitability, neither labor

economists nor industrial organization specialists have seriously

examined the relation of industry profits to organization of the labor

force.1 Since, in theory, the effect of unionism on profitability is

ambiguous ——     in   some market situations unionism can raise profits by

acting as the monopolizing agent while in others it should have no

effect ——   it   is important to test the widespread belief and to estimate

the magnitude of the relation.

        This paper seeks to fill the gap in our knowledge by analyzing

the impact of unionism on the profitability variables studied in

industrial organization, price—cost margins,' and quasi—rent returns

to capital as reflected in revenues minus costs per dollar of assets.

It uses two major bodies of data: the Internal Revenue Service balance

sheet data and the annual Survey of Manufacturing.

        The major finding is that unionism has a statistically

significant quantitatively important depressant impact upon the

relevant profit indicators that holds up under various specifications

and is as or more robust than the widely—studied impact of

concentration on industrial profitability. In addition, the analysis

shows that the negative effect of unionism on industry profits is

limited to the more concentrated industries.

        The finding that unionism reduces profits helps explain

extensive management opposition to unionism, despite the often higher

productivity associated with organization (see Brown and Medoff, Clark,
                                                             2



Allen). Apparently managerial and union productivity or price

augmenting behavior is generally, though not always1 insufficient to

counterbalance the higher cost of union labor.



1. What Theory Says

       While most economists would expect the wage increases due to

unionism to reduce profitability, such an effect is by no means

theoretically certain. Even in situations where all that unions do is

to raise labor costs, the effect on profitability depends on: the

period of analysis, market structure in the organized sector, and the

profitability measure under study.2 When firms are not operating at

optimal efficiency so that unionism is accompanied by productivity

advances as well as cost increases there is even greater ambiguity to

the profit effect. Moreover, when part of a sector is organized and

part is not, profitability is likely to be increased in the nonunion

part, raising the likelihood that industry profits will be higher.

        Consider first the issues of market structure and the time

period of analysis. If a union organizes a competitive sector and

raises costs, it can either increase or decrease profits in the short—

run, depending on the demand and cost conditions in the sector.

Profits are likely to increase if the demand curve facing the sector is

inelastic, so that increases in costs which raise prices, also raise

total revenues. Essentially, union cost increases can bring the

industry closer to the price/output position of a monopoly in the

sector, with the monopoly profits divided between the union and the
                                                                         3




firms. To illustrate, let P =        price,   Q =   quantity,   W = wage, L =

labor,   and let production be governed by Q = La K1a where K is fixed.

Then profits (it)      are

          (1)   it   = PU — Wolta

If   the sector is competitive price is equated to marginal cost

          (2) P W dL/dQ = W/a 01/a — 1

Substitution for WQhi'a in (1) yields

          (3)        = (1 — a) PU

Here profits will rise in the sector whenever demand is inelastic.

(See Nelson 1957, for a general analysis). In the long run, with free

exit and entry, however, the reduction in profits will reduce the

number of firms and output until profitability is restored to

'competitive levels.'

          By contrast, if the industry is already acting as if it was a

perfect monopoly, the union wage increase cannot raise profits. It

will necessarily reduce them since the monopolist is in the elastic

part of the demand curve. In this case, the union profit effect can

continue in the long run, as long as market conditions remain the same.

Profits will be reduced relative to what they would be in the

monopolistic sector in the absence of unionism but, assuming free exit,

will not fall below the competitive level.

          In a recent paper Clark has pointed out that the effect of

union wage increases on profitability depend also on the measure of

profits used.         In particular, he notes the 'anomalous' result in which

unionism lowers profits in a sector but where the ratio of profits to
                                                               4




capital rises. In his case the decline in profits reduces the size of

the sector, with capital usage declining less in percentage terms than

does the level of profits, a result requiring an elasticity of

substitution less than one.3 In this case, profits divided by the

original capital stock are lower but profits divided by the capital

stock after adjustment are higher under unionism. By focusing on the

latter measure rather than the former one ignores capital losses to

fixed factors. The result does not imply that monopolies with low

elasticities of substitution will raise factor prices to raise

profitability: their concern is with total profits, not profits per

plant and equipment capital.

        In sum, theoretical considerations suggest that one be careful

in analyzing the union—profitability relation, distinguishing between

sectors with different market conditions and between profit measures.

        In this study I treat the market conditions issue by

differentiating between more and less concentrated sectors.    While

there are well—known problems with concentration as a measure of market

power, it is the most widely studied indicator of market power and is

generally found to have a moderate but persistent positive relation to

profitability measures (see Weiss), which even critics of the standard

interpretation of the concentration—profit relation admit (Peltzman).

I report some results with other market structure variables found in

the iadustrial organization literature, but as these yield comparable

findings with respect to unionism, I shall not place great stress on

them.
                                                               5




        For profitability. I employ the 'price—cost margin, ' (PCM)

defined as value added less labor costs (and less advertising costs)

divided by the value of shipments, and quasi—rents per unit of capital,

(QRC) defined as value added less labor (and advertising) costs per

dollar of asset. The price—cost margin is generally interpreted in the

industrial organization literature as a measure of the extent to which

a monopolistic sector raises prices over costs (capital held fixed)

beyond competitive levels. In a simple monopoly model the price—cost

margin depends on the elasticity of demand : EPIC = 11(1 —

Alternatively   the price—cost margin can be thought of as a measure of

profits per unit of sales. Despite criticisms of the P01 as a profit

indicator on various grounds (see Liebowitz), it continues to be widely

used, in part because it represents the best profitability measure in

the Census of Manufacturers and appears to yield similar correlations

with profit determinants as do quasi—rents per unit of capital.

        While the QRC measure of profits has some desirable features,

in that it represents a return on capital, it also suffers from serious

drawbacks. It is not a rate of return in the theoretical sense of an

internal return. It involves division of profits by capital/asset

measures of questionable quality, due to capital stock valuation1

omission of intangibles (in the Survey of Manufacturers) and other

well—known problems (see L. Weiss).

       Given the weakness of each measure of profitability, I examine

the impact of unionism on both and contrast results with those obtained

on the standard Industrial Organization variables in each case.
                                                                  6




2. Data
       The empirical analysis uses two data sets containing measures

of profits or quasi—rents, capital. market structure, and unionization

of the labor force:

                Survey of Manufacturing (SOld) data, 1958—1976.   The first
          (a)

data set consists of a pooled cross section time series of observations

on 139 three digit industries from the annual Survey of Manufacturing.

The Survey presents data on value added, value shipments and labor cost

to measure the price—cost margin and measure of quasi—rents. I augment

this data series with: estimates on capital in each industrryear cell

using data reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as described in

detail in the data appendix. estimates of three digit concentration

ratios, obtained as weighted averages of four digit rates, estimates of

the following other market structure variables, obtained from the

ilarvard University (PICA) data bank: minimum efficient scale, cost

disadvantage ratio, advertising/sales ratio, and absolute capital

requirements. Tbe unionism variable is obtained from the Freeman—

Medoff estimates for three digit industries, based on May Current

Population Survey data.

          The three digit SOld data set has both advantages and

 disadvantages for analysis. On the plus side it provides a consistent

 series of 'quasi—rents' and capital measures unaffected by changes in

 tax laws or distorted by inflation for a large number of industries.

 On the negative side the measure of 'quasi—rents' includes overhead

 expenses while the measure of capital stock excludes all assets except
                                                            7




for plant and equipment. Furthermore the data are limited to

manufacturing which has become an increasingly smaller component of

U.S. national product.

        (b) Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data on balance sheets and

assets in 68 industries from 1965 to 1976. From the IRS balance sheets

we have calculated a cash flow measure of profits: reported profits

before taxes plus depreciation plus interest payment1 and obtained

total assets and net depreciable assets. The industry concentration

and unionism variables are taken from the same sources as in the Survey

of Manufacturing data, but are bridged to correspond with the IRS

industry definitions.

        The IRS data set addresses some of the problems in the SOM data

set but also introduces new ones. IRS data yield a quasi—rent measure

that approximates payments to capital instead of contributions to

overhead. And the data yield capital measures ranging from stock of

plant and equipment to total assets. On the negative side, industrial

organization experts cite three major problems (see L.W. Weiss) One,

accounting and managerial policy tend to equalize profit rates among

industries. Two, inflation distorts capital stock valuation. Three.

IRS reports company and not establishment data. Therefore, market

structure variables reflect conditions in the companies' most important

industry but not conditions in other markets of diversified firms.

        The precise definitions of the variables used are given in the

data appendix.
                                                                8




           Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations of the major

variables in the analysis and, to provide a guide to ensuing work, the

multivariate relationship between each of the variables and unionism as

reflected in the regression coefficient on unionism and the implied

level of the variable at 0% and 100% organization. These figures are

not meant to estimate the structural impact of unionism on the relevant

variables but simply to show k2!L they vary with unionism in the

samples.

           jYhile there are differences in levels of variables due to

different definitions and groupings1 the two data sets tell a similar

story about the magnitude, variability, and link to unionism of the key

variables.

           First, the table shows considerable variation in the major

profitability indicators, the price—cost margin and quasi—rents per

unit of capital, providing the differences among industries necessary

for a fruitfui analysis. The levels of the profitability measures do,

however, differ greatly between the data sets, with both the price—cost

margin and quasi—rents per capital higher in the SOM than in the IRS.

In the price cost margin this reflects lack of data on some costs in

 the SOld, while in the quasi—rent/capital measure it also reflects lack

 of a complete accounting of the capital stock in the SOM data: taking

 net depreciable assets as an indication of the plant and equipment

 capital in the SOM, upwards of three—fourths of manufacturing assets

 are not included in the SOM figure.4 Because of these factors, the

 'price—cost' margin, which is capital's share of value shipment in the

SON, averages    19% in that data set while quasi—rents per capital are

73%. These figures far exceed the comparable statistics from national

income accounts, a well—known result indicative of the aforementioned

data problems (see Brown and Medoff). Despite the problems, however,

the SOM data are valuable in providing a large number of industries and

years for analysis, we will develop a somewhat novel model to treat the

data problems.

        Nearly all of the variables are correlated with unionism. With

one exception.the correlations are in the expected direction, though

not of the same magnitude or significance, in the two data sets. The

exception is the gross value of log quasi—rents, which is positively

correlated with unionism in the SON, a result due to the industry

classification scheme as larger industries tend to be more heavily

unionized in that data set. More importantly, the SON and IRS data

show negative correlations between the relative profitability measures

and unionism which, however, are noticeably stronger in the IRS than in

the SON data.

        The capital intensity measures, capital per worker in the SON,

capital per sales in the IRS, are positively correlated with unionism,

as we would expect. The labor cost per worker and value added per

worker data in the SON show that unionized industries pay more for

labor and have higher gross' productivity.

        Without claiming the data are optimal for examining the impact

of unionism on profitability, I believe they are adequate to provide at

least a crude indication of the linkage between collective organization
                                                             11




in the labor market and profitability, on a par with studies of

concentration and other measures of the structure of the product market

and profitability which use essentially the same data sources.



3. Empirical Analysis

        Table 2 presents the results of a multivariate analysis of the

impact of unionism on profitability in the IRS data set. Regardless of

the measure of profits or control variables, the calculations tell a

clearcut story, showing that unionism reduces profits by significant

sizeable amounts.

        Taking the quasi—rents/capital regression first we see in

equation (1) that unionism lowers profits per unit of assets by some

61% ( = 1 — exp(—.49)) as one moves from 0% to 100% organization.

Equation (2) introduces a union concentration interaction term to see

if the negative effect of unionism on profitability is, as expected1

greater in the more concentrated sectors. The interaction term enters

significantly1 supporting this hypothesis. Equation (3) shows that the

negative effect of unionism does not disappear with addition of three

other widely used measures of product market structures.4

       The result with respect to the price—cost margin in equatipns 4

— 6 are similar.

       Table 3 presents a comparable analysis of profitability in the

Survey of Manufacturers data set. Here, the results with respect to

the price—cost margin parallel those given in the previous table:

unionism reduces profits, concentration raises profits, and there is a

noticeable interactive effect. Addition of the other market structure

variables weakens the concentration variable much more than it did in

the IRS data but does not greatly affect the union impact. The results

with respect to the quasi—rent/capital measure of profitability differ,

however, in one remarkable respect. Whereas unionism continues to have

a negative estimated impact on profitability. so too does

concentration. Indeed, the negative relation between concentration and

profitability with this measure is extraordinarily strong. Why?    My

first fear was that I made a gross error with the SO?'! data. After all,

a relation like this has certainly not been reported in the Industrial

Organization literature. Several careful data checks uncovered no such

gruesome error. Examination of the literature found that one reason

for the lack of such a result in previous studies js that nearly all

analysts using the Survey of Manufacturers data focus on price—cost

margins, not the quasi—rent to capital return. The one study which

did, indeed, analyze the QRC, by Lester Telser, reports negative

correlations between 'contribution to overhead' and concentration of a

magnitude similar to that in my data set. Telser deals with the

problem by including 'payroll' as an additional capital measure in the

regressions. He argues that the standard plant and equipment capital

 in the Survey is seriously incomplete by omission of intangible

 'specific human capital,' which can be roughly measured by payroll.

 Indeed, with addition of payroll, the positive relation between the QRC

 and concentration is reversed. However, holding payroll fixed

 essentially turns the QRC regression in a PC?'! equation.5 While this
                                                              15




raises doubts about interpretation of Telser's regressions, I believe

the explanation of the aberrant finding does indeed rest on 'missing'

capital. If a significant amount of capital relevant to profitability

is omitted from the Survey of Manufacturers data, and if this capital

is negatively correlated with concentration, and is positively

correlated with profitability, the negative result in the QRC

regression could be attributed to the missing capital. Calculation

with the IRS data, which contains depreciable assets comparable to the

plant and equipment capital in the Survey of Manufacturers supports the

interpretation. First, the IRS data show that only 1/4 of total assets

are depreciable assets (the rest include inventories, intangible

assets, land, etc.),6 which suggests considerable 'missing' capital.

Second, the log of the ratio of depreciable to total assets is highly

significantly correlated with concentration: a regression coefficient

(standard error) of .51 (.07). whereas unionism is barely correlated

with the ratio 1.09 (.08)]. Third, the nondepreciable assets in the

IRS are correlated with profitability just as are the depreciable

assets.

          As a test of the explanation, I re—estimated the QRC regression

in the IRS data, replacing total assets by depreciable assets. If the

essence of the problem lies with use of depreciable rather than total

assets, one should obtain a negative concentration—QRC relation in the

IRS data in this case. Indeed, the results show just such an effect,

with a coefficient on concentration of —.13 (.08) compared to the .39

(.01) obtained in Table 2. The union coefficient, by contrast, remains
                                                                     16



highly significantly negative.

         There are two ways to adjust the SO?'! data for the missing part

of capital. One could use the IRS data to obtain the relevant

auxiliary regression coefficients to 'correct' the SO?'! results using

omitted variable bias formulae. Alternatively, one can modify the

profitability model to allow for an unmeasured capital effect on

profits. As the latter gives greater leeway to the SO?'! data to tell

the story. I follow this procedure.

         An appropriate generalization of the profitability equation

used in the 5014 regressions is:

        (4) n =    a +   bK   +   cUN-'- dCONC+ eKCONC + fKUN

where ,t =   quasi—rents
      K =    capital
      UN =    extent   of unionization

      CONC =    concentration      ratio

         In (4) measured capital produces quasi—rents according to the

coefficient b and the coefficients on the interaction terms between K

and unionism and concentration. The coefficient f reflects the impact

of unionism on the return to capital, with b + fUN measuring the

marginal impact of a dollar of measured capital on quasi—rents, while

the coefficient e reflects the impact of concentration on return to

capital. Unionism, concentration and a constant enter the equation to

allowfor unmeasured capital and the possibility that either is related

to the amount or the returns to that capital:          if the coefficients c

and d are negative (positive), we would infer that these is less (more)
                                                                 17




unmeasured capital, or that the unmeasured capital has a lower (higher)

return in the more concentrated or unionized sectors.

        Table 4 records the result of estimating (1) in the SOM data.

Consistent with our explanation of the aberrant concentration result,

it shows a sizeable negative direct effect of concentration on the log

of quasi—rents but a sizeable positive interaction with capital. The

estimated union effects are exactly the opposite, as might be expected.

The effects of the variables at the bottom of the table show that, at
                                                            while so too
the mean value, of capital. unionism redtices quasi—rents

does concentration, consistent with the Table 3 findings.

        Whether one does or does not accept this explanation of the

                                       result in the Survey of
aberrant

Manufacturers, the important point is that even in that calculation the

union effect is negative and interacts negatively with concentration.



 3. Assessina the Union—Profitability Relation

           Granted that unionism has a negative effect on profitability

 and that its effect differs between more and less concentrated

 industries, is the effect limited to highly concentrated sectors where

 profitability would otherwise be extremely high or do unions also

 reduce profits below normal levels in competitive industries? A priori

 one expects the negative union impact on profits to be especially

 sizeable and in the long run limited to concentrated or regulated

 sectors, because a union profit effect in a truly competitive sector
                                           drive union firms out of
 would bring in nonunion competitors and

           To see how unionism affects profitability in different types of

industries I have estimated the profitability regressions using a four

way classification of industries in place of unionism and

concentration, dividing industries into roughly equally numbered sets

as follows: low unionism —     high   concentration, high unionism —     high
concentration, high unionism — low concentration, and low unionism —

low concentration.
           Table. 5 presents the results of these regressions in terms of

the estimated ln point difference in profitability between the high

unionism and low unionism parts of low and high concentrated sectors.

The results are clear: unionism has essentially no impact on

profitability in the more competitive sectors but a sizeable negative

effect in the concentrated industries. In all cases the highest

profitability is obtained for the high concentration — low unionism set

of industries. In all but the aberrant quasi—rent to capital Survey of

Manufacturers regression, moreover, the reduction in profitability in

the high concentration —    high   unionism sectors is to irnormaJ.ir low

concentrated profit rates.7

           While the profitability calculations indicate that unionism

reduces profits only in sectors whose industry market power creates

above—normal profits, it is still possible that there is a union effect

on competitive industries. Assume unionism reduces profitability in

the competitive sector, which drives out less efficient union fins.

If, as seems plausible, our data cover a period in which industries

have fully adjusted to the economic effects of unionism, one would

expect little or no connection between unionism and profitability:     the

effect is masked by the shrinkage of the sector. To see whether or not

such a shrinkage may have occurred, I have examined the relationship of

unionism and concentration to the growth of industries over the period

covered. The results differ between the SON and IRS data sets. In the

SON, the average annual compound rate of growth of value added from

1958 to 1976 was 5.1% in the low union—low concentration industries

compared to 4.5% in the high union—high concentration industries, which

might be taken to support the hypothesis that unionism shrinks the

competitive sector. In the IRS low concentration industries, however.

high union industries averaged a 3.1% increase in total receipts (1965

— 1976) compared to a 2.7% increase for low union industries. By

contrast, both data sets show higher rates of growth in the high—

concentrated low union sector than in the high—concentrated—high union

sector (5.4 versus 4.3% in the SON, 6.7% versus 2.8% in the IRS) •8 The

variation in growth rates across industries is, however, quite great,

 suggesting that our findings with respect to profitability are

reasonably robust with respect to differential union impacts on growth.



Other Studies

        Our results on industry profitability can be compared to the

 analyses of Richard Caves, Michael Porter, Michael Spence, and John

 Scott on Canadian industries, Kim Clark on 'businesses,' Michael

 Salinger on companies. and R. Rubach and N. Zimmerman on the stock
                                                                   22




 prices of companies undergoing union organizing drives.

        All of these studies, while based on different data and models1

 obtain the same basic conclusion: that unionism is associated with

 lower profitability. Caves et. al. finds profits to be negatively

related to unionism in 85 or so Canadian industries in ordinary least

 squares regressions of profit—on—sales, price—cost margin and profit—

on—equity on unionism and various industrial organization variables.

Clark finds profits to be negatively related to unionism in regressions

of price—cost, margins and quasi—rents/capital for 902 individual

'businesses in the period 1970—1980. However, contrary to our results

Clark finds the union impact on profitability to be greatest in less

concentrated sectors, a result due possibly to the unrepresentative

sample he uses (his 'businesses' are parts of large firms who provided

data for purposes of Strategic Planning) .      Using a different approach
in which the ratio of the stock market value of a firm to the

replacement value of its physical assets (Tobin's q) is taken as the

measure of profitability, Professor Michael Salinger of Columbia

Business School finds unionism lowers Tobin's q in a sample of 193

manufacturing firms. Supporting our finding on concentration,

moreover, Salinger finds that the union effect is greatest in

concentrated sectors, reducing the market value of a firm with monopoly

power relative to its replacement value. Finally, in an analysis of

the effect of union organizing drives on the value of a company's

stock, It. Rubach and M. Zimmerman   find   significant negative impacts,

which suggest that the stock market at least regards union organization
                                                            23




as harmful for profits.



Conclusion

       This paper has examined available industry data on two

profitability measures, the price—cost margin and the ratio of quasi—

rents to capital, for the purpose of determining the effect of unionism

on profits. It has found that unionism reduces profitability and that

this effect occurs in highly concentrated industries. The effect of

unionism is quite substantial in most calculations, suggesting that the

fraction organized in a sector be included in standard Industrial

Organization profitability calculations in the future.

                               FOONOTES



1.   Unionism is included as a variable in one analysis of Canadian

     industry profitability by Caves et. al. It has been examined as a

     determinant of company profitability by Clark and Salinger.



2.   It can be readily demonstrated that organization of a single

     competitive or monopolistic firm will suffer profit losses when a

     union forces wage increases on it.

4.   The interested reader will note that two of the three measures

     obtain conceptually sensible signs: advertising intensity, which

     obtains a uniform positive coefficient in all calculations1 and

     absolute capital requirements, positive in three of four

     regressions but negative in the 5024 price—cost margin regression.

     By contrast relative minimum efficient scale does not. The

     strongest and most striking 1—0 variable in these calculations is

     the advertising intensity measure, supporting the Comonor—Wilson

     analysis of that variable's impact on profitability.

5.   With payroll fixed, the return depends on the markup of price over

     unit cost and the capital to sales ratio, which is held fixed in

     the usual price—cost margin regression.

6.   It is possible but unlikely that unions could organize a fraction

     of new entrants, maintain a constant share of industry output, and

     have a negative effect on profits. To do this requires

     considerable organizing activity, and is likely to result in weak

     unioni sm.

     whereas log depreciable assets averages 14.lS producing a

     difference of —1.35 so that net depreciable assets are just 26j of

     total assets. The actual regression coefficients and standard
