                                              ABSTRACT

We model welfare-maximizing policy in an infinite-horizon setting when the probability of a tipping
point, the welfare change due to a tipping point, and knowledge about a tipping point's trigger all depend
on the policy path. Analytic results demonstrate how optimal policy depends on the ability to affect
both the probability of a tipping point and also welfare in a post-threshold world. Simulations with
a numerical climate-economy model show that possible tipping points in the climate system increase
the optimal near-term carbon tax by up to 45% in base case specifications. The resulting policy paths
lower peak warming by up to 0.5°C compared to a model without possible tipping points. Different
types of tipping points have qualitatively different effects on policy, demonstrating the importance
of explicitly modeling tipping points' effects on system dynamics. Aversion to ambiguity in the threshold's
distribution can amplify or dampen the effect of tipping points on optimal policy, but in our numerical
model, ambiguity aversion increases the optimal carbon tax.

1       Introduction
Potentially irreversible shifts in system dynamics play a key role in important economic
applications such as the macroeconomic consequences of bankruptcies, institutional changes
resulting from mass uprisings, and management of environmental systems subject to abrupt
degradation. How these shifts affect welfare depends on the policy decisions made before and
after tipping occurs. Crucially for policy, however, the thresholds that trigger such tipping
points are generally uncertain: the policymaker often trades immediate payoffs against the
chance of tipping the dynamic system into a new regime. Further, while a policymaker can
learn about a threshold’s location over time, the probabilities governing tipping points are
rarely known with confidence. The policymaker therefore often also trades more confidently
known payoffs against less confidently known payoffs. We capture both types of trade-offs in
a dynamic model of optimal policy, which is the policy trajectory that maximizes the present
value of net benefits for a given welfare criterion and a given specification of state dynamics.
We analyze the determinants of policy when choices affect both the probability of a tipping
point and its welfare impact. By combining our analysis of uncertain tipping points with a
model of ambiguity, we also analyze how optimal policy changes when a decision-maker is
more averse to tipping point uncertainty than to more confidently known risks.
    Our numerical application explores how tipping points in the climate system affect op-
timal carbon taxes over time. Scientists have grown increasingly concerned about the pos-
sibility of abrupt changes caused by crossing temperature thresholds (Alley et al., 2003;
Overpeck and Cole, 2006; Lenton et al., 2008). While these concerns have shaped the pol-
icy debate, economic models for estimating the social cost of carbon have only allowed for
smooth and reversible changes in the climate system (Greenstone et al., 2011). In our base
case specifications, tipping points raise the current optimal carbon tax by around 40%, with
ambiguity aversion raising the tax further. We explore qualitative policy differences arising
from different tipping points, and we demonstrate the importance of explicitly modeling how
dynamics shift and also how policy affects the probability of a shift.
    Our model endogenizes the timing and probability of crossing a threshold. Crossing a
threshold causes an irreversible change in system dynamics, which we call a tipping point.1
    1
    A different notion of tipping point sometimes used in the economics literature refers to shifts between
equilibria due to small changes in parameters. These changes can occur due to preferences in residential
sorting models (Schelling, 1971), network externalities in technology adoption models (Katz and Shapiro,
1994), increasing returns in agglomeration models (Ellison and Fudenberg, 2003), and human capital accu-
mulation in growth models (Azariadis and Drazen, 1990). The non-convex control literature directly models
the possibility of tipping a system into a new type of equilibrium (e.g., Skiba, 1978; Brock and Starrett,
2003; Mäler et al., 2003; Wagener, 2003). In these deterministic models, it is always known whether a given
policy path will or will not tip the system, so tipping along the optimal path depends entirely on the initial
conditions. Skiba points divide the space of initial conditions into regions with and without optimal tipping.

We also endogenize both the welfare change induced by crossing a threshold and learning
about the threshold location. Previous work has not jointly endogenized these tipping point
characteristics. The macroeconomic literature studies the potential for monetary policy to
stabilize the economy when nominal interest rate rules might shift discontinuously in the
future (Davig and Leeper, 2007), and the real options literature studies optimal investment
when demand dynamics might shift discontinuously in the future (Guo et al., 2005). Be-
cause these regime shifts are controlled by exogenously fixed transition probabilities, the
decision-maker can only change the welfare impact of tipping (self-insure) but not change
the likelihood of tipping (self-protect). The resources literature allows policy to affect the
probability of an irreversible “climate catastrophe,” but the flow of disutility due to the catas-
trophe is specified exogenously (Clarke and Reed, 1994; Tsur and Zemel, 1996; Gjerde et al.,
1999; Nævdal, 2006; Nævdal and Oppenheimer, 2007). In contrast, the welfare changes in
our model derive from the explicit changes in system dynamics and depend on how optimal
policy adjusts to tipping points.
    More closely related work in the resources literature develops models that shift system
dynamics upon crossing a threshold (Heal, 1984; Brozović and Schlenker, 2011; Polasky
et al., 2011; de Zeeuw and Zemel, 2012). Our analytic model is more general than these
stylized models, adds learning and ambiguity, and provides new insights into the equilibrium
conditions that drive optimal policies in the face of tipping points. In particular, as in
Tsur and Zemel (1996), learning enables our decision-maker to realize that already-explored
regions of the state space are free of thresholds. The most closely related numerical work
is by Keller et al. (2004), who model a threshold that alters ocean circulation. In contrast
to their approach, we use a recursive dynamic programming framework that enables us to
include endogenous learning and annual stochasticity. Further, we directly model the effect
of a tipping point on climate dynamics rather than approximating its effects by shifting the
damage function.
    The probability of incurring a tipping point is less understood than are the distributions
governing many stochastic processes. For instance, in our climate application, the probability
of crossing a temperature threshold is less confidently known than is interannual tempera-
ture variability. We employ a recent model of ambiguity attitude based on Klibanoff et al.
(2005, 2009) and Traeger (2010) to express the decision-maker’s relative lack of confidence
in threshold probabilities as opposed to the probabilities governing more standard risks.2
We demonstrate that ambiguity aversion generally has an “ambiguous” effect on optimal
policies and analyze the determinants of its impact. In our numerical climate change appli-
   2
    Keynes (1921), Knight (1921), and Ellsberg (1961) each suggested distinguishing confidence in different
types of uncertainty.

cation, we find that ambiguity aversion slightly increases the optimal carbon tax. Previous
work on ambiguity in the climate change context either uses abstract two-period models or
evaluates exogenous policy paths (Lange and Treich, 2008; Millner et al., 2010). We are not
aware of any work analyzing ambiguity in the context of tipping points or analyzing smooth
ambiguity aversion in a dynamic, optimizing integrated assessment model.
    Sections 2 and 3 introduce the general model and analytically describe how anticipating
tipping points affects optimal policy. Sections 4 and 5 present our numerical integrated
assessment model of climate change and show the expected optimal carbon tax and optimal
temperature path. Section 6 discusses implications of learning and system inertia for optimal
policy paths. We conclude in Section 7. The online appendix provides the complete model
description, additional results, and derivations.


2       Modeling tipping points
Our tipping points are irreversible shifts in system dynamics that occur upon crossing a
threshold in the state space. The policymaker does not know the precise location of the
threshold. The probability of a tipping point occurring (i.e., the hazard rate) is endogenous.
It depends on the evolution of the state variables, which in turn depend on policy choices as
well as on the stochastics governing system dynamics. The policymaker learns that regions in
the state space she has already visited are free of tipping points.3 Crossing the threshold shifts
the world from the “pre-threshold” regime to a “post-threshold” regime with permanently
altered system dynamics. Optimal pre- and post-threshold policies together determine the
welfare loss triggered by the tipping point.
    The policymaker solves an infinite-horizon dynamic optimization problem. Optimal pol-
icy at time t depends on the vector St of state variables. We denote the value of the optimal
policy program by Vψ (St ).4 The parameter ψ indicates whether V is the value function for
the pre-threshold regime (ψ = 0) or for the post-threshold regime (ψ = 1). In general, the
threshold is an unknown function of the state variables. In the case of climate change, the
threshold is the temperature level. Once the threshold is crossed, system dynamics change
irreversibly. Returning state variables to earlier values does not restore the original dynam-
ics. In our climate application, the new dynamics include melted ice sheets, large methane
    3
      The more of the relevant state space that is already explored without crossing the threshold, the more
likely that the threshold is in the remaining unexplored state space. Some region of the relevant state space
might not be explored even under policies optimized without considering tipping point possibilities. The
probability mass on the permanently unexplored region can be interpreted as the chance that there is no
tipping point.
    4
      In our numerical application, each value function Vψ (·) will be non-stationary. We absorb this non-
stationarity in the the state vector by making time t a component of St .

releases, or disrupted forest ecosystems; lowering temperature would not undo any of these
changes over policy-relevant timescales. Similarly, macroeconomic changes can permanently
alter expectations and institutions. Optimal policy in the pre-threshold regime must consider
its effect on both the pre- and post-threshold value functions, but once the state variables
cross the threshold, optimal policy depends only on post-threshold dynamics. Therefore, we
solve the model recursively, starting with the post-threshold problem and then substituting
the solution into the pre-threshold problem.
    In the post-threshold world, we obtain our value (and policy) functions from solving the
following Bellman equation:

                                    xt ∈ Γ(St ) .

Here, xt is the vector of time t control variables, u(·) is the utility derived from time t
consumption, and βt is the discount factor.5 Constraints on the controls are captured by
the set Γ(St ). The transition function g1 (·) characterizes post-threshold dynamics. At time
t, the next period’s state vector is St+1 . It depends on the vector t of independently and
identically distributed stochastic shocks whose distribution is characterized by the probabil-
ity measure IP. The decision-maker maximizes the sum of immediate utility and discounted
expected future welfare. The value function V1 is defined as the fixed point of equation (1)
and determines welfare after crossing the threshold. The welfare change from crossing the
threshold depends on the state variables at the time of crossing and, thus, on the policy path
chosen prior to crossing.
    Prior to crossing a threshold, the value of the optimal policy program is given by the

     The dependence of the discount factor βt on time can arise as a consequence of reformulating utility
and normalizing consumption and state variables. In our climate change application, we use effective labor
units for consumption and capital and transform the population-weighted utility function of per capita
consumption into the form stated above (Crost and Traeger, 2010).

                          xt ∈ Γ(St ) .

The pre-threshold value function captures the possibility of crossing the threshold. The
endogenous hazard h (St , St+1 ) determines the risk of crossing the threshold between the
current and the next period. This probability generally depends on the current state variables
and on how they change from one period to the next.6 With probability 1 − h, the system
dynamics stay unaltered and V0 characterizes future welfare. With probability h, the system
tips and V1 determines future welfare from period t + 1 on. Because of the stochasticity in
the equations of motion, we take expectations over the next period’s value functions and
over the hazard rate (via the integral). Once we have solved equation (1) for V1 , we find V0
as the fixed point of equation (2).
    Finally, we generalize the welfare evaluation in equation (2) to recognize that we often
know little about the distribution governing the threshold location. By assumption, we have
no records of having recently crossed a threshold, and abrupt changes in system dynamics
do not lend themselves to accurate forecasting. Tipping point possibilities therefore exhibit
a deeper uncertainty in the sense that the probabilities governing tipping points are less
confidently known than are well-measured probability distributions. The smooth ambiguity
model captures this distinction between well-known probabilities, here our annually observed
stochasticity captured by t , and more subjective and less confidently known uncertainty, here
our hazard rate h. An ambiguity-averse decision-maker is more averse to the less confidently
known tipping point uncertainty than to the risk posed by the random shock. To capture

    In general, the state space contains informational variables that tell the decision-maker which part of
the state space has already been explored. In our climate application, the decision-maker keeps track of the
greatest historic temperature.

The concave function famb captures smooth ambiguity aversion (Klibanoff et al., 2005, 2009),
or intertemporal risk aversion to subjective uncertainty (Traeger, 2010). When famb is linear,
equation (3) reduces to the ambiguity-neutral form in equation (2). Behavioral evidence
supports a concave famb as a descriptive model of many decision-makers (Camerer and Weber,
1992). Further, when the von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms are extended to recognize that
a decision-maker can have differing confidence in different distributions, concave famb is
consistent with normatively attractive preferences (Traeger, 2010).


3         The effects of tipping points on optimal policy
We now identify the channels by which tipping points affect optimal policy. The possible
existence of a tipping point introduces two new terms into the marginal welfare impact
of changing a control. For ease of exposition, we analyze the case where a single state
variable determines the chance of crossing the threshold. The right-hand side of equation (3)
characterizes welfare for an optimal choice of the controls (with optimality denoted by ∗ ).
We evaluate the marginal welfare impact of varying a generic entry et of the control vector in
the neighborhood of the optimum. In our climate change application, the temperature state
variable determines the hazard, and the welfare impact of varying emissions determines the
optimal carbon tax. Suppressing all arguments independent of et , the value of the optimal
policy program is:

where primes (0 ) indicate derivatives.7 We interpret this equation for the case where an
increase in et raises current utility but decreases expected future welfare. For instance,
additional carbon dioxide emissions increase current utility but decrease future welfare by
generating higher carbon stocks and temperatures; additional borrowing increases current
consumption but also increases future debt; and a political elite’s appropriation of resources
and repression increase social discontent and hamper growth. We assume for now that famb
is the identity function, which implies an ambiguity-neutral decision-maker.
    The left-hand side of equation (4) characterizes the (immediate) benefits from increasing
the policy variable. At the optimum, these benefits must balance the expected future costs.
The costs are represented by the right-hand side of equation (4) and are subject to uncertainty
(captured by the integration). The integrand in the first line represents the impact of policy
on time t + 1 welfare under the pre-threshold regime (i.e., on the pre-threshold continuation
value). This impact is composed of the control’s impact on the state vector and the effect
of the altered state vector on pre-threshold value V0 , and it is weighted by the probability
of staying in the pre-threshold regime (1 − h). In a world without tipping points (where
the hazard rate h is zero), the first line characterizes the full trade-off between current and
future welfare.
    The possibility of imminent tipping points introduces the second and third lines into the
optimal policy trade-off: altering et now also changes time t + 1 welfare in the post-threshold
world (second line) and changes the probability of entering the post-threshold world (third
line). The first two lines together give the expected marginal welfare effect of increasing et
in situations where the immediate hazard rate h is exogenous. These lines adjust a model
without tipping points to account for the different marginal effect of the control et on pre-

and post-threshold welfare. We therefore call this adjustment the differential welfare impact
(DWI):

                                                   ∂V1 ∂St+1 (e∗t )

where we maintain the assumption of ambiguity neutrality. The DWI is proportional to
the hazard rate and to the difference in the marginal impact of the control on the pre- and
post-threshold value functions. If increasing the control decreases welfare relatively more
in the post-threshold regime, then the differential welfare impact makes raising the control
more costly.
    The third line in equation (4) only arises when the tipping point’s probability is endoge-
nous. In this case, a change in the control et affects the hazard rate. The optimal policy now
has to account for this marginal change in the hazard rate in response to a change in the
control. We call this contribution the marginal hazard effect (MHE). The MHE is composed
of the response of the hazard rate to a change in the state vector (term i), the response of the
state vector to a change in the control (term ii), and the total welfare change from switching
regimes (term iii). For the tipping points in our climate application, increasing emissions
raises the hazard rate and the welfare difference [V0 − V1 ] is always positive. Therefore, the
MHE increases the cost of emissions relative to a case without tipping points. In general, a
change in the current control could also increase hazard rates at future times. Possible future
tipping points are included in the pre-threshold continuation value V0 . If the current control
alters the probability of crossing a threshold in the future, then ∂V0 /∂St+1 will include this
effect.
    In summary, anticipating possible tipping points adjusts the first-order conditions gov-
erning optimal policy for the differential impact of the control on pre- and post-threshold
welfare (DWI) and for the control’s effect on the immediate hazard rate (MHE). In our cli-
mate change application, the effects of DWI and MHE together increase the optimal carbon
tax. If we instead consider additional borrowing by a highly indebted state, additional debt
increases the risk of altering investors’ beliefs about solvency and so tipping into a credit
regime with high interest rates on sovereign debt (MHE). This change in dynamics can lead
to default. In October of 2011, Eurozone leaders managed the post-tipping dynamics by
negotiating “haircuts” on Greek debt. However, this type of post-threshold management
can result in a DWI effect that reduces a country’s incentive to avoid the tipping point.
If other highly indebted countries in the monetary union count on a similar post-threshold
“haircut”, their cost of taking up additional debt is reduced because, in case of tipping, they
only have to pay back a fraction of the debt. Here the DWI acts as a benefit, reducing the

cost of the tipping point for each individual nation.
    In another example, a political elite that appropriates its country’s resources has to
account for the increased risk of an uprising that puts an end to its rule (MHE). We consider
two possible post-threshold scenarios. In the first, a successful uprising puts a clear end to
power and wealth. Then the DWI merely adjusts the elite’s calculus by eliminating payoffs
in the event of losing power. It increases the cost of tipping and, in general, reduces its
optimized likelihood. This scenario is equivalent to a model with constant post-threshold
utility and endogenous tipping risk. In the second, a successful uprising puts an end to the
elite’s power but does not affect its previously accumulated wealth. If money and power
are substitutes, the value of a marginal unit of wealth would be larger in the post-threshold
regime. The DWI now works in the opposite direction from the first scenario, increasing the
optimized likelihood of a tipping point.
    We now consider the consequences of ambiguity aversion. An ambiguity-averse decision-
maker is additionally averse to the types of poorly understood uncertainty that characterize
tipping points. A strictly concave function famb captures her additional aversion to tipping
point uncertainty. Our extended definition of DWI now collects all the changes in the first
two lines of equation (4) with respect to the continuation value:

These changes capture the effect of an exogenous hazard and its interaction with ambiguity
aversion. In our interpretation, we assume that increasing the control (e.g., emitting an
additional unit) reduces future welfare more in the post-threshold regime than in the pre-
threshold regime (DW I neutral > 0).8 For an ambiguity-averse decision-maker who faces a
welfare-decreasing tipping point, the concavity of famb implies f 0 (V0 ) < f 0 (Vef f ) < f 0 (V1 ).
Therefore, the first term’s contribution to DW I ambig in equation (6) is negative, while the
second term’s contribution is positive. For a small hazard rate and a second-order expansion
   8
    In our climate application, the current control interacts with future threshold crossings even if a threshold
is not crossed in the current period. Damages increase faster with emissions in the post-threshold world,
which raises DWI. However, at the same time pre-threshold emissions can trigger future tipping via the delay
in the temperature equation (see appendix), which decreases the DWI. Our simulations suggest that these
conflicting effects do produce DW I neutral < 0 in some cases.

ambiguity aversion is zero for an ambiguity-neutral decision-maker and is positive for an
ambiguity-averse decision-maker. The effect captured in the second line relates closely to
how ambiguity aversion adjusts the pre-threshold value function. When DW I neutral > 0,
the first line increases the marginal cost of the control while the second line decreases it. In
our climate change application, the second line’s contribution is often the larger one, making
ambiguity aversion decrease the optimal carbon tax.
    Ambiguity aversion also affects the marginal hazard effect (MHE) via term iii in the third

The first term in brackets is the ambiguity-neutral contribution. The fraction characterizes
the ambiguity contribution. It is unity for an ambiguity-neutral decision-maker and when

                            −V0 ]
                                         . Given the concavity of famb , this condition has to be satisfied
for some Vef f and, thus, for some hazard h. If the hazard is lower than this critical value,
       0
then famb    [Vef f ] is also lower and ambiguity aversion amplifies the MHE. This insight relates
closely to the common finding that ambiguity aversion increases the effective weight of low-
probability catastrophic events (pessimism bias). If the hazard is greater than the critical
value, ambiguity aversion reduces MHE. The intuition is familiar from the standard risk
setting: a risk-averse agent is not always willing to pay more for a risk reduction than is a
risk-neutral agent.9 Here, the MHE captures willingness to pay for a marginal reduction in
the tipping point hazard. In our climate change application, the annual hazard rate is small,
   9
    The more risk-averse (ambiguity-averse) the decision-maker, the more he values wealth in bad states
relative to good states. Giving up wealth for a hazard reduction makes an ambiguity-averse decision-maker
even worse off if the bad outcome happens. If a hazard is large enough and costly enough to reduce, he
prefers carrying wealth into the post-threshold world over spending it on reducing the hazard.

leading ambiguity aversion to always increase the MHE and so the optimal carbon tax.
    In general, the effect of increasing ambiguity aversion is less easily determined than that
of a high or low hazard rate. Increasing ambiguity aversion for a given hazard rate has two
effects. First, increasing ambiguity aversion reduces the mean value Vef f , decreasing the
                                                                                         0
ambiguity multiplier. Second, increasing ambiguity aversion changes the derivative famb      at
a given value (relative to the secant). For the case of small hazard rates as in our climate
change application, a first-order expansion in h pins down the effect of increasing ambiguity
aversion. Employing once more a second-order expansion of famb (see appendix), we obtain
the following approximation of the ambiguity multiplier:

                 famb [V0 ] − famb [V1 ]

                             order zero                 first-order correction

For a sufficiently small hazard, the ambiguity multiplier increases proportionally to the mea-
sure of absolute ambiguity aversion. As the hazard becomes larger, the first-order correction
reduces the ambiguity effect. The hazard rate in our climate change application is sufficiently
small that the first-order correction is negligible. On the whole, we find that ambiguity aver-
sion alters both channels by which tipping points affect optimal policy. Because our climate
change application has a small annual hazard, ambiguity aversion primarily increases the
ambiguity-neutral MHE in proportion to the measure of absolute ambiguity aversion.


4      A climate-economy model with tipping points, learn-
       ing, and ambiguity
We now consider the effect of climate tipping points on the optimal carbon tax. The optimal
carbon tax equals the social cost of carbon when evaluated along the optimal policy path in
a welfare-maximizing integrated assessment model.
    We reformulate the benchmark Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy
(DICE) from Nordhaus (2008) as an infinite-horizon dynamic programming problem with
a tipping point in the climate system, optimal learning about the threshold that triggers a
tipping point, and a generalized welfare evaluation.10 DICE is a Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans
  10
    The appendix provides the model equations. The standard DICE model is a nonlinear programming
problem with constant system dynamics. For previous work using recursive versions of DICE, see Kelly and

growth model that has an aggregate world economy interacting with a climate module (Fig-
ure 1). Gross economic output (or potential gross world product) is determined by an
endogenous capital stock, an exogenously growing labor force, and exogenously improving
production technology. Gross output produces carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions. Non-abated
CO2 emissions accumulate in the atmosphere and ultimately translate into global warm-
ing, which causes damage proportional to world output. Cumulative temperature change
affects the total output available for allocation by the policymaker. The control variables are
abatement and consumption, and residual output not allocated to these two options becomes
capital investment. The state variables are capital per effective unit of labor, the stock of
CO2 in the atmosphere, the change in global mean surface temperature since 1900, and, to
keep track of exogenously evolving variables, time.
    A tipping point irreversibly changes the climate system from its conventional representa-
tion in DICE to a new regime with altered dynamics. The tipping point occurs upon crossing
some unknown temperature threshold. Emission decisions determine the future CO2 stock,
thereby affecting future temperatures and the probability that a tipping point occurs. The
decision-maker anticipates how he would choose emissions and consumption in the post-
threshold world. The timing, probability, and welfare consequences of a regime switch are
endogenous because they depend on the policies chosen before and after the threshold occurs.
    To model tipping points, we specialize the recursive structure from Section 2 to DICE.
We have one dynamic programming problem for the post-threshold world and another for the
pre-threshold world. The pre-threshold world has standard DICE dynamics along with the
tipping possibility and temperature shocks calibrated to the historical record. A tipping point
produces the post-threshold world by irreversibly changing the standard dynamics. We first
solve the post-threshold problem and then use its solution in the pre-threshold problem. We
numerically solve each dynamic programming problem for the unknown value function using

function iteration. Employing a projection method, we approximate the value functions by
Chebychev polynomials and use collocation at the Chebychev nodes in the four-dimensional
state space (Miranda and Fackler, 2002).
    We evaluate two tipping points of prominent concern in the climate science literature.11
In every model run, the policymaker faces a single tipping point and knows in advance what
its effects would be. The first tipping point increases the climate feedbacks that amplify
global warming (arrow a in Figure 1), and the second increases the atmospheric lifetime of
CO2 (arrow b in Figure 1). The first tipping point therefore increases the effect of emissions
on temperature, and the second increases the time during which emissions affect the climate.
The climate science literature has compiled a number of pathways by which tipping points
could abruptly change the strength of feedbacks that determine surface temperature. As one
example, warming could mobilize large methane stores locked in permafrost and in ice lattices
(clathrates) in the shallow ocean (Hall and Behl, 2006; Archer, 2007; Schaefer et al., 2011).
If warming mobilizes these methane stocks, they would cause further warming that could
mobilize additional stocks. As another example, if land ice sheets begin to retreat on decadal
timescales, the resulting loss of reflective ice could double the long-term warming predicted
by models that hold land ice sheets fixed (Hansen et al., 2008). Temperature dynamics in
DICE depend on a parameter known as climate sensitivity, which is the equilibrium warming
from doubling CO2 . The value of 3◦ C used in DICE is inferred from climate models that
hold land ice sheets and most methane stocks constant. We represent a climate feedback
tipping point as increasing climate sensitivity to 4◦ C, 5◦ C, or 6◦ C.
    The second tipping point reflects the possibility that carbon sinks weaken beyond the
predictions of coupled climate-carbon cycle models. Warming-induced changes in oceans
(Le Quéré et al., 2007), soil carbon dynamics (Eglin et al., 2010), and standing biomass
(Huntingford et al., 2008) could affect the uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere. We represent
these weakened sinks by decreasing the transfer of CO2 out of the atmosphere by 25%, 50%,
or 75%. The reader may think of this tipping point as reducing the long-term “decay rate” of
atmospheric CO2 . If the threshold triggers a strong form of this tipping point, then the flow
of carbon from land and ocean sinks back into the atmosphere can temporarily outweigh the
flow of carbon out of the atmosphere. These flows can result in a temporarily negative decay
rate as the earth system comes to a new equilibrium with more CO2 in the atmosphere.
    The system passes from the pre-threshold regime (ψt = 0) into the post-threshold regime
(ψt+1 = 1) when cumulative temperature change Tt+1 crosses an unknown threshold T̃ . Every
  11
    Each modeled tipping point is an extreme case: climate dynamics change severely, abruptly, and irre-
versibly. The scientific literature does not offer clear guidance on the best way to model a given tipping point,
so we translate two common tipping stories into DICE’s reduced climate system in order to gain intuition
about policy implications.

temperature between the maximum temperature previously reached and an upper bound T̄
has an equal chance of being the threshold, meaning T̃ is uniformly distributed between the
historic maximum and T̄ .12 In our base case model runs, we use T̄ = 4.27◦ C so that the
year 2005 expected value for the threshold is 2.5◦ C.13 Sensitivity analyses vary T̄ between
3◦ C and 9◦ C, implying year 2005 expected values of about 1.9◦ C to 4.9◦ C. The probability
of crossing the threshold between periods t and t + 1 conditional on not having crossed the
threshold by time t is:14

This expression is the hazard of crossing the tipping point. As the world reaches higher
temperatures without reaching a threshold, the decision-maker learns that the threshold is
above the current temperature and updates his beliefs by moving probability density from the
newly safe region to the remaining unexplored temperatures. Therefore, as the world safely
reaches higher temperatures, each unit of temperature increase creates a greater hazard than
it did at lower temperatures. The state variable Tt that controls the threshold crossing is
a climate variable whose equation of motion is determined by CO2 concentrations and does
not reflect annual stochastic fluctuations.
    As noted in discussing equation (3), the function famb captures smooth ambiguity aver-
sion (Klibanoff et al., 2005, 2009), or intertemporal risk aversion under subjective uncertainty
(Traeger, 2010). We use the term “subjective uncertainty” to describe uncertain outcomes
when there is less information available for determining probabilities. This deficiency in
probabilistic knowledge applies to climate tipping points, which are less understood than
other climate phenomena (Alley et al., 2003; Lenton et al., 2008; Ramanathan and Feng,
2008; Kriegler et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2009). Sticking to isoelastic preferences, we adopt the
                                          1−γ
power function famb (V ) = ((1 − η)V ) 1−η . Here γ is a measure of Arrow-Pratt relative risk
  12
      The optimal policy path in the absence of tipping points reaches a maximum temperature of 3.33◦ C.
Our model with T̄ > 3.33 is therefore equivalent to one with the uniform distribution’s upper bound at
3.33◦ C and probability (T̄ − 3.33)/(T̄ − Tt ) that there is no threshold.
   13
      Using E2005 T̃ = 2.5◦ C is consistent with the political 2◦ C limits for avoiding dangerous anthropogenic
interference. Further, in Smith et al. (2009), 2.5◦ C is in the upper end of the temperature region that
produces significant risk of large-scale discontinuities and is just below the temperatures that produce severe
risk.
   14
      In DICE-2007, the CO2 stock increases monotonically until the model reaches a sufficiently high level of
abatement. From this point on, the “decay” of CO2 outweighs the flow of emissions, making the CO2 stock
decrease monotonically. Temperature in DICE follows the same pattern. When temperature is increasing, the
probability of crossing the threshold is proportional to the difference between the next period’s temperature
and the current temperature. When temperature is decreasing, the probability of crossing the threshold is
0. As long as temperature is a quasiconcave function of time, we do not need an additional state variable to
keep track of the highest historic temperature.

aversion with respect to subjective or poorly understood uncertainty and η is the constant
Arrow-Pratt measure of relative risk aversion used in the standard DICE utility function. The
subjective uncertainty contrasts with the standard risk posed by the historically-grounded
temperature stochasticity and governed by IP (see appendix). If Arrow-Pratt risk aversion
with respect to subjective risk γ coincides with standard risk aversion η, the function famb
is linear and drops out. In that case, the policymaker is ambiguity-neutral and the welfare
evaluation is as in DICE. However, when γ > η, the function famb measures the policy-
maker’s additional aversion to ambiguity (or subjectivity of belief) governing tipping points
as opposed to annual temperature stochasticity.


5      The optimal carbon tax when facing possible tipping
       points
We compare several sets of model runs to assess how the optimal carbon tax responds to
the type of tipping point considered, to the strength of a tipping point, to prior beliefs
about the temperature threshold location, and to aversion to tipping point ambiguity. The
optimal carbon tax is the policy trajectory that maximizes the present value of net benefits
within our extension of the benchmark DICE integrated assessment model. All of our graphs
present results conditional on not having crossed the threshold: we want to understand how
optimal policy changes in the face of a potential tipping point. The depicted paths draw the
multiplicative temperature shock at its expected value in each period. Each graph compares
the baseline scenario without tipping point awareness to runs with tipping points of various
strengths. The appendix contains additional results.
    Figure 2 gives the effect of tipping points on the optimal carbon tax (social cost of carbon),
the optimal CO2 concentration path, and the optimal temperature path. The figure assumes
ambiguity neutrality and the base case prior over the threshold location. The year 2015
optimal carbon tax is near $10/tCO2 in the absence of tipping points, the strongest version
of the feedback tipping point increases it to $13.5/tCO2 , and the strongest version of the
carbon sink tipping point increases it to $14/tCO2 . While tipping point possibilities have
only a modest effect on near-term abatement, they can nonetheless have a large effect on
cumulative abatement because they increase the optimal tax by proportionally more later in
the century.15 The optimal path without possible tipping points produces a peak temperature
(CO2 concentration) of 3.3◦ C (637 ppm), reached in the year 2187 (2163). The optimal tax
  15
    The climate feedback tipping points have their greatest proportional effect on the optimal carbon tax
shortly after 2100, while the proportional effect of the carbon sink tipping points peaks shortly after 2050.
The appendix plots how abatement and other variables respond to each tipping point possibility.

path in the presence of the weak climate feedback tipping point reduces this peak temperature
to 3.0◦ C (592 ppm), while the higher taxes justified by the strong climate feedback tipping
point further reduce peak temperature to 2.8◦ C (560 ppm). The tax path in the presence
of the weak carbon sink tipping point reduces peak temperature only to 3.2◦ C (617 ppm),
while the possibility of the strong carbon sink tipping point reduces peak temperature to
3.0◦ C (588 ppm). By reducing peak temperature and CO2 , the decision-maker reduces the
cumulative probability of crossing the temperature threshold. The stronger the anticipated
tipping point, the more output the decision-maker devotes to reducing this probability.
    By explicitly modeling the effects of tipping points on system dynamics and the ability
to adapt policy to the new dynamics, we learn how different types of tipping points can
have qualitatively different effects on optimal policy. In comparison to the carbon sink
tipping points, the climate feedback tipping points affect the optimal carbon tax relatively
less in the near-term but relatively more later in the century. When the feedback threshold
is crossed, the policymaker responds by sharply increasing abatement. If the threshold
is crossed when the CO2 stock is still relatively low, then optimal post-threshold policy
prevents CO2 from rising much more and limits the additional warming due to higher climate
sensitivity. However, if the threshold is crossed when the CO2 stock is already relatively high,
then even sharply increased abatement cannot rapidly reduce the CO2 stock and the higher
climate sensitivity produces greater warming along the optimal policy path. Crossing the
feedback threshold is therefore more expensive at a high CO2 stock than at a low CO2 stock.
The feedback tipping point’s increment to the optimal carbon tax increases over time as
the CO2 stock increases. In comparison, the carbon sink tipping point affects policies more
evenly over time. Tipping in an early time period with low atmospheric carbon stocks can
induce a net flow of carbon from the land and ocean reservoirs into the atmosphere. This
temporary flow raises the CO2 concentration independently of abatement policy and imposes
high costs even when crossing the threshold at a relatively low CO2 concentration.
    Recognizing the present inability of climate science to provide a probability distribution
for the temperature threshold, we now consider the implications of more and less diffuse priors
for the threshold location and of aversion to the ambiguity in the threshold’s distribution.
Figure 3 plots the year 2015 optimal carbon tax and the peak temperature for values of
T̄ between 3◦ C and 9◦ C, with all calculations still being for optimal policy paths under
ambiguity neutrality and conditional on not having crossed the threshold. As the upper
bound T̄ increases, optimal policy converges asymptotically to the scenario without a tipping
point. A more diffuse prior on the threshold location reduces the importance of the tipping
point contributions in equation (4) by reducing both the hazard rate and its derivative.
Lowering T̄ from its base case value has a stronger effect on optimal policy than does raising

T̄ . For low values of T̄ , the hazard rate is a steeper function of emissions (raising MHE) and
realized temperatures can approach regions with a high hazard rate (raising DWI). When
T̄ = 3◦ C, the optimal carbon tax in 2015 rises as high as $16.5/tCO2 for the strong tipping
points, with temperature peaking just above 2.5◦ C.
     Finally, we turn to the effect of ambiguity aversion on optimal policy. Figure 4 varies
γ from ambiguity-neutral (γ = 2 = η) to extremely ambiguity-averse (γ = 100 > 2 = η).
We find that optimal policy is not highly sensitive to the policymaker’s level of ambiguity
aversion. The near-term carbon tax varies by less than $2/tCO2 across the modeled range
of γ, the peak CO2 concentration varies by less than 20 ppm, and peak temperature varies
by less than 0.2◦ C. Ambiguity aversion decreases DWI and raises MHE. However, because
of the small annual hazard, its effect on MHE is more significant. Equation (9) shows that
this amplification is proportional to the total welfare loss from crossing the threshold and
to the measure of absolute ambiguity aversion (near 3 for γ = 100). Ambiguity aversion
therefore increases the MHE by more for stronger tipping points that have more severe

welfare implications, and the effect of ambiguity aversion on the optimal tax grows as the
welfare loss from crossing a tipping point grows over time. For the middle climate feedback
tipping point, the extreme form of ambiguity aversion with γ = 100 increases the optimal
carbon tax by 6% in 2015 and by 12% in 2050. For the middle carbon sink tipping point,
the extreme form of ambiguity aversion also increases the optimal carbon tax by 6% in 2015,
but increases it by only 7% in 2050.16 Tipping point evaluation has to acknowledge that
threshold distributions are, by necessity, guesstimates rather than objective probabilities. In
our application, ambiguity aversion always increases the social cost of carbon. The effect on
policy of varying ambiguity aversion across our scenarios is slightly smaller than the effect
of varying the strength of a tipping point.


6      Policy implications of system inertia in the presence
       of learning
How does learning affect the optimal trajectories in a model with tipping points? How does
inertia in the climate system alter the implications of learning? We first describe qualitative
implications of Bayesian learning in general optimally controlled systems with irreversible
  16
     Note from Figure 4 that the effect of greater ambiguity aversion becomes more pronounced later in
the century for the climate feedback tipping point. With the carbon sink tipping point, the approximate
constancy of the ambiguity effect over time means that greater ambiguity aversion has about the same effect
late in the century as in the beginning of the century.

tipping points. We then highlight the importance of explicitly capturing inertia when un-
dertaking quantitative analysis of optimal climate policy. In particular, when information
about threshold locations depends on the evolution of state variables, the form of the optimal
policy trajectory is sensitive to how precisely immediate policy controls the next period’s
state variables. While most deterministic integrated assessments of climate change capture
inertia, many models with uncertainty or learning do not.17 The basic insight underlying this
section is that, in the absence of inertia, it is eventually optimal to maintain temperature
for a long time at the highest level learned to be safe. However, with inertia in the sys-
tem, temperature only peaks once the CO2 concentration is already falling. The policy that
would keep temperature constant must change significantly from period to period, making
it inefficient to keep temperature constant for an extended time.
    Optimal policy sets emissions so that marginal abatement cost equals marginal damage
in each period. Because marginal abatement cost falls exogenously over time in DICE,
abatement increases over time. Tipping point possibilities increase marginal damage through
the MHE, but as long as temperature has been monotonically increasing, learning makes
the MHE depend on whether the next period’s temperature is above the current period’s
temperature. The marginal damage curve therefore has a discontinuity at the emission level
ê(M, T, t) that keeps temperature constant in a period.18 For emissions above ê (point a in
Figure 5a), marginal damage includes the effect of emissions on tipping point possibilities.
At ê, however, marginal damage depends on whether it is assessed relative to the next unit
of emissions or relative to the last unit of emissions: the damages caused by the next abated
unit are strictly higher than the cost of abating that unit, but abatement cost is in turn
strictly higher than the damages caused by the last abated unit (point b). The policymaker
therefore holds emissions fixed at ê. As abatement cost falls, emissions move to a part of the
marginal damage curve that does not include threshold possibilities (points c and d) because
temperature stays in the region that has been shown to be safe.
    If there were no inertia in atmospheric warming, each period’s temperature would be
determined wholly by its CO2 stock. In that case, the policymaker could more directly steer
the state variable triggering the tipping point, making it efficient to set the optimal policy
so that temperature sticks for an extended time to the boundary of the safe region (“state
stickiness”). We demonstrate this qualitative feature by implementing the climate feedback

      For instance, of the work in the resources literature that studies catastrophes or shifts in dynamics,
Gjerde et al. (1999), Keller et al. (2004), and Nævdal and Oppenheimer (2007) model inertia. The majority
do not model inertia (e.g., Heal, 1984; Clarke and Reed, 1994; Tsur and Zemel, 1996; Nævdal, 2006; Brozović
and Schlenker, 2011; Polasky et al., 2011; de Zeeuw and Zemel, 2012).
   18
      The emission level that keeps temperature constant depends on current temperature and CO2 because
of the climate system’s inertia (discussed below) and depends on time because of exogenous variables that
affect forcing and non-industrial emissions (see appendix).

qualitative differences in policy paths, not for quantitative differences that are sensitive to
the different model calibrations. The dashed and dotted lines completely overlap in the full

tipping point in a model without temperature inertia.19 Figure 5b shows the qualitative
difference in the optimal expected temperature curve between this model without inertia
and our DICE extension with inertia. Optimal policy in the model without warming delay
keeps temperature constant over most of the next century, whereas optimal policy in our full
model shows no such stickiness. In the flat temperature region of the model without inertia,
the next unit of emissions causes enough damage (via tipping point risk) to make abatement
cost-effective, but the last unit of emission causes far less damage (Figure 5c).20 Eventually
abatement cost falls far enough that it becomes worth abating additional emissions, at which
point the damage curves for the next and the last unit of emissions merge again. In the full
model with inertia, emissions only have a small immediate effect on temperature (reducing
the MHE) and optimal policy stabilizes temperatures only once carbon concentrations are
already falling. At this point, temperature would remain constant only if emissions increased,
which usually is not optimal (Figure 5d). At the same time, the MHE that gives rise to the
marginal damage discontinuity is smaller because emissions have a smaller impact on the
immediate probability of tipping the system.21


7      Conclusions
We have shown how to model economic decisions in the face of irreversible tipping points
triggered by policy-dependent thresholds. We analytically demonstrated that tipping points
affect optimal policy via two channels: the differential welfare impact (DWI) recognizes
that today’s policy choices affect welfare in case a tipping point occurs, and the marginal
hazard effect (MHE) recognizes that today’s policy choices affect the probability of crossing
the threshold. Ambiguity aversion has an ambiguous effect on both terms. In particular,
ambiguity aversion amplifies the MHE for small hazards, but can reduce the MHE for large
  19
     We model the 5◦ C climate sensitivity feedback scenario. Temperature is no longer a state variable.
We calibrate the model to the same DICE baseline without tipping points by introducing time-dependent
feedback processes. Because eliminating warming delay increases marginal damage, we calibrate these feed-
back processes to suppress the total effect of CO2 on temperature and so induce policy in line with DICE.
The different temperature dynamics and model calibration warn against comparing precise numerical effects
between these models with and without inertia.
  20
     We calculate marginal abatement costs from the optimal abatement policy, and we calculate marginal
damage from the value function as in Section 3. We can therefore calculate the value of additional abatement
even after reaching full abatement. The differences in these calculations lead to the small offset between the
solid line and the dashed and dotted lines over the period when temperature is non-constant. The marginal
damage curve jumps down upon eliminating the MHE by keeping temperature constant.
  21
     In the full model with inertia, additional emissions do affect the probability of crossing the threshold
in future periods, but MHE only captures the effect of additional emissions on the probability of crossing a
threshold in the current period. The impact of future tipping risk on the social cost of carbon is captured
directly in the continuation value.

    Our numerical application developed a dynamic climate-economy model that includes the
endogenous possibility of climatic tipping points, endogenous learning about the temperature
threshold triggering tipping points, endogenous welfare implications of tipping points, and
a generalized welfare evaluation that allows the policymaker to display ambiguity aversion.
We find that the possibility of tipping points in the climate system raises the optimal carbon
tax. Because of the small annual probability of crossing a climate threshold, these tipping
points primarily affect the optimal carbon tax via the MHE, which is amplified by ambiguity
aversion. The tipping point increment to the social cost of carbon is not merely a function of
the current period’s DWI and MHE but is also determined by how current emissions change
“tipping lotteries” in all future periods. The climate system’s warming delay can trigger
future threshold crossings even if future CO2 concentrations are stable.
    Quantitatively, our base case tipping point possibilities can increase the near-term opti-
mal carbon tax by around 40%. The precise effect is sensitive to the type of tipping point,
to the strength of the tipping point, and to the distribution for the threshold that triggers
the tipping point. Carbon sink tipping points more strongly affect the near-term carbon tax,
but climate feedback tipping points have an increasing effect over time and thereby more
strongly reduce optimal peak temperature and CO2 . This result demonstrates the value
of explicitly modeling tipping points’ effects on system dynamics (endogenizing the welfare
change). The importance of the MHE demonstrates the importance of endogenizing tipping
point possibilities. Ambiguity aversion raises the optimal carbon tax and does so by an
increasing amount over time.
    In a model with endogenous learning, tipping point possibilities create a discontinuity in
the future benefits or costs deriving from a control that affects the hazard. This discontinuity
is created by the MHE jumping discontinuously from zero to a finite value whenever exploring
new, threshold-relevant regions in the state space. It can lead policy to keep the system at
the boundary of the safe region for long intervals: going further creates the cost of a possible
tipping point. However, if dynamics are governed by a delay equation, inertia can make it
inefficient to steer along the boundary. First, inertia in a threshold-relevant state variable
limits the ability to steer the state variables along the boundary (making it prohibitively
expensive or even impossible). Second, inertia generally reduces the control’s impact on
the next period’s state variables and, thus, reduces the MHE that incentivizes steering
exactly along the boundary in the first place. In general, these results demonstrate the
value of modeling the effect of learning on optimal policies. In our climate application,
we have shown that opting not to model temperature as a delayed state variable produces
qualitatively different policy paths. When temperature delay is significant, optimal carbon

taxes and temperature do not stay constant for an extended period upon eliminating the
hazard.
    Our numerical conclusions have implications for economic modeling, climate science, and
climate policy. First, economic models of climate change typically assume smooth changes
in the climate system. More broadly, nearly all economic models dealing with growth and
long-run dynamics assume smoothly changing systems. Those models allowing for discontin-
uous changes usually incorporate exogenous penalties. We have demonstrated the value of
explicitly modeling the shifts in dynamics, explaining how feedback and carbon sink tipping
points affect optimal abatement policies in different ways. Further, we have shown that the
main effect of tipping points on optimal policy is often due to their endogeneity. It is impor-
tant to model a tipping point’s structural effects rather than reducing it to a predetermined
shock to utility, and it is important to capture the effect of policy decisions on the tipping
point hazard.
    Second, our work is a call to the climate sciences to improve knowledge about both the
effects of tipping points on system dynamics and the types of temperature paths that trig-
ger them. We have shown that different anticipated changes in dynamics can have quite
different effects on the optimal carbon tax. We demonstrate the economic value of scientific
information about tipping points and open the door to more comprehensive integrated as-
sessments of abrupt climate transitions. Our sensitivity analysis has shown that these more
comprehensive climate change assessments will benefit greatly from progress in the climate
sciences that constrains the regions and probabilities of tipping point occurrence.
    Third, our findings support the widespread supposition that the existence of tipping
points in the climate system should have a strong influence on our current policy decisions.
This influence would become stronger if we allowed the policymaker to face multiple tipping
points at once. Numerical integrated assessment models are the main quantitative input into
regulations that put a price on carbon emissions. Yet past studies omitted climatic features
we have shown to be highly relevant. We provide a quantitative basis for adjusting policy
for the possibility of tipping points. Much work remains to make tipping representations
more realistic, but we have demonstrated how to fully endogenize tipping point possibilities
and have provided a first assessment of their effect on policy.

Appendix

A        Additional numerical results for possible climate tip-
         ping points
Figure 6 gives additional results for optimal policy in the face of a possible tipping point. As
indicated by the main text’s results for the optimal tax, the tipping point possibility increases
optimal abatement, and abatement jumps down upon first eliminating threshold risk by
preventing temperature from increasing. Even though emissions jump up at this point,
temperature inertia implies that these greater emissions still decrease temperature. Possible
thresholds decrease the optimal investment rate very slightly, but they also eventually lead
to slightly greater available output due to reduced climate damages. Threshold possibilities
primarily affect the optimal tax via the interaction between current emissions and future
threshold crossings. The current period’s marginal hazard effect (MHE) is the next largest
component, but the current period’s differential welfare impact (DWI) is insignificant.
    Learning enters the model by expanding the set of safe temperatures and concentrating
probability mass on temperatures yet to be explored (Figure 7a). Therefore, as the world
reaches higher temperatures, a contemplated temperature increase poses a greater hazard
because it cuts through more probability mass (Figure 7b). Lower temperature profiles imply
both less learning and flatter hazard functions for each temperature reached (Figure 7c).
Optimal policy in the face of possible tipping points lowers the hazard rate by reducing
temperature change over time (Figure 7d).22
    Figure 8 illustrates the policy response to crossing a threshold. It assumes that the
policymaker is ignorant of the tipping point possibility until 2075, when the tipping point
actually occurs. The effect of crossing a threshold depends on how it affects system dynamics
and on how policy can compensate for the altered dynamics. The carbon tax responds more
strongly to the threshold crossing when it increases climate feedbacks. The CO2 concentra-
tion in the regime with strengthened climate feedbacks follows a lower path than in a case
without thresholds, but degraded carbon sinks produce a much higher carbon concentration
by increasing the persistence of CO2 in the atmosphere. Temperature increases under either
tipping point, but the more aggressive abatement under the climate feedback tipping point
keeps the peak temperature below levels reached under the carbon sink tipping point.
 22
      Each hazard path has a kink at the year 2100 when the exogenous non-CO2 forcing ceases to increase.

Figure 7: As the time t expected temperature increases without crossing a threshold, the
probability distribution for the threshold level T̃ places more mass on temperatures yet to

risk of crossing the threshold (b). Learning increases the hazard posed by a fixed increment
of temperature change as long as temperatures are increasing (c). The actual hazard along
the optimal path (d) also depends on the chosen emission policy. The plotted simulations
assume expected draws of the temperature shock and also assume that the tipping point
never occurs. The hazard in the cases without tipping points is calculated as if they were in
fact possible but the decision-maker is unaware of the tipping possibility.

The state variables are effective capital kt , atmospheric CO2 Mt , cumulative temperature
change Tt , and time t.24 Tipping points change the bold parameters. The controls are
consumption ct , abatement µt , and, as a residual, investment. Welfare in a given period is
the sum of immediate utility u(ct ) = c1−η
                                        t   /(1 − η) and the discounted expectation of future
welfare. The parameter η is the Arrow-Pratt measure of relative risk aversion, and η −1
gives the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. The parameter γ measures aversion to the
less confidently known tipping point uncertainty, as described in Section 4. The constraints
prevent the decision-maker from using more than the output available after accounting for
damages and from abating more than 100% of emissions in a period. When the output
constraint is slack, we have positive capital investment, and when the abatement constraint
is slack, economic activity produces some CO2 emissions that are not abated.
  23
     Normalizing the discount factor, the value function, and some of the equations of motion makes the
objective equivalent to maximizing population-weighted per capita consumption Lt u (Ct /Lt ) as in DICE.
The discount factor βt captures a rate of pure time preference of 1.5% as in DICE-2007. It also adjusts for
population growth and technological progress, a step that is part of the normalization yielding a measurement
of consumption in effective labor units. See Crost and Traeger (2010) for details.

     We solve the model using a transformation mapping the infinite time horizon to the unit interval.

    Capital depreciates at rate δk , and capital investment comes from any available output
not allocated to the control variables of consumption ct and abatement µt . The exogenous
variable Ψt and parameter a2 determine the cost of abating the chosen fraction µt of emis-
sions. The term outside the brackets in the capital transition equation adjusts for the growth
of labor and technology to keep capital in effective terms. Gross output Yt is a function of
the capital stock:
                                           Yt = ktκ .                          (Gross output)

The parameter κ gives the capital elasticity in a Cobb-Douglas production function. Climate
damages Dt reduce gross output in accord with the total temperature change:

                                         Dt = d1 (t Tt )d2 ,                            (Damages)

where the independent, normally distributed multiplicative shock t has probability measure
IP. Optimal policy adjusts current controls in anticipation of possible future shocks, and a
given period’s realized shock affects the residual output allocated to investment. We calibrate
the mean-1 shock to the years 1881-2010 in the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies
(GISS) Surface Temperature Analysis dataset.25 We take expected temperature in each year
to be the mean of the surrounding 10 years’ realized temperatures. The realized standard
deviation of the resulting time series of multiplicative shocks is 0.0068.26 This multiplicative
noise captures period-to-period temperature variability that makes extreme outcomes more
likely as CO2 increases.
    The carbon dynamics in DICE-2007 are determined by a transition matrix governing the
flow between the atmospheric stock (stock 1), the combined biosphere and shallow ocean
stock (stock 2), and the deep ocean stock (stock 3). We represent the combined biosphere
and shallow ocean stock as a fraction αB (M, t) of the atmospheric stock and the deep ocean
stock as a fraction αO (M, t) of the atmospheric stock. The parameter b12 gives the fraction
of atmospheric CO2 absorbed by land and ocean sinks over a single timestep. The parameter
b11 = 1 − b12 determines the fraction of CO2 that remains in the atmosphere from period
to period, with the remaining terms in the CO2 transition equation together governing the
transfer of carbon from land and ocean sinks back into the atmosphere. As described in
Section 4, carbon sink tipping points reduce the parameter b12 by a fraction, which also
changes b11 , αB , and αO . For both the pre- and the post-threshold regimes, we run DICE-
2007 under several representative emission paths and then approximate the entire coefficient

on Mt in the CO2 transition equation as an interpolated function of CO2 and time. Time t
emissions et are given by:
                                et = σt (1 − µt )Yt + Bt .                    (Emissions)

The exogenous variable σt is the emission intensity of gross output and Bt gives exogenous
CO2 emissions from non-industrial sources such as land use change.
    DICE-2007 determines time t surface temperature from the stock of CO2 , from surface
temperature in the previous period, and from the previous period’s difference between the
surface temperature and the deep ocean temperature. We represent the deep ocean temper-
ature as a fraction αT (T, t) of surface temperature, where αT is an interpolated function of
temperature and time based on output from DICE-2007 under several representative emis-
sion paths. Forcing F (Mt , t) measures the additional energy (W m−2 ) trapped at the earth’s
surface by greenhouse gases and other atmospheric agents. Forcing is concave in CO2 :

                            F (Mt , t) = f ln (Mt /Mpre ) + EFt ,                  (Forcing)

where f is the forcing from doubled CO2 and EFt gives the time t exogenous (non-CO2 )
forcing. The parameter s in the temperature transition equation is climate sensitivity, or
the equilibrium temperature change from doubling CO2 concentrations. This parameter is
altered by climate feedback tipping points as described in Section 4. Finally, the parameter
CO determines how a temperature gradient between the surface and the deep ocean affects
forcing at the surface, and the parameter CT controls the speed with which aggregate forcing
changes temperature.
    We implement our model with an annual timestep, while DICE-2007 uses a decadal
timestep. We therefore adjust all transition equations from those in DICE by calculating the
parameter values that would reproduce the state variables’ paths if the transition equations
were instead applied to an annual timestep with constant policies over the decade. Our
model replicates DICE’s results when run with DICE’s policy path or when optimizing with
a 10-year timestep as in DICE. However, when optimizing with an annual timestep and
without tipping point possibilities, the policymaker’s ability to smooth emissions within a
decade leads to the peak CO2 level being about 30 ppm lower than in DICE, the maximum
temperature being about 0.15◦ C lower, and the year 2015 social cost of carbon being about
$4/tCO2 lower.
    The transition equations for the exogenous variables are as follows. In each case, t = 0

    The primary computational challenge in solving the model lies not in finding the optimal
actions for a given value function but in determining the value functions that satisfy the
relations in equations (1) and (3) (see Kelly and Kolstad, 1999, 2001). We begin with a
guess for the value function and a set of Chebychev nodes in the four-dimensional state
space. We then use the initial guess for the continuation value to find each node’s optimal
controls c∗t and µ∗t and optimal value. Knowing the optimal value at each Chebychev node,
we approximate the value function across the rest of the state space using a set of Chebychev
basis polynomials. We repeat the process using this approximated value function as the new
initial guess, with iteration continuing until the coefficients of the value approximant’s basis
functions change by less than 0.0001. We confirm the results by checking that they are
robust to variations in the number of nodes and basis polynomials and to variations in the
approximated region of the state space.


C     Approximating the effects of ambiguity aversion
We here describe how we analytically approximate the effect of ambiguity aversion on the
differential welfare impact (DWI) and the marginal hazard effect (MHE).
    First, the contribution of ambiguity aversion to the total DWI was given by:
                                      0

                                                                                −1  −         .

Ambiguity aversion increases the DWI when DW I ambig > 0 and decreases it when DW I ambig <

                                                                ∂V0

We derive an expression for Vef f by undertaking a second-order expansion of Vef f around
famb [V0 ]. We then substitute in a second-order expansion of famb [V1 ] around V0 and drop
terms of order greater than h to obtain:

                                           1 −f 00
                 Vef f ≈ V0 − h[V0 − V1 ] − h 0 amb                    [V0 − V1 ]2 + O(h) .          (11)

Substituting for Vef f in DW I ambig and again dropping terms of order greater than h yields
the result in the text.
   Ambiguity aversion changes the MHE through the multiplier

Ambiguity aversion increases the MHE when this multiplier is greater than 1. We approxi-
mate the multiplier by first approximating famb by a second-order Taylor expansion around
