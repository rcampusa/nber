                                             ABSTRACT

Many analysts have considered whether households approaching retirement age have accumulated
enough assets to be well prepared for retirement. In this paper, we shift from studying household finances
at the start of the retirement period, an ex ante measure of retirement preparation, to studying the asset
holdings of households in their last years of life. The analysis is based on Health and Retirement
Study with special attention to Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) cohort
that was first surveyed in 1993. We consider the level of assets that households hold in the last survey
wave preceding their death. We study how assets at the end of life depend on three family status pathways
prior to death— (1) original one-person households in 1993, (2) persons in two-person household in
1993 with a deceased spouse in the last year observed, and (3) persons in two-person households in
1993 with the spouse alive when last observed. We find that a substantial fraction of persons die with
virtually no financial assets—46.1 percent with less than $10,000—and many of these households
also have no housing wealth and rely almost entirely on Social Security benefits for support. In addition
this group is disproportionately in poor health. Based on a replacement rate comparison, many of
these households may be deemed to have been well-prepared for retirement, in the sense that their
income in their final years was not substantially lower than their income in their late 50s or early 60s.
Yet with such low asset levels, they would have little capacity to pay for unanticipated needs such
as health expenses or other financial shocks or to pay for entertainment, travel, or other activities.
This raises a question of whether the replacement ratio is a sufficient statistic for the “adequacy” of
retirement preparation.

       Many analysts have considered whether households approaching
retirement age have accumulated enough assets to be well prepared for
retirement. Various methods have been used to evaluate retirement
preparedness, and the range of studies that apply these methods has yielded a
diverse set of conclusions. Some studies are based on comparisons between
observed saving or consumption and the predictions of the life-cycle model.
Others measure the ability of households to replace pre-retirement levels of
income or consumption, or compare post-retirement income to poverty
thresholds. Many recent studies have been based on the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS), with emphasis and the original HRS cohort that was between the
ages of 51 and 61 in 1992. Other studies use the Survey of Consumer Finances
or the SSA's Employee Beneficiary Survey. A partial list of recent studies of
retirement preparedness would include Bernheim (1992), Mitchell and Moore
(1998), Engen, Gale and Uccello (1999), Haveman, Holde, Wolfe and Romanov
(2005), Scholz, Seshadri and Khitatrakun (2006), Munnell, Webb and Golub-
Sass (2007), Love, Smith and McNair (2008), Hurd and Rohwedder (2009),
VanDerhei and Copeland (2010).

         In this paper, we shift from studying household finances at the start of the
retirement period, an ex ante measure of retirement preparation, to studying the
asset holdings of households in their last years of life. We focus on non-
annuitized assets and income. Virtually all households have a Social Security
annuity, and many have a defined benefit pension annuity as well. We examine
non-annuitized assets held at the end of life, in addition to income, because they
can provide an ex post indicator of whether households were well-prepared for
retirement. If there are substantial numbers of very old households with very low
asset levels, relative to the number of households with low asset levels at the
start of retirement, then many households exhausted their retirement resources.
If most households still hold substantial assets at very advanced ages, or in the
last few years before their death, the pattern is more difficult to interpret. It is
difficult to determine whether such households had what they would have
considered "sufficient" resources for retirement, and did not need to reduce their
consumption outlays in late life, or if they conserved the (insufficient) resources
they had throughout the retirement period.




                                          2
        We study the level of assets that households hold in the last survey wave
preceding their death. In parts of the analysis we make use of all of the cohorts
that are now part of the Health and Retirement Study. We give special attention,
however, to the older Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old
(AHEAD) cohort. We calculate the level of wealth at death and offer several
metrics for determining the proportion of households that may be thought of as
having “insufficient assets” for their retirement. In addition to summarizing the
level of assets, we also study how assets at the end of life depend on family
status pathways to prior to death. We are particularly interested in the strong
relationship between of health and assets near the end of life. We also give
special attention to the relationship between assets and longevity after the 1993
first wave of the AHEAD cohort. We find a strong relationship between health
status and wealth at death.

       Our paper is divided into six sections. In the first, we show detailed
balance sheets in 2008 for households by five-year age intervals—65 to 69, 70 to
74, 75 to 79, 80 to 84, and 85 and older, respectively. These balance sheets are
based on households in all HRS cohorts—HRS, AHEAD, Children of Depression
(CODA), War Baby (WB) and Early Baby Boomer (EBB). We find that the
change in assets with age, as well as the level of assets, differs greatly between
single households and married couples.

       We explore this pattern further by considering the evolution of assets of
the AHEAD as well as the HRS cohorts, distinguishing two-person households,
one-person households, and households that transition from two- to one-person
households. We emphasize the distinction between the evolution of assets
between survey waves for persons who are alive in adjacent waves, and the
evolution of assets with age that can be attributed to "mortality selection effects"
and the progressive selection over time of households with greater financial
assets and lower mortality risk. We are also careful to distinguish between death
and attrition as separate reasons why persons do not remain in the sample
through 2008. The selection effects we calculate are due to death and not due to
sample attrition.

       In the second section, we present greater detail on the evolution of wealth
for AHEAD households. We distinguish three family status pathways based on
family status in 1993 (the first year observed) and family status when last
observed—(1) original one-person households in 1993 who were also single at
death, (2) original two-person households in 1993 in which one spouse is
deceased in the last year observed, and (3) original two-person households in
1993 in which both spouses remain alive in the last year observed. A fourth
group—those who were single in 1993 and who later remarried—is not analyzed
because of its small sample size. Within each of these groups we show the
evolution of wealth by the last year observed (LYO), which is the last wave prior
to death for those who die or 2008, the most recent survey wave available, for
those who are still alive in that year. We highlight the strong relationship



                                         3
between wealth in 1993 and subsequent longevity. We consider several
components of wealth—total wealth, financial assets including personal
retirement accounts, housing wealth, and annuity wealth including both Social
Security benefits and defined benefit pension benefits. We also report
information on an indicator variable for whether the household owns a home.

        In the third and fourth sections, we present results for the single-person
family pathway group. We focus attention on this group because it is the largest
of the three pathway groups and because it is the group most likely to have low
wealth prior to death. In section three, we present estimates of the relationship
between wealth and age, and between wealth and health, with separate
estimates of the health and age effects for each LYO. The health measure we
use is similar to the index developed in Poterba, Venti, and Wise (2010a, 2010b).
Using the regression estimates we predict assets by health and age interval and
by LYO. In section four, we show the distribution of assets by asset category
within each health quintile and age interval. We also suggest metrics to help to
put the results in context.

       In the fifth section, we present data for all family pathway groups
combined and we compare results across all three family pathways. The last
section summarizes and concludes.

1. Balance Sheets and Evolution of Non-Annuity Wealth by Family Status

       Table 1-1 summarizes information in the HRS on household balance
sheets for three age groups and for five aggregated asset categories—financial
assets (balances in taxable financial assets as well as balances in IRA plans,
Keogh plans, 401(k) and similar plans), equity in the primary home, other non-
annuity assets (the net value of other real estate, equity in second homes and
business assets less non-housing debt), the expected present discounted value
of Social Security and defined benefit pension benefits, and net worth (total
wealth). These balance sheets are based on households in all HRS cohorts—
HRS, AHEAD, Children of Depression (CODA), War Baby (WB) and Early Baby
Boomer (EBB). The data on 401(k) balances in these tables are incomplete
because respondents in the two oldest cohorts, CODA and AHEAD, were not
asked for their 401(k) balances. However, these cohorts were unlikely to have
substantial accumulations because they left the labor force before or shortly after
401(k) accounts became available in 1982. Members of the CODA cohort were
age 68 to 74 when first surveyed in 1998 and members of the AHEAD cohort
were age 70 and older when first surveyed in 1993. Appendix Tables 1a through
1e show detailed balance sheets in 2008 for households by five-year age
intervals—65 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 to 79, 80 to 84, and 85 and older respectively.
Separate panels are shown for all households as well as for one-person and two-
person households. Data are shown for both means and medians.

        Several features of the summary data in Table 1-1 warrant comment.
First, whether measured by medians or means, the net worth of older
households, even those aged 85 and older, seems rather large. The net worth
of two-person households is more than twice as large as the net worth of one-
person households. Median (mean) total net worth for households aged 65 to 69
is $414,435 ($649,161) for singles and $1,015,317 ($1,375,963) for couples in
2008. Net worth is lower at older ages, in large part because of the decline in
expected present value of benefits from Social Security and defined benefit
pensions. Wealth from these sources is lower for older households than for
younger households because expected payments from these sources are
weighted by survival probabilities.

       We do not focus on cross-age comparisons in the balance sheets. The
pattern of levels across ages depends on at least two competing effects: assets
are lower for older households because of "cohort effects" (older generations had


                                                  5
lower lifetime earnings, on average, than younger generations) and assets are
higher for older households because of "mortality effects" (on average, within
each cohort, poorer households die at younger ages). We give special attention
to mortality effects in the subsequent analysis.

       The largest components of non-annuity net worth are housing wealth and
financial assets (including personal retirement accounts). Of single person
households, 66 percent of those aged 65-69 own homes and this rate remains
about the same for nearly twenty years; for the group aged 85 and older, the rate
drops to 54 percent. About 91 percent of married couples aged 65-69 own
homes. Thereafter the rate drops gradually to about 89 percent for ages 75 to 79
and 85 percent for those aged 85 and older.

       Table 1-2 shows selected percentiles of the distribution of assets. It
demonstrates that a large proportion of households have very few, or no, liquid
financial assets. This is especially true for single-person households. The 25th
percentile of financial assets for singles is less than $1,300 for all age groups.
Many single-person households also have no home equity. The 25th percentile is
zero for all age groups. In addition, a large fraction of both single- and two-


                                                  6
person households have no other non-annuity assets. The 75th percentile is zero
for single-households at all ages and the 50th percentile is zero for two-person
households at all ages.

        Recall that the balance sheets pertain to the wealth of those who survive
to each age. In contrast, Figures 1-1 and 1-2 show the evolution of assets by
family status—two person households, one-person households, and households
that transition from two- to one-person households during the interval between
survey waves—for HRS and AHEAD households respectively. The figures
exclude persons in households that transitioned from one-person to two-person
because the sample sizes for this group were too small to give reliable results.
Wealth includes all assets reported in Table 1-1 except Social Security wealth,
defined benefit pension wealth, and 401(k) balances. For the HRS cohort, 401(k)
balances are not included because of missing data in some of the early years, as
discussed in Venti (2011). Balances in 401(k) accounts were not collected in the
AHEAD.

        Figure 1-1 shows the wave-to-wave change in median non-annuity wealth
in the three family status groups for HRS households. All values are converted
to 2008 dollars using the CPI. For example, the median wealth of persons who
remained in two-person households between 1992 and 1994 (labeled as "2 to 2")
increased from about $184,000 to $213,000. For those who remained in two-
person households between 1994 and 1996, median wealth increased from
about $223,000 to $231,000. In all intervals, wealth increased for persons in
continuing two person households.

       It is important to distinguish between the within-interval changes in wealth
shown by the line segments in the figure and the effect of differential mortality
indicated by the vertical height of the "gaps" between segments. To illustrate
this point, note that persons in two-person households present in both the 1996
and 1998 waves had $243,706 in wealth in 1998, but that persons in two-person
households present in both the 1998 and 2000 waves had $254,419 in 1998.
This difference is circled in the figure. The difference between $243,706 and
$254,419 is the "selection" effect—two-person households that dissolved
because of death of a spouse, divorce or separation between 1998 and 2000 had
lower wealth in 1998 than those who continued as two-person households
through the 1998 to 2000 period.

       To understand the evolution of wealth with age, as distinct from the
selection effect, it is important to focus on the wave-to-wave changes (segment
slopes). For two-person households in the HRS who were between the ages of
51 and 61 in 1992, the wave-to-wave changes are positive in all intervals. The
increase in wealth for persons in continuing two-person households can be seen
by tracking the assets in the first year of each interval. Some component of this
increase is due to the progressive selection of households with greater wealth.
For one-person households wealth increased in all but two wave-to-wave



                                        7
intervals. The mortality selection effects are not so apparent for single-person
households, in part because a large fraction of one-person households had
relatively low wealth, with median levels between $50,000 and $100,000 over the
1992 to 2008 period.

       Figure 1-1 also shows that the non-annuity wealth of persons in two-
person households that dissolve between waves declines substantially. This is
observed in each of the intervals. The assets of persons in two- to one-person
households were also much lower at the beginning of an interval than the assets
of persons in continuing two-person households. After dissolution, however, the
wealth of the surviving single persons was still larger than the wealth of
continuing one-person households.

        Figure 1-2 shows the evolution of non-annuity wealth for persons in
AHEAD households. The data for 1993 are omitted from the figure because, as
Rohwedder, Haider, and Hurd (2006) explain, financial assets were under-
reported in AHEAD in that year. For the AHEAD households, the mortality
selection effects are extremely important (circles in the figure). Persons who
continued in two-person households from one interval to the next typically held
much greater wealth balances than those who did not. For AHEAD households,
the within-interval change in wealth for persons in continuing two-person
households was negative in all but the first interval, 1995 to 1998. The wealth of
continuing one-person households declined in each period. For AHEAD
households the decline in the wealth for persons in two-person households that
dissolved during an interval is similar in magnitude to the decline for persons in
continuing two-person households. For these households dissolution was
primarily the consequence of mortality, whereas for HRS households dissolution
was more often the consequence of divorce or separation. As with the HRS
cohort, the level of wealth of persons in two-person households that dissolved
during an interval was much lower than the level of wealth of persons in
continuing two person households. Among persons in households that dissolved
in an interval the wealth of the surviving spouse remained much higher than the
wealth of continuing one-person households.

      In short, the figures show the within interval change in the wealth of
households that survive over the interval, but they also make clear that some of
the change from interval to interval is due to the progressive selection of
households with greater wealth. This effect plays a key role in the subsequent
analysis.

2. The Evolution of Wealth for AHEAD Households

       The remainder of the paper focuses on AHEAD households. The goal is
to describe the evolution of wealth by family pathway group and by asset
category from 1993 to 2008 and to consider the wealth of persons in the last year
observed (LYO). All persons last observed in years before 2008 are known to be
deceased--persons who leave the sample but are not known to be deceased are
excluded from the analysis. Persons whose last year observed is 2008 are not
deceased. Most waves are spaced two years apart, with the exception of a three
year gap between the 1995 and 1998 waves. Thus for persons who have an
LYO before 2008, the last observation may be up to two years before the actual
date of death (or three years if the LYO is 1995.)

        We begin by dividing the AHEAD respondents into three groups defined
by family status when first observed in 1993 and family status in the LYO. These
groups, which we call "family pathway groups," are: (1) original one-person
households in 1993, (2) persons in two-person household in 1993 with a
deceased spouse in the last year observed before death, and (3) persons in two-
person households in 1993 with the spouse alive when last observed. For
shorthand we sometimes refer to the groups as one-person, two-person to one-
person, and two-person respectively. A fourth group of persons, in a one-person
household in 1993 and in a two-person household when last observed, is
excluded because this group is too small for meaningful analysis. Also, all
persons who joined the AHEAD sample after 1993 are excluded. Some persons
in one-person households in 1993 may have been in two-person households
prior to 1993. Figure 2-1 is a graphical description of the total wealth (including
the present values of Social Security and DB pension benefits) and the relative
size of each of these groups in each LYO. For each family progression group,
the location of each circle indicates the level of median wealth (shown on the
vertical axis) and the associated LYO (shown on the horizontal axis). The size of
each circle indicates the percent of the total sample in each LYO group
accounted for by the particular sub-group.

       In each family progression group, the wealth and the percent of persons
last observed in 2008 (not deceased) is represented by the dark blue circles.
The other circles indicate wealth in the last wave prior to death. One-person
households in 1993 died with the least wealth, between $142,000 and $188,000
at the median. Those in two-person households in 1993 with a spouse alive
when they died had the greatest wealth in the wave prior to death, between
$585,000 and $685,000. Those in two-person households in 1993 whose
spouse was deceased when last observed had median wealth in the wave prior
to death between $206,000 and $286,000.

       A general feature of the data is the strong and consistent relationship
between wealth in 1993 and survival, the year a person is last observed in the
data. Among persons first observed in 1993, those who will die the earliest begin
with the lowest assets in 1993. The relationship holds for all asset categories.
Figure 2-2a shows the relationship for three of the four asset categories shown in
Table 1-1—annuity wealth, home equity, and financial assets—for each of the
family progression groups. The figure shows medians for each asset category
in1993. The fourth category in Table 1-1, other non-annuity assets, is not shown
because the median is zero in all years for all groups. Because medians are
used in the figure, the stacked vertical height of the bars in the figure is not equal
to median total wealth. Figure 2-2b shows means for all four categories. In the
subsequent discussion we often show medians and not means.

        For each of the groups, Social Security and defined benefit pension wealth
is by far the largest wealth holding. The relationship between wealth when first
observed and subsequent mortality is striking. For example, the rising profiles
within each group shows that annuity wealth in 1993 is higher for persons who
die prior to the 2000 wave (whose LYO is 1998) than for persons who die prior to
1998 wave (whose LYO is 1995). Similarly persons who die prior to the 2002
wave have higher annuity wealth in 1993 than persons who die prior to the 2000
wave, and so forth. Similar patterns are evident for the home equity and financial
assets. The wealth-mortality gradient that has been widely observed by others is
strongly evident in these data. Examples of previous studies that have found

        We do not address the direction of causality between health and wealth or
between wealth and mortality although here and elsewhere in the paper we often
implicitly assume that health is given and subsequent outcomes follow. This
assumption is consistent with the findings of Smith (1999, 2004, 2005), Adams et
al. (2003), Wu (2003), Michaud and van Soest (2008), and Case and Deaton
(2009). The general consensus is that that causation from health to wealth is the
dominant pathway at least in the U.S. but there is no universal agreement.

        The figure above shows that persons "closer" to death in 1993 have lower
assets in 1993 than those who will live longer. We can see the same pattern
over time by showing how assets evolve over time for groups of persons
identified by the last year observed in the sample. Again, an LYO of 2006 or
earlier indicates that the person died in the two-year interval following the LYO.
An LYO of 2008 indicates that the person is still alive in 2008, the last year of our
sample. The next series of figures show the evolution of assets for several
wealth sub-categories—total wealth, financial assets (including IRA and Keogh
accounts), home equity, Social Security wealth, and defined benefit pension
wealth. We also show the percentage of households who own their homes and
the evolution of total income. There is one figure for each wealth category, with
data for each of three family pathway groups. For each figure the evolution of
median wealth is shown by LYO.

       Figure 2-3 shows median total wealth for the three family pathway groups.
Total wealth in 1993 is lowest for the first family pathway group (one-person
households) and highest for the third pathway group (two-person households
with a spouse alive when last observed). In each of the groups, total wealth in
1993 is very strongly related to the LYO. Those who live longer have higher
wealth. In addition, total wealth typically declines as persons get "closer" to
death for each of the groups, largely because of the mechanical decline in
annuity wealth. But the decline is much slower for the for persons in two-person
families who have a spouse alive when last observed, a group that also has
much greater wealth in 1993.

       Figure 2-4 shows the evolution of financial assets (including IRA and
Keogh accounts) for the three pathway groups. The vertical line between 1993
and 1995 is a reminder that some financial assets were under-reported in 1993,
although we present the data because IRA and Keogh assets are not
underreported. Again, the financial assets of the first group decline quite
systematically after 1995 and the financial assets of the second group typically
decline as well, at least after 1998. The decline is in part induced by the
minimum distribution requirement for 401(k) and non-Roth IRA accounts.
Nonetheless, there is much less decline in the financial assets of the third
pathway group.

       Figure 2-5 shows the evolution of home equity. For one-person
households the data show a very sharp decline in median home equity beginning
two or three years before death. Indeed for each LYO, median home equity in
the wave prior to death was zero for all but those whose LYO was 1993. For
original two-person households with the spouse deceased at the LYO, a sharp
decline near the end of life is also apparent, although the median at death is zero
only for those whose LYO was 2002 or 2004. For original two-person
households with the spouse alive at the LYO, there is a decline in home equity in
the year or two before death, but it is more modest than that for the previous two
groups. Home equity declines relatively little in prior years for this group. The
results are consistent with the findings of Venti and Wise (2002, 2004) who
emphasize that home equity tends to be husbanded until a precipitating shock
such as entry to a nursing home or death of a spouse.

         Figure 2-6 shows the evolution of home ownership rates. The decline in
ownership seems more consistent over time than the decline in housing wealth
for all family pathway groups. Housing wealth typically declined sharply near the
end of life. The decline in ownership between 1993 and the year last observed
was greatest for the one-person and the two- to one-person family groups. For
the one-person group the decline ranged from -3.4 percent for persons whose
LYO was1995 to -39.9 percent for persons whose LYO was 2006. For the two-
to one-person group, the decline ranged from -0.1 percent for persons whose
LYO was1995 to -31.6 percent for persons whose LYO was 2006. For the two-
person group, however the decline was less than three percent through 2000 and
then ranged from -6.9 percent for persons whose LYO was 2002 to -11.5 percent
for persons whose LYO was 2006.

       The evolution of Social Security wealth is shown in Figure 2-7. The
pattern of decline for each group is a mechanical feature of the way annuity
wealth is calculated: benefits in each future year are weighted by the probability
of survival. As an individual ages, the present value of remaining benefits
declines because the probability of surviving for any number of years declines.
Like each of the other wealth categories, the Social Security wealth data show
that wealth in 1993 is very strongly related to year of death. The data also show
that one-person households have substantially less Social Security wealth in
1993 than persons in the second pathway whose spouse had died before the
YLO, who in turn have less wealth than the third pathway group, persons in two-
person households whose spouse is alive when last observed. These data are
consistent with the large literature cited earlier showing the strong relationship
between measures of SES such as lifetime earnings (the primary determinant of
Social Security benefits) and mortality.

        Figure 2-8 shows the evolution of defined benefit pension wealth. Single
persons in the first pathway group essentially have no DB pension wealth. The
median is zero for all one-person households except for those who survive to
2008. But persons who were in two-person households in 1993 with the spouse
deceased by the LYO do have substantial median DB wealth in 1993 and
persons in two-person households in 1993 with the spouse alive in the LYO had
even more DB wealth. Most of the persons in the second group had zero or
close to zero DB wealth at death, but persons in the third group still had
noticeable DB wealth at death. Part of the explanation for the very low level of
DB wealth among persons in the two-person to one-person group apparently lies
with the waiver of survivorship benefits. ERISA (1974) requires employers to
offer joint and survivor annuities as the default option and the Retirement Equity
Act (1984) requires written consent to waive survivor benefits. Nonetheless,
Johnson, Uccello, and Goldwyn (2005) report that in 2000, 28 percent of men
and 69 percent of women covered by DB plans had waived survivor benefits.
Even if survivor benefits are not waived, the surviving spouse's benefit is often
less than 100 percent of the deceased's benefit. The implications of the
husband's death for the finances of widows is discussed further in Hurd and Wise
(1989), Weir and Willis (2000), and Sevak, Weir, and Willis (2003)

        Finally, Figure 2-9 shows the evolution of total household income for
persons in each of the three pathway groups. We will discuss the level and path
of total income in more detail in the next section, but we include the pathway
figure here because it is in the same format as the figures for asset categories.


                                           18
The figure shows little decline for the one-person group, a modest decline for the
two-person group, and a substantial decline for the two to one-person group.
The percent decline between 1993 and the year last observed is shown in Table
2-1. As might be expected, the decline is especially large for persons in the two-
to one-person family pathway group. For persons last observed in 2008 the
decline is -48.5 percent.

3. The Effect of Health and Age: The Single-Person Pathway

        In the previous section we emphasized the strong relationship between
wealth in 1993 and the time until death. In this section we emphasize the
relationship between wealth and health, given the year last observed, and we
draw attention to the strong relationship between health and wealth just prior to
death.

          We begin by using a simple median regression framework to describe how
the level of assets in the last year observed depends on age and health. For
each person we construct an index of health based on the first principal
component of responses to 27 health-related questions contained in AHEAD.
These questions asked about functional limitations, the presence of health
conditions and other indicators of overall health. The list of questions used to
construct the index and a discussion of the properties of the index are reported in
Poterba, Venti and Wise (2010b). There are two differences between our
approach in the current paper and that in our past work. First, the earlier paper
constructed an index for each wave using information from the contemporaneous
and all preceding waves. The index used here only uses contemporaneous
wave information. Many of the questions are of the form "have you ever
experienced" a health condition, so there is little extra information obtained by
using prior wave information. Second, the principal component estimates varied
little from wave to wave, so in the present analysis we have pooled the waves.

      In the median regression estimates below, we use percentiles of the index
where the first percentile is the poorest health and the 100th percentile
corresponds to the best health. The index used pertains to health in the last year
observed. We present estimates of theeffect of health and age on wealth in the
LYO, with separate estimates of the health and age effects for each LYO.

      Table 3-1 shows median regression estimates for the single-person
pathway group. The age and health effects are statistically significant for all
LYOs. The estimated effect of a 10 percentile increase in health and the effect of


                                        20
an additional year of age are graphed in Figure 3-1. The effect of health on
wealth in the last year observed is substantial. The estimated effect of an
increase of 10 percentile points in health ranges from $7,530 in 1993 to $28,004
in 2006. Thus persons who have better health when last observed prior to death
have much more wealth. Recall that these estimated effects are conditional on
YLO, which is also related to health. For persons last observed in 2008, the
estimated health effect is $17,340. The effect of an additional year of age on
wealth ranges from -$10,596 in 1993 to -$5,570 in 2006. The age effect is -
$11,125 for those who are last observed in 2008. Those who are last observed
in 2008 have substantially more wealth than those who die before 2008.

       To get an idea of how much wealth in the LYO varies by health and age,
we use the estimated effects from the median regression to predict total wealth
for selected health percentiles and for selected ages. Table 3-2 shows predicted
total wealth for every other LYO between 1993 and 2006. The estimates show
the very large effects of health, as well as age, on wealth in the LYO. The
pattern is quite similar in each of the LYO panels.

        These results suggest that persons who die at older ages and in poorer
health are likely to die with less wealth than persons who die young and in good
health. We are particularly interested in the proportion of people that die with
little wealth. Without trying to define what “little” is, we begin by calculating
selected percentiles of total wealth and selected categories of wealth in the last
year observed by health quintile and by age interval. Unlike the previous table,


                                                                         21
these percentiles are based on actual data rather than predictions from the
median regression.

Table 3-3 shows the percentiles combining all LYOs between 1993 and 2006
(the LYOs associated with death) for original single-person households. One cell
in the lower left is blank because it contains fewer than 10 observations. The
small cell size reflects the fact that the young and healthy are least likely to die.
The shaded cells help to identify cell entries with less that $100,000 of wealth.
There are 24 such cells. All are for persons older than age 80 and 21 of the 24
are for person 85 and older. Seventeen of the 24 are for persons in the bottom 3
health quintiles and 12 of 24 are for persons in the bottom two quintiles. Only 7
are for persons in the top 2 health quintiles. Thus dying with "little" wealth is
clearly concentrated among older persons who are also less healthy.

       Table 3-4, shows the distribution of annuity wealth in the last year
observed before death by health quintile and age interval. Levels less than
$50,000 are highlighted. The decline in annuity wealth by age in largely
mechanical and is reflected in the concentration of low annuity wealth among
persons who are aged 90 or older. But the differences across health quintiles
indicate the large differences in percentiles by health status. For example, over
all age intervals, the 25th percentile ranges from $49,795 for persons in the
lowest health quintile to $119,704 for persons in the top quintile.

        Table 3-5 shows the distribution of non-annuity wealth by health quintile
and by age interval. A large fraction of single-person households have
essentially no non-annuity wealth, particularly those in the bottom two health
quintiles. In these health groups, the 25th percentile is zero or close to zero for all
age intervals. Even for the higher health quintiles the 10th percentile is zero
averaged over all age intervals.

       Perhaps a better way to judge whether persons have "low" resources at
death is to look at resources immediately available for day-to-day expenses.
Table 3-6 shows the distribution of total income in the last year observed before
death by health quintile and age interval.

Total income includes benefits from Social Security and defined benefit pension
plans, government transfer income, and dividends, interest payments, rent
received and other income from assets. Again, the relationship between health
and income is quite pronounced. Even controlling for age and heath, total
income varies considerably within each cell. The 90th percentile is typically at


                                         26
least four times as large as the 10th percentile. Of particular interest is the
association between health and total income summarized in the last column.
The 10th percentile of total income is surprisingly similar across all levels of
health—between $7,342 for persons in the lowest health quintile and $8,718 for
persons in the top health quintile. However, health has a more depressive effect
at higher percentiles. The 90th percentile of total income for persons in the
poorest health quintile is only $32,541, but the 90th percentile for persons in the
top health quintile is $61,494.

        We next consider summary measures of financial resources that focus on
the joint distribution of annuity income and liquid financial assets. The top panel
of Table 3-7 shows the selected points on the bivariate cumulative distribution of
annuity income and liquid financial assets (including IRA accounts) in the LYO
(again combining all LYO between 1993 and 2006). For convenience, the
diagonals are shown in bold. The upper-left entry in the table shows, for
example, that 12.1 of single-person households have less than $10,000 in
annuity income and no financial assets in the last year observed. The entry
below it shows that 23.9 percent of households have less than $10,000 in annuity
income and less than $10,000 in financial assets. More than half of all
households (57 percent) have less than $10,000 in financial assets in the last
year we observe them. As a point of reference, the 2008 poverty threshold for
single persons aged 65 and older is about $10,000. The table also shows that
52.0 percent of single-person households have annuity income less than $20,000
(about twice the poverty level) and financial assets less than $10,000. Although
not shown in the table the percent of single-person households with annuity
income less that $15,000 (about one and one-half time the poverty level) and
financial assets less than $5,000 is 39.6 percent. Over all financial asset levels,
31.9 percent had annuity income less than $10,000 and 82 percent of
households had less than $20,000 of annuity income. Of this latter group, 23
percent also has no financial assets.

        Home equity is an illiquid asset that households tend to hold through late
life. Venti and Wise (2004) and several other studies find that households
typically sell their homes only when confronted with a precipitating shock to
family structure, like death of a spouse or entry into a nursing home. By the time
single-person AHEAD households approach the last year observed, many have
divested their housing wealth, as shown in earlier in Figure 2-5.

       The middle panel of Table 3-7 shows the proportion of single-person
households with zero housing wealth (including persons with negative home
equity) by annuity income and financial asset intervals that are comparable to the
cumulative levels in the first panel. For example, of persons with annuity income
less than $10,000 and no financial assets, 76.3 percent have no housing wealth.
Of persons with $30,000 to $40,000 in annuity income and $25,000 to $50,000 in

                                        28
financial assets, 47.0 percent have no housing equity. Overall, 57.1 percent of
persons in the single-household family pathway have no housing equity in the
last year observed before death. The bottom panel of Table 3-7 shows the mean
health percentile of persons in each of the annuity income/financial asset
intervals. For example, the mean health percentile of persons with annuity
income less than $10,000 and no financial assets is 24.1. For those with annuity
income between $30,000 and $40.000 and financial assets between $25,000 and
$50,000 the median health percentile is 43.3. Thus again the strong relationship
between health and wealth is evident.

        In short, we find that a large fraction of original single-person households
has no housing wealth and very limited financial assets in the last year observed
before death. This suggests that the sole source of wealth for many persons is
the value of annuity benefits. Most persons receive Social Security benefits
(either directly or as a survivor) and about half receive income from a DB pension
(again either directly or as a survivor).

4. Compared to What?

        It is not clear how we should judge what constitutes a “low” or “sufficient”
level of either assets or income. In Table 3-6 we highlighted the distribution of
total income by health quintile and age, showing the level of income for persons
at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentiles with wealth below given levels.
At all ages and for all levels of health, total income at the 10th percentile was
between $7,000 and $10,000. In Table 3-7 we showed the percentage of single-
person households with annuity income below levels that were chosen to
approximate multiples of the poverty threshold in 2008 (about $10,000).

        We will now provide some rough benchmarks to give context to these
income levels just before death. First, we compare total income in the year last
observed with total income in 1993 when these persons were first observed in
AHEAD. The top panel of Table 4-1 shows median total income by age interval
and health quintile in the last year observed before death (which can be any year
from 1993 to 2006). These are the same data that were shown as the 50th
percentile in Table 3-6. The lower panel shows the total income of these same
households in 1993, the first year they were observed in AHEAD. All dollar
amounts have been converted to 2008 dollars. On balance, income was slightly
lower in the last year before death. It was one percent higher for the 1st health
quintile, and then -6 percent for the 2nd quintile, -2 percent for the 3rd, -7 percent
for the 4th and -3 percent for the 5th health quintile. The similarity of incomes in
1993 and the last year observed should not be surprising because a large
fraction of income is indexed Social Security benefits. These sample members
were single in 1993 and single at the time of death and thus did not transition to
survivorship benefits. On the other hand, some income is DB pension benefits
which are not fully indexed. These data do not suggest that household income




                                          29
declined in the years just before death. Household assets, in contrast, do show a
decline.

       Although it is informative to consider the change in income over the (at
most) 13 years of AHEAD (from 1993 to 2006 for persons who died before 2008),
we would like to compare resources just before death to resources at a younger
age, say prior to “retirement age.” Such a comparison is not easy to make.
Nonetheless, we begin by comparing total income of single-persons in the last
year observed before death to median earnings of these same persons when
they were between ages 57 and 62, based on Social Security earnings records.
We first index earnings to 2008 using the SSA Average Index of Monthly
Earnings (AIME). We then calculate the median of earnings for ages 57 to 62
excluding years in which earnings were not positive. Approximately half of the
original single-person households have matched SSA earnings records. The
SSA only records earnings up to the SSA earnings limit which ranged from
$57,600 in 1993 to $94,200 in 2006. Thus our estimate of pre-retirement
earnings may be low for some higher earning workers. More importantly, the
Social Security earnings of these original single persons in 1993 may be a very
inexact indicator of household resources at the younger age. Many persons may
have been married at ages 57 to 62, but were single when first interviewed in
1993. Single women who were previously married may have substantially
greater Social Security benefits at older ages than women who never married.

       Table 4-2 shows the comparison. Overall median total income in the last
year observed was less than half of median earnings at ages 57 to 62. The
percentage difference is greatest for those in the poorest health and smallest for
those in the best health. Combining all age intervals, LYO income was only 46.3
percent of "pre-retirement" earnings in the first health quintile and 57.2 percent of
"pre-retirement" earnings in the fifth health quintile. If these “pre-retirement”
earnings are an underestimate of actual pre-retirement earning, then these
“replacement” rates are an overestimate of true replacement rates.

        Overall, for the original single-person pathway, we find that a rather large
fraction of these single persons have low income judged by poverty thresholds—
12.1 percent below the poverty threshold and with no financial assets, 23 percent
below twice the poverty line and no financial assets. And the proportion in
poverty is much greater for those in poor health than for those in good health.
On the other hand, the data show little difference between income just prior to
death and income in 1993 when first observed in the AHEAD survey. However,
total income in the last year observed is, on average, only about 50 percent of
(possibly poorly measured) income in the pre-retirement years. While this
difference is hard to evaluate because the two measures are not directly
comparable, the implied replacement rate is likely an overestimate of the true
replacement rate.

5. The Other Marital Pathway Groups and All Groups Combined

         Table 5-1 presents median regression estimates of the effects of age and
health on assets in the last year observed. Separate estimates are presented for
each of three marital pathway groups. The estimates control for last year
observed as a marker for financial market returns that the household
experienced since 1993. These estimated age and year effects are the average
over all last years observed. Unlike the estimates for single-person households
in Table 3-1, these estimated health and age effects are not interacted with LYO
but instead show the average effects over all years. The estimates are graphed
for all three marital pathway groups in the left side panel of Figure 5-1. The figure
shows the effect of a 10 percentile increase in health on total wealth. The
estimates range from $10,000 for single-persons to $20,000 for the other two
pathways. The estimated age effect varies from a decline of $7,203 per year of
age for persons in original two-person households whose spouse is deceased in
the last year observed to $20,619 for persons in original two-person households
whose spouse is alive in the last year observed.

        We next consider summary measures of financial resources that focus on
the joint distribution of annuity income and liquid financial assets. We first
present these results for all family pathways combined. We then compare the
results across family pathways. Table 5-2 shows results for all family pathways
combined. The table follows the same format as Figure 3-6 for persons in the
single household pathway. Among all family pathways, 9.1 percent of persons
have annuity income less than $10,000 (approximately the poverty rate for single
persons 65 and older) and no liquid financial assets; 40.0 percent have annuity
income less than $20,000 and financial assets less than $10,000. Overall, 50.4
percent have no housing wealth. Of those with annuity income less than $10,000
and no liquid financial assets, 67.0 percent have no housing wealth.

      The strong relationship between wealth and health is again observed for
persons in all family pathways combined. The median health percentile ranges
from 24.3 for persons with annuity income less than $10,000 to 42.4 percent for
those with annuity income between $30,000 and $40,000 and financial assets
between $25,000 and $50,000.

       Tables 5-3, 5-4, and 5-5 compare results across family pathways. Table
5-3 compares the bivariate cumulative distribution of annuity income and
financial assets. The easiest way to compare across pathways is to consider the
diagonals in the tables for each pathway. Entries are the proportion of persons
below any annuity income/financial asset level. The table shows that more
single-person households have low resources than persons in the two-person to
one-person pathway (persons in original two-person households whose spouse
pre-deceased them), which in turn have lower resources than persons in the two-


                                      34
person pathway (persons in original two-person households whose spouse is
alive at their death). For example the proportion of persons below $30,000 in
annuity income and below $25,000 in financial assets is 64.5 percent for one-
person households, 52.2 percent of two- to one-person households and 38.9
percent for two-person households.

      Table 5-4 shows the proportion of households with zero housing wealth for
each of the three pathways. Again, the diagonal values facilitate the comparison.
For example, in the $20,000 to $30,000 annuity interval and the $10,000 to
$25,000 financial asset interval 52.2 percent of one-person households have no
housing wealth but only 27.9 percent of one- to two-person households, and just
20 percent of two-person households. Overall, in the last year before death, 57.1
percent of single-person households have no housing wealth and 49.6 percent of
persons in two-to one-person households have no housing wealth. Remarkably,

only 20.4 percent of persons who die with a surviving spouse have no home
equity.

       Table 5-5 shows the mean health percentile of persons in each of the
three pathways. Unlike the very dissimilar proportions of households below
annuity income/ financial asset thresholds across family pathways, and the very
different proportions with zero housing wealth within annuity income/financial
asset intervals, the levels of health within the cells are very similar across family
pathways. That is, given similar annuity income and levels of financial assets,
the mean health percentile is about the same for persons in each family status
pathway. For example, the overall mean health percentile in the three groups is
28.5, 32.3, and 28.5 respectively in the one-person, two- to one-person, and the
two-person pathways. For persons in the zero to $10,000 annuity income and
zero housing wealth interval, the mean health percentiles are 24.1, 22.7, and
24.1 respectively.

       Finally, Table 5-6 compares median income in the last year observed with
income in 1993. Because of small sample sizes in many cells the table shows
data for all health quintiles and for all last years observed combined. For men
with matched Social Security records the table also compares median income in
1993 with median earnings for ages 57 to 62. For one-person households and
for two-person households total income in the last year observed was, on
average, only slightly below income in 1993, for two- to one-person households
the decline in income between 1993 and the last year observed was almost 75
percent.

       For men with matched Social Security records Table 5-6 shows that for
one to one and for two to one person households total income in the last year
observed much lower than income when aged 57 to 62—over 68 percent less for
one to one households and almost 106 percent less for two to one households.
The decline was only 23.2 percent for two to two person households.

      6. Summary and Conclusions

       We began by summarizing the balance sheets of households in the Health
and Retirement Study by five-year age intervals from age 65 to 69 through age
85 and older. These balance sheets show that many households have
accumulated considerable wealth, ranging in 2008 from a median of $214,371 for
older single-person households to a median of $1,015,317 for younger two-
person households. Interpretation of these balances is confounded by cohort
effects (older generations have lower lifetime earnings than younger generations)
and mortality effects (persons in poorer households within a cohort die at
younger ages). Thus although these balance sheets present the point-in time
wealth of households who survive to a given age they do not reveal the evolution
of assets of the same households over time.

       To analyze this evolution, we direct attention to the AHEAD households,
who were aged 70 and older in 1993 when first observed and age 87 and older in
2008 when last observed. We divide the AHEAD households into three family
pathway groups: (1) original one-person households in 1993, (2) persons in two-
person household in 1993 with a deceased spouse in the last year observed, and
(3) persons in two-person households in 1993 with the spouse alive when last
observed. For each of these pathways we describe the evolution of assets from
1993 to the year last observed. We describe the evolution of total wealth and
several of its components—financial assets including IRA accounts, housing
wealth and housing ownership, Social Security annuity wealth, and DB pension
annuity wealth. We find a very strong relationship between health when last
observed and the level of assets just before death. Those in poor health have
much lower assets than those in good health.

       Much of our analysis is restricted to persons who are known to have died.
For these persons we are able to calculate wealth in the last year observed
before their death. Because waves of the AHEAD are typically spaced two years
apart, our last observation for each person is at most two years prior to death.
Several general results stand out: 1) Median total wealth was relatively high in
the year last observed for each of the three family pathway groups. 2) Wealth in
the last year before death is greatest for persons who were in two-person
households the longest period of time. For example, the average assets in the
last year observed were $141,606 for persons in one-person households in 1993
whose last year observed before death was 2006, $252,849 for persons in two-
person households in 1993 whose spouse was deceased when last observed in
2006, and $691,588 for person in two-person households in 1993 whose spouse
was alive when last observed in 2006. 3) For total wealth and for each of the
asset sub-categories there is a strong correspondence between the level of
assets in 1993 and the number of years a person survives after 1993. Persons
who lived longer had higher initial assets. 4) For each family pathway group,
there is a very strong relationship between health status and wealth in the last
year observed. Thus there is a strong association between health and wealth



                                       39
even among persons who would die within the next two years. 5) Despite the
appearance of substantial assets at the median, a substantial fraction of people
die with income less than $10,000 and with no financial assets and with zero
housing wealth.

        A rather large fraction of the original single-person households have low
income judged by the income poverty thresholds. We find that 12.1 percent are
below the poverty threshold and have no financial assets, and that 23 percent
are below twice the income poverty line and have no financial assets. To put the
results in context we first compare the total income in the last year observed to
total income in 1993, the first year the AHEAD data were collected. Total income
in the last year observed was about 4 percent higher, on average, than total
income in 1993. We also compare total median income in the last year observed
to median earnings (in 2008 dollars) of the same persons when they were
between ages 57 and 62. While the difference is hard to evaluate because the
two measures are not clearly comparable, overall median income in the last year
observed was approximately 50 percent lower than median earnings of the same
persons at ages 57 to 62.

        There are also important differences across the pathways. Consider for
example the proportion of persons with annuity income less than $20,000
(approximately twice the poverty level for single persons over age 65) and
financial assets less than $10,000: 52 percent of persons in the single-household
pathway fall below these thresholds, but only 36.4 percent of those in the two- to
one-person pathway, and only 26.3 percent of those in the two-person pathway.
Similarly, consider the proportion of persons with annuity income in the $10,000
to $20,000 interval and financial assets less than $10,000 who have zero
housing wealth: of those in the single family pathway 63.3 percent have zero
housing wealth, 53.0 percent of those in the two- to one-person pathway, and
only 25.9 percent of those in the two-person pathway. A perhaps striking
similarity across the pathways is that given income and housing wealth the health
status of the persons in the three pathways is very close. The median health
percentile of persons with annuity income in the $10,000 to $20,000 interval and
financial assets less than $10,000 is 28.2 for persons in the single-household
pathway, 23.9 percent for those in the two-to one-person pathway, and 28.2 for
persons in the two-person pathway. Finally, the total household income of one
to one and two to two households when last observed was only slightly less than
income in 1993, while income of two to one households was almost 75 percent
lower when last observed than in 1993. And for men with matched Social
Security records income when last observed was over 68 percent lower than
earning at ages 57 to 62 for one to one households, 106 percent lower for two to
one households, but only 23 percent less for two to two households.

        The results raise several issues. First, a noticeable fraction of persons die
with virtually no financial assets—46.1 percent with less than $10,000. Based on
a replacement rate comparison, many of these may be deemed to have been



                                         40
well-prepared for retirement, in the sense that their income in their final years
was not substantially lower than their income in their late 50s or early 60s. Yet
with such low asset levels, they would have little capacity to pay for unanticipated
needs such as health or other shocks or to pay for entertainment, travel, or other
activities. This raises a question of whether the replacement ratio is a sufficient
statistic for the “adequacy” of retirement preparation. In addition, this group
relies almost entirely on Social Security benefits for support in retirement. These
persons balance on only one leg of the oft touted three-legged stool that is said
to provide retirement support—Social Security, pension benefits, and personal
saving. If the one leg is judged inadequate it raises the question of how to
strengthen the other legs which in turn may, for example, increase interest in the
spread of 401(k)-like plans to low-wage workers in firms with high turnover.
