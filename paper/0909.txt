                 Exchange—Pate Policy After a Decade of "Floating't



                                ABSTRACT




      This paper integrates exchange—rate policy into a model of exchange—
rate behavior, and examines the data econometrically to infer hypotheses
about policy behavior in the 1970s. The model shows how unanticipated
movements in money, the current account, and relative price levels will
cause first a jump in the exchange rate, and then a movement along a
"saddle path" to the new long run equilibrium. Here the role of "news"
in moving the exchange rate is clear. The model is used to analyze the
options available to the central bank that wants to reduce the jump in
the exchange rate following a real or monetary disturbance. The distinc-
tion is made between monetary policy and sterilized intervention, and a
regime in which the domestic interest rate is used as the policy vari-
able is also studied. Systems of vector autoregressions (VARs) for each
of four countries——the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Japan——are estimated,
and the correlations among their residuals are studied. These represent
the "innovations," or "news" in the time series. A clear, pattern emerges
in these correlations, in which policy in the U.S. and to a lesser extent
Japan, drives exchange rates, and policy in Germany and the U.K. reacts.
It appears that U.S. monetary policy is essentially determined by domestic
considerations, with the exchange rate moving as a consequence. In Japan,
interest rates are varied in response to movement in the current—account
and relative price levels, and the effects on the exchange rate are par-
tially neutralized by sterilized intervention. Germany and the U.K. re-
act to movements in their exchange rates by moving interest rates, and
sterilized intervention.

I. Introduction arid Sunimarv

      During the 1970s an extensive theoretical literature has developed

analyzing market determination of freely floating exchange rates. At the

same time, there has been extensive and continuous intervention in the

market by central banks. Exchange rates have not been floating freely;

they have been managed, or manipulated, by central banks. However, most

of the description of exchange rate policy, as actually practiced has been

informal,   or   "literary," not integrated with the formal theoretical litera-

ture. Recent examples are the surveys in Branson (1980) and ussa (1981).

      Rather than reproduce Mussa's excellent review, in this paper I in-

tegrate exchange—rate policy into a model of exchange—rate behavior, and

examine the data econometrically, to infer hypotheses about policy be-

havior in the 1970s. I focus on four major currencies, the U.S. dollar,

the Deutschemark, Sterling, and the Japanese yen, and analyze movements

in their effective (weighted) exchange rates as calculated by the I' for

their relative cost arid price data.

       In section II a model of market determination of a floating exchange—

rate is laid out. It is a rational—expectations version of the model in

Branson (1977), and it draws on the model of Kouri(1978). The model

shows how unanticipated movements in money, the current account, and rela—

tive price levels vii]. cause first a jump in the exchange rate, and then

a   movement along a "saddle path" to the new long run equilibrium.    Here

the   role of "news" in moving the exchange rate, as recently emphasized by
                                                                             2.


Dornbusch (1980) and Frenkel (1981) is clear. The model ernphasizes ier—
fect substitutability between domestic and foreign bonds, in order to pre—

pare for the analysis of intervention policy in section III.

     Exchange—rate policy is introduced in section III. We analyze the

options available to the central bank that wants to reduce the jump in the

exchange rate following a real or monetary disturbance——"news" about the

current account, relative prices, or money. This is the policy character-

ized as "leaning against the wind" in Branson (1976). The distinction is

made between monetary   policy    and sterilized intervention. We also study

a regime in which the domestic interest rate is used as the policy variable.

     In   sections IV and V   we turn to the data. These are described system-

atically in section IV, where     we investigate the   time—series properties of

the exchange rate, money, realtive prices, and the current account, the

short—term interest rate, and reserves for each of the four countries. It

is difficult to sarize these data, but the time—series behavior of ex-

change rates, money, relative prices, and current—account balances are

roughly consistent with the model of section II.

     In section V we estimate system.s of    vector autoregressions (VARs)    for

each of the countries, and study the correlations among their residuals.

These represent the "innovations," or "news" in the time series. A clear

pattern emerges in these correlations, in which policy in the U.S. and to

a lesser extent Japa; drives exchange rates, and policy in Geiany and the

1LK. reacts. It appears that U.S. monetary policy is essentially deter—

mined by domestic considerations, with the exchange rate moving as a conse-

quence. In Japan, interest rates are varied in response to movement in the
                                                                       3.




current—account and relative price levels, and the effects on the exchange

rate are partially neutralized by sterlized intervention. Ger.any and the

U.K. react to movements in their exchange rates by moving interest rates,

and   sterlized   intervention.

II. An Asset—Market Model with Rational Expectations


II.A. Introduction


     The purpose of this section is to lay out a simple asset—market model

of exchange—rate determination within which, in the next section, monetary

policy reaction to movements in the exchange rate can be analyzed. The

literature of the l970s has identified three principal macroeconomic vari-

ables that influence movements in exchange rates. These are money supplies,

relative price levels, and current—account balances. Here I develop a re-

presentative model that explicitly includes all three elements. The model

is an extension of the asset—market model sketched in Branson (1975) , and

developed in full in Branson (1977). It is a close relative of Kouri

(1978). In the early versions of this model the focus was on the roles of

relative prices and asset markets, and static expectations were assumed.

Here the model is extended to study the effects of underlying "real" dis-

turbances influencing the current account and to include explicitly policy

intervention in a rational expectations framework.


II.B. Asset—maret specification.

     To make the analysis manageable, let us consider one country in a

many—country world. We can   aggregate   the assets available in this country

into a domestic money stock M, which is a nonearning asset, holdings of

domestically—issued assets B, which are denominated in home currency, and

net holdings of foreign—issued assets F, which are dominated in foreign

exchange)    B (for bonds) is government debt held by the private sector,
                                                                                    5.




 and BC is government debt held by the central bank. Total government debt

B =   B   +   B   F (for foreign assets) is the net claims on foreigners held by

 the domestic private sector and R is central bank foreign reserves. Total

national net claims on foreigners F =           F R.       The money stock M   is   equal to

R + BC, with a 100% reserve system.            I assume the initial exchange rate is

indexed to unity, and that the central bank does not permit capital gains or

losses on R to influence N. Similarly, interest income on the central bank's

holding of R is assumed to be turned over to the Treasury so that it does not

affect N. The current account in the balance of payments gives the rate of

accumulation of F over time. The rate of accumulation of B is the government

deficit. N is controlled by central bank purchases (or sales) of B or F

from (or to) the domestic private sector.

      The rate of return on F is given by ,             fixed   in the world capital

market, plus the expected rate of increase in the exchange rate, ê. The

rate of return on B is the domestic interest rate r, to be determined in

domestic financial markets. Total private—sector wealth, at any point in

time, is given by W         N + B + eF, so here the exchange rate e, in home

currency per      unit   of foreign exchange    (e.g.   $0.50 per DN), translates the

foreign—exchange value of F into home currency.


      The total supplies of      B and   F to the national economy are given at

each point in      time.   Each can   be accumulated     only over time   through   foreign

or domestic investment.2         Given   the   existing stocks of B and P at any
                                                                              6.




point in time, the central bank can make discrete changes in N by swapping

either B or F with the domestic private sector; these are open—market op-

erations in government debt or foreign assets.

      The demand for each asset by the private sector depends on wealth,

W = N   +   B   + eF, and both rates of return, r and r +   &. As   wealth rises,

demands for all three assets increase. The demands for B and F depend

positively on their own rates of return and negatively on those of the

other assets. The demand for money depends negatively on both r and

r + ê; as either rises, asset—holders attempt to shift from money into the

asset whose return has gone up.

      These asset—market equilibrium conditions are sunarized in equations

(1) —   (6).

(1)     N E R +    BC =m(r,       -.   ).W.
(2) B = b(r,          +   ê)W.

(3)     eF f(r,        +   ê)W.

(4) =M+B+eF.
(5) BC+BPB.
(6) F+R=T.
Eauation (4) is the balance sheet constraint, which insures that

m + b + f        1.. The three demand functions give the desired distribution of

the domestic wealth portfolio W into the three assets. Specifying the as-

set demand functions as homogeneous in wealth eliminates the prive level

from the asset—market equilibrium conditions. Given the balance sheet
                                                                             7.




 constraint (4), and gross substitutability of the three assets, we have

 the constraints on partial derivatives of the distribution functions:


                + r br < 0:        m— + b f <         0.


Here a subscript denotes a partial derivative. The three narket equili-

brium conditions (l)—(3) contain two   independent     equations given the bal-

ance sheet constraint (4). In equation (5) the bar over B indicates that

the total supply of government debt is fixed.

II.C. Asset accumulation and the current account.

     Equations (l)—(6) provide the specification of asset markets in the

model. The other main building block of the model is the current—account

equation. The balance—of—payments accounts provide the identity

         F E      +.   X + r(F + R) E X + rF.


where X is net exports of goods and non—capital services in terms      of for-
eign exchange. Net exports depend on the      real   exchange rate e/p, private

sector wealth W, (given by equation (4) above), and an exogenous shift

factor a which represents real events such as changes in tastes in tech-

nology, oil discoveries, etc., which increase net exports for given values

of e/p and W. Thus we can write

         X     X(e/P, W, z); X > 0, X. < 0;   X > 0.

The sign of Xe assumes the   Marshall—Lerner condition holds; X1 reflects
wealth effects on import demand.

     Substitution of the function for net exports into the balance—of—

payments identity gives us the equation for accumulation of national net
                                                                                8.




foreign assets:

      (7) F     X(e/p, W, z) +   F.
It is important to note that open—market swaps between the central bank

and the domestic private sector have no direct effect on W or F in (7).

And   the   effect of accumulation of national net foreign assets through a

current—account surplus (t       > 0)   on W and   F is the same regardless of the

distribution of F between F and R.           Since an increase n R, ceteris

paribus, increases the money stock, which is part of W, any increase in F

viii raise W by dF independently of the split between F and R. Thus the

central bank's intervention policy will have no effect on how a current—

account balance moves F and W in (7).

       The effect of an increase in F on           in (7) is unclear.




with X < 0 and r >     0.   Below we will conveniently assume that F/T = 0;

it will quickly become apparent why this is convenient. In Branson (1981),

the case where F/aP < 0      is analyzed.


      Equations (l)—(7) plus the assumption of rational expectations (or,

more precisely, perfect foresight in this non—stochastic model) give us a

complete dynamic model in F and ê. Price dynamics are suppressed, but we

will discuss below exogenous price movements as delayed response to mone-

tary shocks.

II.D. Solution of the model.

      Solution of the model proceeds as follows. First, the rational expec-

tations assumption is that ê is the rate of change of e. Then two equations
                                                                                            9.




of (l)—(3), with wealth substituted from (4) can be used to solve for r and

  as functions of M, W,                         The ê and F equations then are two dynamic

equations in e and F that can be solved for the movement in these two

variables.


       Divide equations (1) and (3) by W and differentiate totally, holding

r constant:


(8)       d() = mdr + m.dê

              '-p

              W
                    =   f   r
                                dr +   fdê
                                        e


These can be solved in matrix form as:


(9)
        (r\                                     [L _m.] (d(—_)\
                    rê frmé) L mj                          \
The solution for dé is then


(10)      dê =
                                 rê             frd* +


The coefficients of eF/W and M/W are the partial derivatives of the é

adjustment function,


(II)    ê —   (-—-,) ;                 >   0;     <   0.


This is the dynamic equation to be solved along with (7) for                    to obtain

equilibrium e and F.

       In the e, F space of Figure 1, the ê = 0 locus is a rectangular

hyperbola. This can be seen by observing that in 4, eF enter multiplica—

tively (in W as wal]. as the numerator pl), so changes in e and F that

hold the product          eF       constant will hold ê constant. CombInations of e and

      off    the   locus move e away from it, as the arrows show. For examDle,

since           >0    an increase in e or F from a point on the locus makes

ê >    0.

        An increase in M/W, holding eF/W constant, ou1d shift the                         = 0

locus in Figure 1 up. This would be the result of an expansicnary open—

market operation in the government debt market with dBC                         >   0,    and no

change in R or F. An Increase in e.1/W, holding M/W constant,                         will
shift       ê = 0 do; this could result from an open—market swap between F and

B. An expansionary            open—market operation in         the foreign asset market, with

 the central bank altering reserves by exchanging N for F with                      the   private

 sector, would shift e              = 0 up both by increasing M/W and reducing eF/W.

This will          provide   the difference between intervention in the bond or

 foreign—asset markets in the model.

            For given values of z and P in the F equation (7), the F                     0 locus in

 e,          space is a horizontal line at the e value where X                 —rF. This is

 shown       in FIgure 2. If          e IS    above this value, the current—account is in

 surplus and         F > 0. In        section III we    will   introduce a "leaning against

 the wind" exchange—rate policy in which the authorities attempt to reduce

 the extent         of jumps n        the    exchange rate,   but not to reverse them. Thus

we rule        out here      the   possibility that the monetary authority "over—
 intervenes," and asse that the sign of F is the same as the sign of F;
 this is the same as assuming Ikl < II. This essentially asses that the
 authorities permit the              market to     guide the system towards    its long—run

 equilibrium,         but perhaps       slow    the movement. The assumption gIves         the   ar-
 rows showing movement in Figure                  2; above     — 0,   F > 0, below it is     negative.
                                                                                           11.



       An increase in z        in   (7) will   shift   the F      0 locus down.    Given   the

assumption that X + r               0, te extent       of   the shift is simply given by the

effect of a change in e on X:


           de                  1
                F=0
If z    rises, increasing X and giving a current account surplus, e must fall

(currency appreciate) enough to restore the original value of X. An ir

crease in P will shift               0 up, with


           de
                          —i
           dp .


        Equilibrium of the system is shown in Figure 3. There is one saddle—
path into the equilibrium shown by the dashed line. For a given value of
F, it is assumed that following a disturbance, the market vii]. pick the
value    for e    that puts the system on the saddlepath toward equilibrium.
The system would have quite different properties under a policy regime of
ovarinterventicn" that reversed the pattern of movement in the horizontal

direction.


II.E.     Reaction to Exogenous Shocks.

II.E.l     Nonetarv disturbance.

        Consider an (unanticipated) expansionary open—market operation in

government debt. This initially leaves W and F                     unchanged.     There are two

etreme     assumptions on price adjustment to consider: no change in P, or

dP/P =    di/ iediately.
        With no change in P as M increases, the F = 0 locus in Figure 4 does

not shift, but ê = 0 shifts up. With F initially given, the exchange

 rate jups (currency depreciates) from initial equilibrium E0 to                   on

 the new saddlepath. This establishes ê < 0 as needed for asset—holders

 to hold the existing stock of F given the lower iiiterest. rate. The

rise in e/P generates a current—account surplus, and F rises with e fall-

ing toward E2. This is an etexne            form of   "overshooting."

        Suppose the domestic price lve1iediate1y reacts by rising by the

same proportion as the monet stock. Then F = 0 also shifts up by that

same proportion. The extent of the upward shift in ê = 0 depends on ini-

tial portfolio distribution and the degree of substitutability among F,

M, and B.      One borderline case would be N e and m =

seen in the expression for dê in equation (10) that in this can a pro—

partial increase in e will maintain ê = 0.            To the extent that N >      eF    or

    >
        1r1'   the ê =   0 curve would shift up more than F = 0, requiring
"overshooting't and ê <     0, F >    0   moving to equilibrium. The reverse ini-

tial conditions would yield "undershocting" with ê >           0,       < 0   in the

movement to equilibrium.

II.E.2. Real disturbance.

     The effect of an unanticipated fall in z (or an increase in P) is

shown in Figure 5. The decrease in competitiveness shifts t                 = 0 up from
its initial intersection with     ê       0 atE. The exchange rate jumps

(currency depreciates) from          to E1, and then gradually rises to E2 as

F falls. The depreciation of the currency restores current—account bal-

ance (t   = 0).   The model"undershoots" in response to real disturbances.
                                                                             13.




II.E.3. Sluggish price adjustment.

     A limiting case of sluggish price adjustment could be modelled as a

combination of Figures 4 and 5. Expansionary monetary policy would begin

this process illustrated in Figure 4. The delayed price response would

then resemble Figure 5. To the extent that the price response is logged

and unanticipated, the e, F point would follow     a   path illustrated in

Figure 6. Quicker price response or anticipation would straighten the

path to E2, which may be to the right or left of E0 depending on initial

portfolio distribution and substitutability.

II.F. Conclusions and empirical implications.

     It is convenient to summarize here the basic conclusions from the

analysis so far.


     1. Unanticipated changes in money, the price level, or under-

          lying real conditions should cause a jump in the exchange

          rate toward the new rational—expectations saddle path.

     2.   Thus we should expect to see correlation between unantici-
          pated movements    in e and M, X, and P in the data. Some

          initial evidence was presented in Branson (1981); more is

          presented below.

    3. Movement of the exchange rate following a real disturbance

          is likely to be monotonic, while monetary disturbances are

          likely to produce "overshooting." Lagged price adjustment

          makes "multiple overshooting" possible. This can be seen

          in a combination of Figures 4 and 6.
                                                                             14.




 II.G. Interest—rate control as an alternatIve to money—supply control.

       In interpreting the empirical   results   on exchange—rate policy in sec-

tion V below, it viii be convenient to have a version of the model in which

the monetary authority manipulates its holdings of government debt in order

to hit an interest—rate target, and uses the interest rate as the instru—

ment of monetary   policy.   Here we take r as exogenous, fixed by policy,

and permit B/W and M/W to vary as necessary to hold r at its target value.

       To solve the model under a regime of interest—rate control, we make

r exogenous and M/W endogenous in equations (8) above, and then solve for

d& and d(M/W). This yields an ê equation in the form


(12)
             eF
         e=*(—V—, r), *1>0 ;*2>0.

The interest rate simply replaces M/W here.

       The ê   0 locus is still a rectangular hyperbola in e, F space. A

reduction in r, implying an increase in M/W and decrease in B/W, shifts

the ê = 0 locus up. Thus Figure 4 provides a qualitative description of

the effect of a reduction of the interest—rate target in a regime of mone-

tary control. The etfects of movement in the interest rate on the path

of the exchange rate are clearly the same as the effects of the corres-

ponding change in M/W in the model with monetary control.
                                                                                 15.




    III. "Leanins Aainst the Wind" as Exchange Rate Policy

    III.A. Introduction.

         There is already ample evidence that monetary authorities have gen-

    erally tried to slow the movement of exchange rates. This type of inter-

    vention has long been characteristic of U.S. domestic monetary policy; in

    Branson (1976) I labelled this "leaning against the wind" as exchange

    rate policy. Artus (1976) and Branson, Halttunen and Masson (P2) (1977'

    presented evidence that German monetary policy responded to movements

    in the exchange rate in this fashion. B} (1977) estimated a reaction

    function of the for-rn        czLe + ...,   with   < 0 for Germany. As the ex-

    change rate rose (1DM depreciated), the money supply was reduced (relative

    to its trend). Amano (1979) describes Japanese monetary policy as attempt-

    ing to stabilize the exchange rate similarly. U.K. exchange rate policy

    was discussed briefly in OECD (1977), where a regression of the form

        = $Ae + ...,   with   r the minimum lending rate (R) arid 8 > 0 is reported.

    This suggests that when sterling depreciated (e rose), the NLR was increas-

    ed as a policy reaction. More recently, Mussa (1981) has presented a tho-

    rough review of exchange—rate intervention which is consistent with a

    "leaning—against—the—wind" model.

         The purpose of this section of the paper is to characterize policy in-

    tervention in terms of the model of section II, to prepare for interpre-

    tation of the empirical results in section V below. The objective is not

    to evaluate policy; it is to describe it. The main difference from the

-
    previous   models is the description of intervention as instantaneous and

    discrete changes In asset stocks via open—market operations to reduce the

    size of discontinuous jumps in exchange rates. This type of policy be-

    havior is discernable in the "innovation" correlations in section V below.
                                                                               16.




     'e will begin with the descriptfon of monetary policy reaction to
                                                                 debt or for-
real dIsturbances via open—market operations in government

eign assets. Then we study sterilized intervention in the foreign asset

market.


III.B. Monetary poli.

     Consider a real disturbance to the current account that shifts

F = 0 up, (rise in e) to restore equilibrium.        This is illustrated in

Figure 7, where in the absence of policy intervention, the exchange rate

would jump from the initial equilibrium E0 to           and then depreciate fur-

                                                           selling bonds to the

This would be an unexpected change in N, since the originating shift in

    In a mode]. with interest—rate control, the same result as the bond—

market open—market operation of Figure 7 could be obtained by an appropri-

ate increase in. the interest rate target. The necessary increase in

could be reduced by performing the open—market operation in the foreign

asset market.


III.C. Sterilized Intervention.

     There is by now ample evidence that central banks intervene in the

foreign exchange markets but attempt to prevent the intervention from

changing the path of M. The literature was cited in Whitman (1975); more

recent results are discussed in Obstfeld (1980) (1982).      In terms of the

model of section III, this is an open—market exchange of foreign assets

f or bonds by the central bank, with LB—eLF' initially. The result is

again a downward shift in ê =   0, as in Figure 7, plus an outward shift in
F. Thus the jump in the exchange rate is to a point below E1, since       F
                                                               that does not
increases. This presents the possibility for intervention

move the path of the money supply.

III.D. Monetary disturbances.

     Shifts in asset demand functions on the foreign interest rate would
                                                                 such as
shift the ê = 0 locus, and the exchange rate would follow a path

that of Figure 4, at least initially. Either monetary or sterilized inter-

vention could reduce the extent of the shift in        0, reducing the jump

in e. The central bank would vary the supplies of the three assets to

meet, at least partially, shifts in their demands by the public. Again,

this is a   straight—forward extension   of "leaning_againsttheWind" policy

reaction from the   domestic to the international markets.
                                                                         18.




III.E. Emnirical Irirolications.


     The principal empirical implication of the present model of policy

intervention is that we should observe the intervention in the correlation

of unexpected movements or "innovations" in exchange rates with innova-

tions in money and/or reserves. Nonetary intervention would give a nega-

tive correlation between exchange—rate and money innovations. Interven-

tion with interest—rate control would give a positive correlation between

exchange—rate and interest—rate innovations. If the monetary intervention

is done in the foreign—asset market, a positive correlation between

exchange—rate innovations and reserves would result. Sterilized interven-

tion would give the reserve—exchange rate correlation without a money—

exchange rate correlation. Thus we can study the correlation matrix of

innovations in section V below to infer hypotheses about policy behavior.
                                                                        19.




IV. The Data

IV.A. Introduction.

     The asset—market model of section II implies that unanticipated ex—

ogerious movements in the money stock, the current—account balance, and re-

lative price levels will cause unanticipated jumps in the exchange rate.

     The intervention model of section III implies that unanticipated

jumps in exchange rates can cause unanticipated changes in the money stock,

reserves, or interest rates. Thus innovations in money or interest rates

may have a positive or negative correlation with innovations in exchange

rates. If the correlatIon is negative, the inferred hypothesis would be

that the underlying model is a monetary reaction function. A negative

correlation between reserve and exchange—rate innovations would indicate

exchange—market intervention. In this and the following section of the

paper we see that the quarterly data for the U.S., Germany, Japan, and the

U.K. can be interpreted in this framework. We are inferring testable hypo-

thesis from the data in this exercise.

     In this and the next section, we study relationships of movements in

the exchange rate of each country, measured by the effective exchange

rate as defined by the IN,with movements in money stocks, current—account

balances, relative prices, reserves, and interest rates.   The purpose is

to see what policy stance is implied by the data. The data are described

in detail in Table 1.

     The first step in analyzing the data is to investigate their time—

series properties. This provides a compact description of the "facts,"
                                                                                          20.



and an initial indication of whether the facts are roughly consistent with
the theory. The time—series analysis of the data is done in this section.
                                                                 autoregressions, one for each
Then in section V we study systems of vector

country, to test the relations between unanticipated changes, or "innova—

tions," in the variables.


IV..   B.    Time series analysis.

            In this section the autoregressive structure of each time series is

described by regression equations of the form:

where X t is the log of the time series under consideration, Xt—1   .   is
its value lagged i quarters, D1 is a seasonal dummy, and t is time.
Equation (12) is a univariate autoregression of the variable X on its
own past   values, and the estimated   values of the a coefficients give the

pattern    of response of the time   series to   a disturbance u. The two    cases

that   will prominently appear in our data are first—order autoregression, where
only    is significant, and second—order autoregression, where a1 and a2
are significant. One purpose of the analysis is simply to describe the
data; the second is to     see if the time—series structure of the exchange—

rate data is consistent with that of the other data.

       For each variable we began with a regression on four lags, seasonal

dummies, and a time trend. We then shortened the lags by eliminating in-

significant variables at the far end of the lag. The results are shown

in Tables 2 through 5, one for each country. Each column in the tables

shows the results of a regression of the indicated variable on lagged

values of itself. Coefficients of the time trend and seasonal dummies

are not shown. The regressions are performed on quarterly data for the

period 1973—IV to 1980—IV. The beginning date was chosen because it was

after the major period of disequilibrium adjustment in 1971—73, including

a major real devaluation of the U.S. dollar,                             and the

last date was the most recent for which data were available when we began

the study in June 1981. The regressions were run using the jogs of e.x—

change rates, relative prices, and money, and the levels of the current—

account balance, interest rates, and reserves. The current—account and

reserves are both   time   series that pass through zero in some cases.

        The results for the U.S. are instructive, and      serve   as an illustra-

tion of the technique. In the first two columns of Table 2, we show the

regressions for the log of the U.S. nominal effective exchange rate e,

weighted by the IMF, in foreign currency per dollar. The first column

shows the regression with four lags on the exchange rate; only the lag at

t—l is significant with a coefficient of 0.86. When the lags at t—2

through t—4 are eliminated, the standard error of the estimated equation

falls a bit, and the coefficient of ei is 0.78. Thus the U.S. effective

rate, measured as a quarterly average, can be described as a stable first—

order autoregression (AR1).      The coefficient of 0.78 in et_l indicates

that a given disturbance        will eventually disappear from the time series

                                                                   =                =

        The third   and fourth colt.ns of   Table   2 show the results for the log
of   the U.S. relative price index PIT. This is an index of the 'U.S. WPI

relative to a weighted average of the WPI's of thirteen other industrial

countries. The variable PIeP is       the   ff's measure of relative cost, pub-

lished in the International Financial Statistics.           It is the inverse of

the "real exchange rate" of section II.

     The first regression for P/P in Table 2 gives significant coefficients

to the lags at t—l and t—2. Elimination of the longer lags results in the

second equation, with a standard error only slightly larger than the first.

The result for P/P is a second—order autoregression (AR2), with a stable

cyclical response to a disturbance.3

     The next two pairs of columns in Table 2 show the univariate auto-

regression results for the two U.S. money stocks. In both cases only the

lag at t—l is significant. Both are stable first—order autocorrelations.




     The next two columns in Table 2 show the autoregressions for the

current—account balance. These are run on the level of CAB, rather than

its log, since the time series passes through zero. The result is similar

to that for the money stocks.




    The next three columns in Table 2 show the autoregressions for the

U.S. short—term interest rate. All four lag coefficients are significant

in the first column. In the second regression, with just lags at t—l and

t-2, the second is completely insignificant. Beyond t—l, the important

lags are at t—3 and t—4. The last of the three regressions includes only

the lag at t—l; the standard error is clearly higher than in the four—lag

regression. Rather than include in the VAR system for the U.S. in section
                                                                      25.




V four (or triore) lags on the interest rate, which would greatly reduce

degrees of freedom, I decided to include only the lag at t—l. The

last two columns of Table 2 show the regressions for U.S. reserves. Only

the lag at t—l is significant, giving a stable first—order autoregression.




     In the case of the U.S., then, money stocks, the balance on current

account, reserves, and the nominal effective exchange rate all follow

stable AR]. processes. This suggests that the behavior of money stocks,

the current—account balance, reserves, and the exchange rate are consis-

tent, at this level, with the theoretical model of section II and III.

     The relationships between interest rates and relative prices, and

the exchange rate is more complicated. With relative prices following

an AR2, there is at best a loose relationship to the exchange rate.   This

is consistent with the evidence of high variability in PPP in Prenkel

(1981). The higher—order process for the interest rate suggests that it

is being moved by all the exogenous variables simultaneously, rather than

reacting systematically to, or causing directly, the exchange rate.


IV.C.2. West Cerman.

     Table 3 shows the univariate autoregression results for Germany. The

format is exactly the same as for the U.S., so the discussion can be brief.

     As in the U.S. case, the nominal effective rate, the money stocks,

and the balance on current account all follow AR1 processes in Germany.

ing that it is a "random walk": the change in M3 is (roughly) white noise.

The German relative price series is AR2 with a stable cyclical response

to disturbances.4      The Ger-man interest rate is AR1 with a lag coeffi-

cient close to unity. Reserves have a barely significant lag at t—3, but

but can be approximated by a stable AR1. Thus the impression from the

German data is similar to the U.S., except for the additional possibility

that the interest rate is used as a policy instrument to control move-

ments in the exchange rate.

tive rate and the Ml money stock in the U.K. have coefficients of unity

on the t—l lag, indicating that they follow a random walk. The relative

price series is AR2, as in the U.S. and Germany, but with a stable mono—

tonic adjustment response to disturbances.

        In the first regression for the current—account balance, there are

no significant lag terms. Thus the U.K. CAB is best described as random

around the path described by the trend and seasonal dummy terms. This

suggests that the innovations in the CAB in the U.K. should not be inter—

preted as conveying information about future movements in the exchange
        5
rate.

        Both the interest rate and reserves in the U.K. follow second—order

autoregressions, with stable cyclical responses to disturbances. This

would be consistent with interest rate policy being used to control

reserves.

IV.C.4.     Japan

      The   results for Japan are summarized in Table 5. There we see major
differences from the other three countries. The nominal effective ex-
change rate, the relative price series, the current—account balance, and
the   interest rate are all AR2 with stable cyclical response patterns.

The two money stocks are AR1 with unitary lag coefficients. Reserves in

Japan follow a complex autoregression of at least the fourth degree.

Comparison of the first two reserve regressions in Table 5 shows the im-

portance  of the lag at t—4. To conserve degrees of freedom in the
Japanese VAR system reported in section V, I used the first—order approx-
imation.6      Thus in the Japanese   case the time—series behavior of the

exchange    rate is consistent with   that of relative prices, the current ac-

count, and the interest rates, but the exchange rate does not follow the

random—walk pattern of money.

IV.D. Suiarv on the data.

       The univariate autoregressions of Tables 2 through 5 provide a use-

ful aridcourpact description of the 'facts." Comparing the country results,

we see several common points.

       1. All weighted relative price series are second—order

            autoregressions with stable responses to shocks. All

            but the U.K. series are cyclical.

       2. All the money stocks are first—order autoregressions,

            many with unitary lag coefficients.

3. The U.S. and German e.xchange—rate and current-account

    series are first—order autoregressions, and the Japanese

    are second—order. Thus these movements in exchange rate

   are consistent with movements in the current—account bal-

   ance, while the U.K. CAB contains no information about

   its future path.

V. Emirical Results Using Vector Autoregression

V.A. Introduction.

     A useful technique for studying the relationships between the inno-

vations in money, the current account balance, relative price levels, in-

terest rates, reserves, and the exchange rate is vector autoregression

(VAR). Here each variable of a system is regressed against the lagged

values of all variables (including itself) in the system, to extract any

information existing in the movements of these variables. The residuals

from these "vector autoregressions" are the innovations — the unantici-

pated movements ——   in   the variables. e can study the correlations of

the residuals to see if they are consistent with the hypotheses implied

by the theory of sections II and III. The vector autoregression techni-

que is introduced and justified by Sims (1980). A clear exposition is

presented in Sargent (1979). Interesting and instructive applications

are discussed in Taylor (1980), Ashenfelter and Card (1981), and Fischer

(1981).

     Here I estimate systems of VARs       for   each of the four countries, the

U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Japan. Two systems were estimated for each

country. Both include the effective exchange rate e, the current account

balance CAB, and the effective relative price PIP, the interest rate IS,

and reserves R; the difference between the two         is   that one includes Ml

and the other M3. An      obvious   extension of the research would be to in-

clude cross—country effects, particularly of money stocks, but also the

other variables. The difficulty in proceeding in this direction comes

from the limited number of quarterly observations: 29 from 1973—IY to
                                                                         30.




1980—IV. Each VAR   includes   lagged values of four variables, a time trend,

and three seasonal duies. In order to expand the analysis, I am pre-

sently moving to a monthly data base.

     Before estimating the VARs, one must consider the issue of the timing

of the data. The effective exchange rate can be computed from public in-

formation on a daily basis. In fact, a UK effective rate is published

daily in the Financial Times. Our data are averages during the quarter.

The effective rate used here is the inverse of e as defined in sections

II and III. Money stock data are available on a weekly basis, so they

are roughly contemporaneous with the exchange rage data. Our money data

are end—of—period. We would expect from section II that the weekly changes

in N would generate nearly simultaneous movements in e. Thus the innova-

tion of the average e over a quarter would be most closely connected in

our data with the innovation of the end—of—quarter money stock, which is

the cumulation of the weekly innovations. Reserves are also end—of—period

data, so that intervention to slow an unanticipated jump in e would appear

as an innovation in reserves.

     The relative price data are quarterly averages of monthly data, which

become known soon after the month finishes. Thus in our data set1 the in-

novation in e would be most closely connected to the innovation in P/Pr.

Interest rates are also quarterly averages, so that if the interest rate

were used to control the exchange rate we would see a correlation between

the innovations in e and in IS.

     On the other hand, the data on the quarterly balance in current ac-

count are not announced until well into the following quarter. Thus to
                                                                      31.




the extent that the innovation in CAB signals a change in the equilibrium

real exchange rate, it is the innovation in
                                              CABt 1 that moves et.

     The VAR residuals to be correlated, then, are those of
                                                              et      (P/)
CABi. IS, and R. We will use a        to designate residuals from the VARs.

The variables in each VAR system are listed in Table 6. The number of

lags included in each variable was determined by the univariate autoregres-

sion of Table 2 through 5. This constraint provides a convenient way to

limit the number of regressors and conserve degrees of freedom. A next

step in research would be to re—estimate the VAR systems with additional

lags to see how much information is lost by application of this constraint.

     After the VAR systems are estimated, we correlate their residuals to

study the relationship among innovations. The correlations are givenfor

the systems with Ml and M3 in Tables 7—14 below, two for each country.

Each table includes the correlation coefficients among the VAR "innovaton"

and in parentheses the probability of that correlation occurring under the

null hypothesis that the true correlation is zero.

     In discussing the correlations, we will focus on

   the correlations particularly relevant for analyzing exchange—rate de-

termination and policy. Detailed discussion of all the results would be

far too tedious.

V.B. United States

    The correlations of VAR innovations for the U.S. are shown in Tables

7 and 8. Remember that here the effective nominal exchange rate is de-

fined in units of foreign exchange per unit of home currency, the inverse

of the theoretical definition of sections II and III. So here an increase

in e is an appreciation.

       The first rows of Tables 7 and S give the correlations of exchange—rate in-

novations. The negative signs for relative prices and money are consistent with

innovations in those variables driving e, as in the model of section II. There

is a weak correlation with reserves, consistent with intervention. Innovations

in reserves, shown in the last columns of Tables 7 and 8, are positively corre-

lated with innovations in CAB, but not in money. It is useful here to recall

that   the CAB     is   lagged one period, so that the correlation is       between   the re-
sidual CABt         and R. Thus the indication in Table 7 and S is that intevention
               1
comes at the     point    where the CAB   announcement would move the exchange rate, not
during the period in which the actual CAB occurs.


       The underlying vector autoregression for e (not sh here) also

shows a strong Granger—causal role for lagged CAB. Thus the hypothesis

I would infer from          the   U.S. data is as follows. The    current   account,

money,'and relative prices all move the           exchange    rate, the latter two

through     market expectations and innovations. Monetary policy is essential-

ly oriented toward domestic targets; movement in the exchange rate is a

side   effect.      The U.S. moneta authorities intervene and sterilize, but

do   not   follow a tight rule. This shows up in        the   strong correlation be—

R and CAB, and in the correlation between R and e.

V.C.     Germany

       The innovation correlations for Germany are shown in Tables              9   and 10.
In the     first row of both tables we see a very strong negative correlation

between    exchange—rate and re1atve         price innovations. This could come

from exchange rates causing prices, or vice versa, but through innovations

and market expectations rather than a tight PPP relationship. The corre-

lations of exchange—rate innovations with short—term interest rates and reserves

(in the Ml system) must reflect leaning—against—the—wind policy both in terms                       of

interest rates and intervention. The negative correlation of the inter-

est rate and CAB innovations suggests that interest—rate policy may re—

spond to the state of the CA.B   as   well as to the exchange rate. The lack

of correlation between money and reserves or exchange rates indicates

sterilized intervention. The correlation between CAB and R also supports

the intervention hypothesis.

fixed—rate regime.

with interest—rate and intervention policy reacting to innovations in e

and CAB with Mi unsterilized.

V.E. Japan

     The results for Japan are shown in Tables 13 and 14. Let us focus
on Table 13 first. The correlation of innovations in the exchange rate

and interest rate suggest a system of interest rate control with policy

targets other than   the   exchange rate, rather than reaction to exchange

rates as in the U.K. and Germany. The correlations of the interest rate

with relative prices and the CAB suggest that these might be the targets.

     The reserve correlations with the exchange rate and CAB strongly sug-

gest "leaning—against—the—wind" intervention, with the central bank ob—

sorbing part of the CAB innovations to reduce movement in the exchange

rate. The lack of correlation of Ml with reserves on the exchange rate

indicates sterlization.


     An interesting story emerges from the Japanese correlations. They

suggest that policy sets interest rates with CAB and P/P among the objec-

tives. The interest rate moves the exchange rate, as in section II, and

the authorities intervene to, in a sense, neutralize this effect. They

also attempt to sterilize N]. from all of this.

     The VAR system with M3 is consistent with this story in term.s of

signs of correlations, although significance levels vary from the Ml sys—

tm (in both directions — see the correlation of IS and CAB).

My interpretation, or inferred set of hypotheses Is as follows.          The

U.S. sets monetary   policy,   largely by controlling quantities, with do-

mestic objections most in mind. The market looks to innovations in

money and relative prices, and levels of the current—account balance,

to set the U.S. exchange rate. The monetary authority attempts steri-

lized intervention occasionally.

     In Japan, interest rates are set with     relative   prices (or rates of

inflation) and the current—account balance among the leading objectives.

Interest—rate innovations move the exchange rate, but an attempt is

made to neutralize this effect through sterilized intervention.

     Movements in the U.S. and Japanese effective rates, caused partly

by fundamentals and partly by policy, are mirrored instantaneously in

the U.K. and German effective rates, and their policy reacts.       The re-

action appears as "defensive" interest—rate movements sensitive to

exchange—rate and CAB innovations, and largely sterilized intervention

in the foreign   ecchange   market. Thus a consistent story in which do—

mestiGally—oriented policy in the U.S. and Japan is transmitted in the

U.K. and Germany is consistent with the VAR     innovation   results.


     One final issue appears in the relations among exchange—rate and

interest—rate innovations. The correlation in the U.S. is negligible,

while in the U.K. and Germany it is strongly negative.        An implication

is that innovations in the dollar prices of the DM and Sterling should

be negatively correlated with innovations in the U.S.—German and

U.S.—U.K. interest differentials, as noted by Frenkel (1981).           The
                                                                    36.




hypothesis advanced there was that nominal interest rates and exchange

rates were both reacting to changes in inflation rates. The alternative

hypothesis provided here is that U.K. and German interest rate innova-

tions are policy reactions.

                                        FOOTNOTES


 1.    Since the analysis here applies to any single country in the interna-

       tional financial system, I use the terms 'home' and 'foreign' to denote

       the country being discussed and the rest of the system, respectively.

      At the level of generality of this discussion no damage would be done

      if the reader substituted U.S. for 'home country', 'dollar' for 'home

      currency' and 'Fed' for 'central bank'.

2.    Since F is home claims on foreigners less home liabilities to foreign-

      ers, an asset swap which exchanges a claim and a liability with a f or—

      eign asset—holder is a transaction within F, changing claims and lia-

      bilities by the same amount. This transaction would leave F and B un-

      changed. The reason for using this particular aggregation will become

      clear when we study dynamic adjustment below. Basically, we want to

      define net foreign assets consistently with the balance of payments and

      national income and product accounts, which record the capital account

      balance as the change in U.S. private holdings of net foreign assets.

      The assumptions outlined above make N and B non—traded assets. This

      implies that the total stocks of N, B, and F in domestic portfolios

      are given at any point in time.

3.    The characteristic equation is given by

                    —    1.36 P/_1 +0.60 P1'1't2 = 0.

      The roots of this equation are .68      .371, with a modulus of
      0.77 =   0.61/2   .
                                                                       2.




4.   Note that the German price equation would not invert due to multico—

     linearity with more than two lags.

5.   A moving average specification of the equation for the U.K. CAB was

     also experimented with, with no improvement in results. The U.K. CAB

     does seem to be random about its trend.

6.   The Japanese VAR results were re—estimated using a four—quarter lag

     on reserves, without much change.
