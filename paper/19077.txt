This paper formulates a structural dynamic programming model of preschool investment choices of
altruistic parents and then empirically estimates the structural parameters of the model using the NLSY79
data. The paper finds that preschool investment significantly boosts cognitive and non-cognitive skills,
which enhance earnings and school outcomes. It also finds that a standard Mincer earnings function,
by omitting measures of non-cognitive skills on the right hand side, overestimates the rate of return
to schooling. From the estimated equilibrium Markov process, the paper studies the nature of within
generation earnings distribution and intergenerational earnings and schooling mobility. The paper
finds that a tax financed free preschool program for the children of poor socioeconomic status generates
positive net gains to the society in terms of average earnings and higher intergenerational earnings
and schooling mobility.

1     Introduction

This paper formulates and estimates an altruistic model of parental preschool investment decisions.

In our model preschool investments affect the cognitive and non-cognitive skills of the children

and hence their lifetime permanent earnings and school outcomes. Optimal choices by parents

determine the equilibrium controlled Markov process, characterizing the equilibrium dynamics

of earnings distributions within each generation, and the schooling and earnings mobility across

generations. We also examine the effect of a social policy that provides free preschool to children of

low socioeconomic status (SES) financed by taxing all parents in the population, on the distribution

of earnings within generation and on intergenerational earnings and schooling mobility. We use

the NLSY79 (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979) and the NLSY79 Children and Young

Adults data containing information on a nationally representative sample of parent-child pairs of

the US population. This paper extends Raut (2003) by incorporating unobserved heterogeneity

and estimating the structural parameters. The paper utilizes the Rust (1987) nested fixed point

maximum likelihood estimation procedure.

    Two important building blocks of our model are: (1) The stochastic production processes of

the cognitive and non-cognitive skills with early childhood investment as one of the inputs; (2) An

augmented Mincer earnings function that adds non-cognitive skills to the standard Mincer earnings

function. We estimate these relationships. We provide an estimate of the extent to which the rate

of return to schooling in the standard Mincer earnings function is inflated because the schooling

level in the standard Mincer earnings function embodies the effect of the omitted non-cognitive

skills variables.

    In the past three decades, the income gap between the rich and the poor and the wage gap

between the college educated and the non-college educated workers in the US have been widening.

Equalizing education is advocated as the main policy in the US to reduce poverty and income

disparities. Many are, however, highly skeptical about a positive answer to the basic question:

“Can we conquer poverty through school?”

    There are many reasons for this skepticism. In the US, education up to high school level

is virtually free. Yet many children of poor SES do not complete high school and many of them

perform poorly in schools. Gaps in test score between the rich and poor children are substantial and

unequal schooling does little to widen this gap (Carneiro and Heckman, 2003; Heckman, 2008).

In spite of its positive effects on test scores and earnings, the effects of improved school quality on

school drop out rates is marginal.

    A growing consensus reached among educators, among media writers (see for instance Traub,

2000), among researchers in economics (see for instance Carneiro and Heckman, 2003; Cunha

et al., 2006; Heckman, 2000, 2008) find that children of poor SES are not prepared for college

because they were not prepared for school to begin with. The most effective intervention for the

children of poor SES should be directed at the preschool stage so that these children are prepared

for school and college. The question is then, does preschool experience have long-term positive

effects on school performance and labor market success? This is the main issue that we address

in this paper and corroborates the evidence in Cunha and Heckman (2007, 2009); Heckman et al.

(2010a,b) that early intervention is effective.

   There are two types of quantitative studies on this issue. One set of studies use data on high

cost high quality pilot preschool programs such as the High Scope/Perry Preschool Program (see

Heckman et al., 2010a,b) and the North Carolina Abecedarian Study (Campbell et al., 2012). These

studies find a substantial lasting effect of these programs on school performance and labor market

outcomes. The participants in these programs are not representative of the US population.

   The other set of studies use data on the Head Start preschool program which is funded by the

Federal government. It is available to the children whose parents earn incomes below poverty

line. Not all eligible children are, however, covered by the program. The quality of the program

is very poor compared to the enriched pilot programs or most private preschool programs. Some

studies find that the Head Start Preschool Program has no long-term effect on children’s cognitive

achievements and school performance, especially for black children. Currie and Thomas (1995)

carry out a careful econometric investigation and conclude that the benefits disappear for black

children because most of the Head Start black children attend low quality public schools. But after

controlling for the school quality, they find significant positive effects of Head Start Preschool

Program. See the recent study by Deming (2009).

   These studies are not based on nationally representative samples of children. Most studies

examine only the effect on school performance such as grade retention and high school and college

graduation rates, and do not model parental choice of investing in their children’s preschool. In

this paper, we formulate a model of parental investment in preschool that is guided by economic

incentives. We show that the preschool experience benefits children in acquiring many useful

cognitive and non-cognitive skills, especially for the children of poor SES who live in poor HOME

environments—a measure of family investment. We also show the importance of non-cognitive

skills in improving school performance and life-time earnings of children, after controlling for

their education level, innate ability, and family background. Almlund et al. (2011); Duckworth,

Almlund, Kautz, and Heckman (Duckworth et al.); Heckman and Kautz (2012) summarize the

literature on the effects of noncogntive traits on earnings.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the intergenerational altru-

ism model of parental preschool investment within a structural dynamic programming framework.

Section 3 describes the estimation algorithm that we use. Section 4 provides the empirical specifi-

cation of the production processes of cognitive and non-cognitive skills and reports the parameter

estimates. Section 5 conducts a policy analysis. Section 6 concludes.




2     The Basic Framework

In this section we formulate an econometrically implementable model of preschool investment of

altruistic parents in a structural dynamic programming framework. We describe how we compute

the long-run equilibrium distributions of earnings and schooling within generation. A transition

probability matrix of earnings or schooling levels provides information about the degree of in-

tergenerational earnings or schooling mobility or if there is intergenerational poverty cycle. We

explain how we compute the mobility index from a transition matrix and how we compute the

long-run equilibrium tax rate to finance the free preschool to the children of poor SES and its net-

gain or loss to the society in terms of welfare gains and loses of various groups, and in terms of

change in the per capita disposable (i.e., after tax) earnings in the long-run equilibrium.

   We assume a parthenogenetic mode of biological reproduction in our model and with due

respect to both genders, all individuals are male gender. Parents of period t will be referred to as

generation t. Each parent has one child. After parents of generation t die at the end of period t,

their children become the parents of generation t + 1 and make decisions for their children and the

economy goes on in this recursive manner for ever.

   In each period, parents are characterized by a vector of observed characteristics x, and a vector

of unobserved characteristics ε, which are described in detail below. We summarize these traits by

a vector z = ( x, ε). When we need to be specific about his generation t or period t, we write him

as zt = ( xt , ε t ). We assume that each component of x takes finite number of values, thus x will be

from a finite set X with m elements. We assume that the set X is ordered with elements x1 , ...., xm

in it. For a parent-child pair, if v is a variable that refers to the parent, we use v′ to denote the

corresponding variable for his child.

   An individual’s life time consists of several stages during which important life-cycle events

relevant to learning and earning occur. A parent invest in his child’s preschool activities during ages

[0-5), which help develop his child’s school readiness, and various cognitive and non-cognitive

skills. Denote by a the preschool investment choice of a parent. At the end of the preschool period,

the child acquires levels of innate ability or cognitive skill τ, social skill σ, motivational skill µ,

self-esteem skill η, and internal self-control skill ϕ.

   During ages [5-17), the child goes to school. The school performance at this stage depends on

his level of τ, σ, µ, η, and ϕ that the child has acquired during the previous stage. It also depends

on the quality of the school that he attends1 , the quality of the neighborhood, and the parental

home inputs such as how many hours of time the parent spend with the child to do his homework,

how many hours the child watches TV and the type of programs he watches, and how stable and

stimulating the relationships among the family members are. Many of these are choice variables

for the parent. We do not have adequate information about these factors in our dataset, so we do

not analyze them.2

    During ages [17-26), the child decides the number of years of schooling to complete, which

depends on his parent’s family background, his own cognitive and non-cognitive abilities τ, σ, µ,

η, and ϕ, and some random shocks ε s . We take this decision to be exogenously given, and denote

its dependence on these factors by the function s = s(τ, σ, µ, η, ϕ, s, ε s ).

    During ages [26-], he works, forms his family, procreate one child and chooses a preschool

investment plan for his child. In section 4.1, we describe in detail the components of the observed

characteristics vector x = (τ, σ, µ, η, ϕ, s). In this section, we sequentially define below the com-

ponents of the vector of his unobservable characteristics ε.

    The production sector of the economy uses a linear production function with labor in effi-

ciency unit as the only input.         An individual with observed cognitive and non-cognitive skills

x = (τ, σ, µ, η, ϕ, s) is assumed to be equivalent to the unit of labor in efficiency unit w ( x ) + ε 1 ,

where ε 1 given x is a mean-zero random productivity shock or it can be interpreted as mean-zero

framework can limit social mobility and lead to the intergenerational poverty trap, see Nishimura and Raut (2007) for
such a model.

measurement error. The individual and the firm observe ε 1 but it is unobserved by others. Let

π ( x ) be the probability density function on the set of observable characteristics X in that period

and g1 (dε 1 ) be the probability density3 of the random shock ε 1 given x. The aggregate output,

which turns out to be also the per capita income or the average income of the economy in any

period is
                                   [∫               ]

    An individual with skills x and productivity shock ε 1 ends up with the marginal product w =

w ( x ) + ε 1 in the labor market. This w is his annualized permanent earnings out of which he

chooses a preschool investment plan a for his child. The annual cost of his investment plan a is

θ̃ ( a) ≡ θ ( a) + ε 2 ( a), where θ is a constant for all parents and ε 2 is an unobserved parent specific

variation in the cost, assumed to have zero mean. The rest of his earnings makes up his annualized

permanent consumption c ≡ w − θ̃ ( a) = w ( x ) − θ ( a) + ε ( a), where ε ( a) ≡ ε 1 − ε 2 ( a) . We

assume that the parents with observed characteristics x have a finite number of feasible preschool

choices which is represented by the ordered set A ( x ) . The utility or reward of a parent ( x , ε)

from a preschool investment choice a ∈ A ( x ) has the form u ( x, ε, a) = u ( x, a) + ε ( a) where

u ( x, a) ≡ w( x ) − θ ( a). In the rest of the exposition we assume general form for u ( x, a).

    Finally, we define the components of the unobserved heterogeneity vector ε of an individual of
   3 We  use the convention of denoting the probability density g of a continuous random variable ε by the notation
g (dε) and for a discrete random variable x by g ( x ) and for their joint density as g ( x, dε) .
   4 In a similar theoretical model, Raut (1995) includes an external total factor productivity multiplier that increases

with an increase in the number of skilled workers in the economy. The paper showed that policies that lead to higher
social mobility also leads to higher economic growth.

observed characteristics x as ε = (ε ( a) , a ∈ A ( x )), where ε ( a) is defined above. Denote by E

the set of all possible ε.

    In any period for a parent z = ( x, ε) with a preschool investment choice a, his child’s vector

of cognitive and non-cognitive skills and unobserved heterogeneity shocks, i.e., the vector z′ =

( x ′ , ε′ ), is produced stochastically, which is characterized by the transition probability density

function p ( x ′ , dε′ | x, ε, a) .

    The preschool investment choice problem of the parent ( x ε) is given by the following Bellman

equation:
                                                              ∫    (        ) (                    )
                    V ( x, ε) = max u ( x, ε, a) + β    ∑         V x ′ , ε′ p x ′ , dε′ | x, ε, a           (2)
                                      a∈ A( x )         ′
                                                       x ∈X


where V ( x, ε) is his maximized welfare, i.e. the value function, u(.) is the utility he derives from

his own consumption; the utility he derives from his child’s welfare is the expected maximized

welfare V ( x ′ , ε′ ) of the child, discounted by β, the degree of parental altruism towards the child.

His influence over his child’s wellbeing is through his preschool investment choice a, which affects

his child’s cognitive and non-cognitive skill formations as reflected in the transition probability

density function p ( x ′ , dε′ | x, ε, a) . Under general regularity conditions on u(.), p ( x ′ , dε′ | x, ε, a)

and β, the measurable value function V ( x, ε) and measurable optimal decision rule a ( x, ε) exist

(see, for instance, Bhattacharya and Majumdar (1989), Theorem 3.2).

    An equilibrium in our model is a controlled Markov process with a given initial distribution

of parent population µ0 ( x, dε) on X × E in period t = 0, a family of optimal preschool invest-

ment decisions a ( x, ε) , x ∈ X and ε ∈ E and the stationary transition probability density function



                                                       11

p ( x ′ , dε′ | x, ε, a ( x, ε)) . These variables determine the equilibrium dynamics of the earnings dis-

tribution and the degree of intergenerational earnings and college mobilities, and how these are

affected by a public policy as described below.

   This level of generality makes the estimation of the model computationally intractable. We are

more interested in studying the equilibrium dynamics over the observable states X . Since X is

finite the equilibrium dynamics over it is a Markov chain, determined by the initial distribution π0

of population over X , and the transition probability matrix Π = [Π ( x, x ′ )] x,x′ ∈X . We derive π0 ,

and Π from the above equilibrium controlled Markov process, µ0 , a, and p (.|.). A stationary or

long-run equilibrium in this reduced set-up is a probability density function π over the observable

states X such that π = πΠ, i.e., an invariant distribution π of the transition probability matrix Π.

   Given π0 and Π, we can examine how the population distribution πt on X changes over time t.

The structure of Π can tell us if there exists a unique invariant distribution, and whether the equi-

librium population distribution πt over time t converges to the invariant distribution as t becomes

large. A sufficient condition for both is that Π ( x, x ′ ) > 0 for all x, x ′ ∈ X . If the equilibrium

transition matrix of Π exhibits a block-diagonal structure (after reordering of the states in X if

necessary), then the economy would exhibit an intergenerational poverty cycle. However, our em-

pirical estimates of Π have all elements strictly positive. Hence we do not have intergenerational

poverty cycles. The unique invariant distribution is the long-run equilibrium distribution that the

economy will converge to starting at any initial distribution π0 .

   A number of mobility measures have been proposed in the literature for the Markov process

determined by a transition matrix. Sommers and Conlisk (1979) argues that 1 − λmax is the most

                                                   12
Intergenerational Long Term Effects of Preschool                                 May 15, 2013 7:52pm


appropriate measure of social mobility, where λmax is the second highest positive eigenvalue of the

transition probability matrix (it is well-known that the highest positive eigenvalue of a transition

probability matrix is always 1). We use this measure for earnings or college mobility, and use

the Gini coefficient of average earnings over the observable states (i.e., the Gini coefficients of

earnings distribution (w ( x ) , π ( x ) , x ∈ X ) to compare the effects of our public preschool policy.

   Public preschool policy: We consider the effect of introducing a publicly provided free preschool

to children of poor SES financed by taxing all parents. In any period, we define parents of observ-

able state x to fall in the poor SES category if w ( x ) ≤ 0.7w̄ where the average or per capita earn-

ings w̄ = ∑ w ( x ) π ( x ) . Denote by X p the set of observable characteristics of the parents of poor

SES. The equilibrium tax rate τ is then given by τ = θ ∑ x∈X p w ( x ) π ( x ) / ∑ x∈X w ( x ) π ( x ) .

Once such a policy is introduced, a new set of optimal preschool investment decision rules and

a new transition matrix will emerge, affecting the invariant distribution, degree of earnings and

schooling inequalities within generation, and the degree of social and college mobilities between

generations. We estimate these effects empirically.



2.1 The Econometric Methodology

We follow the Rust (1987, 1994) approach to estimation of dynamic discrete choice model. He

introduced the following three assumptions to convert the choice problem in Equation (2) into a

random utility model.


Assumption 1 For u ( x, ε, a) = u ( x, a) + ε ( a), the support of ε ( a) is the real line for all a ∈

A (x) .


Assumption 2 The transition probability p ( x ′ , dε′ | x, ε, a) = f ( x ′ | x, a) g (dε′ | x ′ ) for some

twice continuously differentiable density function g with finite first moment.


Assumption 3 The components of ε are independently and identically distributed as extreme

value distribution with location parameter 0 and scale parameter 1.


    Let Ω ( x, a) = {ε|for individual ( x, ε) , the choice a is optimal}. The conditional choice prob-
                                        ∫
abilities are defined as P ( a| x ) =       Ω( x,a)   g (dε| x ) . Denote the vector of conditional choice prob-

abilities by P = { P ( a| x ) , a ∈ A ( x ) , x ∈ X }. Let ∆ be the set of all possible vectors of condi-

tional probabilities. Under the above assumptions, it is easy to see that the transition probability

matrix Π and the average welfare of individuals in observable characteristics group can be com-

puted with the conditional choice probabilities only. Furthermore, the computation of the condi-

tional choice probabilities becomes a simpler iterative fixed point computation of a map Ψ on the

finite dimensional compact set ∆ as given below.



                                   (      )                        (          )

[ f ( x1 | x, a) , . . . , f ( xm | x, a)], a m dimensional row vector.

    Under Assumption 1 and 2, Rust (1987) showed that the problem in Equation (2) becomes a

random utility model. Using the McFadden result that a random utility model under Assumption 3

has a Logit representation, Rust showed that the conditional choice probabilities has the following

Logit representation,



                                                     eṽ(x,a)

where Im is a m × m identity matrix, F̄ is an m × m matrix with the element in the ( x, x ′ )

position is ∑ a∈ A( x) f ( x ′ | x, a) P ( a| x ); ū = [ū ( x1 ) , ..., ū ( xm )]′ , and ē = [ē1 ( x1 ) , ..., ēm ( x )]′

∑ a∈ A( x) e ( x, a) P ( a| x ), x ∈ X .

    The question is, given our data how do we estimate the structural parameters, and hence choose

a particular model to study all the policy issues? We explain this in the next section.




3       Econometric implementation

For each vector of structural parameters, we need compute the optimal choice probabilities P =

{ P ( a| x ) , a ∈ A ( x ) , x ∈ X }and use them to compute the likelihood of the sample and the maxi-

mum likelihood estimates of the structural parameters. To that end, Rust (1987) used a fixed point

algorithm on the set of functions to compute the value function, and used the value function to com-

pute the optimal choice probabilities. Hotz and Miller (1993) use the fixed point algorithm for the

choice probabilities and used these choice probabilities to compute the value function. For other

estimation procedures, see a recent survey of the literature by Aguirregabiria and Mira (2010). We

follow the Hotz and Miller approach to estimate the structural parameters as outlined below.

   Based on what is known in the child-development literature, we specify the stochastic produc-

tion functions for cognitive and non-cognitive skills as follows:



             (          )    (            )    (                              )
          f γ x ′ | x, a = qτ τ ′ |τ, s, a × qσ σ′ |τ ′ , τ, σ, µ, η, ϕ, s, a

                                (                             )    (                               )
                             ×qµ µ′ |τ ′ , τ, σ, µ, η, ϕ, s, a × qη η ′ |τ ′ , τ, σ, µ, η, ϕ, s, a

                                 (                             )    (                                    )

where each component probability density function is further specified as a Logit model with the

regressors as the conditioning variables of the component. The details of the production process

are discussed in section 4.4. Denote by γ the vector of all of these regression parameters, which

together determine the transition probabilities f γ ( x ′ | x, a). Denote the parameters of the reward

function, θ and the altruism parameter β by the vector ξ = (θ, β) .

   We have data of the type xi , ai , xi′ , i = 1, ..., n, on n parent-child pairs. The problem is to

estimate the structural parameters ζ = (ξ, γ) using this data.

   Note that for fixed ζ, Equation (5), defines a map Ψ : ∆→∆ since the right hand side of the

equation is a function of conditional probabilities. The fixed point of which is the set of conditional

choice probabilities of the dynamic programming problem in Equation (2). It can be shown that

for each structural parameter ζ, the iterative process Pn = Ψ (Pn−1 ), starting from any initial P0 ,
                                             (                                 )
always converges to a unique fixed point Pζ = Pζ ( a| x ) , a ∈ A ( x ) , x ∈ X . We use this Pζ to

calculate the log-likelihood of the sample in the following procedure.

    First note that Pr ( a, x ′ | x ) = Pr ( a| x ) . Pr ( x ′ | x, a) = Pζ ( a| x ) . f γ ( x ′ | x, a). The log-likelihood

function for the sample is then given by L (ξ, γ) = L1 (ξ, γ) + L2 (γ), where L1 (ξ, γ) =
                                                 (             )
∑in=1 ln Pζ ( ai | xi ) and L2 (γ) = ∑in=1 ln f γ xi′ | xi , ai . The full information maximum likelihood

estimation involves maximizing the full likelihood L (ξ, γ). The maximization of the full infor-

mation likelihood involves numerous parameters. The maximization algorithm does not always

converge and this turned out to be true in our case.

    We follow a two-stage procedure instead. In the first stage we compute a consistent estimate γ̂

by maximizing the conditional likelihood L2 (γ), which given the recursive structure in Equation

(5), is equivalent to estimating the individual logit models constituting the parts of f γ ( x ′ | x, a). We

then estimate ξ by maximizing L1 (ξ, γ̂) .
                                     (          )
    Denote this two stage estimate by ξ̂ r , γ̂r and the full information maximum likelihood esti-
       (           )
mate by ξ̂ f , γ̂ f . How close is the estimate ξ̂ r to ξ̂ f ? How precise is the estimate of the standard

error Σξξ ·γ of ξ̂ r obtained from the restricted maximum likelihood procedure by fixing a value of

γ = γ̂r ?

Note that Σξξ would be the variance covariance matrix of the full information maximum likelihood

    Since our γ̂r is a consistent estimator for γ, from the first line of Equation (7) we know that

we have zero asymptotic bias for our estimates. But from the second line of Equation (7) we see

that our standard errors are smaller, i.e., our t-statistics are larger than that of the full information

maximum likelihood estimators. We use the public domain Sun Java programming language to

implement the above estimation procedure and for all other computational tasks.

4     Empirical Findings


4.1     The Dataset and the Variables

We use the NLSY79 and the NLSY79 Children and Young Adults data. The NLSY79 dataset

contains a nationally representative sample of 12,686 young men and women who were 14-22

years old when they were first surveyed in 1979, i.e., these sampled individuals represent a pop-

ulation born in the 1950s and 1960s, and living in the United States in 1979. These individuals

are interviewed annually. The dataset has records of school and labor market experiences of these

individuals and also the information on their cognitive and non-cognitive traits. We, however, need

information on most of these variables for the parents of the respondents. This dataset does not

have much information on respondents’ parents. So we link this dataset with the NLSY79 Chil-

dren and Young Adults dataset. The child survey dataset includes longitudinal assessments of each

child’s cognitive, attitudinal and social, motivational, academic and labor market experiences. We

construct the variables of our study as follows:

    Early childhood inputs and home environment: We take the father’s and mother’s education

levels to measure the child’s family background. The NLSY dataset has poor measures of respon-

dent’s early childhood inputs. It has only a binary variable containing information on whether

the respondent had preschool (which does not include Head Start) experience or not. We treat

individuals with Head Start as having no preschool in our analysis. Notice that this may lead to

underestimation of the effect of preschool investment. We use the revised AFQT score to measure

innate ability.

   Socialization skill (σ): Each respondent was asked how social towards others he/she felt at age

6, expressed in the scale of 1 to 4, the highest number represents most social. We create a binary

sociability variable by assigning the value 1 if a respondent reported a value of 3 or 4 and assigning

0 otherwise.

   Motivational skill (µ): We measure motivational skill as the job aspiration of the respondents

in the main NLSY79 sample. For the children sample, we have taken the average of the various

motivation measures at young ages of the child and assigned a value 1 if it the average is larger

than 3.75 and 0 otherwise.

   Rosenberg measure of self-esteem skill (η): It measures the positiveness with which individ-

uals regard themselves in society, i.e., a positive sense of self. Six questions were taken from the

classic Rosenberg (1965) scale in the NLSY surveys. There is, however, no well accepted defini-

tion of adequate self-esteem. Based on the distribution, we divided the 25-point scale by treating

a score of 20 or greater to indicate a high self-esteem, assigning a value 1 to η and a value 0 to η

otherwise.

   Pearlin mastery scale of internal self-concept (ϕ): This measures the extent to which an

individual believes that his life chances are under his own control (Pearlin et al., 1981). This is

similar to Rotter scale of self-control. The respondents were asked seven questions yielding scores

ranging from 0 to 28. We assign the value 1 representing a high sense of self-control to respondents

with a score between 23 and 28 inclusive, otherwise we assign a a value 0. For further discussion

of these measures see Duckworth, Almlund, Kautz, and Heckman (Duckworth et al.).

4.2 An Augmented Earnings Function - The Role of cognitive and non-

       cognitive skills

Noncognitive traits are important determinants of both earnings and learning. For surveys of the

effect of noncognitive traits on earnings see Borghans et al. (2008) and Almlund et al. (2011).

We carry out a rudimentary analysis in this section to emphasize the importane of these traits

for earnings. We estimate an augmented Mincer earnings function by adding measures of non-

cognitive skills such as social, motivational, self-esteem and internal self-concept skills in the

standard Mincer earnings function that includes only cognitive skills such as innate ability and

the number of years of schooling. As a byproduct, we provide an estimate of how much of the

rate of returns to education in the standard Mincer earnings function is over estimated because

the schooling level which is correlated with the omitted non-cognitive skill variables captures the

effects of the non-cognitive skills.

   Mincer (1958) showed that if foregone earnings is the only cost of schooling, and the effect

of an extra year of schooling on earnings is proportional and constant, then the log of earnings is

a linear function of the number of years of schooling. He later extended this model by allowing

experience (measured by the square of the age of the worker) to affect earnings over the life-cycle

as follows:

                              ln w = α0 + α1 s + α2 age + α3 age2 + ε


   This basic Mincer earnings function has been estimated using various datasets. It has been

given various interpretations by deriving it from various models of schooling choice, see for in-

                                                21

stance Card (1999); Heckman et al. (2006, 2008); Weiss (1995). We estimate the basic model

taking w to be the annual earnings of the respondents in the NLSY79 dataset. The estimates for

this basic model are reported in the second column (with the heading ”Basic”) in Table 1. Our

estimate for α1 is 11.12 percent which is close to what is found in other studies, see for instance

the survey by Card (1999), and the analyses of Heckman et al. (2006, 2008)

   What exactly is the role of education in the production of earnings? Does an extra year of

education have any intrinsic value in the production of output? Or is it a surrogate for other factors

such as innate ability and hence the estimated returns to education is higher than its actual worth

in production?5

   We include the AFQT score variable as a regressor, which is a widely used measure of ability,

together with other standard variables used in the literature such as family background measured

by the parents’ education levels, and a dummy variable for the female gender. These are reported

in the third column (with the heading of ”Extended”) in Table 1. The estimate for the schooling

coefficient drops to 6.94 percent. This estimate is corrected for ability bias or gender bias in the

estimated returns to schooling and close to what is found in other studies, see Card (1999). We

now add to it our four measures of non-cognitive skills to see how much of the above estimate

of the returns to education is biased upward because it is capturing the effects of the omitted

non-cognitive skills. The estimates are shown in the fourth column of Table 1 (with the heading

”Augmented”). We see that all of the four non-cognitive skill variables have significant positive

effects on earnings and the rate of returns to education has dropped by about 1 percent point. By
  5 See   Borghans et al. (2011); Heckman and Kautz (2012) for limitations of this measure.

looking at the R2 values, we see that about 1 percent variation in earnings is explained by the

inclusion of the non-cognitive skills in the standard Mincer earnings function.



4.3       Estimation of Schooling Function

We consider two specifications of the schooling function, s (τ ′ , σ′ , µ′ , η ′ , ϕ′ , a, ε′ ). In the first spec-

ification, we assume that the schooling level is a continuous variable and the function s (τ ′ , σ′ , µ′ , η ′ , ϕ′ , a, ε′ )

is linear. We assume that the variable ε′ constitutes an additive error term and satisfies all the as-

sumptions of the OLS model.6 We included our measures of cognitive and non-cognitive skills

and the family background. The parameter estimates from this model are shown in table 2.

     In our second specification, we consider only two levels of schooling: s = 1 for completed

college or more, and s = 0 otherwise. We assume that s (τ ′ , σ′ , µ′ , η ′ , ϕ′ , a, ε′ ) is a Logit model.

The parameter estimates from this model are shown in table 2.

     It is clear from the estimates that the most significant determinant of schooling is the innate

ability measured by AFQT score. Moreover, even after controlling for the family background, we

find that all non-cognitive skills have significant positive effects on schooling level.



4.4       Production of non-cognitive skills

As established in the cited literature, non-cognitive skills are important determinants of earnings

and learning. In this section we estimate the production process of these skills and estimate the
                                             ( ′                    )
    6 More   generally we could assume that E ε s |τ ′ , σ′ , µ′ , h = 0 and use GLS method to correct for heteroskedas-
ticity.

effect of preschool experience on the production of these non-cognitive skills.

    The literature in sociology, psychology, early childhood development and physiology suggest

that early childhood investment is the most crucial input for development of cognitive and non-

cognitive skills. (See Cunha and Heckman, 2007, 2009; Heckman et al., 2008)

    We create the binary variable τ assigning the value 1 to denote an individual as highly talented

if the AFQT score of the individual is 70 or higher (in a scale of 0 to 100), and assigning the

value τ = 0 otherwise. Other binary skill variables are described earlier. We estimated the Logit

models for each of the cognitive and non-cognitive skills types on the children sample. These pa-

rameter estimates constitute the components of the parameter vector γ of the transition probability

function f γ ( x ′ | x, a) . We report the parameter estimates in table 3 for the specifications of each

components of x and a. These are used in the two-step estimation procedure to estimate ξ = (θ, β)

given the parameters γ of the transition probability function fixed at these estimates. To compare

the sensitivity of our estimates and inference of the structural parameters, we estimated another

specification in which we included only those regressors that are significant.

    From table 3, it is clear that after controlling for parents’ grade, preschool has significantly

positive effect on the socialization skill, and on the levels of talent and schooling. But it has no

effect on Pearlin measure of internal self-concept and the Rosenberg measure of self-esteem. The

estimates in the table also show that the level of talent has strong positive effects on the formation

of all skills.

4.5     Optimal Parental Preschool Investment Decision

We assume that the state variables s, τ, σ, µ, η and ϕ are all binary, the components of the random

variable ε are continuous and the preschool investment choice a is a binary variable, taking value 1

if the parent decides to invest in preschool and taking value 0 otherwise. For many children in our

sample, we have two parents alive, but in our model we have assumed one parent family.

    We use both parents’ information to create a synthetic parent as follows: We construct a par-

ent’s binary schooling variable s to take value 1 if either parent has 16 or more years of education,

otherwise s = 0.

    We define a parent to fall in the poor SES if his earnings is less than 70 percent of the average

earnings in economy. We consider a public policy of providing preschool to children of poor

socioeconomic status (SES) in all periods. This will impose a tax burden on all parents, but such

policy may also improve the social mobility, reduce the earnings inequality and eventually lead

to a higher level of per capita earnings in the long-run. We examine if the gain from per capita

earnings can outpace the cost of providing such a social insurance program. We also look at its

within generation effects on earnings, and on the intergenerational effects on earnings and college

mobility.

    The two-step maximum likelihood estimates of the structural parameters ξ = (θ, β) are shown

in table 4 for two sets of specifications of the transition probabilities f γ ( x ′ | x, a) - the first column

contains the estimates from the specification in which only the significant conditioning variables

are included, and the second column contains the estimates of the parameters in which all the

conditioning variables are included. The table also reports the percent of parents falling into the

poor SES status in the long-run before and after the introduction of the public policy and the tax

rate τ that finances the public preschool policy in the long-run equilibrium. Furthermore, the table

also reports the long-run disposable (i.e., after tax) average yearly earnings of workers before and

after the introduction of the social contract policy.

   An estimate of θ̂ = 1.224 in the table means that the cost per year during the first five preschool

years is $6, 120. This comes from the fact we have annualized earnings over 25 years of life-cycle

and a total preschool cost of $30, 600 = $1, 224 × 25 is spread out uniformly over the first five

years of the child’s preschool age. Schweinhart et al. reported an estimate of the average yearly

preschool cost to be $6, 178 using the actual preschool cost. Our maximum likelihood estimate of

the cost is very close to their direct estimate of cost.

5     Economic Benefits from Public Provision of Preschool

We have shown that investment in preschool enhances certain skills that are important for learn-

ing and earning. We have also seen that very few parents of poor SES invest in their children’s

preschool. If preschool is publicly provided for the children of poor SES, it will have many eco-

nomic benefits: It will increase social mobility, it will reduce income inequality, it will improve

college enrollment rate, it will improve the community or criminal behavior, and it will also bring

higher tax revenues because more workers will be earning higher wages. It is important to note

that the magnitude of the effect of publicly provided preschool will depend on if the social protec-

tion will be available to all future generations or it is just a one time policy. (See Heckman and

Masterov, 2004)

    While looking at the magnitudes of the estimated economic benefits below, it is important to

keep in mind that the effects that we report in this paper are underestimates for many reasons: First,

we have treated the Head Start children same as children without preschool. Second, the preschool

programs that the respondents attended were the ones that existed during the sixties. The quality of

preschool programs since then has improved significantly and thus the effects of current preschool

programs will be much higher than the estimates that we have.



5.1    Intergenerational Earnings Mobility

To examine how the introduction of the public policy that provides free preschool to children of

poor SES, affect earnings mobility between generations, we computed the mobility index of the



                                                 30

stationary transition probability matrix of the equilibrium Markov process of earnings distributions

over time. Our estimate of the measure of earnings mobility before the introduction of the social

contract is 0.5945 and after the introduction of the public preschool program is 0.6468.

   It is difficult to compare our estimate of the mobility index with previous studies because there

is no commonly agreed upon measure of earnings mobility. For a survey of various measures of

mobilities and their properties, see Geweke et al. (1986).



5.2    College Mobility

              [ ]
Denote by Qs = qij , i, j = 1, 2, the intergenerational college mobility matrix in which state 1

represents no college and state 2 represents college or more. The element qij represents the proba-

bility that a child of a parent of college education status i will move to the college education status

j, for all i and j = 1, 2. We report below the estimated college mobility matrices, the corresponding

invariant distributions, and the estimates of the mobility measure before and after the introduction

of the social contract. These estimates indicate that the introduction of the social contract will

increase college enrollment from a 6.71 percent to a 9.45 percent, i.e. a 2.73 percentage point

increase for a child of non-college parent. And the percentage of college educated population will

increase in the long-run from the rate of 10.16 percent without social contract to a higher rate of

13.76 percent with the social contract. That is, there will be about a 3.6% increase in the college

enrollment in the long-run.

5.3    Lifetime Earnings Inequality

Preschool investment would increase the incomes of the children of poor SES families and thus it

will reduce the income gap between the rich and the poor. Using the Gini-coefficient to measure

income inequality, we would expect that over time income inequality will improve. The long-

run income distribution that one observes is the invariant distribution. We compute the Gini-

coefficient of income inequality for the invariant income distribution before the introduction of the

public policy and compare it with the Gini-coefficient for the invariant income distribution after

the introduction of the policy. The estimated Gini-coefficients are respectively 0.2363 without the

social contract, and 0.2335 with the social contract. The estimated Gini-coefficient of average

lifetime earnings is 0.2363. We note that the social contract of publicly providing preschool to

children of poor SES produces a reduction in the inequality of the long-term earnings.



                                                 32
Intergenerational Long Term Effects of Preschool                               May 15, 2013 7:52pm


   To compare our estimates to the literature, it is important to know that earnings in our model

are averages over the life-cycle (it is 25 years in our data). Furthermore, we have earnings averaged

over 64 income groups, whereas most studies in the literature have many more groups. The Gini

coefficient decreases if it is applied to average earnings of groups. Keeping this in mind, our

estimates are comparable to estimates in the literature. For instance, Leigh (2009) estimates the

Gini coefficient of ten years average earnings over the life cycle to be little less than 0.3 in the

1990’s and around 0.35 for annual earnings in the 1990s.



5.4 The Tax Burden of the Social Policy

Suppose the government provides preschool to the children of poor SES perpetually. We know that

the size of the population of poor SES will become smaller over time. Thus the resource needs of

the program will become smaller, and the tax revenues will become higher over time. We can look

at the stream of these costs and benefits to the society and then compute the average per period costs

and benefits to calculate the tax-burdens of the social contract. Applying the Ergodic theorem, this

boils down to computing the costs and benefits of the invariant distribution that will result after the

introduction of the social contract. Our computations below are based on the long-run equilibrium.

   Without the public policy, approximately 35.71 percent of the population in the long-run will

fall in the poor socioeconomic status, using our definition of poor SES. The introduction of the

public policy will reduce the population in the poor SES to 29.14 percent. From table 5, we see

that while the welfare of the income groups that get publicly provided preschool will be higher,

the welfare of the rest of the population will be lower. It is difficult to estimate the net effect of

                                                  33
Intergenerational Long Term Effects of Preschool                               May 15, 2013 7:52pm


the policy on social welfare since there is no universally agreed upon aggregation rule for social

welfare. We use the average yearly disposable earnings over the life-cycle to compare the net gain

or loss to the society. These estimates in table 4 show that the average yearly disposable earnings

of the society in the long-run is higher by $113 after the introduction of the policy. Based on this

we conclude that there is a net gain to the society of introducing such a publicly provided preschool

program for the children of poor SES.

    Our benefit calculation does not take into account other public savings that will result due to

the policy such as savings from welfare assistance programs and savings to the criminal justice

system and potential victims of crimes. If we incorporate these, the returns will be much higher.

Using data from the High/Scope Perry Preschool Program, Heckman et al. (2010b) estimate a total

benefit of 7 percent from all these sources for each dollar spent on the preschool program even

counting for the social costs of taxation.




6     Conclusion

This paper formulates an altruistic model of preschool investment choices of parents in a structural

dynamic programming framework. It uses the NLSY79 and NLSY79 Children and Young Adult

data to estimate the structural parameters

    The paper estimates the production processes of two types of cognitive skills - the IQ score and

the schooling level, and four types of non-cognitive skills - the socialization skill, the motivational

skill, the Rosenberg measure of self-esteem skill and the Pearlin mastery scale of internal self-


                                                  34
Intergenerational Long Term Effects of Preschool                               May 15, 2013 7:52pm


concept skill. The paper finds that the preschool boosts significantly both types of cognitive skills

and only the socialization skills among the four measures of non-cognitive skills. Moreover, all

these cognitive and non-cognitive skills have significant positive effects on the level of schooling

and the labor market earnings of individuals.

   The paper estimates the structural parameters and then used those to carry out a Marschak

(1953)-Lucas (1976)-Critique free policy analysis to examine the effect of a publicly provided

preschool to economically disadvantaged children and financing it by taxing all parents. Taking

into account the within generation and between generations effects of such a policy, the paper finds

that introduction of such a public policy (a) improves the intergenerational earnings mobility from

0.5945 to 0.6468, measured in a scale of 0 to 1, (b) improves the college mobility from 0.6609

to 0.6863, measured in a scale of 0 to 1, (c) increases the college completion rate of the children

of non-college educated parents from 10.16 percent to 13.76 percent, i.e., a 3.6 percentage point

increase, (d) reduces the within generation earnings inequality measured by the Gini coefficient in

a scale of 0 to 1 from 0.2363 to 0.2335, and (e) there is a net gain (net of taxes) in the long-run per

capita earnings.

   The positive effects of the public preschool policy will be even higher in reality because we

have used the estimated benefits from the lower quality preschool programs that existed in the

1970s.
