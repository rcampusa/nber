It Presage the Financial Crisis?

                                              ABSTRACT

The initial implementation of the System of National Accounts (1993) for the United States by the
Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Federal Reserve Board has two significant advantages for economists.
First, the SNA are organized according to sectors of the economy defined by economic agents: firms,
financial institutions, consumers, governments and the rest of the world. Second, the accounts integrate
real and financial information, so that one can track not only production of, income from, and use
of output, but also net lending, net borrowing, and net worth by sector. We exploit these two features
in the SNA accounts to examine US economic history leading up to the financial crisis of 2007 and
recession of 2008. First, the SNA data show recent increases in leverage in the household sector. We
track the household shift to a net lending position through the capital and current accounts of the household
sector and then the other SNA sectors. Second, in the financial businesses sector, the accounts largely
miss the rise in exposure to the US housing market as well as the critical factors that significantly spread
and amplified the housing-market related changes throughout the financial system and the real economy.
Finally we present three ways in which SNA-type accounts could be improved to presage a similar
future crisis.

      Information on the US economy is contained in disparate sources that, while generally

congruent, in places track differently-defined sectors, omit sectors of interest, or are not fully

consistent with one another. In this paper, we discuss and analyze an innovative set of

macroeconomic accounts for the United States that integrate financial and real data from these

distinct sources using the System of National Accounts (SNA; 1993), a framework for

macroeconomic accounts constructed by a number of national and international statistical

agencies around the world.1 The US implementation of the SNA, the results of a joint research

project of Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Federal Reserve Board (FRB) staff, is

constructed primarily from both the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA), which

measure the production of, use of, and income generated by newly produced goods and services,

and the Flow of Funds Accounts (FFA), which measure net flows and balances of financial

assets.2 The structure of these accounts differs radically (and initially, confusingly) from the

organization of both the NIPA and FFA.

      We illustrate the organization and use of the SNA by studying US economic history

leading up to the financial crisis of 2007 and severe recession of 2008. First, we track the secular

and recent changes in household saving, financial investment and real investment through the

capital and current accounts of both the household sector and the other SNA sectors. We find

that the SNA data show recent increases in leverage in the household sector financed primarily

with mortgages and through borrowing from the rest of the world.

     Second, we show that the SNA data on the financial sector largely misses both the rise in

exposure to the housing market and increases in leverage, balance sheet complexity, maturity

mismatch, and counterparty risk-taking— four factors that we see as critical in amplifying and

spreading the housing market shock through the financial and real economy. Thus we conclude

that the SNA data alone do not presage the severity of the current financial crisis. We end the

paper by suggesting three modifications to line and sectoral aggregation to increase the

usefulness of SNA-type data for indicating vulnerability to potential future similar crises.



I. The organization of the System of National Accounts

     Compared to the existing macroeconomic accounts data, the US SNA data have two main

advantages. First, the SNA contain a full set of macroeconomic information broken down by

sectors of the economy that are economic units of interest: Households (including nonprofit

organizations that serve households), Nonfinancial noncorporate business (sole proprietorships

and limited partnerships), Nonfinancial corporate business, Financial business, Federal

government, State and local government, and Rest of the world (foreign governments and

businesses that engage in trade or financial transactions with domestic counterparts). In contrast,

in the NIPA’s familiar C+I+G+NX organization, consumption and government spending cover

economic units of interest, but investment does not – it is a grouping based on activity. For

example, household consumption of housing services is in C but household investment in

housing structures appears in I.

       Second, the US SNA integrates financial and real information. For each of a set of

consistently-defined sectors, the SNA follows: a current account that tracks the flows of

production/income and consumption; a capital account that tracks saving and capital formation; a



                                                                                                  2
financial account that tracks net acquisition of financial assets and net incurrence of debts; a

revaluation account that tracks gains and losses on tangible and financial assets; and a balance

sheet account that tracks the stocks of tangible assets, financial assets, and liabilities. In the

current NIPA and FFA for example, only a sophisticated user investing a significant amount of

time could navigate the published tables to produce estimates of net lending and borrowing

across the major sectors of the economy.

      To illustrate the SNA structure, consider the evolution of a sector’s net worth. For any

sector, change in net worth is the sum of revaluation of existing stocks of real and financial

assets, other volume changes (which includes durables goods), net lending, and net capital

formation (the sum of these last two is also net saving plus capital transfers). Each period, each

sector’s combined sources of funds must equal its combined uses of funds. Sources of funds

include current disposable income and borrowing from others sector; uses of funds include

current spending (outside of investment), investment, and the acquisition of financial assets.

      A novel aspect of the SNA integration is net lending and borrowing, which for each sector

of the economy is in both the capital account and the financial account. In the NIPA-based

capital account, a sector’s net lending or borrowing position is defined as the difference between

its net saving—disposable income less current spending—and its net investment (gross

purchases of physical capital less depreciation). Sectors that invest on net more than they save

out of current income are net borrowers. In the FFA-based financial account, a sector’s net

lending or borrowing position is defined as the difference between its net acquisition of financial

assets and its net incurrence of debt.

         II. The household sector of the SNA and the prelude to the financial crisis

                                    In this section, we document the evidence of rising household leverage in the SNA. First,

         Figure 1 shows the well-known fact that after having fluctuated in the neighborhood of 10

         percent from the early 1960s through the recession of 1982, the household saving rate has

         declined to near zero.3 Second, and more interesting, net physical investment by the US

         household sector did not decline along with saving. In fact, in the recent boom years of the

         3
           Annual data from 1960 through 2007 are available at:
         http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Ni_FedBeaSna/Index.asp and are updated by BEA and FRB staff after each
         quarter’s publication of the Flow of Funds Accounts. We use data available as of the December 11, 2008, release of
         the Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States.


                                                                                                                                           4
housing market (2002 through 2006), households’ net investment in tangible assets, mainly net

residential investment, actually increased from 4 percent of disposable income to about 5½

percent in 2006.

                                 Third, consequently, and most importantly, after having providing funding to other sectors

on net, at an average annual rate of around four to five percent of disposable income from 1960

to 1990, households started borrowing on net in 1996 (Figure 2). Net borrowing reached 5

percent of disposable income in 2005 and 2006.

                                 What sort of debt increased so dramatically over the past decade? The household balance

sheet shows a large acceleration in net mortgage debt, which rose steadily over the forty years

from 1960 to 2000, cumulating to 40 percent of disposable income (from 0.31 to 0.70), then

                             We do not however observe in the SNA the significant increase in highly-leveraged home

purchases that raised the exposure of the financial sector to house price risk. In the SNA, the

aggregate home loan-to-value ratio rose little, yet we know from other sources that a significant

fraction of mortgages were extended with little payment and so with exceptionally high leverage.

                             In sum then, we observe in the SNA data a significant rise in balance sheet leverage by the

household sector that, at least in hindsight, signals an increased exposure of consumer demand to

decreases in asset values. But we do not observe the extent to which a subset of highly-leveraged

homes/mortgages moved housing risk from the homeowner to the lender.

         A better understanding would have been useful, because, while the scale of the recent

declines in home prices and equity are historically large, they are not unprecedented and

revaluations often lead to changes in household net worth that dwarf those due to non-secular

changes in household saving. As Figure 3 (previous page) shows, fully offsetting the accounting

effects of revaluation would require, in some years, household saving on the order of plus 20

percent or minus 60 percent of disposable income.

         Using the SNA capital account, Table 1 reports which sectors lent funds to the household

sector. Note that, except for statistical discrepancies, net lending and borrowing across all sectors

sum to zero each period. In the 1960s and 1970s, the two nonfinancial business sectors, the two

government sectors, and the rest of the world were consistently net borrowers, meaning their

rates of investment almost always exceeded their rates of saving. The household and the

financial business sectors served as the net lenders to all the other sectors. In the 1980s and

1990s, the primary change was to net lending by foreign institutions.

     In the 2000s, however, as household switched from being the largest lending sector to the

largest borrowing sector, a large inflow of foreign (financial) capital provided the lion’s share of

net lending, complemented by new lending by nonfinancial corporations.

     In sum, leading up to the financial crisis, housing revaluations and net housing investment

were large by historical standards but neither was unprecedented in magnitude. The SNA

emphasize that what was unprecedented was the household sector’s dramatic shift from funding

the investment of other sectors to borrowing from them, primarily in the form of mortgages.



III. The financial sector of the SNA and the prelude to the financial crisis

     In this section, we show why the SNA data, although helpful for many macroeconomic

analyses, did not convey the substantial vulnerabilities that accumulated in the financial system

during the 2000’s and that turned a housing correction into a financial crisis and deep recession.

     The financial market crisis began in 2007 when recent vintages of securitized mortgages

began to default at elevated rates and house prices decelerated nationally and actually fell (in

nominal terms) in some local markets. Mortgage-related assets lost significant value, and fewer

institutions were willing to hold or buy these securities as they were significantly downgraded

and their complexity hindered valuations. Financial institutions with significant exposure to

mortgage-related assets lost capital, questions about the solvency of specific companies arose,



                                                                                                     8
and a range of financial institutions became vulnerable to—and experienced—a withdrawal of

short-term funding leading some into insolvency. As the crisis has progressed, house prices have

continued to fall and the US is, as we write, mired in a deep recession.

      Thus, the origin of the crisis in the financial sector was exposure to real estate and

mortgage credit, but the core losses were exacerbated by four factors: high leverage (which

amplifies the effect of price movements on balance sheets and can lead to margin calls that

require unwinding positions pushing prices lower and making losses greater still), maturity

mismatch (which leads to increased debt payments when credit becomes expensive, reducing

liquid assets further and leading in some cases to insolvency), complexity of assets and the

balance sheet (which impedes fundamentally solvent institutions from communicating their

positions so as to continue accessing credit), and reliance on business models with significant

exposure to any counterparty risk (creates the risk of a sort of bank run, whereby the suspicion of

insolvency by a firm’s counterparties reduces its ability to conduct business and possibly leads to

insolvency).4

      Why do the SNA data not show the increase in the exposure of the financial sector to house

price risk? The main answer is aggregation across asset classes. The SNA do not distinguish

among different types of corporate bonds or commercial paper. Structured financial products—

such as collateralized debt obligations, asset-backed securities, non-agency mortgage-backed

securities, and certain types of asset-backed commercial paper (namely, structured investment

vehicles and securities arbitrage programs)—carried more risk and exposure than traditional

corporate bonds. While the SNA does show assets that consist of long-term loans (line 102 in the

financial sector accounts), which are primarily mortgages, securitization conveys sizable

4
  We do not consider other possible contributing factors that are less amenable to measurement, such as inaccurate
judgments about risk and expected returns, herd mentality, and mismanaged conflicts in interest.


                                                                                                                     9
exposures to residential mortgages through the “corporate bond” holdings in the SNA

presentation. In the SNA data, exposure to long-term loans (mortgages) actually declines as a

fraction of total assets for the financial business sector from 1990 on.

     Turning to the propagating factors, the SNA does not display an increase in leverage of the

financial sector for two reasons. First, aggregation across the sector hides leverage of

commercial and investment banks. Balance sheet leverage in the aggregate financial sector—as

measured, for example, by the ratio of asset values to equity capital—is an amalgam of

institutions that employ very little leverage—such as mutual funds, pension funds, money market

funds, and insurance companies (and that, together, account for a substantial amount of security

holdings)—and others that employ significant leverage—such as broker/dealers, commercial

banks and saving institutions, and government-sponsored enterprises (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,

and the Federal Home Loan Banks). According to Tobias Adrian and Hyun Song Shin (2008),

during the credit boom of the mid-2000s, balance sheet leverage increased among the primary

dealers and major investment banks while leverage decreased among commercial banks.

Moreover, some large commercial banks and bank holding companies—particularly those with

significant broker/dealer functions—increased their balance sheet leverage, even as the

(sub)sector as a whole generally did not. Although effective leverage in critical financial

institutions increased substantially during the mid-2000s, the SNA aggregate data for the

financial sector show just a slightly faster increase in liabilities than assets, implying only a small

increase in leverage.

     Second, leverage is difficult to observe because risk is difficult to observe. The distinction

between collateral and a risky investment is in the eye of the beholder. As in most macro-

financial accounts produced around the world, the SNA reports lending and borrowing between



                                                                                                    10
sectors using broad categories of credit instruments—instruments that embed different degrees of

credit risk and implicit leverage. For example, for mortgage assets, underwriting became more

lenient (no money down, no documentation of income/assets, etc) which exposed investors to

unprecedented losses. Although the SNA data show the exceptional growth of mortgages in real

time, they did not convey the increased possibility of the magnitude of the losses we have seen.

                            In terms of our second propagating factor, maturity mismatch built up substantially during

the credit boom in a manner that the aggregated data in the SNA do not reveal. As emphasized

by David Bowman and Daniel Covitz (2008) and by Markus K. Brunnermeier (2008), in the

2000’s, financial engineering allowed a range of financial institutions, hedge funds, and money

managers to earn high returns (until the crisis) by borrowing short at low interest rates and

lending long at higher rates. But firms that rely on short-term debt for funding long-term assets

are vulnerable to runs: a withdrawal of short-term funding can cause bankruptcy of an otherwise

solvent institution. During the credit boom many leveraged firms (broker/dealers and subsidiary

broker/dealers of major commercial banks) took on extremely mismatched maturity structures;

they relied on (then) inexpensive overnight debt (such as repurchase agreements) to fund

investments in long-term assets (such as asset-backed commercial paper conduits).

     The SNA aggregation across institution types and asset classes largely masks the rise in

reliance on short-term funding. The SNA do measure net short term borrowing, but these data

show only a long-term trend: net liabilities that are short–term debt rise from 2 percent of total

assets for the sector in 1960 to about 7 percent in 2007 (Figure 4). There is also a trend increase

rather than an acceleration in commercial paper obligations relative to total assets (Figure 4).

     Aggregation to the broad sectoral level and to broad asset classes also masks changes in the

third important propagating factor: balance sheet complexity. However, we suspect that such

information probably was not needed from the government -- the complexity was largely known.

That is, it seems likely that everyone knew that Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were complex

institutions, but potentially everyone did not appreciated how this complexity could contribute to

making these institutions insolvent in the face of large but indeterminate losses.

     Finally, in terms of counterparty risk, sectoral aggregation masks the increased reliance on

counterparty exposure that made the financial system vulnerable to the fear that any bank might

enter bankruptcy. Gross counterparty exposure is netted out by aggregation.

IV. Conclusion and suggestions for modifying the SNA

     The credit boom in the US economy left a pronounced footprint in the household sector of

the SNA. Households moved from significant net lending to significant net borrowing over 25

years, and, in the past decade, increased housing investment and increased net mortgage debt at

an unprecedented rate. What cannot be gleaned from the SNA is the extent to which mortgage

risk rose disproportionately more than leverage due to looser underwriting.

     In the SNA financial business sector, building exposure to real estate and institutional

vulnerabilities were even less visible for three reasons: the financial sector covered by the SNA

is too broad, aggregate information in the SNA masks substantial heterogeneity among firms and

households, and the SNA presentation does not differentiate among similar debt instruments with

different risk characteristics. What improvements can be made?

     First, while it seems unrealistic to ask that national accounts measure the riskiness of

assets, more detailed classification of assets would be useful, such as classifying different types

of mortgage assets. It also seems feasible to separate out structured financial products.

     Second, the SNA definition of the financial sector can be improved. When a mutual fund or

hedge fund purchases a security, that security should appear on the household balance sheet not

the balance sheet of the financial sector. Only firms that provide a significant level of financial

intermediation and are not simply conduits for households should be in the financial sector.

     Third, it would be extremely useful to further divide those institutions in the financial

sector that provide significant intermediation into those that can use leverage and those that

cannot. For example, insurance companies and pension funds would then not be aggregated with

investment banks and broker dealers. Such a division into two sectors seems both feasible and

useful despite institutions which blur this distinction, such as entities like AIG and products like



                                                                                                      13

     Ultimately, because average net positions mask changes in the tails of the distribution,

analysts will need to augment aggregate data in the macroeconomic accounts with information

about the extent of extreme leverage, extreme lack of diversification, or more generally statistics

about the extent to which a significant fraction of a sector may have large exposures.
