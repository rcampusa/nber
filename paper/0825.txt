                The Impacts on Capital Allocation of Some
             Aspects of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981

                                 ABSTRACT


     This paper   develops and employs   a   five-asset, four-household and
single-business  sector simulation model to measure the long-run impacts
of the major provisions of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 on
the allocation of a fixed capital stock among owner-occupied housing,
rental housing, and nonresidential capital. The specific provisions
analyzed are the increases in tax depreciation for nonresidential capital
and rental housing and the reduction in the maximum tax rate on unearned
income.
     Our analysis suggests a 6 percent increase in nonresidential capital,
an 11 percent decline in owner-occupied housing and little change in
rental housing (the increase in the number of renters - - the homeownership
rate declines by l percentage points -- offsets a decline in the quantity
of rental services demanded per renter). In the absence of an increase
in aggregate saving, real pretax interest rates rise by nearly two
percentage points. Corporate profit taxes decline by 60 percent, and
after-tax earnings rise by 25 percent. As a result of the Act, the net
(of depreciation) user costs for the three types of capital will almost
be equalized.

                      THE IMPACTS ON CAPITAL ALLOCATION OF        *
           SOME   ASPECTS OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY TAX ACT OF 1981


       About four years ago, Hendershott and Hu computed net (of depreciation)
user costs of capital for several types of nonfinancial capital:

producers durables and structures of both corporations and unincorporated

businesses, rental housing, and owner-occupied housing.1 Owing to differences

in taxation and financing, the net user costs were lower for housing

(especially owner-occupied) than for industrial capital. Moreover, the

spread between the user costs on industrial (especially corporate) and

residential (especially owner-occupied) capital had risen between the

middle 1960s   and late 19708 in     response to the increase in inflation.

The net result was obviously 'toverinvestment" in owner-occupied housing in

the 1970s, although the extent of this was tempered by downpayment and

cash-flow constraints and mortgage capital gains.2 The obvious economic,

although not political, solution to this misallocation problem would be to

tax owner-occupied housing more heavily (e.g., tax imputed rents), thereby

raising its user cost relative to that of industrial capital.

       Hendershott   and   Hu noted that the same effect on relative net user

costs could be achieved by taxing industrial capital less heavily;

instead of removing tax subsidies to housing, subsidies could be extended

to business capital, e.g., the employment of historic cost tax depreciation

while using accelerated depreciation schedules and allowing investment

tax credits. Businesses would bid for funds to finance capital expansion,

driving up real pretax interest      rates and   lowering   the demand for
residential capital. In fact,       Hendershott and Hu   described an   array

of   tax changes that would tend to equate the net user costs for the six
capital goods they studied.
                                      2



      The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 appears to be a major step
in this direction. The decrease in tax service lives for business capital

more than offsets the increase in the effective corporate tax rate

(at the current inflation rate) generated by historic cost depreciation

and LIFO inventory accounting. In addition, the cut in the maximum tax

rate on unearned income (and thus on equity cap±tal gains), the expansion

of IRA accounts and the eventual partial exclusion of interest income from

taxation   significantly raises the attractiveness of investment in assets

other than owner-occupied housing.

      The present paper develops and employs a simulation model     to measure
the   long-run impacts of the major provisions of the 1981 Tax Act on the
allocation of a fixed capital stock among owner-occupied housing,      rental

housing, and nonresidential capital.3 We emphasize the word allocation

because aggregate savings is implicitly assumed to equal replacement

investment in residential and nonresidential capital. Macroeconomic

impacts   (reduced unemployment of resources) and   growth   effects (greater
labor supply and saving) are not ex.m1,ied.   The specific tax changes
analyzed are the increases in tax depreciation for nonresidential capital
and rental housing and the reduction in the maximum tax rate on unearned
income.

        The paper is divided into five sections. Sections I and II describe

 the   general form of      the aimilation   model and   its initial parazneterization,

 respectively. The         equations explaining tenure choice and       the demands for

 housing services         frcm owner-occupied and   rental   housing   services   are
 discussed    in more detail Section III. Section IV contains the simulation
                                  in

 results, and Section V sunrs.rizea and qualifies the results.

                                       I.   The Model


        Our description of the model is presented in six brief parts. The

 first   two discuss the      determination of nonresidential capital and output

 and   the specification of the demands for housing services.             The household      categories
 and their asset demands        are described in parts three     and   four •   Government

 spending and      taxes are the   topics of part five, and the model is stmnrized
 in   part six.



 Nonresidential Capital and Output

      Our economy contains two goods, housing and nonhousing. The nonhousing

good is produced by nonresidential corporate capital and labor via a Cobb-

Douglas production function

            cii,
(1) Y=K'I

where Y is the level of nonhousing output; L is the labor force; and K is

the quantity of nonresidential capital employed which is determined by

equating the value of its marginal product to its user cost. Thus,


(2) K =               '
                                              3




where         is the user cost of nonresidential capital.



      Corporations finance their capital by issuing risk-free debt (the interest

on which is taxed at the personal level), ATX, and risky equity, AEQ. We
                               TX
assume that average q is unity (A + AEQ              =   K) and that the fraction b of. corporate

capital is debt financed. Finally, the user cost for corporate capital depends on

the   yields corporations pay on debt Rtx and equity Rk, the expected inflation
rate IT,     the   corporate tax rate ¶,     and. any special   tax treatment of corporations,
denoted by

(3)     Ck     ck(Rtx, Rk, , T, xk).

The precise form of (3)          Is   presented in Hendershott and Hu (1981a).

The Deaand.a       for Housing   Services

      Housing services are produced with housing            capital   onl,y, and   the

services are measured such that one unit of capital produces one unit of
services. The dernds for these services depend on real after-tax labor
income and the       real user    cost of   capital, Assume that    households     faU
into ! income       classes.     The demand for housing    services   by households
in the jth class       that are homeowners is

where
        4 is the aggregate after-tax real labor income of householda in. this
class, o is the fraction of households in the class that are owners, and
    is the real user cost for this class • The demands for housing services

The   O'g axe scale factors        relating    to   the share of income     allocated   to

       There are six equations relating real user costs for housing to yields
on debt (mortgages) and own equity financing and tax variables. For owners,
there are relations        for   each class,   depending     on their personal tax rates

where       Roh is   the cost of own equity financing         by households   in the jth class.

For   rental housing,      there   are   relations    for   each   of the two household   classeà
that invest in rental housing,           even though there is a single        user   cost or

Household Categories

       There are      four income classes, part of each which owns their own house
and part of which rents housing. This gives a total of eight categories.
                                                 5




The incomes and marginal and average tax rates for the four income classes
are listed in the tap half of Table 1. The after-tax labor incomes can
be computed directly from other model variables


(22)   -   (29)          =                                +
                              (l_ej)(l-ok)LjYtojz             (i_o)(i_Z)]

where Z equals      one if the household is           an owner     and   zero if it is a renter.

Note   that (1_k)LjY          is the   agegate before-tax labor income of the ith
income class.
       The   assets held by the various sectors are listed in the lower panel
of the table.       Note      that the fraction of each income class that is an owner-
occupied rises monotonically with income from 0.149 to 0.90. Also, only
the two highest income classes hold tax-exempt bonds and rental housing.
Finally, households finance investment in residential capital (owner-
occupied and rental) with debt and awn-equity, in fractions v and 1-v.


Risk Premiums, Asset Demands and rket Clearing
       Financial markets adjust such that after-tax, risk-adjusted returns
are equilibrated        for   all   investors across all assets. Thus we can write



                                             +
(a)           (1-ei)Ri =         (l-e)Rtx        pi   ,




where Rtx is the risk-free             rate and pi and 8i,, respectively, are the
risk premium      and   the   tax rate applied to the income             earned   on the ith

asset required or held by the jth investor•                     We assume that     each   risk premium

is the product     of the common        risk aversion         parameter V,   the expected
after-tax variance       of the return, and.         the proportion of the household's
wealth     invested in the asset

where '    is    the portion of real earnings paid out and         is the ratio of

the concurrent effective capital gains tax rate to the income tax rate.
        The eight demands for taxable debt are derived residually from the balance

 sheet constraints:

(54) -     (61)                W.+v(A       AH),
where v, again, is the loan-to-value ratio on residential housing. Finally, there

 are market-clearing equations for the markets for taxable debt (bonds and mortgages),

 equities, tax-exempt securities, and rental housing (there is no equation for

 owner-occupied housing because supply and demand are necessarily equal at all

 times):


 (62)             = bK +

The volumes of outstanding state            and local tax-exempt debt (EX) and                   federal

debt (FED)      are treated as exogenous, and both are assumed to have financed

government         investment.


Taxes and the Government

        Nine equations are introduced to compute taxes by household class
and to add up total household taxes. For each class,



(66) -    (73         TG1 e1(cgk + uA)               +

three terms reflect capital gains taxes (p. is the ratio -- assumed to be

0.133 --      of   the average concurrent effective capital gains tax rate to 8),

property taxes (i         is   the property tax rate       -- 0.018),        and Federal income

taxes. Regarding div and cg, EAT is corporate earnings after taxes, RE is

corporate retained earnings, and =o.4) is the proportion of real earnings

paid out. An exception arises for the highest income category. For these

groups (both owners and renters), the average tax rate was applied to labor

income only. For renters,               was otherwise replaced by an average of 0.6 and

e    (0.5);   for owners, 0.55 and were averaged. That is, wiearned income is

assumed to be taxed at a higher rate than labor income and the rate is

higher    for   renters, who do    not   have   expenses   on owner—occupied housing

to   itemize, than for owners.
       Total household taxes are computed by aggregating across households:

       Corporate     taxes and income are       also computed    endogenously. For taxes,
we   have

                                      6tx
and         is the corporate property tax rate (0.012). The            last   term is   a

crude   attempt at incorporating the investment tax credit. The 0.6 factor
is the ratio of gross corporate product to total GNP net of housing
services (Y); the 0.65 factor is the ratio of plant and equipment to total
capital (including land and inventories).               The last   two model equations
explain after-tax earnings and retentions:

       Government spending is assumed to equal taxes paid by households
and businesses. A tttrue tax cut -- one that does more than offset
bracket creap due to inflation -- then, is assumed to be "financed" by
budget cuts elsewhere. This seems realistic in the current (1981-82)

setting. It is, of course, possible to simulate         simultaneous   increases
in some taxes and decreases in others.


del Summary
      The model    equations   are   summarized by market in Table 2. In addition

to   the   five asset markets, a "market" for nonresidential capital and output

is listed. The equations for each market are divided into demand, supply,

and "returns". The      latter   Includes: market-clearing equations, user—cost
expressions, and relations for household specific after-tax returns on
residential capital and           equity. To clarify matters, symbols for
                              corporate

the return variables are listed. In addition to the 53 market equations,
12 expressions for tenure choice and after-tax labor incomes and 12 tLtax
equations    were specified above.



                      II.     Parameterization of the Model

      The exogenous variables in the model are the following:
a)    risk parameters: V and O2'S for the four risky assets
b)    inflation and debt ratios: i, b and v
c)    wealth and labor      Income   distribution endowments: the w and
d)    production parameters: 0'k' oh' and        rh
e)    tax parameters: ,        xk, xh, 9 and
r)    other:    W, L, TEX and FED.


Because    the last year of    available income tax data   is 1977, the model
has been    parameterized for this year. The £, e1 and           are coixuted
from this data (see    Table 1). The other      tax parameters are described in
Hendershott and Hu (l981a) and Hendershott and Shilling (1981). We set

V =   3, b = 0.333,            08. W, TEX, and FED are 1977 values from
                         and v =

Federal Reserve      flow of funds data; TI is our best guess on 1977 expected

inflation;   V is    a   common risk aversion parameter of         no real import      because
Voi2is what matters so a set of oi2's can be selected to be consistent
with any value of V; and b and v are the fractions of marginal investments
in nonresidential and residential capital that appear to be debt financed.
      The remaining variables -- the four 'i e5 four w s, three                  '8,   and L - -
are   set such that an array of endogenous variables would be initialized
at their observed 1977 values.             This array includes, Y, K,       AOR, £J,
Rtx, Rex, or, and        the   four   coh's. The 1977 values of these variables
were: Y = $1784      billion,      K = $3006     billion, ZA = $523 billion,
LAOH = $1613 billion, T $80.7 billion, Rtx = 0.08, Rex = 0.0560,

The latter five variables          are   not   observed but   were constructed   and

utilized   in the estimation of demands for housing services (see the following
section). In effect, the simulation model was coded with these quantities,
yields, and user costs as          exogenous and solved for the cYi2's,     the w's,
the 's and L. The solutions were
                                             13




    =    0.0384,   c = 0.014148,         = 0.0635 and o                0.08214



     0.126, w2 = 0.1437, w3 =        0.217 and     w14 =   0.220


     0.29,    cYrh =   0.0829, COh = 0.0586 and L              114.142 billion.




When the w1 are compared with the h1, we find that the $l0-25 thousand

income class has about its share        of   wealth, the $25-50 class has twice

as much wealth per household, and the             over   $50   class   has three times as

much wealth   per household. When the WI are compared with the                      the
highest and lowest income groups        are   seen to have relatively low wealth/labor-
income   ratios.

     The simulations      that   produced the above variables also generated full
balance sheets for      the eight household sectors. The               dollar values of these
balance   sheets and the ratios of assets to net worth (where mortgage

debt is treated as a negative asset) are listed in Tables 3 and 14.                   Note

that the share of wealth In risk-free debt (eithet,                 gross   or net of nrtgage debt)

declines as income rises, while the shares in everything else rise with income.

     The computed values of EAT and RE are, in billions of dollars,

614.5 and 214.3. The observed 1977 values for EAT and RE were 67.1 and 25.5,

quite close to those simulated. (These values are corrected for the

Commerce   Department 'a inventory valuation and            capital consumption

adjustments.)

     The   initial values    for the household specific after-tax rates of

return are listed      in Table 5.    The   pre (household) tax          return to corporate

equity   is Rk = 0.1111.

                    III.       The Demands for Housing Services

      The specification of the demand for housing services and the rental-

ownership tenure choice deals simultaneously with the discrete and continuous

aspects of housing decisions. Following King (1981), we posit a translog

indirect utility function for the ith household in the jth class as



                           -                                 +
log Vjj =   61Elog()           62 log() -   B3flog()2J

where      and y-, respectively, are the price of housing services and

nominal after-tax labor income for a household in the jth class, P

is the price of the composite commodity, the               are positive constants,

and       reflects the effects of the idiosyncracies in tastes of the

household. Except for these idiosyncracies, the households within our

four income classes are identical.

      The individual household is assumed to make           the   tenure choice that

maximizes its utility. Assuming the stochastic utility components, the

      are independently and identically distributed with a double-exponential

distribution, the logarithm of the odds of households in the jth class

choosing to own rather than rent is



            =
                6lS2 1og() - B1B21og            Coj)2 -   (log cr)2

where co and cr equal P/P°, depending on whether the household owns or

rents. (These c's are generally referred to as real user costs.) This

expression is known as the logit probability model [for more details

see Domeneich and Mcadden (1975)].

        The data on the probability of homeownership are taken from the Annual

Housing   Survey   for the years     1973 to 1979. This study analyzes the tenure

choice   decision for households over time by real income groups. The
definitions     and breakdown of the classes       are 0-3,000,    3,000-,000,   14,000-5,000,
                                             17




5,000-6,000, 6,000-7,000, 7,000-10,000, 10,000-15,000, 15,000-25,000
and over 25,000. Tile probability, o, that a household in income c].ass
j will choose to own is approximated by the ratio of the munber of
homeowners to the number of households in that income class.
        The real price of owner-occupied housing services is defined as

                          (1m)
                             i
              COjCUj

where         is the unconstrained real user cost,                 is a mortgage-property
        CUj                                                   mj
tax payment constraint       variable, and cv is a parameter          to be   estimated.

The mortgage-property       tax payment constraint          variable, mj attempts to

capture the extent to which financing costs and property taxes                  impinge
upon the buyer 's liquidity.         The   value of         is based on net-of-tax
                                                      mj
mortgage. and    property tax     payments on a dollar of housing, assuming 75
percent   debt financing     at   the mortgage    rate     for the relevant year, times

the   ratio of a 19711.   constant-quality     house to mean household disposable

real income. The value of a' is determined in the estimation.

       The   construction of the unconstrained user costs of owning by               income

class   follows Hendershott and Hu (1981c).           The data employed       in the calculation

of CUj are     identical   to that   used   in Hendershott and Hu with the exception

that   the   required after-tax return on equity for           taxpayers with     low   to
medium   marginal tax rates is the         after-tax mortgage       rate plus   a three

percentage point risk premium and           for taxpayers      in higher tax    brackets
the required after-tax      return on equity is taken to be the tax-exempt
rate   plus the risk premium.7

        The calculation of the user cost of capital of rental housing

 utilized in the analysis is an extension of that described in Hendershott

and Shilling (1981). The extension consists of viewing the aptimal behavior

of art investor in rental housing as: 1) investing In rental housing until

the marginal product of capital equals the user cost, and 2) choosing an

optimal       holding   period in order to maximize wealth. The basis for determining

the real user cost of capital of rental housing then depends on maximizing

the present value of all         future expected cash flows generated over the

optimal holding period of the property or equivalently             minimizing the
user cost of capital with respect to the optimal holding period.
        The best estimate of the ].ogit probability model using a pooled

equation regressions technique is

        p =   .808, R2 = .859,   =      .856, SEE = .294


where   t-statistics are shown         in parentheses. Both coefficients have the

expected sign and are significantly greater than zero at the 95 percent

confidence level. The effect of the impact of credit market constraints

(nominal interest rates) and property tax payments on the prices of owner-

occupied housing services diminished as income             increased   and was   assumed
not to bind households in the highest income groups.              In   the model    simulations,
c   is set equal to zero.

      The demand for housing services can be derived by applying                 Roy's
identity to      the indirect utility function. The demand for           housing   services
by households in the jth class that are homeowners is

where          =   346     and B1B3    = 0.383.        Similarly, the demand for housing

services     by renters is

                           a
                                        +           log cr].
                                            2B1B3


The scale parameter B1 is determined in the initial parameterization such

that the sum       of   household demands for housing services equals the existing

housing   stock.        Different scale parameters are allowed for the owner and

rental   markets.       More specifically, 1/B1 equals 0'oh in the AH equations

and rh in the RH equations.

      The implied price elasticities of the demand                  for   owner-occupied

and rental housing services are listed in Table 6 for 1976. Also listed

is the weighted average of the price elasticities for owner-occupied

housing. These results can be compared with Polinsky and Elwood (1979),

       The long-run impacts of          the various tax changes considered on the
allocation of a fixed aggregate              capital   illustrated in Figure 1.

The risk-free taxable debt rate is on the vertical axis and the quantity of
capital is on the horizontal. The first schedule is the aggregate demand
for owner-occupied housing. While this schedule is drawn for given values
of a large set of exogenous variables, the only one listed is the marginal
tax   rate   on 'unearned"           the highest income class, e. (An

occupied   housing   of   the highest income households.) This demand schedule

(all capital demand schedules) is negatively related to the taxable debt rate

because an increase in this rate, ceteris paribus, will raise the real user

cost for housing for all income classes.

     The second schedule is the sum          of   the aggregate demands for owner-

occupied and     rental housing. This       schedule is drawn for a given level of

taxation of rental housing, xh,        as   well as a given value of e. An increase

in xh raises the user cost for rental housing and              thus   shifts the IES(=Ao'÷A)

schedule to the left. The       total    capital schedule is drawn for given levels

of e, xh, and xk, the level of taxation of nonresidential capital. An
increase   in   xh shifts RES and CAP(=RES+K)        equally to the left,       the latter

because   of   the former. An increase in            shifts only CAP to the left.

     Now consider the recently passed reduction in the tax service lives of

business capital. Both xk and            are reduced, although the latter by
                          8
less than   the   former. As a result, RES shifts slightly to the right,

and CAP shifts     strongly   to the right. The       increased financing needs
raise the yield on taxable debt (and yields on other assets through portfolio
substitution effects). This will lower the demand for owner-occupied
housing per owning unit       and   will likely    reduce   the number   of   owners (see

below).    The demand for nonresidential capital will certainly                rise. The
impact    on rental housing is ambiguous. Given the small reduction in the

taxation of rental housing relative to the significant rise in interest
rates, the user cost of rental housing will likely rise, lowering the demand

per renting unit. On the other hand, the user cost of rental housing
will likely fall relative to that of owner-occupied housing, causing a
shift in tenure tord rental housing.
                                        22a




     We wish to emphasize the strong assumption employed here that total

saving is unaffected by the cut in tax depreciation. Not only do households

not increase their saving in response to the increase in real rates of

return, but they fully offset the increase in business saving (retained

earnings). That is, households fully 'pierce the corporate veil." We

would   anticipate   a significant increase in total private saving and

thus a dampening     of   the tendency for interest rates to increase. Ignoring

the saving response allows us to concentrate on the allocative effects

of the tax changes.

     The impact of a reduction in the taxation of' rental housing only seemn

clear. While this reduction, too, will raise interest rates, the user cost

of rental housing will fall, while those of owner-occupied housing and

nonresidential capital will rise. There will be less owner-occupied

housing, owing to both lower demand per unit and fewer owning units, and

less nonresidential capital.

     Because a reduction in         lowers   the   demands for owner-occupied

housing, rental housing and nonresidential capital -         - all schedules   shift

to the left with the shift being greater for RES than for AOH and for CAP

than for RES. Interest rates will decline sufficiently to maintain total

demand for capital equal to the given stock. Unfortunately, the directional

impacts on the specific capital components cannot be ascertained from

Figure 1. This would, of course, lead one to suspect that these impacts

are not large.

     Our presentation of the simulation results of the Tax Act is divided

into four parts in order to Illustrate both the impacts of the different

tax changes and the workings of the model. The first three parts deduce
                                            23



the separate impacts of the increase in tax depreciation of nonresidential

capital,   the reduction      in maximum tax rate on unearned   income, and   the

increase in tax depreciation of rental housing. The fourth part computes

the combined impact of these three changes.



Increase in Tax Depreciation of Nonresidential Capital

     The simulation results reported in Tables 6 and 7 reflect the impact

of a shortening of tax service lives of corporate capital (an increase

in tax depreciation). More specifically, we lowered the real user cost

of corporate capital exogenaus].y so as to reflect passage of Jones-Conable

or the 10-5-3 depreciation tax lives. In earlier work, Sheng Hu and I

calculated that this legislation would lower the real user cost,

ceteris paribus, by 1 percentage points (Hendershott and Hu, 1981b, p. 99).

While a 15-5-3 depreciation schedule is less valuable to businesses than

10-5-3,   the   Economic   Recovery Tax Act has    some tax reduction features in addition

to the cut in the tax services lives. For example, the investment tax credit

for equipment was broadened, the credit being roughly doubled for equipment

with a useful life under 7 years •         The credit was also expanded to cover

facilities used for storage of petroleum and its primary products, and

the carryback period was extended to 15 years. In any event, we have

simply lowered the tax depreciation component of the real user cost by

14. percentage points.       Finally, it   should be noted that this analysis, like

any employing the Jorgensonian user cost framework,          assumes   full lease-back

provisions, i • e •,   the   tax cuts apply to all potential investments,

independent of whether the particular companies are or are not currently

earning profits.

        The upper half of Table 6 indicates the impact on the real user costs

and   quantities of the three types of capital. The taxable                 debt yield

rises    by 2.11 percentage points in order to restrain the total demand for
capital to the existing stock. As a result, the real user cost for
nonresidential capital          declines by   only a third     of   a percentage point,
and   those for housing rise by 1.3 to 1.6 percentage points. Nonresidential

capital increases by 6 percent, owner-occupied housing decreases by 9

percent, and rental housing is lowered by 6 percent.3

        Not surprisingly,      this    tax change   has a   major impact on corporate
taxes and earnings (see the lower half of              Table 6). Total corporate

taxes    decline by 112 percent.         Because property    taxes    rise slightly
(from   $21.6 billion to $22.9 billion), profit taxes are estimated to drop
by   a full 60 percent. Earnings after taxes rise by 25 percent and retained
earnings, by 36     percent.         The impact on   household taxes is negligible.

        Next   we turn   to   the   portfolio effects of the increase in tax depreciation.

The initial effect of         the increase is a decline in the real user cost for
nonresidential      capital and an increase in the return on corporate equity.

Because households shift from debt instruments to equities and corporations

issue   debt (and equity) to finance their            greater investment, the yield.

on   taxable debt rises. This renders tax exempts and both owner-occupied
                                         27




and   rental housing   less attractive, the latter because they are heavily

debt financed. Changes      in the   after-tax yield spreads required to establish

the new equilibrium are presented in the top half of Table 8. These are

changes   in the after-tax yields on the      listed asset less that    on debt

instruments,    and the net changes vary by income class (the investor's
tax bracket).    As can   be seen, equities are    more,    and owner-occupied
housing   less, attractive for all income classes. Rental housing and. tax-exempts

are also less attractive for     those in the $25-50       thousand income   group,
but more attractive for those with higher incomes. Of course, tax exempts
cannot   become less attractive for all investors because the exogenous

stock xmist be held by someone.

       The percentage changes   in asset    holdings   are listed in the lower
half   of the table. These changes     correlate   closely with the changes in

after-tax yield spreads. The higher the income class, the greater the

shift into equities. Also, the two       middle income     groups, which experience

the greater declines in the relative return on owner-occupied housing,

reduce   their holdings   by greater amounts. These groups reduce        their

homeownership rates by just over a percentage point; the other two             groups
have   negligible changes   in ownership.
       The $25-SO   thousand group also shifts out of exempts      and rental housing,

the   latter shift being over 50 percent. While the ratio of the exempt
to taxable debt yields declines from 0.70 to 0.67, the spread between the
exempt and after-tax taxable debt yield rises for those in the highest
tax group. The net yield on rental housing also rises for this group.
The dollar movement into equities and out of housing and exempts is about
a wash for the three lower income groups, so changes in their debt holdings
                                             28




are minor. The highest          income group, which       shifts into rental housing and

exempts as well as into equities, liquidates hO percent of its debt holdings.



Reduction in the Maximum Tax Rate on Unearned Income

        The Tax Act lowers the maximum tax rate on unearned income from 70

to 50 percent. We assume that this translates into a reduction in the

average marginal tax rate for owners in the highest income class from

55 to 50 percent. For the tenth for the higher income class that rents,

the reduction is from 60 to 50 percent. The average tax rates on capital

income fall from 52.5 to 50 and 55           to   50, respectively.

        The initial impact of this tax cut is on the highest income group

only; taxable debt instruments become more attractive and all other assets

relatively less attractive, housing investments owing to the reduced

tax saving on interest deductions. As a result, the taxable debt yield

declines. This induces all other household groups to shift out of debt

instruments and into the other assets. The necessary change in the debt

yield required to achieve the new equilibrium is small, however (a decline

of    21 basis   points),   and thus   the impact on capital allocation is minor.

Owner-occupied housing increases by $1.5            billion, and rental housing and
nonresidential capital decrease by $0.3 and $1.2 billion, respectively.
    Nonetheless, some quite significant portfolio shifts occur. Table 9
presents the dollar value changes in asset holdings; mortgage debt (which

equals 80 percent of housing)           is treated as   a negative asset in order that

the   asset   changes sum to zero. To put these changes in perspective, the

percentage changes in holdings of equities are, from the lowest to the

highest income groups: 6,         5,   h and -9.    For   holdings of taxable debt,

the   changes are: -2, -2, —7, and 16. The net indebtedness of the highest
income group (mortgage debt less holdings of taxable debt) falls by
3]. percent. There are also significant shifts in holdings of tax-exempts
and rental housing from the highest income group to the $25-50 thousand
group. (The ratio of the exempt rate to the taxable debt rate rises from
0.7   to 0.73.) These portfolio shifts also include owner-occupied housing,

with   the highest income group lowering its         homeownership rate by l-

percentage   points and the lowest income group doing the reverse.
       The last   interesting finding is the change in household taxes.
The cut in the tax rate on f'ul].y-taxed debt leads the highest income
group to shift from riskier, tax-sheltered investments into the more
heavily   taxed debt instruments. As         a result, their taxes rise by over
$2   billion. Because the decline in taxes paid by other households is

slight, total household taxes rise. A miniature Laffer curve exists, even

without   greater work      effort.



Increase   in the Tax Depreciation on Rental Housing
       The Tax Act reduced the tax service life on rental housing from

35 to   15 years. As a partial offset, the depreciation method was          reduced
from double declining balance to 175 percent declining balance. On the

one hand, this action will lower the rental user cost, thereby altering

the tenure mode toward          renting and increasing   the desired rental quantity

per renting unit.         The demand for   rental   services will rise. On the other

hand, the expected return on investments in rental property will increase,

raising    the   supply   of   rental housing services. A partial equilibrium

analysis could view        the response from     either side of the market; a general
                                            31




equilibrium     analysis incorporates both responses and constrains the market

for rental services to clear in the new equilibrium. We shall use this

disturbance (reduced taxation of rental housing) to illustrate the

different estimates of impacts         obtained   when different variables are

treated as endogenous.

       In   the first   case, only the returns on and the portfolio demands

for   rental housing are     endogenous.     As can   be   seen in Table 10, the result
is a $1311.7   billion,    or 25 percent,    increase in the stock of     rental
housing.     Supposedly    the demand for rental housing services rises
sympathetically arid      the stock of owner-occupied housing falls        by an equal
amount.
       The second case considers the demands for rental housing services

explicitly.       When the returns to rental housing        are held constant, the

real   user cost falls by a full percentage point. With ownership rates
exogenous [see case (2a) in Table 10], consumption demand rises by $40
billion. With endogenous ownership rate8 [see case               (2b)], the demand

increases    by $133.4   billion,   which is remarkably (and only coincidentally)
close to the $134.7      billion    increase in portfolio demand in the first case.
The average ownership rate falls by a full 5 percentage points. However,
our demand equations for owner-occupied housing suggest that the total
residential housing stock rises        by $50    billion. Thus, the stock of
nonresidential     capital implicitly falls by this amount.

       Finally,   we have the   full model   or general equilibrium analysis

[see case (3) in Table ioJ. The rental user cost falls and the return on

rental housing rises (at least for the highest income group). The supply

and demand for rental services rise equally. As can be seen, the declines

In   the rental user cost and ownership rate and              the   increase In the stock

of rental housing         are   only a third as large as in the partial equilibrium

cases. The stock of rental housing               rises   by 8 percent. About 80 percent

of the increase is at the expense of owner-occupied capital and 20 percent,

nonresidential capital.



The Combined Impact of the Tax Act of 1981
       The   results of combining the three components of the Tax Act are listed
in Table     11.   The major results of Table 7 -- the           6 percent     rise in
nonresidential       capital and the sharp        increases   In business after-tax

earnings and       retentions    --   are   repeated.    One significant difference
is that    the   increase in nonresidential          capital is almost entirely at the

expense of owner-occupied housing. The ownership rate falls by over a

percentage point, and the stock of owner-occupied housing decreases by

II percent. In contrast, rental housing Is reduced by less than one percent.

Of course, this result could have been expected given the analysis of the

increase in tax      depreciation       for rental housing.

       The portfolio shifts shown In Table U are a mixture                of    those

indicated In Tables 8 and          9.   To illustrate, the business tax cut raised

equity holdings      of   the highest two       income classes significantly, while the
cut in the tax      on   unearned Income caused the         $25-50 thousand group to
increase     equity holdings      but the over $50       thousand group to   lower them

sharply. Thus Table 11 shows a large Increase in equity holdings of the

former and    a small     decrease    for the    latter.   Further,   Table 8 lists a shift
in   both tax-exempts and        rental housing      from the $25-SO   thousand group to

those with higher incomes; Table 9 shows the reverse. Thus the shifts
in Table 11 are quite small. Also, recall that        ratio of   the yields on

tax   exempt and   taxable debt was lowered to 0.67   by the increase in business
tax   depreciation   but raised to 0.73 by the cut in tax on unearned income.

When the two tax changes are combined, the ratio is unchanged.

      Table 12 lists the net (of depreciation) user costs of capital for

corporate capital, rental housing, owner-occupied housing on average,

and the components of the latter. The initial net user costs and those

after the impact of the Tax Act are reported. Ignoring risk considerations

and possible externalities, the net user costs should be equal across

all types of capital for capital to be allocated efficiently in the economy.

The Tax Act goes a fair distance toward achieving this equality. Prior

to the Act, the net user cost for corporate capital was 2 percentage

points above that for rental housing and 5     percentage points above the
weighted average net cost for owner-occupied housing. After allowing for

the impact of the Tax Act, the net costs for corporate capital and rental

housing are equal, and that for owner-occupied housing is only three

percentage   points less. When the    net cost for owner-occupied housing is

examined by income class, one sees that the net cost is significantly

below   those   of rental housing and corporate capital for the upper-middle

and high income classes only.

                                      V. Conclusion

       Our    analysis suggests the following long-run impacts          of the Economic

Recovery      Act of 1981 on the allocation of real capital. The stock of
nonresidential capital increases by 6 percent, while the stock of housing
is reduced by 8      percent.      The latter is the result of a nearly 2 percentage
point   increase in    real, pretax interest rates. The          honieownership rate

declines  by almost l percentage points because the Tax Act increases
tax   depreciation for rental housing as well as for industrial capital.
As   a result, the stock      of   owner-occupied housing falls by 11 percent,
while the stock of rental housing          is   relatively unaffected (the increase
in the number of renters offsets          a decline in the     quantity of   rental

services      demanded per renter).

       Corporate profit taxes fall       by 60 percent;      after-tax earnings rise

by 25 percent; and retained earnings are up by 35 percent. Household
taxes are roughly constant. By assumption, the full decline in taxes is
tched by a decrease in government expenditures.
        Some other assumptions should be emphasized. First, saving is
unchanged. Second, there are no other output             or   growth   effects.

That    is,   resources are   not   more fully   employed,   labor participation does
not   rise, and the productivity increase that should accompany the 6

percent increase in industrial capital (in spite of the increase in real

pretax interest rates) is not factored into the model. The existence of

these ttsupply side" effects would (through an increase in saving) further
                                      38




increase   the stock of industrial capital and would dampen the decline

in the stock of residential capital. In fact, residential capital could

increase, although household consumption will surely    be   tilted from

capital (housing and durables) services to other services.

      One other result is worthy of mention. When the cut in the maximum

tax   rate on unearned (capital) income is analyzed in isolation, total

household taxes on unearned income increase. The cut in the tax rate on

interest   from   fully-taxed debt instruments leads high income households

to shift from riskier, tax-sheltered investments into the more heavily

taxed debt instruments. As a result, their taxes are estimated to rise by

$2 billion (l9T7 dollars). Because the decline in taxes paid by other

households is slight, total household taxes rise.

 8The after-tax   variance of   the returns on corporate      equity and   rental housing

  is not affected by these changes.




 9Fei1atein and Fane (1973) have provided evidence that households do pierce

  the veil. Recent estimates of von Furstenberg (1981) suggest that

 households offset only two-thirds of changes in corporate            saving.


10When Hendershott and   Ru (1981b) calculated a partial equilibrium response

 of equipment demand to the 10-5-3 plan, they obtained a l1 percent increase.

 They also emphasized that the general equilibrium effect would be smaller.




11Tbese   data may understate   the shift away from housing      capital in     that the

 relative    expected inflation rate in house      (asset) prices is assumed      to be
 unchanged. It may     be   that this relative expected inflation rate would decline
  (from positive to, say,    zero)   in response   to   the negative impact     on housing

 demand of the increase in real interest rates.
