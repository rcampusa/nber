                                               ABSTRACT

Every year, millions of pounds of toxic chemicals thought to be linked to developmental problems
in fetuses and young children are released into the air. In this paper we estimate the effect of these
releases on the health of newborns. Using data from the Toxic Release Inventory Program and Vital
Statistics Natality and Mortality files, we find significant negative effects of prenatal exposure to toxicants
on gestation and birth weight. We also find that several developmental chemicals increase the probability
of infant death. The effect is quite sizeable: the reported reductions in cadmium, toluene, and epichlorohydrin
releases during the 90s could account for about 3.9 percent of the overall decrease in infant mortality.
Our results are robust to several specification checks, such as comparing developmental to non-developmental
chemicals, and fugitive air releases to stack air releases.

Every year, millions of pounds of toxic chemicals thought to be linked to developmental

problems in fetuses and young children are released into the air. Yet, we have only limited

information about the health effects of these releases. A 1998 Environmental Protection Agency

(EPA) review found that complete screening data about toxicity was available for only 7 percent

of 3,000 chemicals released in large quantities in the U.S. (U.S. EPA, 1998). Even for chemicals

that have been studied, there is little information about how levels found in the environment

affect human health. Laboratory data on toxicity may be of limited value given that tests are

typically conducted on animals, and do not take human behaviors (such as staying inside on high

pollution days) into account.

       This study uses data from the EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) matched to data

from national Vital Statistics Natality and Mortality files to examine the effects of fetal exposure

on health at birth and subsequent infant mortality. Exposure to toxic chemicals may be linked to

many other characteristics of families and neighborhoods, and to swings in economic activity.

Therefore, in an effort to identify the effect of toxic exposures, we compare the estimated effects

of chemicals that are thought to be developmental toxicants to those which are not known to

have developmental effects. We also compare the effects of “fugitive” air releases to the effects

of “stack” air releases. Emissions that go up a smoke stack are more likely to be treated in some

fashion (e.g. with scrubbers), and travel further than those that do not. Hence, they should be

less likely to affect those in the immediate vicinity of the plant than fugitive air releases. Finally,

we look at several of the most common known developmental toxicants separately.

I. Background

There is little research on the question of whether exposure to the toxic releases measured in the

TRI has negative health effects. Woodruff et al. (1998) run 1990 TRI data through a dispersion
model and calculate that 90 percent of Census tracts have concentrations of benzene,

formaldehyde, and 1,3-butadiene greater than cancer benchmarks. This suggests that Americans

may be at risk from toxic releases, but does not establish any direct relationship between

environmental releases and health effects. The current study is one of the first to do so.

        Moreover, it is quite difficult to draw a relationship between a disease such as cancer and

toxic exposures in a particular location given that cancer develops over a long period, and people

are mobile. In contrast, birth outcomes are likely to be highly affected by conditions during the

brief interval of pregnancy (though of course they might also be influenced by factors affecting

the mother before conception). Hence, infant health outcomes are an ideal place to look to see if

existing environmental releases have detectable negative effects for human health.

II. Data and Methods

Information about pregnancy outcomes comes from the Vital Statistics Natality data. These data

are a rich source of information on infant and maternal health. They cover virtually all births and

include information about characteristics of the mother, characteristics of the child, and health at

birth. Information on infant deaths comes from Vital Statistics Mortality files. In this paper, we

focus on birth weight, gestational age, and infant mortality in the first year of life, since there is

considerable variation across counties in these outcome measures.

        Data on toxic releases comes from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxic Release

Inventory, which was created by the Emergency Planning, Community Right to Know Act

(EPCRA) in 1986. EPCRA was a legislative response to the 1984 Bhopal disaster, in which a

cloud of deadly methyl isocyanate escaped from a Union Carbide plant and killed thousands of

people. A Union Carbide plant in West Virginia had a serious chemical release a short time
later. These incidents added urgency to claims that communities had a “right to know” about

hazardous chemicals that were being used or produced in their midst.

        EPCRA required manufacturing plants (SIC=2000 to 3999) with more than 10 full-time

employees that either use or produce more than threshold amounts of listed toxic substances to

report to the EPA for public disclosure. Plants are required to file a separate form for each

substance and plants must identify whether the release was to ground, water, or air. For releases

to the air, we also know whether a discharge was a fugitive or stack release. We focus on air-

borne releases because people living close to a plant may be more likely to be exposed to them

than to water or ground releases. The previous calendar year’s toxic releases are required to be

reported by July 1. Data from the TRI are publicly available from the EPA on CD-Rom or on

the internet.

        The TRI is intended to provide public information about releases so that private agents

can take appropriate action. The EPA can charge fines of $27,500 per violation per day for

failure to file reports about toxic releases. Over the first five years of the program, the EPA

conducted over 3,200 inspections and fined 683 facilities for failure to report.

        The data are quite extraordinary and clearly the best available for our project.2 Several

studies have examined their quality. Brehm and Hamilton (1996) discuss an enforcement

program in Minnesota aimed at finding companies who were not reporting releases. They find

that while the program uncovered many non-compliers, these firms tended to be smaller polluters

so that the total TRI figures were not much affected by their inclusion. Natan and Miller (1998)

examine reductions in reported toxic releases in the early years of the program using an audit of

plants with large changes in reported toxic releases. They found that changes in plant operations

2
  The National Air Toxics Assessment has more complete information about air toxics. However, it is currently
available only for 1996 and 1999, and the two waves are not strictly comparable because of changes in chemicals
tracked and in the dispersion models used to form estimates of the toxics present in each location.
and production levels explained over 90 percent of reductions in releases. On the other hand,

Koehler and Spengler (2007) find evidence of systematic underreporting of releases in the

aluminum industry, and deMarche and Hamilton (2006) find underreporting of lead and nitric

acid emissions compared to monitored concentrations. Changes in analytical methods can also

affect year to year variations in TRI reporting (Poje and Horowitz, 1990).

       Besides potential underreporting, these data have other limitations. First, many releases

are to off-site facilities. We have excluded these from our data set. A more serious problem for

using the TRI to examine changes in emissions over time is that there have been several changes

in the requirements for reporting. In 1995, the list of chemicals tracked was expanded; in 1998,

the type of facilities required to report was expanded, and in 2000, the thresholds for the

reporting of chemicals that persist in the environment were lowered. A few chemicals have

been de-listed. We have chosen to focus on a set of chemicals and industries where reporting

requirements were consistent between 1988 and 1999.

       In 1999, about 23,000 facilities submitted reports describing the releases of more than 2.3

billion pounds of toxic substances. This was however, a decline of approximately 40 percent

from 1988 levels, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. There is considerable variation in the quantities

of toxic releases across counties of the U.S., with the southern states accounting for a

disproportionate and increasing share of releases over time.

       One common criticism of the TRI is that it tracks only a subset of the many chemicals in

widespread use in the U.S. Hence, it is impossible to know if the declines tracked in Figures 1

and 2 accurately track total releases of toxics over time, or if, for example, companies simply

substitute from listed to unlisted chemicals where possible.
        While we cannot resolve this problem, we can examine the estimated effects of the most

commonly released individual chemicals that are thought to affect reproductive success or to

affect fetal, infant, or child development. These chemicals are known as developmental

toxicants. Estimates of the effects of individual chemicals are of considerable interest in their

own right.

        We use information from the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard

Assessment’s (OEHHA) to identify TRI chemicals that are known developmental toxicants.

This determination is made on the basis of the available evidence, which might consist, for

example, of studies of animals exposed to high levels of these substances. Eighty of the

chemicals on the OEHHA list are tracked in the TRI. This list enables us to distinguish between

developmental toxicants and other toxic chemicals (which might, for example, be carcinogens,

but not have known effects on reproductive health).

        In addition to looking at these 80 chemicals as a group, we focus on 10 important

developmental toxicants and divide them into two broad classes that could be expected to have

very different actions in the body: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which generally diffuse

quickly into the air, and heavy metals, which are highly persistent in the environment. 3 Turning

to individual chemicals, we examine toluene, which accounts for the vast majority of the VOC

air emissions, and epichlorohydrin. We also examine lead, which accounts for the majority of

the heavy metals emissions, as well as cadmium, which is thought to be among the most

dangerous developmental chemicals. We have classified compounds of these chemicals together

with the main chemical.



3
  The heavy metals we examine are lead, cadmium, arsenic and mercury. The VOCs are benzene, carbon
disulphide, dibromoethane, epichlorohydrin, ethylene oxide, and toluene. We chose these chemicals on the basis of
frequency of releases and known toxicity.
       An additional problem is that we do not know the date of TRI releases, only that they

occurred in a particular calendar year. This raises the question of how best to merge the TRI

data with the Natality data, where we know the month of birth. We have chosen to focus on

births in January of each year. For these births, most of the pregnancy occurred in the previous

calendar year. Because very low birth weight births and infant deaths are rare events, when we

look at these outcomes, we expand the sample to include all births from January to March. For

all of these children, at least six months of their time in utero occurred in the previous calendar

year, and so they have a greater than 50 percent chance of having been exposed to the releases

reported for that year. Focusing on January births has the additional advantage of controlling

for any seasonality in birth/death outcomes.

       Having made these selections, we aggregate the TRI data, the birth data, and the death

data to the county level. Since counties are of wildly different sizes (see Figure 1 and 2) we

rescale the toxic releases by dividing them by county area. We estimate models in which the

outcome (gestation, birth weight or the infant death rate) depends on toxic releases and control

variables obtained by aggregating the natality data. All of our models control for county-year

level means of indicators for maternal age, race, ethnicity, education, whether the mother

smoked during pregnancy and how many cigarettes per day, whether the mother drank during the

pregnancy and the number of drinks per day, as well as child gender. We also control for year

and county fixed effects in order to deal with overall time trends and differences between

counties. Finally, we weight the regressions using the average number of births in each county

over the sample period and cluster standard errors on the county level to control for serial

correlation.
       Counties with populations of less than 100,000 are not identified in the Natality data.

Hence, our sample consists of relatively large counties, which represent about 75 percent of all

US births. Table 1 presents summary statistics for both the merged TRI/birth sample and for

those counties which have TRI data, but have populations less than 100,000 so that the county is

not identified. We call the latter the unmerged sample. The table shows that infants in the

unmerged sample have somewhat better outcomes, that their mothers are slightly younger and

less educated on average, and that they are almost twice as likely to be African-American or

Hispanic. The mothers in the unmerged sample are also more likely to smoke. Thus, it should

be kept in mind that the results discussed below apply to a relatively urban population and not

necessarily to rural counties.

III. Results

       Our main results are shown in Table 2. Table 2 shows strong evidence that within-county

variations in reported toxic releases are related to infant health outcomes: Nearly all coefficients

indicate a negative effect on birth outcomes and are quite precisely estimated. The only wrong

signed coefficient is the estimate of the effect of lead on infant death which has a very large

standard error. Moreover, a comparison of sections 2 and 3 indicates that the estimated effects

are much larger for developmental releases than for non-developmental releases as one would

expect if the estimates truly reflect effects of the chemicals and not the effects of other factors

(such as economic cycles) that might be linked to similar variations in emissions of both types of

chemicals.

       Turning to types of chemicals, and estimates of the effects of individual chemicals, Table

1 shows that toluene accounts for the 78 percent of the fugitive air emissions of developmental

chemicals we focus on, as well as 83 percent of the VOC fugitive air releases that we focus on.
It is not surprising then that toluene is estimated to have negative effects which are similar in

magnitude, though slightly larger than those for all developmental chemicals. The estimated

effects of epichlorohydrin and heavy metals, including lead and cadmium are much larger.

While the estimates for heavy metals and lead are relatively noisy, epichlorohydrin and cadmium

have highly statistically significant negative effects on gestation, birth weight, and the

probability of infant death.

       However, taken at face value, the magnitude of some of the effects is small. For

example, the point estimate of the effect of toluene on gestation in row 5 implies that an

additional one thousand pounds per square mile of toluene emissions in a county would reduce

gestation by only .024 weeks. Given Table 1, this is about a third more than a one standard

deviation change. Similarly, the point estimate of the effects of toluene on birth weight implies a

3.2 gram change in birth weight per thousand pound per square mile change in emissions. The

coefficients on heavy metals suggest that a two standard deviation change in lead emissions

would reduce gestation by .002 weeks, and would reduce birth weight by 4 grams on a mean of

3,300 grams. Finally, although the estimated coefficients on cadmium and epichlorohydrin are

very large, they reflect the fact that relatively small amounts are released. A two standard

deviation change in cadmium releases would decrease gestation by .012 weeks, and would

decrease birth weight by 2.4 grams, while a two standard deviation change in epichlorohydrin

would decrease gestation by .1 week and birth weight 1.8 grams.

       These modest effects on the overall means of gestation and birth weight mask the fact

that there are sizeable effects on the probability of a newborn child being of low (< 2500 grams)

and very low (< 1500 grams) birth weight: a two standard deviation change in cadmium releases

would increase the probability of low birth weight by 1.2 percent and the probability of very low
birth weight by 1.4 percent. For toluene (epichlorohydrin) the effect of a two standard deviation

increase in releases would be to increase the incidence of low and very low birth weight by 1.9

(0.2) and 2.7 (1.5) percent respectively.

       The effects of releases on infant death are of comparably large magnitude. The estimated

effect of toluene on deaths implies that a two standard deviation change in toluene emissions

would increase deaths by .405 on a baseline of about 8 deaths per 1,000 live births, while a two

standard deviation change in cadmium would increase the death rate by about 5 percent.

Moreover reported toluene releases decreased from an average of 340 pounds per square mile to

about 75 pounds per square mile over the sample period. For the counties in the sample, this

decrease accounts for 3.2 percent of the overall reduction in infant mortality and translates to

about 220 fewer infants deaths in 2000. Similarly the reductions in lead and cadmium imply 9

and 40 fewer infant deaths. Reductions in these three chemicals alone can account for about 3.9

percent of the reduction in infant mortality during the late 80s and 90s from 9.2 to 6.9 deaths per

1000 live births.

       Moreover, the distribution of releases is extremely skewed, as is indicated by very large

standard deviations and maximum values relative to the means. For example, the maximum

release of lead is 433.3 pounds per square mile, nearly 300 times the mean. It may not be very

plausible to assume the effect to be linear over such a wide range of releases. Our estimates may

be driven by severe effects on health from large releases. With the small number of such

releases in the sample, it is unfortunately not feasible to estimate this nonlinearity with any

precision.

       Table 3 shows an important specification check. As predicted, fugitive air releases have

larger negative effects than stack air releases. We view this as additional evidence that we are
detecting an actual health effect, rather than the effect of omitted variables correlated with

emissions. Presumably both fugitive and stack air emissions vary with fluctuations in economic

acitivity, but fugitive air would be expected to have greater effects on health. Indeed, the effect

of stack air emissions is sometimes positive, as one might expect if they picked up the effect of

upswings in economic activity, for example. This is never the case with fugitive air emissions,

which always have negative estimated effects on health. The contrasting patterns between

fugitive and stack air emissions suggest once again that we are underestimating the effect of

fugitive air releases on health. If positive economic conditions improve health but also increase

emissions in industrial areas, then the true health effect might more accurately be measured by

the difference between the stack air and fugitive air coefficients.

       Our results are quite robust to the exact specification chosen. We also estimated models

where we include the toxic releases in absolute values, rather than divided by the county area.

This may be more appropriate if the county area is a bad approximation for what fraction of

births in a county is actually affected by a given release. The results from these regressions,

shown in Appendix Table 1, are fairly similar to our main results. One marked difference is that

in this specification heavy metals and lead have a very clear negative effect on all health

measures. All quantitative predictions (such as the explained part of the decrease in infant

mortality) are very similar.

       We also estimated models (shown in Appendix Table 2) using data from December births

(December to February for the rare outcomes) to show that our results are not driven by focusing

on January births. While the effects tend to be slightly smaller, the overall pattern is quite

similar. The discrepancy could arise because Toxic Releases may be concentrated at the end of

the year and are perhaps particularly harmful at certain periods during fetal development.
         Finally, we also asked whether positive correlations between toxic releases could cause

an upward bias for the coefficients on the toxics in regressions that only include one toxicant. To

check for this we estimated models controlling for all of the individual chemicals

simultaneously. This change had little impact on either the levels of the effects or the precision

of the estimates.

         There is good reason to view the estimates discussed above as extreme lower bounds on

the effects of toxic releases given the measurement issues discussed above. These estimates

reflect the mean effect over children who may have been exposed to large doses of toxic

chemicals at critical periods, and other children who may not have been exposed at all, or who

may have been exposed at times that they were not vulnerable to injury. This logic suggests that

if we could measure actual exposures delivered to particular children at critical periods while

they were in utero, it is likely that the estimated effects would be much larger. This is consistent

with the fact that we find relatively small effects on mean birth weight and gestation but larger

effects on the more extreme outcomes of low birth weight, very low birth weight, and infant

death.
