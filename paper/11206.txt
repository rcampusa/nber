Industrialization and urbanization are seen as interdependent processes of modern economic
development. However, the exact nature of their causal relationship is still open to considerable
debate. This paper uses firm-level data from the manuscripts of the decennial censuses between 1850
and 1880 to examine whether the adoption of the steam engine as the primary power source by
manufacturers during industrialization contributed to urbanization. While the data indicate that
steam-powered firms were more likely to locate in urban areas than water-powered firms, the
adoption of the steam engine did not contribute substantially to urbanization.

I. Introduction

       Industrialization and urbanization are seen as interdependent processes of modern

economic development. In the United States, industrialization began in the early nineteenth

century as manufacturing re-organized from artisanal shops to non-mechanized factories in a

handful of industries; however, in the second half of the nineteenth century, manufacturing

activity rose in scale, became more mechanized and spread to numerous industries. The rise of a

manufacturing sector, especially in the second half of the nineteenth century, coincided with a

significant growth in urban population. As the domestic labor force in manufacturing doubled

from 10% to 20% between 1850 and 1880, so too did the share of the population in urban places,

from 15% to 30%.

       One of the major developments associated with industrialization was the shift in primary

power sources for manufacturing from hand and water power to steam power, particularly in

large factories. This shift towards greater use of steam power by manufacturers is believed to be

explained by a sharp decline in the relative user cost of steam compared to other power sources.

According to Atack’s (1979) estimates, the annual costs per horsepower of steam fell below that

of water power in the 1840s. By 1870, steam power capacity in manufacturing was greater than

that of water-power (Fenichel (1979) and Rosenberg and Trajtenberg (2004)). While rigorous

comparisons of hand and steam power costs do not exist, the relative cost of using hand power

may have risen as wages were increasing over this period (see Margo (2000)).

       In a recent paper, Rosenberg and Trajtenberg (2004) argue that the adoption of the steam

engine by manufacturers, and in particular the Corliss engine, was responsible for the rapid rise



                                                3
in urbanization.1 By releasing firms from the locational limitations of topography and climate

and offering them the freedom to locate in cities, they argue that the deployment of the Corliss

steam engine served as a catalyst for the relocation of firms from rural locations to cities. While

the idea that the steam engine contributed to urbanization is not new, and indeed many early

promoters of the steam engine proclaimed locational freedom as one of its major benefits,

Rosenberg and Trajtenberg’s paper represents the first serious empirical estimate of this

hypothesis.2 In sum, they show that counties which adopted a higher stock of Corliss steam-

engines as of 1870 exhibited faster population growth in subsequent decades.

         This paper evaluates the role of the steam engine, as well as other primary power sources,

on the location of manufacturing firms using establishment-level data from the manuscript

censuses of manufactures for the period between 1850 and 1880. Since the data from the

manuscript censuses contain information on power sources of establishments and whether these

establishments were in rural or urban places, it is possible to estimate more precisely whether the

adoption of the steam engine contributed to urbanization. Although the census data do not

distinguish between Corliss and other types of steam engines, there is little reason to believe that

the locational impact of steam engines was isolated to the Corliss type.

         The analysis of the manuscript census data show that steam-powered employees were on


1 Rosenberg and Trajtenberg believe that the Corliss steam engine was a general purpose technology that was
responsible for triggering economic growth in the late nineteenth century. They argue that the steam engine, by
fostering urbanization, allowed the economy to capture significant benefits of agglomeration economies. However,
previous studies that use the growth accounting framework suggest a limited role of general purpose technologies on
economic growth. For example, Crafts (2004) and Crafts and Mills (2004) find that the impact of the steam engine
on UK economic growth was rather modest. A social savings calculation suggests that the steam engine’s
contribution to growth was about 0.05% per year between 1870 and 1910.

2 For example, the Scientific American, in their May 12, 1849 issue, wrote: “A water-mill is necessarily located in
the country afar from the cities, the markets, and the magazines of labor, upon which it must be dependent. Water
appears to run very cheaply, but it always rents for a high price, and the [capital] cost of dams, races, water wheels
etc. is on the average quite as great as that of a steam engine and equipage... A man sets down his steam-engine
where he pleases - that is, where it is most to his interest to plant it, in the midst of the industry and markets, both for
supply and consumption of a great city - where he is sure of always having hands near him, without loss of time in
seeking for them, and where he can buy his raw materials and sell his goods, with adding the expense of double
                                                             4
average almost five and a half times more likely to locate in cities than water-powered

employees between 1850 and 1880. However, when compared to employees that did not use

inanimate power as their primary power source, such as hand-power, steam-powered employees

were on average 0.55 times less likely to locate in cities. At any given point in time, the

differences in predicted probabilities of urbanization for steam powered employees were

negligible. However, when the calculations factor into account the changes in the distribution of

primary power sources over time, the shift in power source from hand and water-power into

steam-power may have contributed to about 8-10% increase in the rate of urbanization.

         Rather than the adoption of steam-power, the shift from artisanal to factory organization

of production in manufacturing may have been the single most important contributor to

urbanization in the second half of the nineteenth century. Factory workers, who did not use

inanimate power, as well as steam-powered and water-powered factory workers were on average

two to three times more likely to locate in cities than their non-factory counterparts. Factory

production is estimated to have increased urbanization by about 27% at any given point time.

Finally, employees in firms with a higher intensity of female labor were much more likely to

locate in urban areas whereas employees with a higher intensity of child labor were less likely to

do so.



II. Data

         This paper uses the Atack-Bateman-Weiss (ABW) sample of manufacturing firms drawn

from the manuscripts of the decennial censuses for 1850, 1860, 1870 and 1880 to examine

whether the adoption of the steam engine contributed to urbanization. In addition to the typical

census type information on output, raw materials, capital, labor, and wages, the data provide


transportation.” See Hunter (1985, p.104).
                                                  5
information on primary power source. For 1850-1870, the census enumerators collected

information on whether an establishment used one of five types of power sources: water, steam,

hand, animal, and combination. However, information on the level of horsepower was only

sporadically reported for a meaningful analysis of this variable. For 1880, the census schedules

provide information on the level of primary horsepower generated by water and steam, but do

not contain information on other types of power sources.

        The ABW data contain information on the location of firms at the county level and

whether its location is urban or rural. An area was defined as urban if it was an incorporated

town or city which contained a population of at least 2,500. However, it is important to note that,

unlike the modern definition which uses the county as the smallest geographic unit of analysis

for determining whether a place is rural or urban, the most likely unit of geographic observation

was the minor civil division during this period. Thus, it is possible to infer from the data whether

an establishment was located in the rural or urban part of the county. Finally, the establishments

are categorized by standard industrial code (sic) at the 3-digit industry level.

        To eliminate potential outliers in the data, the samples were restricted to establishments

with positive values of output, employment and capital. Firms with capital-labor ratios below

$50 per worker were omitted. The data were restricted to manufacturing industries defined by

modern 3-digit industries ranging from 200 to 399; however, 351 (steam engine) was deleted.

For the 1880 data, the so-called “special agent” industries are under-represented in the random

sample. In a number of industries, such as cotton, wool, silk, iron and steel, etc., experts rather

than regular enumerators were chosen to gather information. However, these manuscript

schedules collected by “special agents” have never been located. Several strategies are deployed

to ensure that the data analysis is robust to the under-enumeration of these industries.3


3 The articles by Atack, Bateman and Margo (2002, 2003, 2004) carefully address many of the important data
                                                      6
         Table 1 demonstrates that the manufacturing employment of the establishments in the

ABW sample became increasingly more urbanized between 1850 and 1880. Over this period, the

share of employment in urban locations rose from 40% to 71%. However, the growth in

urbanization of the manufacturing labor force was not monotonic as the share of urban

employment fell between 1860 and 1870. Unfortunately, it is difficult to know whether this

decline was caused by the Civil War or whether it is related to sampling problems with the 1870

data, such as an under-enumeration of firms in the South. From a regional perspective, little

discernible patterns emerge in the ABW data except for the possible emergence of north-south

divergence in urbanization rates by 1880.

         Table 2 reports the share of urban manufacturing employment by 2-digit industries. The

ABW data indicate that the share of manufacturing employment in urban locations varied

significantly by industries. Employees in tobacco, apparel, printing and miscellaneous industries

were much more likely to locate in cities whereas those in food and lumber-wood industries were

more likely to reside in rural places. For employment in some industries such as textiles and

primary metals, locational patterns shifted somewhat over time and became more concentrated in

cities by 1880. The industry data also indicate that the drop in urbanization between 1860 and

1870 was heavily concentrated in a few industries such as apparel, lumber-wood, paper, and

chemicals.



III. Did the Steam Engine Contribute to the Growth of Cities?

         To assess whether the adoption of the steam engine led firms to locate in urban areas, we

select a discrete choice model where the dependent variable takes on a value of 1 if a firm is

located in an urban area and 0 if it is located in a rural area. More specifically, the regression


issues, including those related to “special agent” industries, that pertain to the ABW data.
                                                            7
estimates are based on the logit model of the following form:

(1) ln[Pi/(1 – Pi)] = a + ß1 Locationi + ß2 Industryi + ß3 Factoryi + ß4 Womeni +

   ß5 Childreni + ß6 Steami + ß7 Wateri + ß8 Steam*Factoryi + ß9 Water*Factoryi + ui

where Pi is the probability that a firm i is located in an urban area and (1-Pi) is the probability

that it is located in a rural area. To estimate the impact of primary power sources on location, we

construct dummy variables for steam-powered and water-powered firms; the omitted category is

dominated by hand-powered firms, but also include a small number of firms that use some

combination of various power sources.

        To control for other factors that influence firm location decisions, we include as

independent variables a factory dummy variable, which equals one if a firm employed more than

15 laborers, the share of women employees, the share of children employees (for 1880 only), and

interactions between steam and water power dummy variables with the factory dummy variable.4

In addition, to account for unmeasured industry and location specific effects, the regressions

contain 3-digit industry and county-level locational fixed-effects, respectively.

        The regression sample means are reported in Table 3. Between 1850 and 1880, the

proportion of workers in factories rose steadily from 61.3% to 77.9%. Over the same time

period, the share of steam-powered employees rose from 20.7% to 52.2% whereas the share in

water-power fell from 31.7% to 6.3%. Similarly, the share of steam-powered factory workers

rose from 17.0% to 46.2% whereas that of water-powered factory workers fell from 21.4% to

3.1%. The intensity of female labor in manufacturing declined from 23.3% to 16.6%, but this

decline may be an artifact of changes in reporting criterion. In 1850 and 1860, the data contain

female workers of all ages; however, in 1870 and 1880, the data only include female workers

over fifteen years of age. In 1880, about 4% of the manufacturing employment in the ABW


4 Employment is defined as one plus men, women and child employees.
                                                     8
sample was comprised by children.

         The logistic regressions reported in this paper are weighted by employment. However,

there are differing strategies for interpreting the logistic regression coefficients. One standard

strategy involves reporting the coefficients in odds-ratios, (P/(1-P)), by simply taking the

exponent or anti-logarithm of the logit regression coefficients. The odds-ratio has the simple

interpretation in that a coefficient greater (less) than one means that manufacturing employment

is more (less) likely to locate in an urban rather than a rural location. The second strategy

involves translating the effects on logged odds into the effects on probabilities. This latter

strategy provides a more concrete estimate of the independent variable’s effect on urbanization.

         Table 4 reports the logistic regression coefficients in terms of odds-ratios. The results

indicate that steam-powered employees were more likely to locate in urban locations than water-

powered employees, but were less likely to do so compared to employees in the omitted

category.5 Compared to water-powered employees, steam-powered employees were 8.7 times

more likely to locate in cities in 1850, but that figure declined to an average of 4.3 for the

decades between 1860 and 1880. On the other hand, when compared to the employees in the

omitted category, steam-powered employees were on average 0.64 times less likely to locate in

cities between 1850-1870. In 1880, the odds fell even more sharply to 0.29, but this decline may

be in part due to a change in reporting procedure for primary power data.6

         Factory employees, those who worked for establishments with greater than 15

employees, were on average twice as more likely to locate in cities than those in smaller

establishments. Except for 1850, steam-powered factory employees were also more likely to


5 The omitted category consists of establishments that used hand, animal, and combination of power sources as well
as those that failed to report their sources of primary power.

6 In order to determine whether the results of the paper are sensitive to the under-enumeration of “special agent”
industries for 1880, the analysis was repeated accordingly. First, “special agent” industries were re-weighted to
match the published aggregates. Second, the “special agent” industries were omitted from the sample. In both
                                                           9
locate in cities. The interaction between steam-power and factory dummy variables indicate that

employees in steam-powered factories were 1.7 and 1.2 times more likely to locate in cities in

1860 and 1870, and 3.5 times more likely in 1880. Surprisingly, employees in water-powered

factories, except for 1860, were even more likely to locate in cities than those of steam-powered

factories. In 1850, employees in water-powered factories were 2.8 times more likely to locate in

cities than those in other firms; the odds-ratio fell to 1.2 in 1860, but rose again to 2.2 and 3.6 in

1870 and 1880, respectively.

         For 1880, a second logistic regression, equation (5), was estimated using levels of

horsepower of steam and water power and their interactions with a factory dummy. For this

specification, the odds of locating in cities declined to 0.75 and 0.72 for a unit increase in steam

and water power per worker, respectively; however, their factory interaction was significant for

steam but not for water power. The lack of significance may be due the positive correlation

between horsepower intensities in steam and water power and factory organization.

         Employees in firms with a higher intensity of women workers were much more likely to

locate in cities. Except for 1850, when the coefficient was not significant, an increase in the

intensity of women workers increased the probability of locating in cities from 1.3 to 9.6 times

between 1860 and 1880. On the other hand, employees of firms that utilized children more

intensely in 1880 were more likely to locate in rural locations.

         While the odds-ratios provide an intuitively useful way of interpreting the logit model, an

alternative strategy of estimating out-of-sample predictions in probabilities provides a means of

estimating the changes in the probability of the dependent variable associated with a change in

the independent variable. However, since the relationships between the independent variables

and the dependent variable in probability are non-linear and non-additive, the simple partial


instances, the logit regression estimates were essentially identical to those reported in the paper.
                                                           10
derivative, especially for dichotomous dummy variables, is a poor estimate of the effects on

probability. Instead, to derive a more accurate estimate, it is necessary to calculate the predicted

differences in probabilities associated with a dummy variable group or a standard deviation

change of a continuous independent variable (see Sample (2000), Hamilton (2004)).

       This paper employs two types of counter-factual experiments based on predicted

probabilities. The first method is analogous to using the standard partial equilibrium framework

where predicted changes in probability of the dependent variable is estimated for a change in an

independent variable holding all other variables constant. This method estimates the contribution

of the steam engine (or other independent variables) on urbanization at any given point in time

assuming that all other factors are held constant. The second method takes into account the

changing distribution of primary power sources over time. As shown in Table 3, there has been a

systematic shift in primary power sources from hand and water to steam power over time. This

method estimates the changes in the level of urbanization over time that can be attributed to the

changing distribution of primary power sources.

       To estimate the predicted probabilities based on the first method outlined above, it is

necessary to select a starting point for calculating the out-of-sample predictions. While there is

no standard choice, a useful one is the probability associated with the sample mean. For example,

the sample mean of the share of urban manufacturing employment in 1880 as reported in Table 3

is P0=0.71; the logit for this probability, L0, is equal to 0.8954 (ln(P0/(1-P0))=ln(0.71/0.29)). To

compute the impact of an independent variable on urbanization, the logistic regression

coefficient in logit (logarithm of the odds-ratios reported in Table 3) is added to the initial logit

value. If the independent variable is a dummy variable, then L1=L0 + ßi; if the independent

variable is continuous, then L1=L0 + ßi*SDi, where SD is the standard deviation. The probability

associated with this new logit L1 is then equal to P1=1/(1+e-L1). The difference in predicted

                                                  11
probabilities, P1 minus P0, measures the independent variable’s impact on urbanization.

       The computations on predicted probabilities indicate that the adoption of factory

production and female intensive labor force contributed positively to urbanization, but that the

adoption of inanimate primary power sources, both steam and water power, led to a decrease in

urbanization. While the reported estimates are based on the 1880 logit coefficients, similar

results are obtained for other years. Factory production based on animate power sources

increased the share of urban manufacturing employment by 10%, but if steam and water-

powered factories are included, then the impact factories increased to 27%. Like factory

production, one standard deviation increase in the intensity of the female labor force increased

urbanization by about 11%.

       Surprisingly, the adoption of the steam engine contributed to a significant decline in the

probability of urban employment. The steam power dummy variable contributed to a decline in

urban employment by 29.5%. However, the net effect of the steam engine, when one includes the

effect of steam-powered factories, was negligible. The adoption of water power led to an even

more significant decline in the share of urban employment. The water power dummy variable

accounted for a 55.6% decline in the share of urban employment; however, if the impact of

water-power factories was added, water-power on net contributed to a 31.3% decline in urban

manufacturing employment. When the exercise was repeated for equation (5) using levels of

horsepower, a standard deviation increase in horsepower per worker led to a decline in urban

employment by 9% and 11% for steam and water, respectively.

       The second counter-factual experiment asks how much of the changes in urbanization

over time can be attributed to the change in the distribution of power sources from hand and

water-power to steam-power. Using the 1850 estimated logit coefficients, it is possible to

estimate the predicted changes in the rate of urbanization if the 1880 mean distribution of

                                                12
employment in water-powered shops, steam-powered shops, non-powered factory, water-

powered factory, and steam-powered factory is used, holding all other variables at the 1850

sample means. By this estimation, the shift in the distribution of power sources, which also takes

into account the changes in the organization of production, may have increased urbanization by

about 8% between 1850 and 1880. Alternatively, if the 1880 logit coefficients are used on the

1850 employment distribution, then the change in the rate of urbanization is about 10%.

       Despite the lengthy set of controls, the logit coefficient estimates on the steam engine

variable are likely to be biased upwards due to omitted factors that are positively correlated with

use of steam and location in an urban area. If the choice of power sources is endogenous, then

there may be an endogeneity bias in the regression estimates since urban firms were more likely

to adopt steam engines rather than water wheels as their primary power source. On the other

hand, measurement error in the use of steam may bias the results in the opposite direction,

although this bias is likely to be mitigated by the use of dummies rather than horsepower.

Finally, to determine whether there may be an additional bias caused by the fact that

establishments in some industries may reside solely in urban or rural locations within a county,

the regressions were repeated without county fixed-effects and the results were essentially

unchanged.

       Decomposing Industry Fixed-Effects

       The data presented in Table 2 indicate that some industries were much more likely to

locate in urban areas than others. Table 5 examines the role of industry fixed-effects by

estimating logit regressions based on dummy variables for 2-digit industries. The omitted

industry was stone, clay and glass (sic 32), as well as a few other manufacturing industries (sic

29, sic 30, sic36, sic 38) whose sample sizes were very small. While there were considerable

variations in the data, the logit regressions show that firms in some industries such as lumber and

                                                13
wood, chemicals, leather, and transportation were relatively more likely to locate in rural areas;

on the other hand, firms in printing, miscellaneous and apparel manufactures were generally

more likely to locate in urban areas.

       The examination of the industrial patterns of urbanization show that industries that were

more likely to locate in rural areas were generally intensive in raw materials derived from

agriculture and forests. On the other hand, the industries that were more likely to locate in urban

areas were mostly labor intensive such as printing, miscellaneous and apparel, and to a lesser

extent tobacco and textiles industries. It is also interesting to note that some industries such as

lumber and wood that relied on intensive use of inanimate power were more likely to locate in

rural rather than in urban areas.



IV. Conclusion

       Modern economic development has been associated with industrialization and

urbanization. In the United States, while cities existed prior to the nineteenth century, the rapid

rise of urbanization coincided with industrialization that took hold and grew over the course of

the nineteenth century. This paper examines whether the growing importance of the steam engine

as a primary power source by manufacturers during the second half of the nineteenth century was

responsible for the rise of urbanization during industrialization.

       The analysis of establishment data from the manuscript censuses shows that, contrary to

the findings of Rosenberg and Trajtenberg (2004), the steam engine did not serve as a catalyst

for the relocation of manufacturers from rural areas to large urban centers. While steam-powered

employees were much more likely to locate in cities when compared to water-powered

employees, the net impact of urbanization caused by steam power at any given point time was

negligible. Over time, the shift in primary power sources from hand and water to steam power

                                                  14
may have contributed to an increase of about eight to ten percent increase in the rate of

urbanization but the actual figure is likely to be considerably less. Rather than steam power, the

data indicate that the shift from artisan to factory production contributed significantly to

urbanization. Regardless of whether the factory used steam, water or hand power, factory

production increased the likelihood of firms and employment locating in cities.

        One of the most important developments associated with industrialization was the rise of

the labor market. While it is difficult to infer the causes of urbanization from the analysis

presented in this paper, one intriguing theory that is broadly consistent with the data is based on

labor market transactions costs. When the labor market is composed of heterogeneous firms and

workers who must search and match for production, economic agents have an incentive to

agglomerate in cities since search costs are likely to decline with the density of the labor market.7

The data show that factories that employed a larger workforce and industries that were labor
