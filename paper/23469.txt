                                          ABSTRACT

Does the pre-deal geographic overlap of the subsidiaries and branches of two banks affect the
probability that they merge and post-merger value creation and synergies? We compile
comprehensive information on U.S. bank acquisitions from 1986 through 2014, construct several
measures of network overlap, and design and implement a new identification strategy. We find
that greater pre-deal network overlap (1) increases the likelihood that two banks merge, (2) boosts
the cumulative abnormal returns of the acquirer, target, and combined banks, and (3) is associated
with larger labor cost reductions, managerial turnover, loan quality improvements, and revenue
enhancements at target banks.

1.     Introduction
      Mergers and acquisitions have reduced the number of U.S. banks by 60% since the mid-

1980s, spurring research into the causes and consequences of bank mergers. Researchers

examine whether bank mergers create value (e.g., James and Weir, 1987; Houston and Ryngaert,

1994, 1997; DeLong, 2001; Houston, James and Ryngaert, 2001), enhance operating

performance (e.g., Cornett and Tehranian, 1992; Boyd and Runkle, 1993; Akhavein, Berger and

Humphrey, 1997; Calomiris, 1999; Hughes and Mester, 2013), reduce competition (e.g.,

Focarelli and Panetta, 2003; Erel, 2011), and satisfy the empire-building incentives of executives

at the expense of shareholders (e.g., Brook, Hendershott, and Lee, 1998; Bliss and Rosen, 2001;

Hughes, Lang, Mester, Moon, and Pagano, 2003; Laeven and Levine, 2007; Goetz, Laeven and

Levine, 2013).

      What has received surprisingly little attention is how the geographic overlap of the

subsidiaries and branches of two bank holding companies (BHCs) influences (a) the likelihood

that they merge and (b) post-merger value creation and synergies. This is surprising both because

bank executives overseeing a merger typically advertise the synergistic opportunities created by

combining the geographic networks of the BHCs involved in the merger and because existing

research offers differing perspectives on the impact of network overlap on the likelihood and

effects of mergers. As suggested by the literature cited above, more overlap can provide greater

opportunities for a merger to (a) lower costs through the elimination of redundant operations, (b)

boost revenues through the exploitation of enhanced market power, and (c) avoid the formation

of geographically expansive BHCs that impede effective governance. However, research also

suggests that more overlap limits risk diversification opportunities, boosting the cost of capital.

Houston and Ryngaert (1994, 1997) and DeLong (2001) are the only previous studies of how

pre-acquisition network overlap affects stock price reactions to BHC mergers. They find that

returns are positively associated with the degree of pre-deal network overlap.

      In this paper, we push this examination forward in several ways. First, we evaluate

whether and how the degree of geographic overlap between the subsidiaries and branches of two
                                                1
BHCs influence the likelihood that they merge. We believe ours is the first study of this

“extensive margin.” Second, we contribute to research concerning the “intensive margin:” Given

that banks merge, how does the geographic overlap between the subsidiaries and branches of the

acquiring and target BHCs influence the cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) of the acquirer,

target, and combined BHC? We not only quadruple the sample of bank acquisitions relative to

past studies (e.g., Houston and Ryngaert 1994, 1997, and DeLong, 2001), we also develop and

implement a new instrumental variable strategy to assess the impact of network overlap on CARs.

Third, we explore potential mechanisms linking pre-acquisition network overlap and post-deal

stock returns, such as post-deal labor costs, interest margins, the replacement of directors and

executives, and loan quality. We believe that ours is the first study of the mechanisms through

which pre-acquisition networks can shape post-acquisition synergies.

      To conduct these examinations, we compile a comprehensive dataset on BHC mergers and

acquisitions over the period from January 1986 through December 2014, the geographic location

of bank subsidiaries and branches, stock prices, and other BHC and deal traits. After merging

several datasets, we have data on 716 deals in which the acquiring BHC is publicly traded and

429 deals where the target is publicly traded. We construct several measures of the degree of

overlap between the networks of the acquirer and target BHCs. These overlap measures focus on

the degree to which the BHCs have subsidiaries (and branches) in the same or different states

prior to the acquisition. To measure the CARs of the acquiring, target, and merged BHC, we use

the five-day event window around the announcement of the acquisition, i.e., the window from

two days before until two days after the announcement. To evaluate how the merged BHC

responds to the deal in terms of other performance criteria, we examine changes in the target

firm’s (a) number of board members, executives, employees, (b) total salary expenditures, (c)

insider loans, (d) net loan charge-offs, and (e) net interest margins. We believe this is the first

paper to assess changes in these U.S. target bank traits following acquisitions.

      We turn first to the question of whether more network overlap between two BHCs

increases, decreases, or has no effect on the likelihood that they merge. To identify this
                                                 2
relationship, we construct pseudo-matching deals as in Gompers, Mukharlyamov and Xuan

(2016). The goal is to form pseudo acquire-target pairs that are the same as those in the actual

deal except that the pseudo-pairs have different degrees of pre-deal network overlap. We use two

matching criteria. First, for each actual deal, we match the actual acquiring BHC with five

pseudo-target BHCs that are closest in total assets to the actual target. We create an additional

five pseudo-pairs by matching the actual target with five pseudo-acquirers that are closest in total

assets to the actual acquiring BHC. Thus, for each completed deal, we create ten pseudo-deals.

For these pseudo-deals, we also create network overlap measures. We then run a probit

regression in which the dependent equals one for actual deals and zero of pseudo-deals. The

main explanatory variable is a measure of network overlap between the acquirer and target BHCs

in the actual or pseudo deal. For the second matching criterion, we use the market-to-book ratio

rather than total assets to create pseudo-pairs and repeat the analyses.

      We discover that the degree of network overlap is positively associated with the likelihood

of a bank merger, using either matching criterion. After controlling for acquirer and target

characteristics, we find that a BHC is much more likely to acquire a target with a network that

heavily overlaps with that of the acquiring BHC. This finding holds across several different

measures of network overlap and the estimated coefficients indicate that a one standard deviation

increase in overlap is associated with an almost 9% increase in the probability of a merger.

      We next evaluate whether the degree of network overlap between merging BHCs

influences the CARs of the acquirer, target, and combined BHC. We first use ordinary least

squares (OLS) regressions and control for an array of acquirer, target, and deal characteristics to

limit the potential importance of omitted variables. Nevertheless, identification concerns remain.

For example, BHCs with weak governance systems might allow empire-building executives to

acquire BHCs with geographically dispersed networks, and markets might interpret such

acquisitions as a signal that the acquiring BHC is poorly governed. In this case, both the choice

of acquiring a target’s network and the post-deal performance might reflect the acquiring BHC’s


                                                  3
governance system rather than the independent effect of network overlap on post-deal

performance.

        To mitigate endogeneity concerns, we design an instrument variable (IV) of network

overlap. Building on Goetz, Laeven, and Levine (2013, 2016), we exploit two plausibly

exogenous sources of variation in the likelihood that a BHC acquires a target with subsidiaries in

the same states as the acquirer. The first source of variation is interstate bank deregulation, which

determined whether and when BHCs headquartered in one state could establish subsidiaries in

each other state. For most of the 20th century, BHCs headquartered in one state were prohibited

from establishing subsidiaries (or branches) in other states. Starting in 1982, individual U.S.

states started removing these restrictions. Not only did states start the process of interstate bank

deregulation in different years, they also followed very different dynamic paths, as states signed

bilateral and multilateral reciprocal agreements in a fairly chaotic process over time. The Riegle-

Neal Act eliminated regulatory restrictions on interstate banking in 1995. 1 The process of

interstate bank deregulation yields information on whether BHCs headquartered in two different

states can establish subsidiaries in the same states and hence on the potential degree of network

overlap between BHCs headquartered in those states. But, interstate bank deregulation does not

distinguish among BHCs within the same state. The second source of variation uses the

geographic location of BHCs within a state to identify which BHCs in a given state are more

likely to have subsidiaries in other states. In particular, the gravity model of investment predicts

that the costs of acquiring and managing target BHCs increase with distance, implying that

BHCs are more likely to acquire BHCs in geographically close states. By distinguishing among

BHCs within a state, the gravity model provides additional information on the degree of network

overlap between each BHC headquartered in a state and potential targets headquartered in other

states. By integrating interstate bank deregulation with the gravity model, we create an IV of the

1
 An extensive body of research indicates that interstate bank deregulation does not reflect the level, growth rate, or
distribution of state income (e.g., Jayaratne and Strahan, 1996, Kroszner and Strahan, 1999, Morgan, Rime and
Strahan, 2004, and Beck, Levine and Levkov, 2010) or banking system profitability, valuations, and risk (Goetz,
Levine, and Levine, 2013, 2016; Jiang, Levine, and Lin, 2016).

degree to which each BHC has a subsidiary network that overlaps with potential targets in other

states.

          From the OLS analyses, we find that the CARs of the acquirer, target, and merged BHC

all rise more after a deal when there is greater overlap between the networks of the acquiring and

target BHCs. These results hold across the different overlap indicators and when using either

measures of subsidiary or branch overlap. The analyses control for acquirer, target, and deal

characteristics as well as year and acquirer state fixed effects. The economic magnitudes are

material: A one standard deviation in the overlap measures is associated with about a 0.47%

increase in acquirer CAR, which is large as the mean acquirer CAR is -0.13%. As we will now

explain, however, these OLS estimates are biased toward zero.

          The instrumental variable (IV) analyses indicate that greater network overlap materially

boosts the CARs of the acquirer, target, and merged BHC. In these analyses, the endogenous

regressor is one of the pre-deal network overlap measures. The analyses continue to control for

acquirer, target, deal characteristics, and fixed effects for year and the acquirer’s state. We find

that the deregulation-gravity instrument explains actual network overlap, entering with an F-

statistic of over ten in all of the specifications for acquirer, target, and combined CAR and for all

of the measures of pre-deal network overlap. The IV estimates are about ten times larger than in

the OLS analyses, suggesting that BHCs facing less profitable futures have a greater tendency to

purchase BHCs with overlapping networks. Pre-deal overlap exerts a strong, positive influence

on post-announcement stock returns.

          We next examine specific mechanisms through which network overlap might affect

synergies and value creation. It is beyond the scope of this paper to explore all the potential

mechanisms linking CARs and pre-deal network overlap. But, we do explore several. First, if

network overlap boosts CARs by offering opportunities to review and replace inefficient or

redundant executives and board members, then we should observe both an uptick in the rate of c-

suite turnover in targets following an acquisition and an improvement in bank governance as, for

example, measured by a reduction in insider lending and fewer bad loans. Second, if greater
                                                  5
network overlap offers expanded opportunities for the combined BHC to economize on labor

costs, then we should observe cuts in staff and total salary expenditures. Third, if greater network

overlaps creates a combined bank with more market power, then we should observe an increase

in net interest margins following the merger. We examine each of these predictions by

examining changes at target BHCs during the year following the acquisition. Typically, it is

impossible to examine post-merger changes in target firms because the target firm’s balance

sheet is consolidated into the combined firms. However, The Chicago Fed’s BHC data includes

data on a subset of target BHCs following mergers, and we exploit those data.

      We discover that more pre-acquisition network overlap is associated with (1) a higher rate

of replacement of directors and executives at target banks and larger reductions in insider lending

and net charge-offs at targets, (2) greater cuts in the number of employees and the total salary bill

at target banks, and (3) bigger increases in net interest margins at target BHCs. These findings

are consistent with the views that when merging banks overlap geographically, there are greater

opportunities for the merged bank to (a) address managerial inefficiencies, (b) reduce workforce

redundancies, and (c) increase net interest margins through the exploitation of the market power

generated by the more intense overlap of subsidiary networks.

      Our work relates to several strands of research. An extensive body of work examines

whether empire-building motivates bank acquisitions (e.g., Gorton and Rosen 1995; Brook,

Hendershott, and Lee, 1998; Ryan 1999; Bliss and Rosen, 2001; Hughes, Lang, Mester, Moon,

and Pagano, 2003; Laeven and Levine, 2007; Goetz, Laeven and Levine, 2013). Although

empire-building might be a powerful driver of some bank acquisitions, we show that the degree

of pre-deal network overlap exerts a powerful influence on post-deal value creation, cost cutting,

loan quality, and revenue generation. This suggests heterogeneity in the degree to which value-

destroying empire-building shapes the likelihood and consequences of bank acquisitions.

      Furthermore, our work relates to research on whether there is a diversification discount or

premium. Berger and Ofek (1995) and Lang and Stulz (1994) stress that firms that diversify

beyond their core competencies destroy value, while others stress that diversification lowers
                                                 6
risks and boosts shareholder value (e.g., Hubbard and Palia, 1999; and Stein, 1997). We show

that the degree of pre-acquisitions overlap—the degree to which a merger will intensify

geographic focus—boosts shareholder value.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 described the data and

variable construction. Section 3 examines whether the degree of pre-acquisition network overlap

influences the likelihood that two banks merge, while Section 4 evaluates the CARs of the

acquirer, target, and merged BHCs around the announcement date. Section 5 examines the

potential sources of synergies by evaluating post-merger change to the target BHC’s executives,

board members, employees, salaries, insider lending, loan quality, and net interest margin.

Section 6 concludes.



2.     Data and Variable Construction
       To assess how the pre-acquisition geographic overlap of BHC subsidiaries and branches

shapes the likelihood and performance of BHC acquisitions, we use data on BHC acquisitions,

the geographic overlap of BHC subsidiaries and branches, target BHC performance before and

after the merger, and other characteristics of BHCs and M&A deals. To create the dataset used in

our analyses, we merge several data sources. In this section, we describe the sample, data sources,

and key variables. Table 1 gives variable definitions and Table 2 provides summary statistics.



2.1.    BHC mergers & acquisitions

       Thomson Reuters Securities Data Company (SDC) provides data on BHC mergers and

acquisitions (M&As). Since the Federal Reserve only started providing information on the

location of BHC subsidiaries in 1986 and we need this information to construct measures of the

geographic overlap of BHC subsidiaries, we start our sample in January of 1986 and collect data

through December 2014. When constructing measures of the geographic overlap of BHC

branches, we start in 1994 because that is when the FDIC started providing such data. Thus, we


                                                7
focus on the subsidiary analyses, and show in the appendix that the results hold for when using

branch locations to calculate the geographic overlap of BHC networks.

         We include deals in which the acquirer and target BHCs are US-based, the acquirer is

publicly traded, the SDC categories the deals as “Merger,” “Acquisition,” “Acquisition of

Assets,” or “Acquisition of Majority Interest,” the value of the deal is above $1 million (in 2000

US dollars) and above 1% of the acquirer’s market value, and the deal results in the acquiring

bank holding more than a 50% stake in the target. We exclude deals in which the acquirer’s

initial stake in the target already exceeded 50%. After the above screening, this leaves 2,854

deals.



2.2. CARs

         We examine cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) for the acquirer, target, and combined

entity over the five-day window from two days before until two days after the announcement day

of the acquisition. Setting the announcement day as day 0, the CAR window is therefore

indicated as (-2, +2). Following Brown and Warner (1985), we define abnormal returns by using

the difference between actual and projected returns. To compute projected returns, we (1) regress

the BHC’s daily return on the value-weighted returns on the CRSP equally weighted market

portfolio over the 200-day period from the 210th trading day through the 11th trading day before

the announcement date of each deal and (2) use the estimated parameters to compute the

projected returns during the 5-day event window (-2, +2). The CAR for the combined entity is

calculated as the market value-weighted average of the CARs for the acquirer and target bank. 2

         To compute the acquirer, target and combined CARs, we use security prices from the

Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database. After excluding deals in which the

acquirer is missing key data in CRSP, there are 2,341 deals. If we only exclude deals in which

the target is missing key data in CRSP, there are 1,300 observations. The large number of

2
  The results reported below are robust to using (a) an11-day CAR window (-5, +5) or (b) using the three or four
factor asset pricing model to compute abnormal returns.

                                                         8
missing data in CRSP on targets primarily arises because many target banks were not publicly

traded at the time of the announcement. When we exclude deals in which either the acquirer or

target is missing relevant CRSP data, this leaves 1,095 deals.



2.3. Network overlap measures

       To identify BHC subsidiaries and their geographic location, we use Y-9C and Call

Reports from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Following Goetz, Laeven and Levine (2013)

and Jiang, Levine and Lin (2016), we define a bank as the subsidiary of a parent BHC if the

“parent” owns at least 50% of the voting rights of the “subsidiary.” The Call Reports provide

each bank’s address. There are challenges to matching banks in the SDC and Y-9C Reports due

to spelling mistakes, abbreviations, and BHCs in different states sharing the same name, so we

manually match banks. 3

       After matching BHCs with their subsidiaries, we create the overlap measures as follows.

For each BHC in each year, we construct an unweighted and a weighted 51-element vector to

measure the geographic distribution of its subsidiaries. In the unweighted vector, each element is

one or zero depending on whether the BHC has a subsidiary in each state and the District of

Columbia or not. In the weighted vector, each element is zero or the number of subsidiaries in

each state and the District of Columbia.

       We construct several proxies of the degree to which the networks of the acquirer and

target BHCs overlap geographically. Overlap equals the number of non-zero elements in the

intersection of the two BHCs’ unweighted vectors of subsidiaries divided by the total number of

non-zero elements in the union of the two BHCs’ vectors. For example, if u=[1,0,1,0] and

v=[1,1,0,0], then 𝑢 ∩ 𝑣 = [1,0,0,0] and 𝑢 ∪ 𝑣 = [1,1,1,0], therefore Overlap = 1/3. All of the

results hold when using the weighted vectors of subsidiaries.



3
 Many banks that we cannot match in the Y-9C Reports can be matched in the FDIC bank branch data. As we
report below, the results using FDIC data are very similar to the results using subsidiaries.

                                                     9
       Correlation Coefficient equals the correlation coefficient of the two BHCs’ unweighted

vectors of subsidiaries. More formally, the Correlation Coefficient is defined as

                                              ∑𝑛𝑖=1(𝑢𝑖 − 𝑢�)(𝑣𝑖 − 𝑣̅ )
                             𝜌𝑢,𝑣 =                                            .
                                      �∑𝑛𝑖=1(𝑢𝑖 − 𝑢�)2 �∑𝑛𝑖=1(𝑣𝑖 − 𝑣̅ )2


For example, if u=[1,0,1,0] and v=[1,1,0,0], Correlation Coefficient is 0. It is worth noting that

Correlation Coefficient takes on values between -1 and 1. Correlation Coefficient (Weighted) is

defined similarly using the weighted vector of bank subsidiaries, i.e., using the number of

subsidiaries that a BHC has in each state and the District of Columbia.

       Cosine Distance and Cosine Distance (Weighted) measure overlap using cosine distance

based on the unweighted and weighted vectors of bank subsidiary networks respectively. Cosine

Distance of vector u and v is defined as
                                                                𝑢∙𝑣
                                             𝑑(𝑢, 𝑣) = 1 − ||𝑢||           .
                                                                2 ||𝑣||2


       Cosine distance is a measure of “dissimilarity.” It takes on values between 0 and 1, such

that 𝑑(𝑢, 𝑣) = 0 when u = v, which is when the two vectors are exactly the same and hence there

is perfect overlap. In turn, 𝑑(𝑢, 𝑣) = 1, when 𝑢 ∙ 𝑣 = 0, which is when the two vectors do not

overlap at all. For example, if u = [1,0,1,0] and v = [1,1,0,0], then

                     𝑢 ∙ 𝑣 = � 𝑢𝑖 𝑣𝑖 = 1 × 1 + 0 × 1 + 1 × 0 + 0 × 0 = 1,
                                 𝑖


where 𝑢𝑖 and 𝑣𝑖 are components of vector u and v, so that


                         ||𝑢||2 = �� 𝑢𝑖2 = �12 + 02 + 12 + 02 = �2,
                                         𝑖



                         ||𝑣||2 = �� 𝑣𝑖2 = �12 + 12 + 02 + 02 = √2,

      We also use other measures of dissimilarity, including Bray-Curtis, Canberra, Correlation

distance, Euclidean, Hamming, squared Euclidean, Dice, Jaccard-Needham, Kulsinski, Matching,

Sokal-Michener, Sokal-Sneath, Rogers-Tanimoto, Russell-Rao, and Yule distance. While the

results using cosine distance are presented in the main text, all of the results hold when using

these alternatives as reported in Appendix Tables A.5 – A7.



2.4. Additional acquirer, target, and deal characteristics

      We control for several acquirer, target, and deal characteristics in the analyses using data

from the SDC, CRSP, Compustat and Bloomberg. From CRSP, we calculate Acquirer Runup,

which is the percentage change in the acquirer’s stock price over the period from 200 days before

the announcement until 11 day before the announcement. From the SDC, we compute: Deal size

adjusted by assets, which is value of the acquisition divided by the total assets of the acquiring

BHC; Cash deal dummy, which equals one if the acquisition is 100% in cash and zero otherwise;

Stock deal dummy, which equals one if the acquisition is 100% in stock and zero otherwise;

Attitude dummy, which equals one if the deal is “friendly” (i.e., the target did not resist or receive

an unsolicited offer, as defined by the SDC) and zero otherwise; Target public dummy, equal one

if the target BHC is publicly traded and zero otherwise; and Percentage of shares acquired,

which equals the percentage of share of the target purchased by the acquiring BHC. From

Compustat, we obtain both Acquirer total assets and Acquirer return on assets, provided data on

Acquirer Tobin’s Q, which equals the ratio of the market to the book value of assets. When only

including deals with nonmissing values on all of these acquirer, target, and deal characteristics,

we are left with 716, 429, and 404 deals in which we can calculate acquirer, target, and

combined CARs, respectively.




                                                 11
      We are also able to assemble post-acquisition financial data on a subset of target BHCs

from the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank. In particular, there are 1367 targets with separate

financial statements. We are left with 472 targets after omitting those for which we cannot

compute the network overlap proxies discussed above and after excluding observations with

missing control variables. These data on target BHCs provide a unique opportunity to examine

the post-merger performance of target BHCs. For each target BHC in a completed deal, we

obtain its quarterly information from three years (12 quarters) before the announced merger to

three years after the merger announcement. Our BHC-quarter observations have information

such as each target BHC’s quarterly total salary, average salary, number of employees, total

loans, insider loans, net charge-offs, and net interest margin. Observations in the year of merger

announcement are excluded.


3. Does Geographic Overlap Make BHCs More Likely to Merge?
      In this section, we examine whether the likelihood that one BHC acquires another BHC is

increasing in the degree to which the two BHCs have networks that overlap geographically. To

identify the relationship between network overlap and BHC acquisitions, we use a strategy

developed by Gompers, Mukharlyamov and Xuan (2016). Specifically, we examine both actual

deals and pseudo-deals. For each actual deal, we take the actual acquirer and create five pseudo-

deals by matching the acquirer with five pseudo-targets that are closest in total assets or market-

to-book ratio to the actual target. We create an additional five pseudo-deals by matching the

actual target with five pseudo-acquirers that are closest in total assets or market-to-book ratio to

the actual acquiring BHC. Thus, for each actual deal, we create ten pseudo-deals. In creating

these pseudo-deals, we choose only pairs that are legally permitted. That is, we do not create

pseud-pairs among BHCs that could not merge due to interstate banking restrictions. The

strategy is to create pseudo acquirer-target deals that are similar to the actual deal except in terms

of the degree of network overlap and then assess whether network overlap helps account the


                                                 12
decision of two BHCs to merge. In creating the pseudo-deals, we do not select pseudo-acquirers

or pseudo-targets that were involved in an M&A during the three years prior to the relevant deal.

      After creating these pseudo-deals, we estimate the following probit regression:


      𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑑 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑑 + 𝛽2 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑑 +
                                                 +𝛽3 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑑 + 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐹𝐹𝑑 + 𝜀𝑑,                (1)


where the dependent variable, 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑑 , is a dummy that equals one for actual acquisition

deals (d) and equals zero for the pseudo matched pairs of the acquirer and target associated with

deal d. 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑑 represents one of the measures of geographical overlap between the

actual or pseudo acquirer and target of deal d. In Table 3, we provide the results for Overlap,

Correlation Coefficient, and Cosine Distance, and give the results on the other network overlap

indicators in the Appendix. We also control for acquirer and target characteristics in the year

before the announcement of the deal (𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑑 and 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑑 ), including the total

assets, profitability (return on assets), and equity ratio, which are defined in Table 1. Deal fixed

effects (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐹𝐹𝑑 ) are included in all regressions, where this fixed effect equals one for the

actual deal and the pseudo-deals associated with the actual deal and zero otherwise. Thus, there

is a deal fixed effect for each group of pseudo-pairs and its corresponding actual deal. Standard

errors are clustered at the deal-level. The results also hold when clustering at the acquirer state

level. Due to missing observations on some of the control variables, there is variation in the

number of observations across the regressions. In Table 3, we report the marginal effects of the

explanatory variables.

      As shown in Table 3 when using the geographic location of BHC subsidiaries to measure

network overlap, we discover that more network overlap is associated with a much higher

probability that two BHCs merge. This result is statistically significant for each of the network

overlap measures. As discussed above, larger values of Cosine Distance indicate less overlap, so

the negative coefficient estimate on Cosine Distance is consistent with the positive coefficient

estimates on Overlap and Correlation Coefficient. The estimated effects are also economically
                                                 13
large. Consider, for example, a one standard deviation increase in Correlation Coefficient (0.416)

and the regression estimate in column (2) that includes all control variables (0.21). These

estimates indicate a one standard deviation increase in network overlap as measured by

Correlation Coefficient is associated with an 8.7% (0.087=0.416*0.21) increase in the

probability that the two BHCs merge. 4 Furthermore, as shown in Appendix Table A.2, these

results hold when using different combinations of the control variables.

       The finding that network overlap is positively associated with the probability that two

BHCs merge is robust to two additional sensitivity checks. First, we compute the geographic

network overlap of subsidiaries at the MSA-level (Metropolitan Statistical Area level) rather than

at the state-level. In particular, when constructing the network overlap measures at the state level,

we used a one-zero vector of whether a BHC has subsidiaries in each US state and the District of

Colombia or not. For the MSA-level overlap indicators, we instead we use a one-zero vector of

whether each BHC has subsidiaries in each MSA or not. From this vector, we construct MSA-

level network overlap measures for each merger. As shown in Appendix Table A.3, all of the

results hold using these alternative geographic network overlap measures. Second, we compute

the geographic network overlap of branches across states rather than subsidiaries. As shown in

Appendix Table A.4, across all measures of network overlap and using different control

variables, network overlap at the branch level is positively associated with the likelihood that

two BHCs merge. Not only are the results statistically significant, the estimated economic

magnitudes are similar to those reported in Table 3 when using bank subsidiaries to measure

network overlap. For example, the estimated coefficients indicate that one standard deviation

increase in Correlation Coefficient (computed from the bank branch data) is associated with a

9.6% increase in the probability of a merger. FDIC data allow us to generate Correlation

Coefficient and Cosine Distance measures not only weighted by the number of branches in each

state, but also by branch deposits in each state.
4
 When we only include acquirer or target total assets as control variable, we have more completed deals (728) than
we do in later tables (716) because those later tables control for more deal characteristics from the SDC data and
some deals have missing control variables.

                                                        14
      These findings indicate that the likelihood of one BHC acquiring a target is increasing in

the degree to which they have subsidiary or branch networks that overlap geographically.

Holding other features of the BHCs constant, network overlap is apparently viewed as a positive

feature by those making merger decisions within the BHCs. However, this does not necessarily

imply that conditional on an acquisition that greater network overlap boosts the returns to and

profitability of the merged BHC. We now turn to this question.


4.     Network Overlap and CARs
      In this section, we evaluate whether network overlap shapes the CARs of the acquirer,

target, and merged BHC. In the first subsection, we use OLS and control for an array of acquirer,

target, and deal characteristics. In the next subsections, we describe and use a gravity-

deregulation instrumental variable to better address identification concerns.



4.1 OLS

      To assess the relationship between pre-acquisition network overlap and the stock price

reaction to the deal, we begin with the following linear regression:


      𝐶𝐴𝐴𝑑 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑑 + 𝛽2 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑑                              (2)

             +𝛽3 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑑 + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖 + 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌 𝐹𝐹𝑑 + 𝜀𝑑 .

The dependent variable 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑑 is the acquirer, target, or combined 5-day CAR of (-2, +2) around

the announcement date of deal d, which has one acquirer and one target BHC. As defined above,

𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑑 is one of the measures of pre-acquisition network overlap that is announced

in year t. As in Masulis, Wang and Xie (2007) study of CARs following M&As, we control for

the following acquirer (Acquirer Chard) and deal (Deal Chard) characteristics: Acquirer Runup,

Acquirer profitability, Acquirer Tobin’s Q, Deal size adjusted by assets, Acquirer total assets,

Percentage of shared acquired, and a series of four dummy variables that provide information

about the deal: Cash deal dummy, Stock deal dummy, Attitude dummy, and Target public dummy.
                                                15
In addition, we control for the year of the announcement and acquirer state fixed effects.

Standard errors are clustered at the acquirer level since several BHCs engage in multiple

acquisitions. Since some states have more BHCs engaging in acquisitions than others, we also

confirm that all of the results hold when clustering at the acquirer state level. Table 4 reports the

regression results. The dependent variable is Acquirer CAR in columns 1-3, Target CAR in

columns 4-6, and Combined CAR in columns 7-9. For each of these dependent variables, we

provide three regression results, which differ by the network overlap measure: Overlap,

Correlation Coefficient, or Cosine distance.

      As shown in Table 4, we find that (a) pre-announcement network overlap is positively

associated with the post-announcement CARs of the acquirer, target, and combined BHCs and (b)

the estimated relationship is economically large. Specifically, Overlap, Correlation Coefficient,

and Cosine Distance enter significantly at the five-percent level in all regressions. For Overlap

and Correlation Coefficient, larger values signify greater geographic overlap of BHC

subsidiaries. These enter positively and significantly in the CAR regressions. For Cosine

Distance, larger values indicate less overlap and it enters negatively and significantly in the CAR

regressions. With respect to the estimated economic magnitudes, consider a one standard

deviation increase in Correlation Coefficient (0.416). The estimated coefficients on Correlation

Coefficient in Table 4 indicate that a one standard deviation increase in network overlap is

associated with a 0.52, 1.90, and 2.55 percentage point increase in Acquire CAR, Target CAR,

and Combined CAR respectively, as shown in columns 2, 5, and 8.

      These results are robust to several sensitivity checks. First, these results hold across the

other seventeen network overlap measures. We provide these results in Appendix Tables A.5 –

A.7. Second, the results hold when using FDIC bank branch data to compute pre-announcement

network overlap, as shown in Appendix Table A.8 – A.10. Third, the results hold when using the

network overlap measures computed at the MSA-level, as shown in Appendix Table A.11.

Fourth, the findings hold when excluding “big banks,” i.e., BHCs with assets that are larger than

10% of the headquarter state’s total bank assets, as reported in Appendix Table A.12.
                                                 16
4.2. Instrument variable construction and validity

       Although the OLS regressions condition on many factors, identification concerns remain.

Omitted variables might affect both the decision to merge and the market response to the merger.

For example, poorly governed banks might both allow CEOs to engage in empire-building

acquisitions that expand the geographic reach of the BHC, and the market might view the merger

of distant banks as a signal of poor governance at the acquiring BHC. In this case, the stock price

reaction to a non-overlapping acquisition would reflect new information about the governance of

the acquiring BHC and not the causal impact of pre-acquisition network overlap on the expected

performance of the merged BHC.

       To mitigate endogeneity concerns, we develop an instrument for the network overlap of

two merging BHCs that exploits two exogenous sources of variation in the ability of two BHCs

to establish subsidiaries in the same state. The first source of variation is interstate bank

deregulation. The dynamic process of interstate bank deregulation determined whether BHCs

headquartered in different states could legally establish subsidiaries in the same states. The

second source of variation is geographic location. The geographic location of BHCs within a

state influences their likelihood of establishing subsidiaries in other state. Thus, geographic

location provides additional information on which BHCs headquartered in different states are

more likely to establish overlapping networks in other states.

       More specifically, to construct an instrumental variable for the degree to which the pre-

acquisition networks of the acquiring and target BHCs overlap geographically, we begin with the

process of interstate bank deregulation. For most of the 20th century, states prohibited interstate

banking, i.e., each state prohibited banks from other states from establishing subsidiaries (or

branches) within its geographic borders. Starting in 1982, individual states began a process of

removing these restrictions. 5 States both started interstate bank deregulation in different years

5
 More specifically, Maine passed in 1978 legislation permitting out-of-state acquisitions on a national reciprocal
basis, i.e., Maine allowed a “foreign” state’s banks to buy Maine banks if that foreign state allowed Maine’s banks

                                                         17
and followed different paths of deregulation over time. Some states unilaterally opened their

borders to out-of-state banks, while others signed a series of bilateral and multilateral reciprocal

agreements with other states over time. For example, Figure 2 presents two maps. The upper map

indicates the first year that each state’s banks were allowed to enter Texas, and the lower map

indicates the first year that each state’s banks were allowed to enter Pennsylvania. These maps

illustrate the general point: different states started the process of interstate bank deregulation in

different years and followed different dynamic processes of deregulating with other states until

prohibitions on interstate banking were effectively ended across the United States in 1995 by the

Riegle-Neal Act.

        The dynamic process of interstate bank deregulation provides variation in whether two

BHCs headquartered in different states can establish subsidiaries in the same state and hence

whether they have overlapping networks prior to any potential M&A activity between those

BHCs. While interstate bank deregulation provides state-year information on the ability of BHCs

headquartered in different states to acquire BHCs in the same state, it does not distinguishing

among BHCs within the same state.

        To differentiate among BHCs within a state, we exploit an additional source of exogenous

variation: the pre-acquisition location of each BHC’s headquarters and its corresponding distance

to other states. In particular, the gravity model predicts that the costs of acquiring and managing

target BHCs increase with distance, so that BHCs are more likely to acquire BHCs in

geographically closer states. Since BHCs within a state differ in their distances to other states,

the gravity model allows us to differentiate among BHCs within the same state. That is, by

integrating the dynamic process of interstate bank deregulation with the gravity model of

investment, we capture variation in the likelihood that different BHCs within a state acquire

BHCs in another state.




to buy its banks. Since no states reciprocated until 1982, this deregulation process was in fact stalled until 1982,
when Alaska and New York passed laws similar to Maine’s.

                                                           18
      Operationally, we construct the instrumental variable for Overlap in the following manner,

and use a similar procedure for constructing the instruments for Correlation Coefficient and

Cosine Distance. First, for each completed deal, we identify all states that the acquiring BHC can

legally enter in the year when the deal was announced. We call these “accessible states.” Second,

we find each accessible state’s accessible states and calculate the degree of overlap between the

acquirer’s accessible states and each of the states that those accessible states can enter based on

interstate bank regulations. For example, if the acquirer’s state i can access five states when the

acquisition is announced—states j, k, l, m, and n, we compute (a) the overlap between the states

that BHCs headquartered in state i can access and the states that BHCs headquartered in state j

can enter, (b) the overlap between the states that BHCs headquartered in state i can access and

the states that BHCs headquartered in state k can enter, etc. This yields five overlap values, one

for each of the acquirer’s accessible states. Third, we divide each of these overlap values by the

geographic distance between the acquirer’s headquarters and the most populated city of the

acquirer’s corresponding accessible state. Continuing the example from above, for each

acquiring BHC that is headquartered in state i and announces the acquisition of a target BHC

during period t, we compute five overlap values weighted by distance to states j, k, l, m, and n.

Then, we sum these distance weighted overlap values for each acquiring BHC and use this as the

instrumental variable for network overlap. The instrument reflects both the dynamic, state-

specific process of interstate bank deregulation and the differences in the geographic location of

each BHC’s headquarters.

      For this deregulation-gravity instrumental variable to be a valid instrument, it must both

satisfy the exclusion restriction, i.e., the deregulation-gravity instrument must explain CARs only

through its effect on pre-announcement network overlap, and explain differences in actual

network overlap. With respect to the exclusion restriction, the instrument is based on integrating

two plausibly exogenous sources of variation in the network overlap of acquiring and target

BHCs. Interstate bank deregulation occurred over two decades in which states started the process

of interstate bank deregulation in different years and followed different dynamic paths as they
                                                19
liberalized restrictions with different states in different years. Moreover, we differentiate among

BHCs within a state and year by the differential distance between each BHC and the state’s

accessible states. Since our instrument is constructed from the interaction between the overlap of

a state’s accessible states with those states’ accessible states and the differential distance of each

BHC to those accessible states, we argue that our instrument satisfies the exclusion restriction.

      With respect to the power of the instrument, the first stage regressions are revealing. We

report these regressions in Panel B of Table 5. As shown, the instrument variable enters

positively and significantly when the dependent variable is the actual pre-acquisition network

overlap. Moreover, the F-values on the null hypotheses that the instrument does not explain

actual overlap is 10, suggesting that we do not have a weak instrument problem (Stock and

Watson 2007).



4.3. Instrument variable results

      Using these gravity-deregulation instrumental variables, Table 5 presents the results of our

assessment of the impact of network overlap on post-deal CARs. We examine three measures of

network overlap, Overlap, Correlation Coefficient, and Cosine Distance, while using distinct

instrumental variables for each of these measures. Standard errors are clustered at acquirer BHC

level. As noted earlier, all of the results hold when clustering at the acquirer state level. The

regressions include acquirer and deal characteristics, as well as year (the year of the

announcement) and acquirer state fixed effects.

      As shown, the instrumental variable results indicate that pre-acquisition overlap exerts a

statistically significant, robust, and economically large impact on acquirer, target, and combined

CARs. Overlap, Correlation Coefficient, and Cosine Distance enter the Acquirer CAR, Target

CAR, and Combined CAR significantly at the five-percent level in all specifications. Thus, the

results are robust to using alternative measures of the pre-announcement overlap of subsidiary

networks. The estimated impact of geographic overlap on stock returns is large. For example, the

coefficient estimates indicate that a one standard deviation increase in Correlation Coefficient
                                                  20
induces a 5.13% (=12.32*0.416) larger boost in acquirer CARs during the 5-day event window

of the announcement. This estimated effect is almost ten times larger than the estimates from the

OLS regressions in Table 4. The much larger estimates from the instrumental variables

regressions are consistent with the view that BHCs that poorly governed banks are more likely to

expand into geographical dispersed areas and the market views this as a signal of the quality of

BHC governance. This effect can bias the OLS estimates toward zero. After addressing this bias

through the use of the gravity-deregulation instrumental variable, we obtain larger estimates of

the impact of network overlap on CARs, as reported in Table 5. These findings advertise the

importance of using instrumental variables to address identification concerns and thereby obtain

sharper estimates of the impact of network overlap on the stock price reaction to the

announcement of BHC mergers.


5. Sources of Synergy
      In this section, we examine several potential sources of the synergies between acquirer

and target BHCs. We do this by examining post-merger changes at target BHCs. In particular, if

network overlap offers opportunities to review management and replace inefficient executives,

then we should observe a higher rate of replacement of executives in targets after the acquisition

than before. If network overlap allows banks to economize on labor costs, then we should

observe cuts in staff and total salary expenditures at target BHCs following an acquisition. If

network overlap boosts overall efficiency and governance, then we should observe increases in

net interest margins and reductions in insider lending and loan charge-offs at targets. We

evaluate these changes at target BHCs during the year following the announcement. Typically, it

is impossible to examine post-merger changes in target firms because the target firm’s balance

sheet is consolidated into the combined firms. However, The Chicago Fed’s BHC data includes

data on a subset of target BHCs following mergers, which we use to examine post-merger

changes at target BHCs.



                                               21
5.1 Replacement of directors and executives in target BHCs

      We begin by assessing whether a higher percentage of target BHCs board members and

executives are replaced during the year after an acquisition when the BHCs have a greater degree

of pre-deal network overlap. We do this by merging data on the SDC on deals with data on

directors and executives in BoardEx. For each deal, we find the target BHC’s list of directors and

executives one year before the merger announcement. We then check whether these directors and

executives work for the target one year after the merger. If they are not working at the target

BHC, we check if they are board members or executives at the acquiring BHC. If the directors

and executives of the target before the merger work at the acquiring BHC after the merger, then

we do not consider them “replaced.” In this way, we measure whether each director and

executive in the target BHC is replaced after the merger. We calculate the percentages of target

board directors and executives that are replaced and use that percentage as the dependent

variable in our regressions.

      In particular, we estimate the following Tobit regression:


𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑑 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑑 + 𝛽2 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑑 + 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐹𝐹𝑑 + 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌 𝐹𝐹𝑑 + 𝜀𝑑
                                                                                                (3)

where the unit of analyses is a deal (d), 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑑 is either the percentage of directors or executives

at the target BHC who are replaced during the year following deal d’s announcement,

𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑑 is one of three measures of pre-acquisition network overlap (Overlap,

Correlation Coefficient, or Cosine Distance), and 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑑 are detailed features of each deal

defined above. The regression also controls for target state and year fixed effects. We use a Tobit

regression because the dependent variables are always nonnegative, though the results hold when

using OLS. Standard errors are clustered at the target BHC level for the reasons discussed above.

      As shown in Table 6, the degree of pre-deal network overlap is positively and significantly

associated with the post-deal replacement of board members and executives at the target BHC. In

particular, whether examining Overlap, Correlation Coefficient, or Cosine Distance, we find that

                                                22
these proxies of pre-acquisition network overlap enter statistically significantly at the five

percent level in the Tobit regressions, where the dependent variables are either the percentage of

directors (columns 1-3) or executives (columns 4-6) who are replaced following acquisitions. 6

Moreover, the estimated relationship is economically significant. As reported in columns (2) and

(5), a one standard deviation larger Correlation Coefficient is associated with an 8.21% and

6.72% greater reduction in target directors and executives, respectively. Though only suggestive,

these results are consistent with the view that greater network overlap offers enhanced

opportunities for acquiring BHCs to effective review and replace directors and executives at

targets.



5.2 Employee layoff and cost of total salary payment

       One mechanism through which network overlap could boost valuations is by providing the

combined BHC greater opportunities to eliminate redundancies and reduce costs. Thus, we next

evaluate the relationship between network overlap and changes in the total salary expenditures,

average salary expenditures, and number of employees at target BHCs following an acquisition.

To conduct this examination, we use deal level data on target BHCs, tracing the evolution of

compensation and staff from 12 quarters before until 12 quarters after the announcement. We

estimate the following equation:


∆𝑙𝑙(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷)𝑑 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑑 + 𝛽2 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑑 +

                                                             +𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐹𝐹𝑑 + 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌 𝐹𝐹𝑑 + 𝜀𝑑 ,               (4)


where the dependent variable, ∆𝑙𝑙(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷)𝑑 , is the natural logarithm of the target BHC’s total

salary (Panel A, columns 1-6), average salary (Panel B, columns 7-12), or number of employees

(Panel C, columns 13-18) for deal d averaged over the 12 quarters after the merger


6
 The results hold when examining the percentage of directors or executives at the target BHC who are replaced
during the period from one year before the merger (instead of using the year of the merger) until one year after
the merger.

The main independent variable of interest, 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑑 is one of three measures of pre-

acquisition network overlap (Overlap, Correlation Coefficient, or Cosine Distance), and

𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑑 are the detailed features of each deal defined above. The regression also controls for

target state and year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at target BHC level.

      Consistent with the view that pre-deal network overall facilitates post-deal cost cutting in

the target, Table 7 shows that total salary expenditures and the number of employees at target

BHCs fall more when there is greater pre-acquisition network overlap. There is no cut in the

average salary of employees at targets. Rather, the cut in total salary is accounted for by the

reduction in the number of employees.



5.3 Loan quality and net interest margin
       To the extent that mergers involving BHCs with widely dispersed subsidiaries create a
combined BHC that is more difficult to govern than mergers between BHCs with dense network
overlap, the resultant differences in governance could generate differences in insider lending and
the quality of loans. Furthermore, to the extent that more pre-deal network creates more post-deal
market power, network overlap could boost valuations through this market power channel, too.
Thus, we next examine the relation between pre-deal network overlap and measures of post deal
insider lending, loan quality, and efficiency. Specifically, using the same econometric
specification as in Table 7, we assess the relation between network overlap and (1) post-merger
lending to corporate insiders at the target BHC (Insider Loans/Total Loans), (2) the proportion of
loan charge-offs to total loans at the target BHC (Net Charge-offs/Total Loans), and (3) the net
interest margin of the target (Net Interest Margin). For each of these three dependent variables,
we examine three measures of network overlap: Overlap, Correlation Coefficient, and Cosine
Distance. The results are robust to using the additional measures of the geographic overlap of
networks discussed above.

      As reported in Table 8, greater pre-deal network overlap is associated with a drop in

Insider Loans/Total Loans, a reduction in Net Charge-offs/Total Loans, and an increase in Net

                                                 24
Interest Margin. The rise in net interest margins is consistent with the view that pre-deal network

overlap creates more most-deal market power.


6. Conclusion
      Does the geographic overlap of the subsidiaries and branches of two BHCs influence the

likelihood that they merge and post-merger value creation and synergies? To address these

questions, we compiled comprehensive data on U.S. bank acquisitions over the period from 1986

through 2014, constructed an array of measures of pre-deal network overlap, and designed and

implemented a new identification strategy for assessing the impact of pre-deal network overlap

on the acquirer, target, and combined CARs. Moreover, to shed empirical light on the potential

synergies underlying stock price reactions, we examined how pre-deal networks influence the

replacement of directors and executives at target BHCs, cost reductions through staff cuts at

targets, and improvements in loan quality and interest margins at target BHCs.

      Our two main findings are that (1) pre-deal network overlap is positively associated with

the likelihood that two BHCs merge, (2) network overlap materially boosts the cumulative

abnormal returns of the acquirer, target, and combined banks, i.e., pre-deal overlap boosts post-

deal value creation, and greater pre-deal network overlap materially boosts the CARs of the

acquirer, target, and merged BHC during the five-day event window around the announcement

of the deal. The estimated economic magnitudes are large. The results indicate that a one

standard deviation in network overlap increases acquirer CARs by almost 5%.

      With respect to synergies, we discover that pre-acquisition network overlap is associated

with (1) acquiring BHCs replacing a higher proportion of directors and executives at target

BHCs, (2) greater cuts in the number of employees and the total salary bill at target BHCs, and

(3) larger reductions in insider lending and net charge-offs at targets, and (4) bigger increases in

net interest margins at target BHCs. The results are consistent with the view that bank mergers

with greater network overlap offer expanded opportunities for both cost cutting and revenue

generation.

                                  Table 3: The Geographic Overlap of BHC Subsidiaries and the Probability of Merging

This table reports Probit regression results of the relation between the probability that two BHCs merge and the degree to which the two BHCs have
subsidiary networks that overlap geographically. The regression sample includes data on actual deals and pseudo matched deals, where the pseudo
deals include both (a) pseudo matched deals of the actual acquirer with targets of similar total assets (model 1-3) or similar market-to-book ratio
(model 4-6) to that of the actual target and (b) pseudo matched deals of the actual target with acquirers of similar total assets (model 1-3) or similar
market-to-book ratio (model 4-6) to that of the actual acquirer. The dependent variable is a dummy variable that equals one for actual deals and zero
for the pseudo deals. The table reports the estimated marginal effects of three measures of the geographic overlap of BHC subsidiaries: Overlap,
Correlation Coefficient, and Cosine Distance, which are defined in Table 1. The regressions control for Acquirer total assets, Target total assets,
Acquirer profitability, Target profitability, Acquirer equity ratio, and Target equity ratio, as defined in Table 1. The regressions also include a Deal
dummy, which equals one for the actual deal and zero for pseudo-matched deals. Standard errors are clustered at the deal level. Robust z-statistics are
in parentheses. *, **, *** indicate significance at 1%, 5% and 10%.

                                   Table 4: The Geographic Overlap of BHC Subsidiaries and CARs: OLS Results

This table presents OLS regressions of the relation between the CARs of acquirer, target, and combined BHCs and the degree to which the two BHCs
have subsidiary networks that overlap geographically. The dependent variable is either the 5-day CAR (-2, +2) of the acquirer, target, or combined
BHC around the announcement date of the deal (i.e., Acquirer CAR (-2, +2), Target CAR (-2, +2), and Combined CAR (-2, +2). The table reports the
estimated coefficients on three measures of the geographic overlap of BHC subsidiaries: Overlap, Correlation Coefficient, and Cosine Distance,
which are defined in Table 1. The table also controls for an array of acquirer, target, and deal characteristics, where Table 1 provides definitions of

This table presents instrument variable regressions of the relation between the CARs of acquirer, target, and combined BHCs and the degree to which the two
BHCs have subsidiary networks that overlap geographically. Panel A provides the second-stage results, where the dependent variable is either the 5-day CAR (-2,
+2) of the acquirer, target, or combined BHC around the announcement date of the deal (i.e., Acquirer CAR (-2, +2), Target CAR (-2, +2), and Combined CAR (-2,
+2). The table reports the estimated coefficients on three measures of the geographic overlap of BHC subsidiaries: Overlap, Correlation Coefficient, and Cosine
Distance, which are defined in Table 1. The regressions control for an array of acquirer, target, and deal characteristics, where Table 1 provides definitions of each
of these regressors. In addition, we control for the year of the announcement and acquirer state fixed effects. Panel B provides the first-stage results. The
instrumental variable for the geographic overlap measures are the gravity-deregulation instrument defined in the text. Standard errors are clustered at the acquirer
bank level. Heteroskedasticity robust t-statistics are reported in parentheses, and *, **, *** indicate significance at 1%, 5% and 10%.

                   Table 6: The Geographic Overlap of BHC Subsidiaries and the Replacement of Target Directors and Executives

This table presents Tobit regressions of the relations between rate of replace of directors and executives at target banks and the degree to which the
two BHCs have subsidiary networks that overlap geographically. The table provides results on two dependent variables: The percentages of the target
BHCs (1) board directors and (2) executives replaced during the year following the acquisition. The table reports the estimated coefficients on three
measures of the geographic overlap of BHC subsidiaries: Overlap, Correlation Coefficient, and Cosine Distance, which are defined in Table 1. The
table also controls for deal characteristics (Deal controls), i.e., Acquirer Runup, Deal size adjusted by assets, Cash deal dummy, Stock deal dummy,
Attitude dummy, Target public dummy, and Percentage of shared acquired, which are defined in Table 1. The regressions also control for target state
and year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the target BHC level. Heteroskedasticity robust t-statistics are reported in parentheses, and *,
**, *** indicate significance at 1%, 5% and 10%.

This table presents OLS regressions of the relations between salary and number of employees at target banks and the degree to which the two BHCs
have subsidiary networks that overlap geographically. Across three panels, the table provides results on three dependent variables: The change in the
natural logarithm of the target BHC’s (1) total salary (Panel A), (2) average salary (Panel B), and (3) number of employees (Panel C) over the period
from 12 quarter before the announcement of the merger until 12 quarters after the announcement. The table reports the estimated coefficients on three
measures of the geographic overlap of BHC subsidiaries: Overlap, Correlation Coefficient, and Cosine Distance, which are defined in Table 1. The
table also controls for deal characteristics (Deal controls), i.e., Acquirer Runup, Deal size adjusted by assets, Cash deal dummy, Stock deal dummy,
Attitude dummy, Target public dummy, and Percentage of shared acquired, which are defined in Table 1. The regressions also control for target state

          Table 8: The Geographic Overlap of BHC Subsidiaries and Target BHC's Insider Lending, Charge-offs, and Net Interest Margins

This table presents OLS regressions of the relations between salary and number of employees at target banks and the degree to which the two BHCs
have subsidiary networks that overlap geographically. Across three panels, the table provides results on three dependent variables: Panel A: Post-
merger lending to corporate insiders at the target BHC (Insider Loans/Total Loans); Panel B: Proportion of loan charge-offs to total loans at the target
BHC (Net Charge-offs/Total Loans); and Panel C: Net interest margin of the target (Net Interest Margin). The table reports the estimated
coefficients on three measures of the geographic overlap of BHC subsidiaries: Overlap, Correlation Coefficient, and Cosine Distance. The table also
controls for deal characteristics (Deal controls), i.e., Acquirer Runup, Deal size adjusted by assets, Cash deal dummy, Stock deal dummy, Attitude
dummy, Target public dummy, and Percentage of shared acquired. Table 1 provides variable definitions. The regressions also control for target state
and year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the target BHC level. Heteroskedasticity robust t-statistics are reported in parentheses, and *,
**, *** indicate significance at 1%, 5% and 10%.

                              Table A.2: The Geographic Overlap of BHC Subsidiaries and the Probability of Merging: Robustness Test

This table reports Probit regression results of the relation between the probability that two BHCs merge and the degree to which the two BHCs have subsidiary
networks that overlap geographically. The regression sample includes data on actual deals and pseudo matched deals, where the pseudo deals include both (a)
pseudo matched deals of the actual acquirer with targets of similar total assets (Panel A, B, C) or similar market-to-book ratio (Panel D, E, F) to that of the actual
target and (b) pseudo matched deals of the actual target with acquirers of similar total assets (Panel A, B, C) or similar market-to-book ratio (Panel D, E, F) to that
of the actual acquirer. The dependent variable is a dummy variable that equals one for actual deals and zero for the pseudo deals. The table reports the estimated
marginal effects of measures of the geographic overlap of BHC subsidiaries, which are defined in Table 1. As indicated, the regressions include different
combinations of control variables: Acquirer total assets, Target total assets, Acquirer profitability, Target profitability, Acquirer equity ratio, and Target equity
ratio, as defined in Table 1. The regressions also include a Deal dummy, which equals one for the actual deal and zero for pseudo-matched deals. Standard errors
are clustered at the deal level. Robust z-statistics are in parentheses. *, **, *** indicate significance at 1%, 5% and 10%.

                       Table A.3: The Geographic Overlap of BHC Subsidiaries and the Probability of Merging: MSA Overlap

This table reports Probit regression results of the relation between the probability that two BHCs merge and the degree to which the two BHCs have
subsidiary networks that overlap geographically. The regression sample includes data on actual deals and pseudo matched deals, where the pseudo
deals include both (a) pseudo matched deals of the actual acquirer with targets of similar sizes to that of the actual target and (b) pseudo matched
deals of the actual target with acquirers of similar sizes to that of the actual acquirer. The dependent variable is a dummy variable that equals one for
actual deals and zero for the pseudo deals. The table reports the estimated marginal effects of measures of the geographic overlap of BHC subsidiaries
computed at the MSA-level. As indicated, the regressions include different combinations of control variables: Acquirer total assets, Target total
assets, Acquirer profitability, Target profitability, Acquirer equity ratio, and Target equity ratio, as defined in Table 1. The regressions also include a
Deal dummy, which equals one for the actual deal and zero for pseudo-matched deals. Standard errors are clustered at the deal level. Robust z-
statistics are in parentheses. *, **, *** indicate significance at 1%, 5% and 10%.

                                   Table A.4: The Geographic Overlap of BHC Branches and the Probability of Merging

This table reports Probit regression results of the relation between the probability that two BHCs merge and the degree to which the two BHCs have
branch networks that overlap geographically. The regression sample includes data on actual deals and pseudo matched deals, where the pseudo deals
include both (a) pseudo matched deals of the actual acquirer with targets of similar sizes to that of the actual target and (b) pseudo matched deals of
the actual target with acquirers of similar sizes to that of the actual acquirer. The dependent variable is a dummy variable that equals one for actual
deals and zero for the pseudo deals. The table reports the estimated marginal effects of seven measures of the geographic overlap of BHC subsidiaries
that are defined in Table 1. The regressions control for Acquirer total assets, Target total assets, Acquirer profitability, Target profitability, Acquirer
equity ratio, and Target equity ratio, as defined in Table 1. The regressions also include a Deal dummy, which equals one for the actual deal and zero
for pseudo-matched deals. Standard errors are clustered at the deal level. Robust z-statistics are in parentheses. *, **, *** indicate significance at 1%,
5% and 10%.

                             Table A.5: The Geographic Overlap of BHC Subsidiaries and Acquirer CARs: Robustness Tests

This table presents OLS regressions of the relation between the CARs of acquirer BHCs and the degree to which the two BHCs have subsidiary
networks that overlap geographically. The dependent variable is the 5-day CAR (-2, +2) of the acquiring BHC. The table reports the estimated
coefficients on several measures of the geographic overlap of BHC subsidiaries, which are defined in Table 1. The table also controls for an array of
acquirer, target, and deal characteristics, where Table 1 provides definitions of each of these regressors. In addition, we control for the year of the
announcement and acquirer state fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at acquirer bank level. Heteroskedasticity robust t-statistics are reported
in parentheses, and *, **, *** indicate significance at 1%, 5% and 10%.

                              Table A.6 The Geographic Overlap of BHC Subsidiaries and Target CARs: Robustness Tests

This table presents OLS regressions of the relation between the CARs of target BHCs and the degree to which the two BHCs have subsidiary
networks that overlap geographically. The dependent variable is the 5-day CAR (-2, +2) of the target BHC. The table reports the estimated
coefficients on several measures of the geographic overlap of BHC subsidiaries, which are defined in Table 1. The table also controls for an array of
acquirer, target, and deal characteristics, where Table 1 provides definitions of each of these regressors. In addition, we control for the year of the
announcement and acquirer state fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at acquirer bank level. Heteroskedasticity robust t-statistics are reported
in parentheses, and *, **, *** indicate significance at 1%, 5% and 10%.

                           Table A.7 The Geographic Overlap of BHC Subsidiaries and Combined CARs: Robustness Tests

This table presents OLS regressions of the relation between the CARs of combined BHCs and the degree to which the two BHCs have subsidiary
networks that overlap geographically. The dependent variable is the 5-day CAR (-2, +2) of the combined BHC. The table reports the estimated
coefficients on several measures of the geographic overlap of BHC subsidiaries, which are defined in Table 1. The table also controls for an array of
acquirer, target, and deal characteristics, where Table 1 provides definitions of each of these regressors. In addition, we control for the year of the
announcement and acquirer state fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at acquirer bank level. Heteroskedasticity robust t-statistics are reported
in parentheses, and *, **, *** indicate significance at 1%, 5% and 10%.

This table presents OLS regressions of the relation between the CARs of target BHCs and the degree to which
the two BHCs have branches networks that overlap geographically. The dependent variable is the 5-day CAR
(-2, +2) of the target BHC. The table reports the estimated coefficients on several measures of the geographic
overlap of BHC branches, which are defined in Table 1. The table also controls for an array of acquirer, target,
and deal characteristics, where Table 1 provides definitions of each of these regressors. In addition, we control
for the year of the announcement and acquirer state fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at acquirer bank
level. Heteroskedasticity robust t-statistics are reported in parentheses, and *, **, *** indicate significance at

This table presents OLS regressions of the relation between the CARs of acquirer, target, and combined BHCs
and the degree to which the two BHCs have subsidiary networks that overlap geographically, where overlap is
computed at the MSA level. The dependent variable is either the 5-day CAR (-2, +2) of the acquirer, target, or
combined BHC around the announcement date of the deal (i.e., Acquirer CAR (-2, +2), Target CAR (-2, +2),
and Combined CAR (-2, +2). The table reports the estimated coefficients on three measures of the geographic
overlap of BHC subsidiaries: Overlap, Correlation Coefficient, and Cosine Distance, which are defined in
Table 1. The table also controls for an array of acquirer, target, and deal characteristics, where Table 1
provides definitions of each of these regressors. In addition, we control for the year of the announcement and
acquirer state fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at acquirer bank level. Heteroskedasticity robust t-
statistics are reported in parentheses, and *, **, *** indicate significance at 1%, 5% and 10%.

             Table A.12 The Geographic Overlap of Subsidiaries and CARs: Excluding Big Banks

This table presents OLS regressions of the relation between the CARs of acquirer, target, and combined BHCs
and the degree to which the two BHCs have subsidiary networks that overlap geographically. The sample
excludes BHCs with assets that are larger than 10% of the headquarter state’s total bank assets. The dependent
variable is either the 5-day CAR (-2, +2) of the acquirer, target, or combined BHC around the announcement
date of the deal (i.e., Acquirer CAR (-2, +2), Target CAR (-2, +2), and Combined CAR (-2, +2). The table
reports the estimated coefficients on five measures of the geographic overlap of BHC subsidiaries, which are
defined in Table 1. The table also controls for an array of acquirer, target, and deal characteristics, where Table
1 provides definitions of each of these regressors. In addition, we control for the year of the announcement and
acquirer state fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at acquirer bank level. Heteroskedasticity robust t-
statistics are reported in parentheses, and *, **, *** indicate significance at 1%, 5% and 10%.
