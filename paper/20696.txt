                                              ABSTRACT

Charities often circulate widespread donation appeals to garner support for campaigns, but what impact
do these campaigns have on the well-being of individuals who choose to donate, those who choose
not to donate, and the entire group exposed to the campaign? Here we investigate these questions by
exploring the changes in affect reported by individuals who donate in response to a charitable request
and those who do not. We also look at the change in affect reported by the entire sample to measure
the net impact of the donation request. Results reveal that large donors experience hedonic boosts
from their charitable actions, and the substantial fraction of large donors translates to a net positive
influence on the well-being of the entire sample. Thus, under certain conditions, donation opportunities
can enable people to help others while also increasing the overall well-being of the population of potential
donors.

       Societies often value generous action among citizens and support various forms of

prosocial behavior, such as unpaid volunteer work and monetary donations. However, because

charities frequently rely on contributions motivated by donor interest, people are commonly

bombarded with charitable requests as many organizations hope that their initiative will generate

support. But what are the emotional consequences, for both donors and non-donors receiving an

invitation to contribute? Here we explore how the presentation of a donation request influences

the well-being of both donors and non-donors.

       A large literature has explored what factors lead people to give (e.g., Batson, Duncan,

Ackerman, Buckley & Birtch, 1981; Benabou & Tirole, 2006; Cialdini, Brown, Lewis, Luce &

Neuberg, 1997; Clary & Snyder, 1991; Hamilton, 1963; Nowak & Sigmund, 1998; Piff, Krause,

Cote, Cheng & Keltner, 2010; Trivers, 1971), but only recently have researchers started to

examine the emotional impact of giving. Indeed, this growing body of research has demonstrated

that people are not only willing to offer aid to others, a tendency that begins early in life

(Eisenberg & Mussen, 1989; Warneken & Tomasello, 2006), but that giving to others is

emotionally rewarding. Correlational research suggests that people who engage in generous

behavior – by way of giving either their time or money to others – are happier and healthier (e.g.,

Borgonovi, 2008; Brown et al., 2003; Helliwell & Wang, 2013; Konrath, Fuhrel,-Forbis, Lou &

Brown, 2012; Thoits & Hewitt, 2001). For instance, individuals around the world who report

donating money to charity in the last month also report higher levels of life satisfaction than

those who report not donating at all (Aknin et al., 2013). Moreover, the link between giving and

well-being is causal; several experiments demonstrate that giving to others leads to larger

emotional rewards than giving to oneself (Aknin et al., 2013; Aknin, Hamlin & Dunn, 2012;




                                                  1
Dunn, Aknin & Norton, 2008, 2014; Gray, 2010; Weinstein & Ryan, 2010). Thus, giving to

others yields emotional rewards for the giver.

       Donation opportunities may therefore be beneficial for donors who reap the benefits of

generosity outlined above, but what is the overall emotional impact of a donation opportunity on

the whole range of subjects, including people who decide not to give (non-donors) or those who

choose to give very little (low-donors)? Past research suggests that non-donors and low-donors

fare worse than donors. Indeed, just as people engaging in prosocial behavior typically

experience positive outcomes, people engaging in little or no prosocial action tend to experience

relatively fewer benefits. For instance, examining mortality rates in large sample of older adults,

Konrath and colleagues (2012) found that individuals who reported engaging in no volunteer

work or low levels of volunteer work in the past decade had a higher level of mortality risk than

highly active volunteers. Focusing specifically on the emotional consequences of donations,

Dunn and colleagues (2010) detected a positive relationship between the amount of money

students donated to a classmate and the donor’s well-being; students offering less money

reported lower levels of positive affect and higher levels of negative affect. Finally, some

research has examined how non-helpers – defined in past research as individuals who were not

asked to provide assistance to someone in need – compare to helpers on various well-being

measures. Weinstein and Ryan (2010) found that participants not given the opportunity to help

another participant reported lower levels of well-being than participants allowed to help, but only

when assistance was initiated by the helper. Similarly, Williamson and Clark (1989) reported

that participants not allowed to help a confederate experienced lower levels of well-being than

participants asked and allowed to help. Thus, individuals for whom the opportunity to help is

withheld tend to report lower well-being than individuals for whom help is requested and



                                                 2
permitted. Interestingly, however, past research has not measured whether non-donors and low-

donors are worse off (i.e. experience lower well-being) as a result of declining a donation

opportunity. As such, it remains unknown whether individuals who choose to forgo an

opportunity to act generously experience negative emotional consequences, thereby offsetting, at

least in part, the overall positive emotional consequences of donation requests.

       Given that widespread charitable appeals often request involvement from many members

of a population, how do the differential outcomes for high, low, and non-donors influence well-

being of the full sample? To the best of our knowledge, this question has not yet been examined.

Here, we provide a first look among a sample of undergraduate students provided with the

opportunity to donate as much or as little of their study earnings to charity as they like. Because

all participants were presented with the same donation request and reported their well-being

before and after the donation, we are able to investigate how high, low, and non-donors respond

emotionally –individually and as a larger collective – to being offered a chance to donate. Our

four key hypotheses were as follows:

       Hypothesis 1: Consistent with past research demonstrating that human prosocial

   tendencies emerge early in life and are visible across a wide variety of contexts, we predicted

   that the majority of participants would give a large portion (defined here as more than 50% of

   their earnings) when presented with the opportunity to donate to charity.

       Hypothesis 2: Consistent with past research demonstrating that larger donations predict

   greater emotional rewards than smaller donations (e.g., Dunn et al., 2010), we predicted that

   high donors (people offering more than 50% of their earnings to charity) would experience

   larger emotional benefits as a result of their donation than low or non-donors (people offering

   less than 50% of their earnings to charity).



                                                  3
       Hypothesis 3: We predicted that people offered the opportunity to give but who choose

   not to do so (non-donors) or only offer a little (low-donors) may experience a reduction in

   well-being, including a decrease in positive affect and increase in negative affect. To the best

   of our knowledge, this hypothesis has not been tested in previous research.

       Hypothesis 4: Since there is no previous research assessing the aggregate net emotional

   consequences for donors and non-donors, it was not clear what to expect. However, because

   aggregate cross-national evidence demonstrates that life evaluations are higher in countries

   where generosity is more prevalent (Aknin et al 2013; Helliwell & Wang 2013), and these

   samples include both donors and non-donors, we hypothesized that among our sample with a

   high prevalence of donations (H1) that presenting participants with an opportunity to donate

   would have a positive net impact on the well-being of the entire sample, despite the

   emotional costs potentially incurred by non-donors and low donors (H3).

       If the presentation of a charitable appeal does not lead to negative consequences for non-

donors and low-donors as predicted by Hypothesis 3, but there are gains for large donors, then

offering people the opportunity to give may provide an unalloyed good. However, if non-donors

and low-donors do experience negative well-being consequences when forgoing the opportunity

to donate, as Hypothesis 3 suggests, then the overall emotional consequences of the donation

opportunity will require finding an appropriate way of measuring and comparing the gains of the

donors against the emotional losses of the low-donors and non-donors.

                                             Methods

Participants

       Two hundred and eighty-seven students (Mage = 19.75, SD = 2.90, 64% female) at Simon

Fraser University participated in this study in exchange for course credit. Five additional



                                                 4
participants completed the experiment but withdrew their consent upon completion; their data are

not reported.

Procedure

       Initial questionnaire. Participants registered for the study independently but were tested

in pairs. When entering the lab, participants were asked to independently complete an initial

questionnaire assessing their baseline emotion on the Positive and Negative Affect Scale

(PANAS; Watson, Clark & Tellegen, 1989); this measure requires respondents to rate the extent

to which they feel 10 positive and 10 negative affect emotions at the moment using a 5 point

likert scale (1-very little or not at all, 5- extremely). In line with previous research (Aknin, Dunn,

Whillans, Grant & Norton, 2012), the word “happy” was added to the PANAS because this

emotion was of particular interest.

       First die roll and second questionnaire. After participants completed the initial

questionnaire, the research assistant told participants that they would have the chance to roll a

six-sided die for a monetary payoff. Pairs of participants were randomly assigned to either a team

or self condition. Participants in the self condition were told that each player would have the

chance to roll the die. If the participant rolled a value of 1-3 they would earn $3 cash and if the

participant rolled a value of 4-6 they would earn $6. Meanwhile, participants in the team

condition were told that each player would have a chance to roll the die and if they, together as a

team, rolled values that summed between 2-6, the team would earn $6 cash to split equally. If the

numbers summed to a value between 8-12, the team would earn $12 to split equally. And if the

team rolled values that summed to 7, both participants would roll again. If only one of the two

research participants came to the assigned time slot, the sole participant was given the chance to

roll the die with the “self” payoff scheme. The research assistant showed participants cash in a



                                                  5
money box to indicate that the earnings were real. Participants rolled the die and were paid

accordingly. Afterward, participants were asked to independently complete a second emotion

questionnaire assessing their current positive and negative affect on the same PANAS scale

(Watson et al., 1989).

       Second die roll and third questionnaire. Participants were then informed that they had the

option of rolling the die again for a monetary gain or loss. Specifically, participants in the self

condition were told that each player could decide to roll the die again and if they rolled a value

of 1-3 they would lose $2 cash. However, if the participant rolled a value of 4-6 they would earn

$3. Meanwhile, participants in the team condition were told that if they, together as a team,

decided to roll again and rolled values that summed between 2-6, the team would lose $4 cash.

However, if participants rolled numbers that summed to a value between 8-12, the team would

earn $6 to split equally. And if the team rolled values that summed to 7, both participants would

roll again. Participants made their decision, rolled the die, and earnings were adjusted

accordingly. To assess the impact of gains and losses on well-being, participants were asked to

complete a third emotion questionnaire assessing their current positive and negative affect on the

same PANAS scale (Watson et al., 1989). In addition, participants were asked to provide their

demographic information (e.g., age, gender, GPA, income).

       Donation opportunity and final questionnaire. The research assistant indicated that the

study was nearly complete and told participants that the lab was collecting money for Spread the

Net, a charity affiliated with the United Nations International Emergency Fund (UNICEF) that

purchases bed nets to stop the spread of malaria through Africa. The research assistant explained

that every ten dollars donated buys a bed net that could save a child. Therefore, if participants

wanted to support the charity, they could put a donation in a small envelope and put the envelope



                                                  6
in a box labeled “Spread the Net”. The research assistant then left the room to prepare the final

questionnaire; this ensured that participants could make their donation decision without pressure

from the researcher. Envelopes provided for donations were surreptitiously marked with each

participant’s unique identifier so that we could determine how much money, if any, each

participant donated to charity. When the research assistant returned, participants were asked to

complete a final emotion questionnaire, which allowed us to assess the impact of donation on

well-being.

                                                Results

Hypothesis 1: Earning and donation rates

       Participants earned an average of $4.25 (SD = 2.72) and donated an average of $2.80 (SD

= 2.43) to charity. A large proportion of participants (90.6%) gave some money to charity. We

calculated a “donation ratio” – dividing donation amount by earnings – and found that nearly

two-thirds (60.62%) of participants gave more than half of their money to charity, while a subset

of 11.1% of the full sample donated all or more of their earnings.

Hypotheses 2 &3: Change in affect for individual donors

    Given that slightly over half of our sample offered more than half of their earnings to

charity, we focused our analyses on the emotional consequences of donating large (>50%) and

small (<50%) earnings ratios to charity. Note that this means we have combined non-donors and

low-donors to increase our statistical power; this strategy is supported by the finding that non-

donors and low-donors provided similar emotional ratings on all well-being measures pre- and

post-donation (see Supplementary Materials).

   We focused on two particular positive emotions of specific interest (happiness and pride) as

well as overall positive and negative affect.



                                                  7
       Happiness. To examine the impact of large and small donation ratios on happiness we

first looked at change in self-reported levels of happiness from pre- to post- donation

questionnaires using paired samples t-tests. Analyses revealed that participants offering a small

proportion of their earnings (<50%) reported a non-statistically significant drop in happiness

(from M = 3.54, SD = 1.10 to M = 3.47, SD = .87), t(111) = .85, p = .40, while participants

offering a larger proportion of their earnings (>50%) reported a statistically significant increase

in happiness (from M = 3.37, SD = .99 to M = 3.74, SD = 1.00), t(170) = 5.81, p < .001 (see

Figure 1). Thus, although there were no happiness differences between high and low donation

groups before the donation opportunity, t(281) = 1.29, p = .200, participants who donated a

larger proportion of their earnings to charity were happier post-donation than were participants

who donated a smaller proportion of their earnings, t(285) = 2.33, p < .03.

       Pride. Similarly, to examine the impact of large and small donation ratios on pride we

looked at change in self-reported levels of pride from pre- to post- donation questionnaires using

paired samples t-tests. Analyses revealed that participants offering a small proportion of their

earnings (<50%) reported a non-statistically significant drop in pride (from M = 2.37, SD = 1.20

to M = 2.32, SD = 1.10), t(112) = .51, p = .61, while participants offering a larger proportion of

their earnings (>50%) reported a statistically significant increase in pride (from M = 2.52, SD =

1.13 to M = 3.08, SD = 1.28), t(171) = 6.94, p < .001 (see Figure 1). Thus, once again, although

there were no differences in pride between high and low donation groups before the donation

opportunity, t(283) = 1.04, p = .299, participants who donated a larger proportion of their

earnings to charity reported experiencing higher levels of pride post-donation than participants

who donated a smaller proportion of their earnings, t(285) = 5.19, p < .001




                                                 8
       Positive Affect. A paired samples t-test revealed that participants offering a small

proportion of their earnings (<50%) reported a statistically significant drop in positive affect

(from M = 2.71, SD = 1.02 to M = 2.42, SD = .81), t(108) = -5.22, p < .001, while participants

offering a larger proportion of their earnings (>50%) reported a statistically significant increase

in positive affect (from M = 2.74, SD = .79 to M = 2.83, SD = .84), t(168) = 2.46, p < .02 (see

Figure 1). High and low donation groups reported similar levels of positive affect before the

donation opportunity, t(279) = 2.99, p = .765, but participants who donated a larger proportion of

their earnings to charity reported higher levels of positive affect post-donation than participants

who donated a smaller proportion of their earnings, t(282) = 4.07, p < .001.

       Negative Affect. A paired samples t-test revealed that participants offering a small

proportion of their earnings (<50%) reported a non-statistically significant drop in negative affect

(from M = 1.25, SD = .34 to M = 1.21, SD = .33), t(110) = 1.53, p = .13, while participants

offering a larger proportion of their earnings (>50%) reported a statistically significant decrease

in negative affect (from M = 1.27, SD = .39 to M = 1.16, SD = .27), t(160) = 5.11, p < .001 (see

Figure 1). High and low donation groups reported similar levels of negative affect before the

donation opportunity, t(281) = .47, p = .637. Because both groups reported a decrease in negative

affect, participants donating a larger proportion of their earnings to charity did not report

statistically significant lower levels of negative affect post-donation than participants who

donated a smaller proportion of their earnings, t(273) = 1.30, p = .20.

Hypothesis 4: Change in affect across the full sample

       How did these emotional consequences influence the entire sample? To find out, we

examined the change in happiness, pride, positive affect, and negative affect from pre- to post-

donation across all participants. Analyses revealed a statistically significant increase in happiness



                                                  9
(from M = 3.44, SD = 1.03 to M = 3.63, SD = 0.96, t(282) = 3.79, p < .001), a statistically

significant increase in pride (from M = 2.46, SD = 1.16 to M = 2.78, SD = 1.27, t(284) = 4.74, p

< .001), a statistically significant drop in positive affect (from M = 2.73, SD = 0.89 to M = 2.67,

SD = 0.85, t(277) = 1.97, p < .05), and a statistically significant drop in negative affect (from M

= 1.27, SD = 0.37 to M = 1.18, SD = 0.30, t(271) = 4.89, p < .001; see Figure 1). These changes

in emotion reflect the generally positive consequences of offering the donation opportunity, with

large and strongly statistically significant increases in happiness and pride, and a corresponding

decrease in negative affect. However, it is worth investigating further why there is a small but

significant drop in full-sample positive affect despite the significant full-sample increases in

happiness and pride (and also “inspired”). This appears to happen because four of the PANAS

positive affect markers that reflect increasing fatigue as the experiment progresses – alertness,

attentiveness, excitement and determination – fall significantly over the second half of the

experiment. If these affect declines that take place between the third and fourth evaluations

(before and after the donation opportunity) are factored out of our calculations, then the

remaining sum of positive affect changes becomes significantly above zero for the sample as a

whole. We conclude that the donation opportunity resulted in an unambiguous improvement in

the average level of subjective well-being.

                                        General Discussion

       The findings reported here suggest that a single donation request can have net positive

influence on the well-being of an entire sample. While those who donate little or no money at all

in response to a charitable request experience some hedonic costs, such as a drop in positive

affect, those who chose to donate a substantial portion of their earnings to charity experience

large hedonic gains, seen here as an increase in happiness, pride, positive affect, and drop in



                                                 10
negative affect. Given that the majority of our sample donated a large proportion of their

earnings to charity and experienced emotional rewards, the overall impact of presenting a

donation request to the sample was positive.

       To what extent is the net positive impact of the donation opportunity dependent upon

having a majority of large donors? To answer this question, we used the changes in happiness

and pride reported in the results section to compute the smallest percentage of high donors that

would result in subjective well-being improvement for the full sample.1 Analyses reveal that a

the net change in happiness is estimated to be positive if 16% or more of the subjects donate

more than half of their earnings. The corresponding figure for the net change in pride is 9%.

Thus, while nearly two-thirds of the present sample donated over half of their earnings in

response to a donation request, fewer than one-sixth of the donors must do the same for the net

subjective well-being change to be positive if the magnitude of change matches that in our

experiments.

       These findings dovetail with a growing body of research documenting the emotional

rewards of generous actions. Indeed, while numerous studies have demonstrated that people

enacting kind deeds – using either their time or money in service of others – experience a boost

in well-being from doing so, the findings reported here indicate that the well-being benefits of

generosity are detectable across an entire sample including non-donors and low-donors as well.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first examination of a large-scale, net result of a

donation request. As such, these findings may provide helpful guidance when considering the

emotional consequences of wide-spread donation requests and opportunities.

       Our results may offer helpful insight for policy directed at increasing prosocial behavior

and citizen well-being. Specifically, our results suggest that presenting opportunities for



                                                 11
prosocial action are beneficial in that they offer citizens the opportunity to contribute to their

community or causes of interest and reap emotional rewards of doing so. While we focused on

monetary requests, it is possible that similar outcomes may occur in response to other charitable

campaigns, such as requests to assist with community clean-up initiatives or to volunteer at a

local homeless shelter. Thus, policy supporting prosocial campaigns might not only make

prosocial behavior more prevalent, but also foster greater well-being for citizens.

       While these initial results offer exciting possibilities for increasing prosocial and well-

being outcomes, caution should be exercised when extrapolating from this single, small-scale

investigation to the real world because this study has limitations. First, our sample consisted of

undergraduate students, a population that does not represent the large range of adults targeted by

donation requests. Although students may not reflect the demographics of the population, past

research has shown that students respond to donation requests in similar ways to nationally

representative adult samples (e.g., Aknin et al., 2013; Dunn et al., 2008), suggesting that our

convenience sample does not raise obvious concerns for generalizability. Second, participants

were asked to donate a small amount of money that they had just earned participating in the

study, not their hard earned cash. This may seem problematic to the extent that the emotional

consequences of donating may differ when people contribute their hard earned resources instead

of “house money”. While this presents an intriguing possibility, previous work has shown that

people take ownership of newly acquired resources quickly and value them accordingly. For

instance, classic research on the Endowment Effect indicates that moments after being given a

mug, new owners require double the original value to sell their item (Kahneman, Knetsch &

Thaler, 1990). Moreover, the emotional benefits of giving tend to be greater when giving

requires sacrificing one’s own personally costly resources than when giving an identical, non-

personally costly item; 22-month old toddlers in a giving experiment smiled significantly more

when sharing their own treats with a recipient than when giving an identical treat that did not

belong to them (Aknin et al., 2012). Thus, these findings suggest that the emotional rewards of

giving detected here may have underestimated the true effect. Finally, it is worth noting that

participants were asked to donate to charity with a clear positive impact on recipients. Given that

the emotional rewards of giving are greatest when donors are aware of how their donation

positively influences others (Aknin, Dunn, Whillans, Grant & Norton, 2013), the donation target

– and especially the transparency of the aid – may be of critical importance. Thus, future

research may wish to examine whether the observed findings replicate with various donation

targets.

           Moving to the bigger picture, any conclusion that expanding the opportunities for

generosity improves well-being needs to be able to make the connection between the short-term

emotional consequences we have found and some broader and more long-lasting measures of

well-being. We do not expect that short-term, small-scale experiments – like the one used here –

would increase life evaluations; indeed it is better for the plausibility of both measures that they

do not. Thus we find, as expected, that there is a small and non-significant increase in life

satisfaction among the high donors. What we need is some plausible link between this small-

scale experimentation and what might be happening in societies with very different patterns of

generosity. In earlier work, we combined lab experiments on the emotional benefits of giving

with large scale survey evidence showing a significant partial linkage between the national

prevalence of donations and average life evaluations (Aknin et al, 2013). This suggests that

sustained patterns of giving are associated with life evaluations that are on average higher, with

donors and non-donors both included in the sample. Further research is needed to clarify the



                                                  13
channels through which the positive emotions from sustained giving translate into higher life

evaluations, perhaps through the health and social connections channels proposed by Kok and

colleagues (2013).

       More broadly, large-scale implementations of donation opportunities require careful

consideration of unintended outcomes. For instance, past research on donor fatigue and moral

licensing (Monin & Miller, 2001) suggest that individuals respond generously to an initial

donation request but may abstain from subsequent opportunities to engage in prosocial behavior.

To the extent that multiple donation requests turn high-donors into low-donors or non-donors,

the emotional costs of each donation request increase, decreasing the net positive impact

experienced by the population. Of course, it is also possible that positive emotions could

promote subsequent prosocial action (Aknin, Norton & Dunn, 2010; Isen & Levin, 1972),

making repeat donations more likely. Thus future work should examine the long-term impact of

multiple donation requests. In addition, we did not have the statistical power to explore which

participants were the most likely to forgo the opportunity to donate to charity. Seeing as

individuals choosing not to donate bear the emotional costs of donation requests, it is worth

investigating whether these individuals represent a vulnerable population (e.g., low income

individuals) requiring further consideration of whether emotional costs should be preferentially

weighed.

       These considerations notwithstanding, this research presents a first look at how a single

donation request can influence the well-being of potential donors, both as individuals and as a

larger collective. Our findings suggest that a donation request can have net positive influence on

the well-being of the group targeted by a donation request. Although low-donors and non-donors

may experience hedonic costs, high donors experience larger hedonic gains. Given that the



                                                14
majority of people are large donors, the emotional benefits outweigh the emotional costs,

suggesting that donation requests provide an opportunity for people to help others and

experience a boost in well-being from doing so.
