                                                ABSTRACT

This paper presents a modeling framework that delivers joint forecasts of indicators of systemic real
risk and systemic financial risk, as well as stress-tests of these indicators as impulse responses to structural
shocks identified by standard macroeconomic and banking theory. This framework is implemented
using large sets of quarterly time series of indicators of financial and real activity for the G-7 economies
for the 1980Q1-2009Q3 period. We obtain two main results. First, there is evidence of out-of sample
forecasting power for tail risk realizations of real activity for several countries, suggesting the usefulness
of the model as a risk monitoring tool. Second, in all countries aggregate demand shocks are the main
drivers of the real cycle, and bank credit demand shocks are the main drivers of the bank lending cycle.
These results challenge the common wisdom that constraints in the aggregate supply of credit have
been a key driver of the sharp downturn in real activity experienced by the G-7 economies in 2008Q4-2009Q1.

                                      I. INTRODUCTION

       The recent financial crisis has underscored the need for a deeper understanding of the

key drivers of systemic financial risk and its two-way relationship with real activity. We

believe that to accomplish these goals, at least two requirements need to be met. First,

measures of systemic risk need to be associated with the potential for undesirable welfare

consequences, such as extreme adverse real effects. Second, the interplay between real and

financial activity needs to be assessed through the implications of some theoretical model,

and correspondingly quantified. Importantly, detecting macro-financial linkages through a

consistent and tractable framework may make it feasible to design risk monitoring tools

implementable in real time. Contributing to accomplishing these goals is the main objective

of this paper.


       We design a modeling framework that aims at tracking and quantifying the impact

and transmission of structurally identifiable shocks within/between the macroeconomy,

financial markets and intermediaries, as well as their “tail” realizations. In terms of Figure A

below, the proposed framework aims at identifying which sectors of the economy are most

affected by a shock at impact, to gauge size and persistence of shocks’ propagation within

and between sectors, and forecast their systemic real and financial outcomes.

         Ideally, a computable general equilibrium model specified at a suitable level of dis-

aggregation would allow us to identify the sources of shocks as well as the linkages through

which they are propagated. In practice, formulating and implementing such a model is a

formidable theoretical and computational task. At present, an increasing number of research

resources are devoted to develop macroeconomic models with meaningful interaction

between financial and real sectors. However, work in this direction is still in its infancy, since

work-horse Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models do not yet embed

essential financial structure or sectors, being their modeling of financial markets and

institutions highly stylized.1

 However, a rapidly growing literature, briefly reviewed by Walsh (2009), is exploring the implications of
specific financial frictions in the context of extensions of the “financial accelerator” model of Bernanke, Gertler
and Gilchrist (1999), with work by Christiano, Motto and Rostagno (2009) at the forefront of this effort.
                                                    4




        As a result, the available modeling technologies are still relatively underdeveloped.

Some models analyzing the impact of macroeconomic shocks on segments of the financial

sector have been developed recently in some central banks and international organizations.

Yet, the feedback effects of financial vulnerabilities on the macroeconomy has been usually

left unmodeled, since the output of these models is used mainly for financial supervisory

purposes.2

        Our modeling framework delivers joint forecasts of indicators of systemic real risk

and systemic financial risk , as well as stress-tests of these indicators as impulse responses to

structurally identifiable shocks. This framework is novel in two respects. First, it uses a

dynamic factor model with structural identification based on theory. This permits to extract

information on common sources of shocks contained in a large set of time series, and to

characterize their economic content. Second, it integrates the dynamic factor model with

quantile regressions techniques, which allow us to estimate and forecast the size of tail

realizations of systemic risks.

        We make a distinction between systemic real risk and systemic financial risk, based

on the notion that real effects is what concerns policymakers most since they are likely to

entail welfare consequences. Our systemic real risk indicator is GDP-at-Risk (GDPaR),

defined as the worst predicted realization of quarterly growth in real GDP at 5 percent

probability over a pre-determined forecasting horizon. Our indicator of systemic financial

risk (FSaR) is defined as the worst predicted realization of a system-wide financial risk

indicator at 5 percent probability over a pre-determined forecasting horizon.

       The underlying joint dynamics of GDP growth and the system-wide financial risk

indicator is modeled through a factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) model, following variants

of the methodology detailed in Stock and Watson (2002, 2005). Estimates of GDPaR and

FSaR indicators are obtained through quantile regressions.

       Forecasts of GDPaR and FSaR indicators are obtained by inputting the predicted

values of factors obtained from the companion factor-augmented VAR into the relevant

quantile regressions. Identification of structural shocks is accomplished with an expanded

version of the sign restriction methodology introduced by Canova and De Nicolò (2002),

where shocks are identified based on standard macroeconomic and banking theory. Stress-

tests of both systemic risk measures are obtained inputting impulse responses to shocks

identified in the FAVAR model into the relevant quantile regressions.

       We implement this framework using a large set of quarterly time series of financial

and real activity for the G-7 economies during the 1980Q1-2009Q3 period. We obtain two

main results. First, we find evidence of out-of sample forecasting power of the model for tail

risk realizations of real activity for several countries. This suggests the usefulness of the

model as a risk monitoring tool. Second, in all countries we identify aggregate demand

shocks as the main drivers of the real cycle, and bank credit demand shocks are the main

drivers of the bank lending cycle. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that shocks to

the real economy are the main drivers of both real and financial risks. Importantly, this

finding challenges the common wisdom that constraints in the aggregate supply of credit
                                               6




have been a key driver of the sharp downturn in real activity experienced by the G-7

economies in 2008Q4-2009Q1.

        The remainder of the paper is composed of four sections. Section II defines systemic

risks and describes indicators consistent with these definitions. Section III outlines the model

setup, estimation and forecasting, and the procedure used to identify structural shocks.

Section IV describes the implementation of the modeling framework on data for the G-7

countries and the relevant results. Section V concludes.



                                      II. SYSTEMIC RISKS


                                         A. Definitions

        We adopt the following definitions:

Systemic financial risk is the risk that a shock will trigger a loss of economic value or

confidence in, and attendant increases in uncertainty about, a substantial portion of the

financial system.



Systemic real risk is the risk that a shock will trigger a significant decline in real activity.



        As in Group of Ten (2001) and De Nicolò and Kwast (2002), these definitions embed

a key necessary condition for a financial shock to induce adverse systemic real risk

realizations: financial shocks must be highly likely to induce significant adverse real effects,

such as substantial reductions in output and employment. Thus, it explicitly requires that the

negative externalities of a financial shock that extend to the financial system also extend to
                                               7




the real economy. Financial markets turbulence, attendant increases in volatility and/or

failures of financial intermediaries that are devoid of significant and widespread real effects

are not classified as systemic.

       We adopt these definitions for two reasons. First, distinguishing systemic financial

risk from systemic real risk allows us to better assess the extent to which a realization of a

financial shock is just amplifying a shock in the real sector, or originates in the financial

system. Second, financial events that carry significant adverse real effects, such as sharp

reductions in output and increases in unemployment, are what may affect welfare

significantly and, as noted, are the ultimate concern of policy-makers.



                                       B. Measurement

       To control risk in financial institutions, risk managers track Value-at-Risk (VaR).

VaR measures the worst possible portfolio loss over a given time horizon at a given

probability. To control risk in the economy, policy makers may wish to track measures of

worst possible real macroeconomic outcomes. One such a measure is GDP-at-Risk

( GDPaR ), defined here as the worst predicted realization of quarterly growth in real GDP at

5 percent probability.

       To control risk in the financial system, policy makers may also wish to track

measures of worst possible system-wide financial outcomes. One such a measure is financial

system-at-risk ( FSaR ), defined as the worst predicted realization of the market-adjusted

return of a large portfolios of financial firms at 5 percent probability. Following Campbell,

Lo and MacKinlay (1997), this market-adjusted return is the return of a portfolio of financial

firms less the return on the market. We chose this measure for the easiness with which can be
                                                    8




embedded in the model described below. However, other indicators can be adapted to our

framework, such as those based on distance-to-default measures as in De Nicolò et al.

(2004), or based on CDS spreads, as in Huang, Zhou and Zhu (2009a, 2009b).



                  III. A DYNAMIC FACTOR MODEL OF SYSTEMIC RISKS

       Denote real GDP growth with GDPGt , and the indicator of system-wide financial

risk with FSt . The joint dynamics of GDPGt and FSt is modeled by a version of the

Dynamic Factor Model (DFM) detailed in Stock and Watson (2002, 2005).

       The model is described by the following equations:



                    GDPGt   R ( L) f t   11 ( L)GDPGt 1   12 ( L) FSt 1  ut1   (1)

                    FSt   F ( L) f t   21 ( L)GDPGt 1   22 ( L) FSt 1  ut2     (2)

                                    X it  i ( L) ft   i X it 1  vit               (3)

                                   ft  ( L) f t 1  t                               (4)



       Equations (1) and (2) describe a VAR in GDPGt and FSt augmented with a factor

structure. The dynamics of a (large) vector of series (predictors) X t indexed by i  N is
                                                          9




represented by the factor model (3), where ft is a set of dynamic factors.3 Equation (4)

describes the dynamics of these factors through a VAR.


           As in Stock and Watson (2005), factors and idiosyncratic errors ut1 , ut2 , and vit are

assumed to uncorrelated at all leads and lags. Assuming finite lags up to p , and defining the

vector of static factors with Ft  [ ft , ft 1 ,....., f t p 1 ] , one obtains the static form

representation of the DFM:


                           GDPGt   R Ft   11 ( L)GDPGt 1   12 ( L) FSt 1  ut1          (5)

                           FSt   F  Ft   21 ( L)GDPGt 1   22 ( L) FSt 1  ut2           (6)

                                         X it  i Ft   i X it 1  vit                      (7)

                                        Ft   ( L) Ft 1  Gt                                 (8)

           Note that  ( L) includes ( L) and 0’s, while G is a matrix of coefficients of

dimension rxq , where r is the number of static factors and q that of dynamic factors. If

r  q , then  ( L)  ( L) and G  I , that is, (8) is equivalent to (4).

           Substituting (8) in (5) and (6), we obtain a Factor-Augmented VAR (FAVAR)

representation of the DFM, akin to that adopted by Bernanke, Boivin, and Eliasz (2005):

                                        Ft   ( L) Ft 1  Gt                                 (9)

                      GDPGt   R ( L) Ft 1   11 ( L)GDPGt 1   12 ( L) FSt 1  ut1            (10)


3
    Following Stock and Watson (2006), we do not include GDP growth and the FS indicator in the vector X t of
predictors.
                                                      10




                  FSt   F  ( L) Ft 1   21 ( L)GDPGt 1   22 ( L) FSt 1  ut2          (11)



Systemic Risk Measures

        Using estimates of the static factors Ft , the systemic risk indicators GDPaR and

FSaR are obtained by estimating the following quantile regressions:

             GDPGt  1q   qR Ft   11q ( L)GDPGt 1   12q ( L) FSt 1  ut1q       (12)


             FSt   2q   qF  Ft   12q ( L)GDPGt 1   22q ( L) FSt 1  ut2 q       (13)




       Denoting the estimated coefficients of (12) and (13) with a “hat”, GDPaRt and

FSaRt are the fitted values of the quantile regressions (12) and (13) with q  0.05 :

                                ˆ R F  ˆ q ( L)GDPG  ˆ q ( L) FS
                GDPaRt  ˆ1q                                                          (14)
                                  q   t    11         t 1 12         t 1



                                ˆ F  F  ˆ q ( L) FS  ˆ q ( L)GDPG
                FSaRt  ˆ 2q                                                          (15)
                                  q    t    12        t 1 22         t 1




Measures of Systemic Risk Spillovers

       It can be useful and informative to compute measures of systemic risk spillovers from

real activity to the financial sector (and viceversa) that are net of the impact of common

factors on GDPaR and FSaR measures. These can be obtained by using the Covar measures

introduced by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2008).


       Estimates of Co(GDPaRt ) and Co( FSaRt ) are given by:

          Co(GDPaRt )  ˆ1q  ˆ1q Ft  ˆ11q ( L)GDPaRt 1  ˆ12q ( L) FSaRt 1         (16)
                                                        11




                Co( FSaRt )  ˆ 2q  ˆ2q Ft  ˆ12q ( L)GDPaRt 1  ˆ22q ( L) FSaRt 1          (17)

         The existence of systemic risk spillovers can be gauged comparing Co(GDPaR)t

with GDPaRt , and Co( FSaR)t with FSaRt . For example, if Co(GDPaR )t  GDPaRt , then

negative risk spillovers in the real sector arise from negative risk spillovers either in the real

sector, or in the financial sector, or both. However, positive risk spillovers cannot be ruled

out, since improvements in real activity, or a reduction in system-wide financial risk, can

have positive feedback effects on either sectors. This is apparent noting that the differences

between the Covar and the systemic risk measures are given by:

          Co(GDPaR )t  GDPaRt  ˆ11q ( L* )(GDPaRt  GDPGt )  ˆ12q ( L* )( FSaRt  FSt ) (18)

          Co( FSaR )t  FSaRt  ˆ12q ( L* )(GDPaRt  GDPGt )  ˆ22q ( L* )( FSaRt  FSt )                   (19)



                                   IV. ESTIMATION AND FORECASTING

           The first estimation step is to compute static factors and choose their number. Since

our focus is on forecasts of systemic risk indicators, we adopt the following forecasting

criterion to select both number of static factors and lags of the FAVAR (10)-(11).

           First, we use principal components to extract all factors with eigenvalues greater
than 1, in number R . Second, we order factors according to their explanatory power of the
variance of the data, and construct F  {( Fr 1 ), ( F1 , Fr  2 ),...., ( F1 , F2 ,..., Fr  R )} . Lastly, we

choose the number of lags L and the number of static factors r  F that maximize
FPE ( L, r )  AIC ( L, r ) , where FPE is the Final Prediction Error Criterion and AIC is the
Akaike Information Criterion. As detailed below, our forecasting criterion turns out to yield
an optimal number of static factors close to the number of dynamic factors obtained by
applying the statistical criterions based on Bai and Ng (2003).
                                                      12




         In the second estimation step, we use the optimal number of lags L* and number of
static factors r * obtained in the previous step to estimate quantile regressions (12)-(13)
Note that these quantile regressions can be viewed as forecasting equations of systemic risk
indicators. Using the VAR of static factors described by equation (9), we compute dynamic
forecasts of static factors k quarters ahead. Then, these forecasts are used to obtain recursive
forecasts of indicators of systemic risk using estimated coefficients of regressions (12)-(13).
         In sum, the foregoing procedure yield forecasts of GDPaR , FSaR , co(GDPaR) and

co( FSaR) indicators k quarters ahead. 4



                                V. IDENTIFICATION AND STRESS TESTS

         We would like to know how systemic risk indicators respond to structural shocks in

the economy. To this end, we can use impulse responses to identified structural shocks

through the FAVAR. These impulse responses can be viewed as stress tests of systemic risk

indicators to these structural shocks. At a given date, the size of these responses provides a

gauge of the sensitivity of systemic risk indicators to shocks of a given (standardized) size.

Between dates, changes in the size of impulse responses of the systemic risk indicators to a

given shock can provide a measure of changes in the resilience of an economy to a given

shock.


Orthogonalization

         We can obtain impulse responses of “factors” to their orthogonalized innovations, and

translate them into impulse responses of indicators of systemic risk in(14)-(15) via the
4
  Differing from Stock and Watson (2002), we obtain multistep-forecasts using the FAVAR rather than k-step
projections. Assessing the relative merit of these procedures in terms of their out-of sample forecasting ability is
a worthwhile enterprise in future applications.

the FAVAR estimation do not have any “economic” interpretation, although they have the

useful property of being contemporaneously and serially uncorrelated. Their economic

interpretation can be obtained through identification based on some underlying theoretical

model, as detailed next.


        Inverting (9) yields the Moving Average (MA) form of the factor VAR

(equation(9)):

                                    Ft  A( L)t                                        (9a),

        where A( L)  (1   ( L) L) 1 G .

        Substituting (9a) in (10) and (11), we obtain:

                    GDPGt   R A( L)t   11 ( L)GDPGt 1   12 ( L) FSt 1  ut1   (10a)

                   FSt   F  A( L)t   21 ( L)GDPGt 1   22 ( L) FSt 1  ut2     (11a)



        For the sole purpose of identification, we make the simplifying assumption that the

dynamic impact of FS on GDPG , and of GDPG on FS , is entirely captured by the

dynamics of factors. This amounts to posit  12 ( L)   21 ( L)  0 , and converts our forecasting

model into the standard Factor VAR detailed in Stock and Watson (2005). Under this

assumption, inverting (10a) and (11a) yields the MA representation of the FAVAR:

                                      GDPGt  B R ( L)t  wt1          (10b),

                                      FSt  B F ( L)t  wt2            (11b),
                                                               14




where B R ( L)  (1   11 ( L) L) 1  R A( L) , B F ( L)  (1   22 ( L) L) 1  F  A( L) ,

wt1  (1   11 ( L) L) 1 ut1 and wt2  (1   22 ( L) L) 1 ut2 .

          Likewise, the MA representation of the systemic risk indicators is:

                                        GDPaRt  BqR ( L)t  v11q              (14a),

                                        FSaRt  BqR ( L)t  vt2 q              (15a),


where BqR ( L)  (1   11q ( L) L) 1  qR A( L) , BqF ( L)  (1   22q ( L) L) 1  qF  A( L) ,

vtq1  (1   11q ( L) L) 1 ut1q and vtq 2  (1   22q ( L) L) 1 ut2 q .



Theory-based identification

          Extending the identification procedure introduced in Canova and De Nicolò (2002),

we identify a chosen set of orthogonal innovations as structural shocks if they satisfy certain

sign restrictions on key variables derived from aggregate dynamic macroeconomic theory

and a simple banking model.

          Specifically, the theoretical restrictions on the responses of key aggregates to

structural shocks implied by an aggregate macroeconomic model are as follows. If a positive

temporary orthogonal innovation represents a positive transitory aggregate supply shock,

then it should generate transitory weakly positive output responses and weakly negative

transitory responses in inflation, depending on capacity utilization. On the other hand, if it is

a real aggregate demand shock, it should generate weakly positive transitory responses in

output and inflation. Canova and De Nicolò (2002) show that these sign restrictions can be
                                              15




derived from a wide class of general equilibrium monetary macroeconomic models with

different microfoundations.

       What are the implications of these theoretical responses for the demand and supply of

bank credit? To answer this question, we use the implications of textbook partial equilibrium

banking models, as for example described in Chapter 3 of Freixas and Rochet (2008) , or the

simple model in Boyd, De Nicolò and Loukoianova (2009). In these models, aggregate

shocks can have an impact on both the demand for credit and the supply of funding for

intermediaries.

        Specifically, the theoretical restrictions on the responses of bank credit growth and

changes in loan rates implied by these banking models are as follows. If there is a positive

transitory shock to the demand for bank credit (e.g. because of a positive technology shock to

firms generating an increase in demand for investment, or an increase in the quality of

investment prospects), then we should observe a transitory increase in bank credit growth and

an increase in loan rates. We call a shock generating these responses a positive credit demand

shock. Conversely, if there is a positive transitory shock to the supply of bank credit (e.g. the

supply of bank liabilities increases or banks expand by raising capital), then we should

observe a transitory increase in bank credit growth but a decline in loan rates. We call a

shock generating these responses a positive credit supply shock. Of course, negative shocks

have all the signs of these responses reversed.

       Note that real aggregate demand or supply shocks can affect the underlying drivers of

the supply and demand for bank credit simultaneously. For example, a negative aggregate

demand shock can induce firms and household to decrease their demand for bank credit,

shifting the demand for bank credit to the left: this would result in a decline in loan rates
                                             16




ceteris paribus. At the same time, the adverse wealth effects of a negative aggregate demand

shock may induce investors to reduce their supply of loanable funds to banks, or banks could

reduce their supply of credit as they may become increasingly capital constrained or risk

averse: this would result in a leftward shift in the supply of credit ceteris paribus. Which

effect dominates on net will be reflected in movements in loan rates and bank credit growth.

If negative credit demand shocks dominate, then loan rates and bank credit growth should

decline, while the converse would be true if negative credit supply shocks dominate.

       Table A below summarizes the responses of GDP growth, inflation, bank lending

growth, and changes in loan rates in response to positive structural shocks implied by

standard aggregate macroeconomic models and partial equilibrium banking models:

       Identification of structural shocks will be conducted by checking whether a subset of

orthogonal innovations of the FAVAR produces responses of the four variables considered

that match the signs of the responses implied by theory.

                                   VI.     IMPLEMENTATION

       Our modeling procedure is implemented using quarterly macroeconomic and

financial series for the G-7 economies for the period 1980:Q1-2009:Q3. All series are taken

from Datastream.

         For each country, the vector of quarterly series X t in equation (3) includes about 95

series, which are detailed in the Appendix. They can be classified into three main groups.

The first group comprises equity markets data, including prices, price/earnings ratios and

dividend yields for the entire market and by sector. The inclusion of all sectors spanning

from manufacturing to services allows us to gauge the differential impact of shocks on

different sectors of the economy, as well as to capture the impact of specific sectors on

systemic risks. The second group includes financial, monetary and banking variables related

to credit conditions, namely: interest rates for different maturities, monetary policy rates,

bank prime rates and interbank rates, bank lending, and monetary aggregates. The third and

last group includes price and quantity indicators of real activity. This set of variables

includes net exports, capacity utilization, firms’ investment, consumer confidence,

unemployment, consumption and saving for firms, government and household, a consumer

price index, industrial production, house prices and manufacturing orders.

       In the reminder of this section, we first report some descriptive statistics, then we

detail the results of the forecasting model of systemic risks, and lastly, we carry out a

benchmark identification of structural shocks, examining the responses of the systemic risk

indicators to these shocks.
                                              18




                                   A. Descriptive statistics

        Table 1 reports basic statistics for GDP growth ( GDPG ) and our system-wide

indicator of financial risk ( FS ). Three facts are worth noticing. First, ranges as well as

volatilities of GDPG and FS appear to differ markedly across countries, suggesting

differential sensitivities of these indicators to underlying shocks. Second, means of FS are

generally small and not different from 0 according to simple t-statistics tests: this is expected,

as in the long-run the evolution of bank stock returns tracks that of the market. Third, the

contemporaneous correlation between GDPG and FS appears relatively small, with no

significant correlation for the U.S., Canada,, Japan and Italy, and a positive and significant—

albeit small—correlation for the U.K., France and Germany.


        As shown in Figure Set 1, however, the comovement between GDPG and FS appears

to be the most pronounced during recessions and the latest “crisis” period in all countries.

This suggests either an increase in the sensitivities of both indicators to common shocks, or a

significant increase in risk spillovers between real and financial activity, or a combination of

both.

        Assessing to what extent movements in real activity and the financial risk indicator

are primarily driven by common shocks or primarily by spillovers is especially important

during periods of both real and financial instability. Whether the recent crisis has been one in

which the sharp contraction in real activity registered at end-2008 and beginning 2009 has

been caused by sharp declines in the aggregate supply of bank credit, or alternatively, sharp

declines in real activity are the main drivers of the reduction in the demand for bank credit, is

still an open issue. Indeed, the conventional wisdom has been one in which the credit crunch
                                                    19




has prompted banking systems to curtail lending, and banks’ increasingly binding capital

constraints have forced banks to de-leverage, with the attendant contraction of their asset size

and further constraints in their lending capacity. Yet, bank loan growth in the U.S. and the

Euro area, for example, has been buoyant since the start of the crisis, although it has

decelerated since September 2008. This may suggest that the contraction in bank lending

growth reflects primarily the sharp decline in the demand for credit resulting from the severe

contraction in consumption growth and investment.5

          Identification is essential to address these issues, and this is exactly what we do.

Capturing the main drivers of the demand and supply of credit, and assessing whether shifts

in the demand or supply of bank credit dominate on net requires identification of structural

shocks.


                                   B. Estimation and Forecasting

          We estimated static factors and autoregressive coefficients of each variable by

principal components according to the iterative procedure described in Stock and Watson

(2005), and chose their number and the lags of equations (12) and (13) according to the

forecasting criterion described previously. Notably, for all datasets of the seven countries our



5
  For the U.S., Chari, Christiano and Kehoe (2008) made assertions at variance with the common wisdom,
which were countered by Cohen-Cole et al., 2008 and Ivashina and Sharfstein (2008), to whom the former
authors further replied. The issue is still open. For example, the IMF GFSR (2009) states that “This GFSR
contends that the credit disruption has been an exogenous and significant factor in the global recession that
began in 2008. However, it could be argued that the slowdown in credit is a symptom rather than a cause of the
economic slowdown and merely reflects the lower demand of credit – by households and corporates – rather
than a supply disruption.”
                                             20




forecasting criterion selected the same number of static factors and lags: five factors and one

lag.

       As a cross-check, we also estimated the number of static factors chosen according to

the Bai and Ng’s IC p1 and IC p 2 criterions, obtaining 11 static factors for the U.S.—

consistent with Stock and Watson (2005) results—and between 9 and 12 static factors for the

other countries. We also estimated the number of dynamic factors as principal components of

the residuals of each variable in equation (10) and (11), obtaining 6 dynamic factors for the

U.S., and between 4 and 6 dynamic factors for the other countries.

       In light of these results, and because our focus is on forecasting and on identification

with restrictions dictated by theory, we acted conservatively by treating the five estimated

static factors equal to the number of dynamic factors, essentially assuming Ft  ft , so that in

equation (8) G  I .

       We used these five estimated factors as independent variables of quantile regressions

(14) and (15) specified with one lag. The resulting GDPaR and FSaR estimates were also

used to compute Covar measures (16) and (17).

       As detailed in the previous section, forecasts of GDPaR and FSaR eight quarters

ahead were obtained projecting forward the factors through the VAR of equation (8) and

using the estimated quantile coefficients to project forward GDPaR and FSaR values.

Forecasts were undertaken with all data available as of September 25, 2009, that is, at end-

2009Q3. Note, however, that at that time actual real GDP was available only up to 2009Q2,

so that the first effective forecast date for GDPaR is 2009Q3 and the estimated 2009Q3 GDP

growth is a “nowcast” .
                                               21




          Figure Set 2 reports estimated GDPaR and FSaR series, together with their forecasts

eight quarters ahead of 2009Q3. Table 2 reports basic descriptive statistics of the systemic

risk indicators, as well as the difference between Covar and at-risk measures. As noted, the

latter measure is useful to gauge risk spillovers in excess of those implied by the dependence

of both measures on common factors.


          We point out two main findings. First, means of FSaR estimates are very similar

across countries, but their standard deviations vary significantly across countries. The

converse is true for GDPaR, whose measures exhibit marked cross-country variations, while

their standard deviations do not appear to vary markedly. Second, risk spillovers are present

for GDPaR measures, as Table 2 exhibits negative values for all countries, while spillovers

for FSaR measures are on average small and not significantly different from 0. Overall,

common factors appear to be the dominant drivers of systemic risk indicators, whereas risk

spillovers (net of common factors) seem relatively small in all countries.


          Turning to GDPaR and FSaR forecasts, Figure Set 2 indicates for all countries a V-

shaped pattern of systemic risk indicators, with forecasts pointing at a return of these

systemic risk indicators to their historical mean by mid-2010. This means that the model

predicts a significant decline in the size of real and financial losses associated with tail risk

events.


          One intuitive—albeit informal—way of judging the forecasting ability of the model is

to assess whether out-of sample forecasts of the systemic risk indicator GDPaR move in the

same direction of subsequent actual values of GDP growth. A full formal evaluation of the
                                             22




forecasting performance of the model is outside the scope of this paper. However, here we

report perhaps the most demanding assessment of the model’s forecasting ability. Namely,

we assess if the model signals a decline in GDPaR prior to one of the largest historical

declines in real activity: that experienced in 2008Q4-2009Q1 in all G-7 countries.


       Figure Set 3 reports the results of this comparison: the blue line is the out-of-sample

GDPaR forecasts made in 2008Q3, while the red line is actual GDP growth. Predicted

changes in GDPaR and actual GDP growth go in the same direction for at least 1 quarter

ahead within a three quarters’ horizon (up to 2009Q1) in all countries. Although informal, we

view this evidence as notable. The out-of sample consistency of GDPaR forecasts with the

future evolution of actual GDP growth for the most unpredictable event in decades suggests

the potential usefulness of our model as a real-time risk monitoring tool.



                          C. Identification of Structural Shocks

       We implemented the identification procedure outlined previously following three

steps. First, we selected an orthogonal decomposition of the MA representation (9a). Second,

we computed impulse responses of FAVARs for GDP Growth, Inflation, Bank Lending

Growth and first differences in Loan Rates for each country. Lastly, we checked whether the

joint signs of the responses of these variables conformed to the signs predicted for different

shocks by the basic macro and banking models summarized in Table A.

       As a benchmark orthogonalization, we chose a Choleski decomposition with factors

ordered according to their explanatory power of the common variations in the data, with

factor 1 ordered first, factor 2 second, and so on, and with GDPG, Inflation, Bank Lending
                                                    23




Growth and first differences in loan rates ordered last in each FAVAR equation. The simple

assumption underlying this choice is that the casual ordering implied by this decomposition

reflects the relative importance of factors in explaining variations in the data, and each

idiosyncratic component of the observable variables does not affect any of the factors at

impact.

          To check robustness, however, we examined alternative decompositions with inverted

ordering of the variables, obtaining similar signs of the responses of each of the observable

variables to shock to orthogonalized innovations. We also examined the covariance matrix of

innovations of the VAR of each country, and such matrices appeared approximately diagonal

in all cases, indicating that the ordering of variables in the VAR was not likely to change

results under the casual ordering selected. Furthermore, the approximate diagonality of these

covariance matrices also suggests that our results may be robust to alternative orthogonal

decompositions— not necessarily recursive—that can be extracted applying the systematic

statistical search implemented by Canova and De Nicolò (2002).

          Figure Set 4 reports impulse responses of GDP growth, Inflation, Bank Lending

Growth and changes in Lending Rates for each of the G-7 countries. Strikingly, the response

of all variables to all shocks at impact or for at least up to two quarters after impact is either

strictly positive (in most cases) or non negative (in few cases).6 Hence, according to Table A,

under the assumed benchmark orthogonalization, all structural shocks in these economies

can be identified as aggregate demand shocks associated with bank credit demand shocks.


6
 The only exception is the shock associated with the third factor for Canada, whose responses do not satisfy
any of the sign restrictions in Table A, and thus it results unidentified.
                                                     24




         The finding of aggregate demand shock as the predominant drivers of real cycles in

the G-7 economies is matching exactly the findings by Canova and De Nicolò (2003), who

used only a small dimension VAR for the G-7 countries, but implemented a full search for

shocks interpretable according to aggregate macroeconomic theory in the entire space of non-

recursive orthogonalizations of the VAR of each country.

          The finding that aggregate bank demand shocks are the predominant drivers of

cycles in bank credit growth is consistent with their being prompted by aggregate demand

shocks. This result also supports the conjecture that slowdowns in aggregate bank credit

growth are primarily the result of downturns in real activity, as they reflect declines in the

aggregate demand for bank credit by households and firms, rather than a reduction in the

aggregate supply of bank credit.

         Notably, the five identified aggregate demand and bank credit demand shocks are not

all the same, as they have a differential impact on GDP growth, inflation, bank lending

growth and changes in loan rates within as well as between countries. This suggests that the

sectors of the economy where they originate are different. As shown in Table 4, the variance

decompositions of the four variables VAR in each country show that the variance explained

by each shock varies across both variables and countries, with most shocks resulting relevant

in each country.7

          Similar results are obtained when we look at the impulse responses and variance

decompositions of GDPaR and FSaR measures. As shown in Figure Set 5, the sign of the

indexes documented recently by Foerster, Sarte and Watson (2008)
                                             25




impact of each shock on GDPaR is essentially the same in each country, although magnitude

and persistence of these shocks widely differ. As shown in Table 5, the relevant variance

decompositions indicate the importance of each of the identified shocks for the systemic risk

indicators in each country.

       In sum, all identified structural shocks are aggregate demand shocks associated with

bank credit demand shocks, this identification is the same for all countries considered, and

appears robust to alternative orthogonalizations of the innovations in the FAVAR.



                                      VII. CONCLUSION

       This paper has developed a modeling framework that delivers forecasts of indicators

of systemic real and financial risks that can be updated in real time. In addition, the proposed

identification procedure allows gauging the sensitivity of these indicators to structural shocks

identified by theory, giving economic content to stress tests. The implementation of such

framework appears promising as a risk monitoring tool.

       We view this framework as a first building block for an analysis of the determinants

of systemic risks. As it can be inferred from our discussion, refinements and extensions of

our framework are aplenty, since we have exploited the rich information provided by the

factor model only in a limited way.

       There remain deeper questions that need yet to be answered: where do these structural

shocks originate? And, to which other sectors are they transmitted? In terms of Figure A of

the introduction, answering these questions amounts to identifying in which “box” shocks

originate, and disentangle the linkages between the originating box and other boxes in the

picture, that is, the web of linkages implied by the transmission mechanism of these shocks.
                                              26




       Answering these questions amounts to further exploiting the rich information

structure provided by the factor model. We believe that such an exploration is likely to yield

increasing returns. It can guide a more effective integration of financial frictions into current

macroeconomic modeling, encourage the development of more disaggregated versions of

such macroeconomic modeling by incorporating the insights of models of financial

intermediation, and can be a powerful monitoring tool available to policy-makers. Carrying

out some of these extensions is already part of our research agenda.
