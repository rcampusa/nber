      EARNINGS, DIVIDEND POLICY, AND PRESENT VALUE RELATIONS:
      BUILDING BLOCKS OF DIVIDEND POLICY INVARIANT CASH FLOWS



                             ABSTRACT


      In a Modigliani-Miller world, price equals the risk-adjusted
present value of future dividends and dividend policy is
irrelevant for asset pricing. This paper searches for cash flows
with two characteristics: asset prices can be calculated from

their present values and they are invariant with respect to

dividend policy. Residual income measures with these features
are identified under two assumptions: dividend policy does not
alter risk premiums and income earned from investments associated

with dividend policy includes capital gains and losses. These
results hold for otherwise arbitrary risk premiums in the general
no-arbitrage approach to the valuation of uncertain income
streams -

      There is a peculiar schizophrenia underlying the present value relation. On
the one hand, the value of equity is, the risk-adjusted present value of expected
future dividends. On the other hand, value additivity implies that dividend policy
is irrelevant. Hence, the conventional practice of assuming a particular dividend
policy and computing its present value is fraught with hazard. Under the null
hypothesis of efficiency, there is substantial reason to believe that any assumed
dividend policy is misspecified since managers have no obvious incentive to adopt
or maintain a consistent dividend policyJ
      For many years, there was comparatively little interest in academia in the
computation of present values. The efficient markets hypothesis, which has
dominated research over the last quarter century, presumes that asset prices equal
their underlying intrinsic values. This focused attention on the behavior of asset
prices and particular risk-adjustment procedures, retarding the development of
improved procedures for calculating intrinsic values.
      It is fair to say that most academic research has been concerned with risk-
adjustment procedures for holding period returns. I want to focus instead on
procedures for measuring cash flows more fundamental than dividends in a
particular sense—like dividends, prices are their risk-adjusted present values but,
unlike dividends, they are invariant with respect to changes in dividend policy.
Accomplishment of this task would facilitate the calculation of measures of intrinsic
value that are not price dependent, simplifying the testing of the efficient markets
hypothesis or the exploitation of its predictions for valuation purposes. It does so by

evidence of excess volatility under particular assumptions about dividend policy
and expected returns. See, for example, Campbell and Shiller(1987,1988a,b),

providing an explicit link between accounting measures of capital (i.e., book value)
and rates of return (i.e., return on equity) and their economic counterparts.
       There are three building blocks of dividend policy invariant cash flows which
comprise the body of the paper. The next section sets out the general no-arbitrage
valuation environment used throughout the paper and the class of accounting
relations that can be accommodated by the analysis. The main result is the
translation of the no-arbitrage pricing relation for future dividend payments into a
corresponding procedure for valuing arbitrary stocks and flows. The second section
analyzes the role of dividend policy in the dividend policy invariance of residual
income measures based on economic income. It shows that one must generally
define financial policy to be the net issuance of contingent claims by firms plus the
synthetic securities implicitly created by particular dividend payout strategies. The
third section provides a corresponding analysis of accounting-based residual
income measures, emphasizing the role of capital gains and losses in their dividend
policy invariance. A brief appendix contains the proof of the first proposition.
      1. The Arithmetic of Stocks, flows, and Present Value Relations
      The first building block is the specification of both the valuation
environment and the class of accounting relations to be considered. Generality is
clearly desirable in both dimensions; I do not wish to restrict attention to particular
equilibrium valuation or even efficient markets models or to tie the analysis to a
particular definition of accrued or realized income. Accordingly, I will consider
present value relations that require only no-arbitrage in frictionless markets and any
accounting numbers that obey simple stock/flow relations.
      The valuation environment assumed throughout the paper is the general
no-arbitrage approach to the valuation of uncertain income streams. This is
restrictive in some dimensions—it assumes the absence of frictions like taxes,
transactions costs, and constraints on short sales as well as value-relevant

asymmetries in the information available to investors.2 Nevertheless, i satisfies
the requirements listed above since it does not require market efficiency, particular
risk/return models, or complete markets. Fo1lowig Rubinstein(1976) and

 nature of financial markets. This is an efficient markets model when investors
 have rational expectations given appropriate specification of their information sets
 since market price equals the objective intrinsic or fundamental value. However, it
 is also consistent with a wide variety of inefficient markets models. For example,
 investor expectations need not be rational so that price need not equal objective
 intrinsic value and some investors could even irrationally ignore the presence of
 arbitrage opportunities from their perspective so that risk premiums (i.e., the
 pricing kernels Yt.j) are not those that would occur if all investors were rational.S
       Note also that the central tenets of modem financial theory are embodied in
 this general present value relation. The role of modern portfolio theory is implicit
 in the risk adjustment used to generate the certainty equivalents of the cash flows
 d+;. Modigliani-Miller propositions follow from the notion of value additivity
 embedded in (1)—'--the value of a claim to the income stream d1+ is the sum of the
 values of claims to any arbitrary decomposition of this stream. This observation on
 the linearity of expectations (or, equivalently, on the linearity of price systems)
implies that the value of the firm is independent of its capital structure and the
value of an equity claim is independent of the dividend policy of the firm.6
Modigliani-Miller reasoning will play a critical role in the analysis that follows.
      The conversion of the valuation relation (1) into an operational device for
calculating intrinsic value requires knowledge of all of its factors. Much of modern
financial research has been devoted to the identification of the appropriate risk


5ff horizons were finite, equation (1) permits an additional source of irrationality—
the possibility of the terminal price (and, hence, the current price) not reflecting
intrinsic value due to irrationality of future investors. Obviously, the no-arbitrage
pricing relation is not compatible with all sorts of market inefficiency.
6This means that beliefs are assumed to be invariant with respect to financial and
dividend policy. This further restricts the kinds of market inefficiency compatible
with the analysis.

adjustment procedures (i.e., identification of Yt,j when expectations are rational. I
want to focus instead on the cash flows d1÷. An implication of the general present

value relation is that security values are independent of all zero net present value
alterations of the stream of cash flows. When the security under consideration is a
common stock, this property is usually referred to as the Modigliani-Miller
dividend policy irrelevance proposition.
       Dividend policy irrelevance greatly complicates the calculation of present
values. Legal, institutional, and moral hazard considerations suggest that dividend
payouts will not generally follow the convenient stochastic processes typically
assumed by econometricians. This would occur, for example, in the plausible case
where managers were committed to a stable policy of dividend payments with two
features—retained income must be positive when paid-in capital exceeds book
value and retained earnings are bounded below by zero because of an eventual 100%
payout policy. Moreover, managers might find it convenient to consider occasional
alterations of dividend policy. Conventional assumptions like the stationarity of
dividend growth rates or detrended dividend payments leads to incorrect present
value calculations in these circumstances.          Put differently, present value
calculations are not invariant with respect to dividend policy assumptions even
though prices are invariant with respect to dividend policy.
      Therefore, it is desirable to measure cash flows more fundamental than
dividends. In particular, I will seek to identify cash flows with two characteristics:
(1) like dividends, they can be used to compute asset values and (2) their conditional
expectations are invariant with respect to dividend policy. Mathematically, a
random variable zt+j has these characteristics when:


         = zt
                      E[zjyqfItJ
                                                                                   (2)

                j=l
                                             6

  for some variable Zt known at time t where Z and E[zi+1y/l,] do not vary with
  possible (and feasible) future dividend policies. I will call cash flows like
  dividend policy invariant.
        This definition of dividend policy invariance has obvious intuitive appeal. It
 permits the application of conventional time series methods to random variables
 like ztyj to determine conditional expectations and to facilitate the calculation of
 present values. Otherwise, present value calculations require knowledge of how the
 conditional expectations of d1÷y1 vary with dividend policy as well as the nature of
 the firm's actual (or potential) dividend policy unless the analyst can measure and
 forecast economic income.7
       I will begin the search for such cash flows by delineating the general class of
 stock/flow relations that can be accommodated in the analysis and restating the
 present value relation in terms of these stocks and flows. In particular, I will
 confine attention to accumulation equations of the form:
                                                                                     (3)
The result presented below is for arbitrary choices of the flow variables x and the
stock variables X1, so long, as X1 does not grow too quickly.
     Stocks and flows like these arise from the capital maintenance notions of
income that underlie modern accounting in which assets are often carried at
historical cost or book value. For example, if x is earnings or net income calculated
on an accrual basis and there are no new stock issues, then X is the book value of
owners' equity. Similarly, if Xt is the change in cash (i.e., net income calculated on a
realized basis), then X is the book value of all noncash assets.
      The general present value relation may be rewritten in terms of these stock


7Economic income is dividend policy invariant by definition for reasons discussed
later.

 and flows. This translation is recorded as Proposition I and may be found in
 Ohlson(1989a) for the case of risk neutrality and a constant riskless interest rate.

       Proposition 1: Let security values satisly the general no-arbitrage pricing
 relation (1) and let Xt and X be any numbers satisfying the accumulation equation:

Proof: The proof is contained in the Appendix.

       The three terms in the summation merit special comment. The latter two
terms simply shows that stock/flow relations like (3) yield complicated expressions
for risk premiums although they are obviously not changed by this translation.8
The first term is called residual income when Xt is earnings, X is the book value of

owrters equity, and the forward rate equals the cost-of-capital (typically assumed to
be constant). Residual income has a long history in managerial compensation and
performance measurement and plays an important role in the analysis that follows.
       It is also worth emphasizing what is not said by Proposition 1. Proposition I
is a statement about arbitrary stocks and flows. As such, it cannot point to particular

   stock/flow relations as being especially useful for
                                                       valuation purposes. Economic
   reasoning is needed to identify dividend policy invariant cash flows and the means
   by which they can be estimated from accounting
                                                    measurements.
        2. Dividend Policy, Risk Premiums, and the Dividend Policy Invariance of
            Residual Economic Income
         The next building block of cash flows that are invariant with
                                                                          respect to
  changes in dividend policy requires the definition of dividend policy. Following
  Modigliani and Miller(1955) and Miller and Modigliani(1961), it is useful to
  distinguish three kinds of policies undertaken by the firm: investment policy,
  financial policy, and dividend
                                    policy. Investment policy governs the firm's
  investment in physical (and, for some companies, financial) assets. Financial policy
 refers to the issuance of contingent daims to finance the desired level of investment
 that divide the stream of income generated by investment policy. Dividend
                                                                                policy
 reflects alterations of the stream of payments to equity claimants.
        As is customary in Modigliani-Miller analyses, we want to isolate the effects
 of dividend policy on equity prices. Accordingly, I will assume that both investment
 and financial policy are exogenous and will focus on the effects of dividend
                                                                                policy.
 This means that I will take income from investment and the payments to other
 claimants as given. In these circumstances, dividend policy involves
                                                                      zero net
present value alterations of the dividend stream.
      It is difficult to distinguish investment, financial, and dividend policy
                                                                                even if
there were no accounting
                              measurement problems. One simply cannot tell from a
balance sheet whether retained
                                 earnings represent investment, financial, or
dividend policy. Earnings retention might reflect financial policy since internal
finance is one way to finance future
                                    investment. Alternatively, it might represent
dividend policy as the firm translates foregone current dividend payments into
future payouts. Similarly, one cannot disentangle these possibilities by looking at
                                            9


changes in firm assets—the firm will invest retained earnings in assets in both cases.

Finally, one cannot distinguish these effects at the time of physical investment so
long as the firm is retaining earnings and engaging in both financial and dividend
policy related transactions at that time. Only specialized knowledge about the firm
can   tell an analyst whether particular financial assets are or were earmarked for
future investments or dividend payments.
       These ambiguities arise because of our valuation methods: we replace the
intricate Operations of a business firm with a disembodied replicating portfolio of
contingent claims. Changes in dividend policy alter the menu of contingent claims
that replicate the risk and return characteristics of the dividend stream. Financial
policy involves the actual menu of contingent claims used to finance investment.
Hence, dividend and financial policy changes are indistinguishable without more
detailed knowledge of the firm's inner workings. This knowledge is absent when
we model the firm as a blackbox generating cash flows.
       Consequently, it is not clear how to identify the cash flows and net assets
associated with these conceptually distinct elements of corporate policy even in the
absence of accounting measurement problems. This is readily seen by considering
the relevant flows assuming no measurement problems. Accordingly, let itt denote
the economic profits from investment policy net of the changes in the value of the
firm's physical assets (i.e., economic depreciation). Similarly, let 'Vt denote the net
income (or expenditure) on financial policy inclusive of both earnings retention for
future investments and capital gains and losses on the financial liabilities and assets
of the firm. The inclusion of these capital gains and losses is not essential and will
be discussed further in the next section.
       How does dividend policy fit into this picture? The simple dividend policy of
paying out net economic profits (i.e., it-i-y, a capital levy on the equity daimants
when net economic profits are negative) creates no additional cash flows or assets to
                                            10


  consider. However, any dividend policy in which payouts differ from net economic
 profits generates additional financial assets or liabilities with their attendant
                                                                                   impact
 on future cash flows. Accordingly, let represent the net profit or loss from the
 investment of prior differences between net economic profits and dividend
 payments inclusive of capital gains and losses. The inclusion of capital gains and
 losses in   plays a substantive role in the analysis, as will be seen in the next section.
 For later reference, let Z1 denote the market value of the portion of the firms assets
 associated with dividend policy.
        In these circumstances, let x1 be total economic earnings inclusive of capital
 gains and losses which has three components:

                                                                                       (5)
 This decomposition implies that ltt+Wt is unaffected by dividend policy and that ? is
 the dividend policy dependent component. The invariance of net economic profits
 to dividend policy plays a central role in the analysis.
      Now consider the role of dividend policy in this setting. Decompose
dividends into net economic profits (i.e., dividend payouts in the absence of
dividend policy) and a residual:

                                                                                      (6)
Since dividend policy involves only zero net present value alterations of the
dividend stream, the market value of the assets associated with dividend policy is
also the risk-adjusted present value of the residual D1:

explains why it is difficult to construct dividend policy invariant flows. The
conditional expectations of Ct÷j.ftjXt÷Fj and the conditional covariances involving

Ct+'       yj. and Yt.j-1   for each j are generally nonzero and will typically vary with

dividend policy even though their present values are equal to Z. Clearly, the
individual components of the risk premium play an important role in dividend

 policy invariance. Cash flows will not possess the invariance property so long as
 intertemporat shifts in the risk premium components cause expected risk-adjusted
 cash flows to systematically change with dividend policy.
          This issue arises because the effects of zero net present value changes in the
 dividend stream can be like those of investment and financial policy—they can alter
 the equity risk premium (i.e., the present value of the covariance terms in the
 pricing relations (1) and (4)). As noted earlier, firms could retain additional earnings
 in the future, invest the proceeds in contingent claims, and pay out the income
 from these investments as dividends later on. An obvious example is the future
repurchase of some of the firm's outstanding contingent claims such as its debt.
Such policies will not alter current equity prices but will typically change the
division into risk premiums and expected present values of dividends.10 They will
also generally change the risk premiums associated with each period t+j (i.e.,
cov[d1+;,y1/I]).
          Accordingly, the first major assumption or definition made here is that all
policy changes that alter equity risk premiums are changes in either investment or
financial policy. This is consistent with the exogeneity of income from investment
and the payments to other claimants—in the example above, the purchase of
additional contingent claims alters the net flow of payments to other claimants.
Hence, this definition restricts changes in dividend policy to be those zero net
present value alterations of the dividend stream that leave equity risk premiums
unaffected." In terms of the preceding analysis, this restriction implies that:


"These statements apply to current earnings retention for cum-dividend current
prices.
11This definition places unusual burdens on the analyst in practical applications.
The investigator must identify investment and financial policy and thus the
exogenous income stream. If the firm changes dividend policy in a way that alters
the risk premium, the analyst must decompose this change into investment and

changed by dividend policy.12
      The need for this assumption arises because changes in financial and
dividend policy are generally indistinguishable when the firm is viewed as a black
box generating cash flows. Changes in dividend policy generally alter the portfolio
of contingent claims that replicate the risk and return characteristics of the dividend
stream. Hence, they also constitute a synthetic security that replicates this portfolio.
In this sense, any change in dividend policy that alters equity risk premiums can be
viewed as changing the net financial assets of the firm inclusive of synthetic
securities. The difficulty of differentiating the actual from synthetic changes in
financial policy associated with dividend policy changes is eliminated by confining
dividend policy to zero net present value, zero risk premium alterations of the
dividend stream.13 This is also a definition of financial policy.


financial policy components. The present analysis then applies to the residual zero
net present value, zero risk premium dividend stream alteration.
t2This confines the investments associated with dividend policy to zero beta assets
like discount and fixed coupon bonds held to maturity and rolled over into zero beta
assets. It is related to the Modigliani-Miller equivalent risk dass formalism.

Proof: The results follows directly from the assumptions about dividend policy and
the present value relations (8) and (Ii).

       These are the ingredients required to synthesize cash flows that are unaffected
by alterations of dividend policy in the absence of accounting measurement
problems. Proposition I indicates how the general present value relation (I) can be
rewritten for general stock/flow relations of the form (3). Confining the definition


it might appear natural to define dividend policy as a set of restrictions on the
covariance terms q1. Unfortunately, this does not generally lead to dividend policy
invariant income measures because the stock/flow relation (3) is additive while
E[(xI+;-Xi+;÷X1+)qj /IJ is multiplicative. It does work in the special case of
deterministic discount factors as noted in the next section.

 of dividend policy to those zero net present value alterations of the dividend stream
 that leave equity risk premiums unchanged prevents intertemporal shifts in the
 risk premium components from causing expected risk-adjusted cash flows to
 systematically change with dividend policy. This condition is restrictive but
 essential—without it, it is necessary to risk adjust the flows X and the stocks X,
 making their conditional expectations dependent on dividend policy.
       Unfortunately, the analysis in this section involved economic income
 variables inclusive of economic asset depreciation. In practice, it is often difficult to
 assess changes in asset values in a verifiable and replicable way. Consequently, the
 present analysis is not terribly useful unless it can be applied to accounting income
 or cash flow measures. This is the focus of the next section.
       3. Dividend Policy Invariance and Accounting Income Measures
       The final building block of dividend policy invariant cash flows involves the
translation of the preceding analysis from economic to accounting earnings.
Economic profits are not accounting profits, generally differing in their treatment of
asset depreciation. This section identifies the circumstances in which the dividend
policy invariance of accounting measures of residual income arises.
      Accordingly, consider two broad accounting income measures: earnings (i.e.,
accrued income inclusive of accounting depreciation) and the net change in cash
(i.e., the sum of the cash flows from operating, investment, and financing
activities).'4 The question at hand is whether the inclusion of capital gains and


BOther income concepts could be handled as well so long as their associated stocks
are treated in an internally consistent manner. For example, earnings could be
replaced by earnings available for common (i.e., earnings adjusted for nonrecurring
items, unjustified income or contingency recognition, noncomparable inventory
and depredation measures, consolidation of subsidiaries, affiliates, and unrecorded
assets and liabilities, and provision for income taxes). See Cottle, Murray, and
Block(1988), Chapters 10 through 17, fora detailed guide to the construction of
earnings available for common (i.e., true operating earnings).
                                                    16


 losses in net economic profits          x1÷÷y4 and income associated with dividend policy
   materially affects the analysis.
           In terms of the earlier analysis, accounting income measures take the form:

                                                                                                  (14)
 where the 'measurement errors z,,                    and         reflect the difference between the
 components of the economic and accounting income measures. Cash flow income
 measures differ in that they make no allowance for net asset depreciation while
earnings       are generally adjusted for measured but not economic depreciation.
Accordingly, investment is calculated net of economic depreciation for economic
income, net of accounting depredation for earnings, and gross of depreciation on a
cash flow basis. Not surprisingly, these 'measurement error' components have
different effects on the construction of dividend policy invariant cash flows.
           There are twO present value relations that help identify the issues associated
with the distinction between accounting and economic income measures. The first
arises from the application of the stock/flow relation (3) to income as defined in (12),
yielding a pricing relation of the form (4). The second is the pricing relation (8) for
economic income and the market value of assets associated with dividend policy.
The difference of these two pricing relations implies:

 where Z1 is the market value of assets associated with dividend policy and X is the
 stock variable associated with the income variable (12) (which differs from the
 corresponding stock for economic income defined in Section 2).
     Consider first the 'measurement error' components c, and c associated
with net economic profits tW (i.e., the first line of (16) above) for cash flow
income measures. Cash flows measure income gross of depreciation—_depreciation
implicitly figures in the present value of future income which is reduced by future
sales or disposal of depreciated capital or by future declines in the productivity of
capital (measured gross of depreciation). As such, the present values are unaffected
but the timing of expected cash flows and risk premiums are changed. This is
reflected in the difference between the book value of noncash assets X and the
market value of dividend policy related assets Z, the second present value term in
the first line of (16), and the risk-adjusted present value of the 'measurement error'
components 6ict and e.
      Similarly, earnings introduce the distinction between measured and
economic depreciation and the need to account for this difference in present value
                                          18


computations. This too results in a difference between the market and book values
of owners' equity and in the altered timing of expected cash flows and risk
premiums. These terms show up in (16) as the risk-adjusted present value of the
'measurement error' components t, and e,1 (which differ from those associated
with cash income) and in the current and present value differences between the
market value based 'book' value of owners equity in (11) and the corresponding
accounting measure of book value implicit in (16).
       These differences between accounting and economic income measures are
unimportant for the purpose of identifying dividend policy invariant cash flows.
The reason is simple—neither difference between accounting and economic income
is related to changes in dividend policy. Accordingly, these distinctions affect the
details of present value calculations but introduce no dependence of accounting
income measures on dividend policy.
       By contrast, the dividend policy dependent component of income found in
the last two lines of (16) requires the other major assumption of the analysis—1
represents the net profit or loss from investments associated with dividend policy
inclusive of capital gains and losses)5 This could literally mean that all relevant
capital gains and losses are fully realized each period. Alternatively, this
corresponds to the assumption that all such investments are marked to market each
period for accounting purposes. In terms of (16). this involves the assumption that
     is equal to zero for all j (although E(eç,1y/I1 = 0 is all that is needed to obtain
the results that follow).
      The need for this assumption is straightforward. If the financial assets
associated with dividend policy are not marked to market, the measurement error

15This assumption implicitly requires broad measures of accounting income. It
would be less plausible for narrow definitions of the accounting income variable
since some portion of might then be inadvertently omitted.

  as zero coupon and fixed income securities held to maturity, the
                                                                    unrealized capital
  gains and losses of other zero beta assets will
                                             generally depend on dividend policy.
        This assumption renders the residual income variable xt+1-f1X±1 based
                                                                                   on
  accounting income dividend policy invariant, as noted in Proposition 3.
        Proposition 3: Suppose that security prices satisfy the general no-arbitrage
 pricing relation (1). Let xt be some broad accounting income measure like net cash
 flow or earnings satisfying the accumulation equation:
                  =
       Xt+j - d÷j      - Xt+i;    X given
 such that T—°     '
            urn E[Xt÷TytT/ltJ
                              = 0.
                                     Suppose that equity risk premiums are unaffected
 by dividend policy (i.e., Cov[dt+,y j/tJ=Cov(Ot •+y •y /1]) and that dividend
 policy related income includes capital gains and losses. Then the residual income
 variable xi÷1-ft1Xt+11 is dividend policy invariant in that:
                              =
 for all choices of dividend policy and
                                          prices satisfy:

          =   ,         E[(xt÷f ;Xt÷.j)y1 j/lt]

                                                                                    (17)


Proof: This follows directly from Proposition 2 and the
                                                        preceding discussion.
      Hence, there are three building blocks of dividend policy invariant cash flows.
The first is the general present value relation (4) for stock/flow relations of the form
                                        20


(3). The second is the restriction of dividend policy to zero net present value, zero
risk premium alterations of the dividend stream. The final building block is the
assumption that income associated with dividend policy reported in broad
accounting income measures includes any capital gains and losses. Proposition 3
also provides a framework for distinguishing accounting from economic rates of
return and capital stock measures.
       The two assumptions—dividend policy does not change risk premiums and
any dividend policy related income includes marking relevant assets to market for
accounting purposes—are necessary br the dividend policy invariance of residual
income. The risk premium restriction eliminates the need to risk-adjust the
dividend policy related components of income which, in turn, purges their
conditional expectations of dependence on dividend policy. Without restrictions on
the accounting treatment of dividend policy related income, the residual income
variable xt+1-fjX÷1 would include the unrealized gains and losses associated with

dividend policy, which clearly can depend on dividend policy. The first assumption
restricts dividend policy substantially and the second is a counterfactual proposition
about the general accounting treatment of capital gains and losses.
      A more positive view is that the analysis does cover a broad range of
dividend policies under plausible restrictions. For example, suppose retained
earnings reflect savings by the firm designed to eliminate potential future
borrowing constraints (or other constraints on the issuance of future contingent
claims) much as household savings plays this role in some versions of the
permanent income hypothesis of consumption. It is reasonable to suppose that
such precautionary savings would be placed in safe assets because of their self-
insurance nature. Discount and coupon bonds held to maturity would be safe in
this sense and satisfy the requirements of Proposition 3. On this view, accounting
residual income measures are invariant to a large class of dividend policy changes.

         In addition, these observations have
                                               obvious significance for present value
  calculations given actual practice.
                                      It is commonplace to assume that the present
  value relation holds for expected future dividends
                                                     discounted by deterministic
  discount factors of the form:

 expected returns (r = r), constant expected excess returns (l+rt )J        = (1+5)J   for some
                                                               (1+p '.

 rates (PtJ = Pt V j). These specializations of the pricing kernel
                                                                    Yt.j make residual
 income variables of the form
                              x1÷1-$,1x11 dividend policy invariant.'6 In any event,
 one can certainly make a case for using some residual income variable in place of
 dividends in present value calculations.


 '6The variable        is defined by:
                     (1+r1)J

These restrictions on discount factors implicitly restrict dividend policy since:
                          [      d11

                 =

       4. Conclusion
       This paper had a very simple motivation. It is well-known that dividend
 policy is irrelevant in a Modigliani-Miller world. It is equally well-known that price
 equals the risk-adjusted present value of expected future dividends in these
 circumstances. The latter fact would not appear to be especially useful for the
 purposes of computing present values in the absence of a priori knowledge of the
 nature of (value-irrelevant) dividend policy.
       There are three building blocks of dividend policy irrelevant cash flows
 identified in these pages. The first is the calculation of stocks from the difference
between arbitrary flows and dividends and the translation of the risk-adjusted
present value relation for future dividends into one for the future values of these
stocks and flows. The second is the breakdown of corporate policy into investment,
financial, and dividend policy and the requirement that dividend policies that
synthesize risky contingent claims are classified as financial policy. The final
building block is the assumption that the accounting treatment of income from
dividend policy includes all relevant capital gains and losses, permitting the
calculation of the present value of the cash flow effects of dividend policy in each
future period.
      Is there some easily measured cash flow that is useful for computing present
values and is invariant with respect to dividend policy? The answer to this
question is a qualified yes. The analysis identified two necessary conditions for the
dividend policy invariance of residual income measures. The first is that dividend
policy does not alter equity risk premiums, which are those that would prevail in a
world where firms paid out 100% of economic profit as dividends. The second is
that the component of accounting income associated with dividend policy includes
its associated capital gains and losses. Under these conditions, residual income
measures are invariant with respect to dividend policy.
                                           23


        This is moderately bad news in that it places unusual burdens on the analyst.
 If changes in dividend policies alter equity risk premiums, the analysis requires the
 attribution of this change to three components: (1) income from investment policy;
 (2) the payments to other claimants; and (3) the residual dividend policy
 component. It also requires that the dividend policy component includes
                                                                                 capital
 gains and losses whereas accounting income measures typically only include
 realized gains and losses. Hence, the analysis would appear to apply only under
 very restrictive circumstances.
       On the other hand, these are burdens that are usually assumed away in actual
 practice.   It is common to assume that either expected returns or equity risk
 premiums are constant, thus assuming away the problem of the effects of dividend
policy on risk premiums (but not on the flow of dividends). Similarly, the constant
risk premium assumption effectively limits investment associated with dividend
policy to zero beta assets like bonds held to maturity, on which capital gains and
losses are not an issue. It is reasonable to suppose that the capital gains and losses
associated with other zero beta assets would not substantially alter the analysis.
       It is fair to say that techniques for computing the intrinsic value of equity
securities have lagged over the past few decades. This is doubtless a consequence of
the efficient markets hypothesis, which shifted attention away from such
calculations toward the behavior of prices under the assumption that asset prices
were equal to their underlying intrinsic values. This paper is a small step toward
facilitating such computations by identifying cash flows that are more fundamental
than dividends in their invariance with respect to some forms of dividend policy.
