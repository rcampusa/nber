                                            ABSTRACT

    Differentials between blacks and whites in birth weights and prematurity and stillbirth rates
have been persistent over the entire twentieth century. Differences in prematurity rates explain a

large proportion of the black-white gap in birth weights both among babies attended by Johns

Hopkins physicians in the early twentieth century and babies in the 1988 National Maternal and

Infant Health Survey. In the early twentieth century untreated syphilis was the primary observable

explaining differences in black-white prematurity and stillbirth rates. Today the primary observable

explaining differences in prematurity rates is the low marriage rate of black women. Maternal birth

weight accounts for 5-8 percent of the gap in black-white birth weights in the recent data, suggesting

a role for intergenerational factors. The Johns Hopkins data also illustrate the value of breast-feeding

in the early twentieth century -- black babies fared better than white babies in terms of mortality and

weight gain during the first ten days of life spent in the hospital largely because they were more

likely to be breast-fed.

1    Introduction

In the United States today, African-Americans at all ages are in worse health than whites. They

are more likely to be born premature and with lower birth weights for gestational age. They are

more likely to die in infancy, in large part because they are born prematurely (Copper et al. 1993).

At older ages a greater proportion of African-Americans are likely to report themselves in fair

or poor health than whites in the same age group; a greater proportion report limits on activities

of daily living; and a greater proportion report having specific chronic conditions, particularly

hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis (Manton and Stallard 1997; Smith and Kington 1997).

Explanations for black-white health differentials include the greater early life environmental

stress faced by African-Americans, lifestyle differences in exercise and diet, differential access

to medical care, and differences in income and education.

          This paper documents the differential twentieth century trends in black and white

pregnancy outcomes and examines what socioeconomic and maternal health factors explained

these differentials in the past and in recent times. Examining pregnancy outcomes is important

because health differentials in early life may have a long reach. Barker (1994) argued that measures

of fetal and maternal malnutrition are related to such adult chronic conditions as ischaemic heart

disease, adult-onset diabetes, and thyroid conditions. Doblhammer and Vaupel (2001) found

that month of birth, a proxy for the disease and nutritional environment faced by the mother,

influences adult life expectancy at ages greater than 49. Preston, Hill, and Drevenstedt (1998)

found that among African-Americans survival to age 85 is best predicted by a farm background,

having literate parents, and being from a two-parent household. Emmanuel et al. (1999) found

that among all ethnic and racial groups studied in Washington state, there is an inverse relationship

between maternal birth weight and infant low birth weight. They noted that the birth weights

of black mothers were markedly lower than those of white mothers and suggested that racial



                                                 1
differences in pregnancy outcomes may be related to maternal prenatal factors. Thus a first-

generation college-educated woman may still be carrying the risks of generations of poverty and

this risk may be preprogrammed in utero in her children. This paper will use recent data to

examine whether black-white differences in maternal birth weight can account for any of the

black-white birth weight gap.

          Relatively little is known about long-trends in black and white birth weight and stillbirth

rates and even less about racial differentials in prematurity. Ward (1993) reported that black babies

born at Boston Lying-In in the late nineteenth century were roughly 200 grams smaller than white

babies, but that black babies’ weight was comparable to that of babies born in Europe. Steckel

(1986) used height at young ages to infer that at birth the mean slave baby weighted less than

2500 grams, suggesting severe deprivation. This paper uses records from Johns Hopkins Hospital

in the first third of the century and recent data to analyze differential trends not only in birth

weights, but also in prematurity and stillbirth rates, the probability of surviving the first ten days

of life, and weight gain in the first ten days of life.



2    Producing Healthy Babies

Maternal nutrition and health is an important determinant of birth weight. Women with low

prepregnancy weights and with inadequate weight gain tend to have smaller babies. But, the

relationship between maternal nutrition and fetal growth is nonlinear; deprivation must pass a

threshold level before birth weight is significantly affected because the fetus is protected at the

expense of the mother (Tanner 1978). Infectious disease, alcohol or drug use, smoking, and heavy

physical work can also reduce birth weight. The impact of these factors varies during gestation.

Some are felt most strongly in the third semester, when fetal weight gain is greatest; others are

felt most strongly during the first trimester when cell growth is the greatest. Inadequate prenatal


                                                    2
care will also affect the development of the fetus, but in the past prenatal care was certainly less

effective.1

           The effects of maternal nutrition and health may extend across generations. Mother’s

birth weight predicts children’s birth weight. Using all births from the 1958 British birth cohort,

Emanuel, Alberman, and Evans (1992) find that each 100 grams of maternal birth weight increases

the birth weight of singleton births by 12 grams. Studies of maternal and paternal half-siblings

find that the intrauterine environment accounted for more of the variance of birth weight than

genetics (Morton 1955). Emanuel et al. (1999) argue that the lower birth weights of African-

American compared to white mothers may explain the persistence of black-white birth weight

differentials.

           Maternal infection predicts prematurity and stillbirths. Pre-term births are associated

with bacterial vaginosis and previous genital infections. Such maternal infections as syphilis, tox-

oplasmosis, parvovirus B-19, chorioamnionitis, and Listeria monocytogenes have been implicated

in intrauterine deaths. Other medical factors such as hemoglobinopathies and Rh sensitization

also play a role (Copper et al. 1994). Mother’s health may also play a role in stillbirths through

placental insufficiency and intrauterine growth restriction (Petersson et al. 2002). Smoking is

associated with both prematurity and stillbirths.

           Other important determinants of stillbirths, prematurity, and birth weight are the factors

that are specific to a pregnancy, such as the age of the mother, parity, the sex of the child, and

the number of births. Birth weight rises at a decreasing rate with the age of the mother, parity,

the spacing interval, and gestational age. Taller mothers have larger babies, male newborns tend

to weigh about one hundred grams more than females, and multiple births are lighter than single


   1
     In the first third of this century prenatal care was common only after the seventh month and consisted largely
of instruction of the patient in diet, exercise, and hygiene; arrangements for confinement; desirability of nursing;
the importance of regular medical exams to detect abnormalities, toxaemia, and eclampsia; and the danger signs of
pregnancy (Speert 1980).


                                                         3
births. In recent populations, prematurity is associated with teen births and with births to mothers

older than 34. A high maternal age is also associated with intrauterine fetal death. Congenital

malformations also predict stillbirths.

          Today death in the first ten days of life is mainly due to congenital factors. At the

beginning of the twentieth century babies faced a high risk of death from birth injuries. Based

upon data from New York Lying-In, Costa (1998) estimated that at least one third of deaths

were from birth injuries, often cerebral hemorrhage, suggesting that the fetal head was large in

proportion to the size of the mother’s pelvic outlet. Babies at New York Lying-In also failed to

regain their birth weight by the tenth day, largely because they were fed only every four hours,

sometimes even only every eight, rather than every two as recommended today.

          Race plays a role in the determination of pregnancy outcomes as a proxy for income,

acting as an enabling variable, that is one which permits the purchase of better nutrition or medical

care. It may also be a proxy for health habits, for familial support, for exposure to stress, or for

maternal health endowments. Researchers who regress pregnancy outcomes on race and omit

these or other inputs will overestimate the impact of race.

          Although race may partially proxy for unobservable income characteristics or for ma-

ternal nutrition and health, it is still of interest to establish the long-term trend in birth weight by

race. In addition, I also examine whether once I control for all observable factors, differences in

pregnancy outcomes by race still persist. This enables me to determine what some of the sources

of pregnancy outcome inequality by race are.



3    The Records of Johns Hopkins

The proportion of births attended by physicians was rising rapidly in the United States at the

beginning of the twentieth century, with most deliveries in the major cities attended by a physician


                                                   4
even before 1920. In Baltimore in 1915, 74 percent of births to black married mothers were

attended by a physician as were 73 percent of births to white, native-born married mothers

(Rochester 1923).2 By 1935 for the country as a whole only 6 percent of white births were

not attended by physicians. However, among blacks 55 percent of births were not attended

by physicians, mainly because most births to blacks in rural areas (places less than 2,500 in

population) were not physician attended. Thus in 1940 71 percent of rural black births were not

attended by a physician compared to 19 percent of urban black births. Virtually all white births

in 1940 in urban areas were physician attended. In cities of 250,000 or more, such as Baltimore,

differences between black and white rates of physician attendance by 1940 and 1950 were small

and most births were overseen by a physician (Vital Statistics of the United States, 1950).

              Johns Hopkins Hospital was one of the foremost teaching hospitals in the country. It

ministered to a wide population within Baltimore and the surrounding area, drawing from the

nearby neighborhoods for within hospital births and from a wider area for home births supervised

by Johns Hopkins physicians. The records of both the indoor and outdoor departments have

been preserved in the hospital archives and the construction of the sample used in this research is

described in the Data Appendix.

              The sample used in this research spans the years 1897 to 1935. Fifty-three percent

of the sample consists of births to black mothers, at a time when roughly 17 percent of all

births in the city of Baltimore were to black women.3 Black and white births were roughly

proportionately divided between the indoor and outdoor departments. However, babies born in

the indoor department were almost 300 grams lighter, were more likely to be premature, and had

stillbirth rates that were more than twice as high. It was common practice for hospitals to bring

   Rates among the foreign-born were lower, ranging from a high of 65 percent among Jews to a low of 22 percent
among Poles (Rochester 1923).

abnormal or complicated cases into the hospital, even when they occurred in the outdoor service

(Louden 1992). As discussed in the Data Appendix, hospital births are undersampled. However,

because the undersampling is too small to affect the results, unweighted results are presented.

           The clientele of Johns Hopkins was predominately upper working class. In the late

1910s and 1920s, when some socio-economic data are available, 22 percent of white fathers and

63 percent of black fathers were laborers. No father held a professional occupation. Weekly

earnings (in current dollars) were $20 for white fathers and $16 for black fathers. In contrast,

in the United States as a whole 20 percent of all non-farm male workers were laborers and

average weekly earnings in manufacturing were $22 (United States Bureau of the Census, Series

D 182-238: 139 and Series D 802-810: 170). A negligible portion of mothers of either race

worked.

           The records of Johns Hopkins show no evidence of unequal surgical treatment by race,

even though all wards were segregated and served by the white staff. Despite the trend in American

obstretics towards prophylactic forceps operation, the employment of version as a routine method

of delivery, routine episotomy, induction of labor, and Caesarian sections, interference in the

labor process at Johns Hopkins was not the norm.4 A negligible portion of mothers of either race

were given any type of pain relief such as chloroform or ether. Forceps were used in roughly

10 percent of all births, regardless of race. Caesarian section rates were also comparable across

races: roughly 1 percent of white births and 2 percent of black births.

           The 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (NMIHS) is used to investigate

black-white differentials in a modern population.5 This survey is a random sample of births in

     J. Whitridge Williams, a member of the Johns Hopkins faculty since 1896 who later became chairman of the
obstretics department, denounced this trend at the annual meeting of the Medical Society of the State of New York
in 1922 (Louden 1992: 352).
   5
     Sanderson, Emanuel, and Holt (1995) used this survey to examine the effect of maternal birth weight on child
birth weight among blacks and whites separately.

1988 and contains both birth and death certificate and interview information. It oversamples

low-birth-weight babies and all population means estimated from this survey are adjusted using

the sampling weights. In the regressions (but not the sample means), only those observations for

which maternal birth weight is known are used. Mothers who did not know their own birth weight

tended to be older, unmarried, of higher parity, shorter, and less educated. Child characteristics

did not predict the mother’s knowledge of her own birth weight controlling for the mother’s

characteristics.



4       Pregnancy Outcome Trends

Table 1 illustrates that although the birth weights of both black and white babies born in hospitals

in the early 1900s compare favorably to those of modern populations, the gap in black and white

birth weights is persistent. There was roughly a 200 gram difference in the mean birth weight of

black and white babies born at Johns Hopkins and at Boston Lying-In. There was a 240 gram

difference in the median birth weight of black and white babies born at Johns Hopkins, compared

to a 210 gram difference in 1998 for the United States as a whole.6 The proportion of babies

weighing less than 2500 grams at birth has historically been roughly double among blacks.7

           Since 1918, when national data on fetal deaths by race became available, fetal death

rates have been falling for both races, but the black rate has been roughly twice that of whites (see

Figure 1). In 1918 for every 1000 live births there were 80 stillbirths among blacks and 38 among

whites. By 1950 the number of stillbirths per 1000 live births had fallen to 32 among blacks and

17 among whites. By 1996 fetal deaths per 1000 live births were 11 among blacks and 6 among


    6
    In 1950, the black-white birth weight difference was only 70 grams and black births were up to 100 grams higher
than in subsequent years. Why black babies fared so much better in 1950 is unclear.
    7
    The weight of black babies was similar to that of babies born in Europe. For example, the mean weight of babies
born at the Allgemeines Krankenhaus in Vienna between 1910 and 1930 was 3,143 grams (Ward 1993).


                                                        7
whites.

           Less is known about long-run racial trends in prematurity rates. In 1960, 6 percent

of white births were premature (less than 37 weeks gestation) compared to 12 percent of black

births. By 1998 10 percent of white births and 17 percent of black births were premature (Vital

Statistics of the United States, various issues).

           Tables 2 and 3 use the Johns Hopkins data and the 1988 NMIHS to illustrate long-run

trends in pregnancy outcomes. The tables show a persistent gap in black and white prematurity

rates. The tables also show that intrauterine deaths are rare today, but that in the past they averaged

12 percent of all births among blacks and 6 percent of all births among whites. Per 1000 live

births these represent 132 fetal deaths among blacks and 66 fetal deaths among blacks, higher

than the national averages but similar to fetal death rates for the city of Baltimore as a whole.8

Note that when birth weight is calculated for both stillbirths and live births, the data show a rising

birth weight trend, suggesting that declining stillbirth rates may explain the constancy of live birth

weight. Including stillbirths magnifies black-white birth weight differentials, particularly in the

Johns Hopkins data.

           Tables 2 and 3 also show that death in the first ten days of life is rare today. In the

past, these early deaths were more common among whites than among blacks and white full-term

babies who survived lost weight by day 10 whereas black babies gained weight.


   8
   In 1922, the fetal death rate in Baltimore was 126 per 1000 live births among blacks and 58 per 1000 live births
among whites (see the 1922 edition of Birth, Stillbirth, Infant Mortality Statistics).

5    Empirical Framework

I examine the factors that mediate the effects of race on birth outcomes by running regressions of

the form,


                                           yi =   + Wi + ui                                      (1)

                                  yi =    + Wi + Xi + ui                                       (2)


where   yi is the dependent variable, W is a dummy equal to one if the child was white, X is a
vector of control variables, and u is an error term. For the Johns Hopkins sample, I estimate probit

regressions where the dependent variables are indicator variables equal to one if the child was

born premature, was born stillborn, or died within 10 days of birth and I estimate OLS regressions

where the dependent variables are equal to birth weight or weight gain during the ten days spent in

the hospital. For the 1988 NMIHS, I estimate a probit regression where the dependent variable is

an indicator variable equal to one if the child was born premature and I estimate OLS regressions

where the dependent variable is birth weight. All regressions using the NMIHS are weighted.

            I will examine how  , the coefficient on the white dummy, changes as I control for

additional characteristics. Because the order in which additional characteristics are controlled

for will determine whether controlling for one specific characteristic has a large effect, I will test

for robustness by varying the order in which characteristics are controlled for. Note that this

methodology assumes that the black and white birth weight production functions are the same.

Running separate regressions for blacks and whites did not reveal any significant differences in

the black and white birth weight production functions.

            Table 4 lists the control variables in the Johns Hopkins sample used in the regressions

and shows how they differ by race. Black births were of lower gestational age, were more likely to

be home births, were somewhat more likely to be to unmarried mothers, were to younger mothers,

                                                  9
and were to mothers who were more likely to have syphilis. Black mothers were in labor longer

and were more likely to breast-feed their children. The higher propensity of black mothers to

breast-feed their children relative to white, native-born mothers in Baltimore was noted in the

Children’s Bureau study of infant mortality among babies born in 1915 (Rochester 1923).

           The differences in maternal syphilis rates shown in Table 4 are particularly striking.

During World War I the annual rate of rate of men infected with syphilis entering the army was

5 percent and that of men infected with gonorrhea was 23 percent (Brandt 1987: 231). A study

of six southern rural counties by the Julius Rosenwald Fund and by the United States Public

Health Service just before the Great Depression reported that in the richest county and the one

with the best medical care (provided by the University of Virginia Hospital), syphilis rates among

African-Americans were 8.9 percent whereas in the poorest county (which was also home of the

later notorious Tuskegee Institute) syphilis rates were 39.8 percent (Parran 1937: 161-174). A

widely advertised public health campaign carried out in Chicago between 1937 and 1940 which

provided free syphilis tests and free treatment showed that syphilis rates could be sharply lowered

with treatment. More than 60 percent of all cases treated under the Chicago program came from

the city’s black wards where health facilities were grossly inadequate and infection rates were

high (Brandt 1987: 152).9

           Table 5 shows how black and white mothers differ in terms of their characteristics in

the 1988 NMIHS. Black mothers are of higher parity, are much less likely to be married, are

younger, are less likely to be smokers, are less well-educated, are taller, gain less weight during

their pregnancies, were born with a lower birth weight, and are less likely to breast-feed their


   9
    Differential syphilis rates by race may explain the high rates of childlessness among ever married black women
observed in metropolitan areas. In Baltimore, 17 percent of ever married black women age 40-49 were childless
whereas only 8 percent of their white counterparts were. In all metropolitan areas of the United States the respective
percentages were 18 and 12. In contrast, in non-metropolitan areas the proportion of ever married women age 40-49
who were childless was 9 percent among whites and 8 percent among blacks.



                                                         10
children.

            The two samples show a large increase in the proportion of unmarried black mothers,

mirroring the trend for the nation as a whole. Ruggles (1994) reports that in 1910 95 percent of

white children and 80 percent of black children age 0-4 were living with both parents. In 1980

87 percent of white children in that age group were living with both parents, but only 46 percent

of their black counterparts were doing so.

            In the Johns Hopkins sample, control variables in the preterm, stillbirth, and birth

weight regressions include parity, parity squared, dummy variables equal to one if the child was

male, if it was a home birth, and if the mother was married, the number of prenatal visits, the

mother’s age, a dummy equal to one if the mother was foreign-born, a dummy equal to one if the

mother had syphilis, dummies indicating whether the birth was in the summer (June-August), fall

(September-November), winter (December-February), and spring (March-May), and dummies

indicating the decade of birth (before 1910, in the 1910s, and in the 1920s or later). The stillbirth

and birthweight regressions also control for prematurity using a dummy variable or gestational

age in weeks. Control variables in the death by day 10 regressions include birth weight, either a

dummy variable for prematurity or gestational age in weeks, a dummy equal to one if the child

was breast-fed, parity, parity squared, a dummy equal to one if the child was male, a dummy

equal to one if the mother was married, the number of prenatal visits, the mother’s age, dummy

variables equal to one if the mother was foreign-born, if the mother had syphilis, if forceps were

used, or if extraction was used, the observed length of labor in hours, seasonal dummies, and a

dummy equal to one if the child was born in the 1920s or later. Control variables in the weight gain

regressions include dummy variables indicating if the child was fed breast-milk only, breast-milk

and formula, or formula only, gestational age in weeks, parity, parity squared, a dummy equal

to one if the child was male, a dummy equal to one if the mother was married, the number of

prenatal visits, the mother’s age, a dummy equal to one if the mother was foreign-born, a dummy


                                                 11
equal to one if the mother had syphilis, seasonal dummies, and a dummy equal to one if the birth

was in the 1920s or later.

          In the NMIHS, control variables in the prematurity regressions are parity, parity squared,

dummies equal to one if the child was male or the mother was married, the mothers’ age, dummies

equal to one if the mother ever had a prenatal visit, was foreign-born, was a smoker, had high

alcohol use (more than 8 drinks a week in the 3 months before finding out about the pregnancy),

dummies for educational level (less than high school, high school, some college, and college),

mother’s height, and mother’s birth weight. The birth weight regressions control for these factors

as well as prematurity, gestational age, mother’s weight gain, and mother’s birth weight.



6    Birth Outcomes and Race at Johns Hopkins

Table 6 shows that maternal syphilis explains 33 percent of the difference in prematurity rates

between black and white babies. Although maternal syphilis significantly predicts stillbirths, it

does not explain differences in black-white stillbirth rates. Differences in black-white prematurity

rates explain 41 percent of the difference in black-white stillbirth rates. No other observable factors

explained differences in black-white prematurity or stillbirth rates.

          The only observable characteristic that predicted differences in black-white birth weights

was prematurity or gestational age. For all births, black-white differences in prematurity rates

explained 18 percent of the difference in birth weights controlling for all other observables. Once

prematurity was controlled for, maternal syphilis no longer had a statistically significant effect

on birth weight. For full-term births controlling for gestational age explained 9 percent of the

difference between black-white birth weights controlling for all other observables.

          A strongly significant predictor of birth weight was season of birth. Babies born in the

spring (March-May) weighted 73 to 81 grams less than babies born in the summer (June-August),


                                                  12
perhaps because of the nutritional stress their mothers experienced during the winter months.

A study of a rural North Carolina mill town begun in 1939 found that in spring vitamin levels

were at their lowest point (Beardsley 1987: 204). When season of birth was defined by quarter,

then babies born during the second quarter (April-June) were significantly more likely to be born

prematurely than babies born in other quarters. Season of birth did not predict stillbirth.10

              Low birth weight babies were more likely to die within 10 days of birth (see Table 8).

Each additional kilogram decreased the probability of death of full-term babies by 0.003, a 21

percent decrease from the baseline mortality probability of 0.010.11 But, despite their higher

birth weights, full-term white babies were significantly more likely to die within 10 days of birth

than black babies (see Table 8). Being white lowered a full-term baby’s probability of survival

by 0.005 controlling for birth weight, gestational age, and other characteristics. However, once I

control for breast-feeding, being white lowered a baby’s probability of survival by the statistically

insignificant amount of 0.002, suggesting that differences in breast feeding practices explain at

least 60 percent of the difference in black-white survival rates.

              The relationship between birth weight and death was not strictly linear.12 Compared to

babies weighing over 2500 but less than 4500 grams, babies weighing more than 4500 grams had

a probability of dying within the first 10 days of life that was greater by 0.29. Babies weighing

less than 2500 grams had a probability of death that was greater by 0.14. The use of forceps was

associated with a higher risk of death of the child, raising the probability of death by 0.01. The


   10
      Goldin and Margo (1989) did not find a statistically significant effect of season of birth on birth weight in the
Philadelphia Almshouse. Ward (1993: 62) found that babies born in Vienna in the fall during the crisis years of
1916-1922 had higher birth weights than those born in other months. In the Johns Hopkins data the proportion
of full-term births occurring in the spring was the lowest among blacks, but among whites the lowest proportion
occurred in the fall. Either preferences or seasonality across occupations are potential explanations.
  11
     This baseline probability is higher than that reported in Table 2 because this sample excludes observations where
the type of feeding is unknown.
  12
       Controlling for non-linearities does not affect black-white survival differences.

results suggest that birth injury was an important determinant of surviving the first ten days of

life, consistent with evidence from New York Lying-In (Costa 1998) and from the Philadelphia

Almshouse (Goldin and Margo 1989).

          The effects of feeding practices are evident in weight gain in the first 10 days of life.

White babies gained less weight than black babies, even controlling for birth weight (not shown).

But, controlling for feeding practices explains 21 percent of the difference in black-white weight

gain. Babies fed formula only lost 247 grams relative to babies fed breast-milk only. Babies fed

a combination of breast-milk and formula lost 130 grams relative to babies fed breast-milk only.

At the beginning of the century, the prevalence of breast feeding was falling both in the Johns

Hopkins sample and in the United States as a whole (Apple 1987), thereby leading to less weight

gain among babies born in the 1920s or later relative to babies born earlier.

          The data do not allow me to determine whether it was breast feeding per se that was

beneficial to children or whether breast feeding was associated with more frequent feeding. At

New York Lying-In insufficient feeding, not the type of feeding, predicted poor weight gain (Costa

1998). Babies born in the winter experienced poorer weight gain compared to babies born in the

summer. When the seasons are divided into quarters, babies born in the second and third quarters

(April-September) fare better than babies born in the fourth quarter (October-December).

          The relatively good fortune of black babies in the first ten days of life spent in the

hospital probably did not outlast their stay. The Children’s Bureau study of infant mortality in

Baltimore in 1915 revealed a steep gradient between infant mortality and family income, because

a higher income enabled families to buy lower room congestion, sanitary equipment, and less

work away from home for the pregnant mother (Rochester 1923).

          A relatively large proportion of the black-white gap in prematurity rates, stillbirth

rates, and birth weights still remains unexplained – two-thirds of the black-white prematurity

gap, 59 percent of the black-white stillbirth gap, and 91 percent of the black-white full-term


                                                14
birth weight gap. These differences cannot be explained by socioeconomic differentials. Using

the small subsample that contains socioeconomic information shows that controlling for either

father’s occupational status or income does not affect differences in prematurity or stillbirth rates.

Controlling for father’s occupational status or income increases the unexplained birth weight

advantage of full-term white babies.



7    Birth Outcomes and Race in 1988

Such social factors as the mother’s marital status play a much more important role today than

in the past in explaining black-white differences in rates of prematurity and in birth weight.

Table 10 shows that differences in marital status explain 16 percent of the black-white difference

in prematurity rates. Other observable factors have very little effect on prematurity rates. Marital

status is also a statistically significant predictor of birth weight and explains 10 percent of the

black-white difference in birth weights (see Table 11). Controlling for parity, the sex of the child,

the mother’s age, her use of prenatal care, whether the mother was foreign-born, maternal smoking

and alcohol use, maternal education, and maternal height has no effect on the black-white birth

weight gap (not shown). However, once I control for marital status, the birth weight gap falls

from 307 to 280 grams for all births and from 210 to 188 grams for full-term births.

          Maternal birth weight has a statistically significant on the child’s birth weight. An extra

100 grams in maternal birth weight increases child birth weight by 16 grams for all births and by

14 grams for full-term births. In a probit in which the dependent variable is whether the full-term

child weighed less than 2500 grams at birth, each kilogram of maternal birth weight lowers the

probability of low birth weight by 0.008. In the OLS regressions racial differences in maternal

birth weight explain roughly 5 percent of the difference in black-white birth weights both for

all births and for full-term births. If I control for maternal birth weight prior to controlling for


                                                 15
marital status, prematurity or gestational age, or maternal weight gain, then birth weight accounts

for 8 percent of the difference in black-white birth weights. Maternal birth weight was not a

statistically significant predictor of prematurity.

          Prematurity was the most important predictor of birth weight for all births. Differences

in prematurity rates explain roughly 32 percent of the black-white weight gap for all births. For

full-term births, gestational age explains only 7 percent of the black-white gap (regression not

shown), roughly comparable to the 8 percent that is explained by differences in maternal weight

gain.

          Including the logarithm of total household income (not shown) can further explain the

black-white birth weight difference, but the effects are small. (Controlling for income in the

prematurity regressions yields a small and insignificant coefficient on income and only a very

small reduction in the black-white birth prematurity gap.) For all births, the coefficient on income

was insignificant (ˆ   =19.557, ˆ =14.889) and reduced the coefficient on the white dummy from
165.9 to 159.1, thus suggesting that income differences explain only up to 2 percent of the black-

white birth weight difference. For full-term births, the coefficient on income was statistically

significant at the 10 percent level (ˆ   =22.414, ˆ =13.743) and reduced the coefficient on the
white dummy from 146.4 to 139.4, thus implying that income differences account for 3 percent

of the black-white birth weight differential.

          The richer control variables available in the NMIHS compared to the Johns Hopkins

data do not permit me to explain a greater proportion of the black-white gap in prematurity

rates. Two-thirds of the gap is still unexplained. However, because I can control for maternal

weight gain and maternal birth weight in the NMIHS, I can explain up to 30 percent of the

black-white difference in birth weights, leaving only 70 percent unexplained compared to 91

percent unexplained in the Johns Hopkins sample. Future research may need to focus on better

measures of the mother’s early life and current health status, on her current nutritional status, and


                                                  16
on her sources of familial support. For example, among low-income pregnant women, zincintake

is lower among blacks than among whites (Neggers et al. 1998). Racial differences in ascending

infection and upper genital tract colonization of the chorioamnionic interface may help explain

racial differences in premature births (Goldenberg et al. 1996).



8    Conclusion

Over the twentieth century the differential in black-white pregnancy outcomes has been persistent.

Differences in prematurity rates account for the biggest observable share of the black-white gap

in birth weights, both in the past and today. Some of the persistence in the birth weight gap

may be explained by intergenerational factors. Intergenerational factors, as proxied by maternal

birth weight, accounted for 5 to 8 percent of the gap in recent data, implying that the role of

maternal birth weight is as important as that of maternal weight gain and is much larger than

that of family income. But, many of the explanations for relatively poor outcomes of black

pregnancies have changed. In the early twentieth century untreated syphilis was the primary

observable explaining differences in black-white prematurity and stillbirth rates. Today the

primary observable explaining differences in prematurity rates is the low marriage rate of black

women, a significant social change that dates from the 1960s. Differential marriage rates also

play an important role in explaining the recent black-white birth weight gap.

          Trends in birth weights, including those of full-term births, by race have remained

roughly constant over the twentieth century and prematurity rates have increased slightly since

the 1960s. In contrast, stillbirth and infant mortality rates fell sharply, coincident with declines in

infectious disease in the first half of the twentieth century and improvements in the technology of




                                                  17
birth in the second half of the twentieth century.13 Birth weights in the past may have compared

favorably with those today because many low-birth-weight babies who were stillborn in the past

would have survived with modern obstetrical knowledge and a modern disease environment.

The constancy in live birth weights over the twentieth century suggests that explanations for

improvements in health at older ages may need to focus either on other measures of intrauterine

growth retardation or on changes in the disease environment, changes that affected all age groups

but that were particularly important in the first five years of life.



Data Appendix

The Johns Hopkins sample consists of 1911 births, including still-births and infant deaths. The

first step in the construction of the sample was the creation of indexes of births that occurred at the

Johns Hopkins Hospital or through the Johns Hopkins Out-door Obstretical Department between

1897 and 1935. Random samples of births were then drawn from the two indexes in proportion to

the size of the two indexes. 1472 hospital births and 990 out-door births were selected for a total

sample size of 2462 births. However, only 1911 births were then found among the births records

because all births for the same mother at Johns Hopkins Hospital are filed together with that

mother’s last birth. Thirty-seven percent of births from the hospital sample could not be found

and two percent of births from the home births sample could not be found. First-born children

whose siblings were also born at Johns Hopkins Hospital have a lower probability of being found.

Two hundred sibling birth records were also collected for mothers who delivered other children

through Johns Hopkins Hospital, but these records were not used in the analysis.

           Using sample weights that account for the over-representation of home births in the

whites and the persistence of a racial gap.


                                                      18
Johns Hopkins sample does not materially change the results. Mean birth weights are lower by

only 20 to 30 grams. Table 1 presented both the unweighted and weighted results. The other

tables are all unweighted.

         The 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey consists of separate random

samples of national live birth, fetal deaths, and infant deaths linked to questionnaires mailed to

mothers. The response rate on questionnaires was 74 percent for live births, 69 percent for fetal

deaths, and 65 percent for infant deaths. Because fetal and infant deaths are over-sampled sample

weights must be used to obtain national estimates.

Note. Slave birth weights are from Steckel (1986) and are inferred from height at young ages. The data for
the Philadelphia Almshouse are from Goldin and Margo (1989). The data from Boston are from Ward (1993:
148-149). The data for New York Lying-In are from Costa (1998). The data for the US are from various
issues of Vital Statistics of the United States. Race is determined by the race of the mother. The weighted
Johns Hopkins birth weights are more representative of the Johns Hopkins clientele (see the Data Appendix
for details).

1729 observations. The sample was restricted to singleton births. The dependent variable for the regressions labeled
prematurity is a dummy equal to one if the child was born prematurely. The dependent variable for the regressions
labeled stillbirths is a dummy variable equal to one if the child was stillborn. Standard errors are in parentheses. The
symbols , y, and z indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent level, respectively. Derivatives are from a probit
model. Derivatives for dummy variables give the change from 0 to 1.

The sample of all births contains 789 observations and the sample of full-term births contains 577 observations. The
sample was restricted to live, singleton births born in the hospital. The dependent variable is a dummy equal to one if
the child died by day 10. The symbols , y, and z indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent level, respectively.
Derivatives are from a probit model. Derivatives for dummy variables give the change from 0 to 1.
