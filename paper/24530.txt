                                          ABSTRACT

There has long been interest in the extent to which effects of social stratification extend and
persist across generations. We take a novel approach to this question by asking whether birth
order and sibling group size in the parental generation influences the educational attainment of
their children. To address this question we use Swedish population data on cohorts born
1960-1982. To study the effects of parental birth order and family size we apply a cousin fixed
effects design and exploit information on twin births in the parents generation. Relative to having
a first-born mother, having a second-born or fifth-born mother is associated with educational
attainment at age 30 being 4% and 8% of a standard deviation lower, respectively. After adjusting
for attained parental education and social class, the parental birth order effect is heavily
attenuated. Nevertheless, we do find that children who share the same birth order and gender as
their parents attain slightly more education, and this is particularly pronounced when the parents
have higher levels of education themselves. We do not find clear or consistent evidence for
parental sibling group size effects. Overall our results suggest that birth order and family size
effects operate through a Markovian process of transmission.

                                           I NTRODUCTION

    Research on the intergenerational transmission of status has a long history in the social sciences,
and studies have consistently documented the importance of the family of origin for socioeconomic
attainment (e.g. Sorokin, 1927; Blau and Duncan, 1967; Erikson and Goldthorpe, 1992; Ermisch,
Jantti, and Smeeding, 2012). In recent years there has been a growing interest in the influence that
grandparental socioeconomic status (SES) has on the attainment of grandchildren. A majority of
studies have suggested that grandparental wealth and SES does influence the outcomes of grand-
children, even net of parental characteristics (Anderson, Sheppard, and Monden, 2018). Typically,
these studies have pursued one of two strategies. Some research has regressed individuals’ social
statuses (education, occupation or income) on their grandparent(s)’ SES, holding their parents’
values on these measures constant. A residual effect of grandparental characteristics on grand-
offspring holding the intervening generation constant is seen as evidence of a non-Markovian pro-
cess of status transmission (e.g. see Warren and Hauser, 1997; Zeng and Xie, 2014; Hällsten and
Pfeffer, 2017). Another approach decomposes variance in SES measures into a nuclear family
component (sibling correlation) and an extended family component (cousin correlation). In this
model, grandparents’ characteristics need not be measured, and the interpretation of the cousin
correlation is that it captures the omnibus effect of grandparents net of unmeasured, immediate
family effects (Jæger, 2012; Hällsten, 2014).
    This literature on stratification and social mobility suggests that there are indeed multigener-
ational processes of status transmission over and above a two-generational Markovian process.
However, recent work suggests that grandparental effects may be an artifact of measurement error
(Lundberg, 2018), particularly at the parental level (Ferrie, Massey, and Rothbaum, 2016). After
such attenuation-inducing error is corrected, evidence of a multigenerational transmission of sta-
tus disappears, and stratification seems to follow a two-generation Markovian model (Ferrie et al.,
2016). Within this literature the multigenerational impact of demographic factors within the family
has received much less attention than the multigenerational impact of socioeconomic conditions
(Mare, 2011). This is unfortunate, as within-family sociodemographic factors such as birth order or
   INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF BIRTH ORDER AND FAMILY SIZE ON EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT               3

sibling group size are measured with much less error than, say, education, occupational prestige, or
income. As a consequence, research on the multigenerational impact of birth order or family size
would be much less vulnerable to bias from measurement error, and would therefore shine a clear
light on whether intergenerational transmission processes follow a Markovian model or not. Fur-
thermore, to date research on the multigenerational transmission of advantage has focused largely,
if not exclusively, on differences across families rather than within families. Although parental so-
cioeconomic status and household income are powerful predictors of offspring attainment, sibling
correlations on high school grades, educational attainment, and earnings in adulthood demonstrate
that there are substantial differences in outcomes even amongst children who share the same par-
ents (Conley, 2004; Björklund and Jäntti, 2012; Grätz et al., 2016). These differences in sibling
outcomes suggest that there are important inequality generating processes operating even within
families, and that processes of cumulative advantage based upon differences in relative access to
resources within the household can lead to substantial differences in outcomes in the long-run, and
potentially even over subsequent generations.
  For these reasons, in the present study we seek to go beyond previous research examining
whether grandparental SES influences grandchildren to ask whether grandparental fertility affects
grandchild outcomes. In doing so we also attempt to address a broader question, which is: do
inequality generating processes within families, such as differences in parental investment, have
effects on the attainment of the subsequent generation? We address these questions by examin-
ing whether birth order and sibling group size in the parental generational are associated with the
educational attainment of their children. We consider parental birth order and sibling group size
a grandparental variable and its putative effect a three-generational effect because it is the grand-
parents’ fertility that determines the parents’ birth order and sibling group size, which may in turn
affect their offspring’s attainment, net of the grandchildren’s own birth order and sibling group
size. When sibling group size is held constant in an OLS model, or a family fixed effects analy-
sis, birth order can be considered randomly assigned. Therefore, examining the multigenerational
impact of birth order allows us to approximate the notion of a ‘treatment’ to the parental genera-
tion. The same applies to sibling group size in the parental generation if we use a twin birth at the
4                                   BARCLAY, LYNGSTAD, CONLEY

grandparental generation as a exogenous shock to family size. If there are intergenerational birth
order and family size effects in this context (net of each generation’s fertility and ego’s birth order
and sibling group size), then it is reasonable to assume that three-generational effects are real (at
least for birth order and family size). Furthermore, if there are no net effects once parental charac-
teristics known to be influenced by birth order are controlled, then the random assignment nature
of birth order within families offers the potential to consider parental birth order as an instrumental
variable for parental education – an important background variable in the stratification literature
for which there have been few, if any, instruments (Angrist and Keueger, 1991; Bound, Jaeger, and
Baker, 1995; Lleras-Muney, 2005).
    Our study is predicated on several points. First, in line with previous research, we assume that
relative differences in childhood investment lead to potentially large differences in later attainment
due to processes of cumulative advantage (Merton, 1968; DiPrete and Eirich, 2006; Heckman,
2006), that these relative differences in resources are consequential even when the absolute level
of resources is high (Marmot, 2004), and that differences in parental attainment can affect offspring
attainment (Holmlund, Lindahl, and Plug, 2011). Second, as we will argue, birth order can be used
as a valuable indicator for relative levels of parental investment and access to resources within
the family, and particularly indexes access to resources in the crucial early years of life. Thus,
our interest in birth order is primarily driven by how this factor marks access to resources and
parental investment during childhood. Research on birth order has been criticized on the grounds
that it lacks policy relevance. However, the fact that birth order is essentially random and not
amenable to policy intervention is also a strength when it is considered as a random assignment to
relative advantage in terms of resource access and parental investment during childhood. We also
use sibling group size, instrumented using twin births as an exogenous shock on family size, as a
second indicator of resource dilution in the family, following the classic quantity-quality trade-off
assumption (e.g. see Becker and Lewis, 1973; Becker and Tomes, 1976). Finally, we argue that
the microcosm of the family is uniquely suited for studying how inequality generating processes
related to relative access to resources and cumulative advantage produce differences in attainment,
   INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF BIRTH ORDER AND FAMILY SIZE ON EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT                5

as the family context allows us to study the influence of these factors net of shared genetics, and
the shared contextual environment.
  Another motivating factor for the present research is the idea that parental birth order may act
as a moderator for ego’s birth order. A handful of existing studies indicate differential inheritance
of parental characteristics by birth parity. For example, Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2009)
examined the IQ scores of Norwegian military conscripts and found that the natural logarithm
of ability is more weakly inherited by first-born sons than by later-borns. It should be added
that this effect was barely significant despite almost 25,000 cases, and disappeared when ability
was not logged. Conversely, Lindahl (2008) reported that the strength of transmission of labor
market earnings decreased with increasing parity in Sweden; she also reported that transmission
was weaker in larger family sizes. One intuition behind birth order effects, at least as articulated
by Lindahl (2008), is that later-borns may feel less attachment to their parents, they may be more
influenced by older siblings (and thus less so by parents) and they may experience father absence
more frequently and for longer durations. It may also be the case that there are higher order
interactions at work; namely, it could be that transmission is stronger when fathers identify with
particular offspring in terms of birth order. In other words, a last-born father may identify more
strongly with his last-born son (and vice versa) resulting in a higher correlation than with earlier-
born sons. Or, alternatively, there could be a magnified effect of dissociation from the family such
that later-born offspring to later-born fathers resemble each other the least. In such a model, birth
order would be a relational variable of parent-offspring identification and investment. That is, there
may be heterogeneous effects of birth order contingent on parental birth order (and/or gender) that
are averaged out by only looking at a single generation’s parity.



Within-Family Inequality Generating Processes. The vast majority of research on how fam-
ily background influences socioeconomic attainment focuses on differences across families. This
literature examines how factors such as social class, education, and race and ethnicity influence
opportunity structures and predict differences in the production of and transmission of skills and
resources to children. Although differences between families are enormously important for the
6                                   BARCLAY, LYNGSTAD, CONLEY

production and reproduction of patterns of social stratification in society, variation in how children
are raised within the family may also play an important role in explaining individual differences
in human capital formation and educational attainment. That is, the concept of a non-shared en-
vironment also has relevance within the family, particularly when one considers time-varying cir-
cumstances. Differences in how children within the same family are raised may be a consequence
of numerous factors, including changes to family structure, such as parental divorce or changes
in family size, differences in how parents treat their children, such as by gender or birth order, as
well as within-family differences in parent-child relationships (Conley, 2004; Plomin and Daniels,
1987; Suitor et al., 2008). Parents are typically reluctant to report that they treat their children
differently, but children do perceive substantial differences. Studies show that parental self-reports
on how they treat each of their children are much more highly correlated than how children per-
ceive they are treated (Daniels et al., 1985; Reiss et al., 2009). Furthermore, it is the childrens’
perceptions that are corroborated by independent observers (Reiss et al., 2009).
    Although full siblings share the same parents and kin network, live in the same house and neigh-
bourhood, and often attend the same schools, there are substantial sibling differences in socioeco-
nomic attainment. Sibling correlations on cognitive ability and educational and socioeconomic out-
comes in Sweden have been estimated at 0.51 for high school GPA (Björklund, Lindahl, and Sund,
2003), 0.39 for educational attainment, 0.47 for IQ, and 0.22 for long-run earnings (Björklund
and Jäntti, 2012). These correlations reflect the influence of both shared genetics and shared envi-
ronment, and indicate that while there are substantial similarities amongst siblings in attainment,
non-shared environment is important for explaining differences in sibling outcomes (Plomin and
Daniels, 1987). One factor that consistently captures systematic sources of advantage in the sib-
ling group is birth order. Research suggests that first- and earlier-born siblings are advantaged over
later-born siblings on many dimensions. Studies show that parents differentially invest time, care,
and resources in first-born and earlier-born siblings relative to later-borns, both during pregnancy
and during childhood. Mothers are more likely to seek prenatal care for first-born children (Buck-
les and Kolka, 2014), they are more likely to breast feed first-borns (Buckles and Kolka, 2014),
   INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF BIRTH ORDER AND FAMILY SIZE ON EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT                  7

and they take longer periods of parental leave to spend with first-borns (Sundström and Duvan-
der, 2002). Research in the United States indicates that parents regulate the television watching
and monitor the school performance of first-borns to a greater extent than they do for later-born
children (Hotz and Pantano, 2015). Studies also indicate that, particularly in middle class fam-
ilies, younger children can be hostages to the activities and schedules of older children, whose
cultivation is prioritised by the parents over that of the younger children (Lareau, 2011).
  Parents also spend more time with first-borns than later-borns, with some estimates suggesting
that parents spend 20-30 minutes more quality time per day with first-borns than second-borns
of the same age (Price, 2008). An important factor explaining this difference in quality time is
structural change in the sibling group attributable to changes in family size, which leads to the
dilution of parental resources (Blake, 1989). By definition parents have relatively more time for
their first-born child during the early years of life than they have for later-born children, as parental
time is finite, and family size is a time-varying factor during the life course. According to the
resource dilution hypothesis, first-borns will typically be the most advantaged amongst a group of
siblings precisely because they spend a period of time with exclusive access to parental attention
and various other parental resources. Studies indicate that these early years can be crucial for child
development. Although this has been shown most dramatically by examining severely deprived
children (Rutter, 1998), it is also clear that early life investment has an important impact on reading
ability and numeracy even amongst children who are not deprived (Stanovich, 1986; Bast and
Reitsma, 1998; Sénéchal and LeFevre, 2002; Cheadle, 2008).
  A second theory concerned with structural changes to the sibling group is the confluence hy-
pothesis (Zajonc and Markus, 1975; Zajonc, 1976). The confluence hypothesis also posits that
earlier-born siblings should be advantaged over later-born siblings, but argues that this is due to
the average degree of intellectual stimulation in the household. First-borns interact exclusively
with their parents, which is highly cognitively stimulating, until the birth of any later siblings. This
is presumed to be beneficial for cognitive development. Later-borns, however, interact not only
with the parents, but will also spend much time interacting with their other infant siblings, who
offer much less cognitive stimulation. This in turn may have negative long-term consequences.
8                                    BARCLAY, LYNGSTAD, CONLEY

Indeed, studies show that later-born children have lower cognitive ability and educational attain-
ment than first-borns (Black, Devereux, and Salvanes, 2005a; Bjerkedal, Kristensen, Skjeret, and
Brevik, 2007; Barclay, 2015b).
    As this body of theoretical and empirical research would suggest, there are also consistent birth
order differences in academic achievement. Studies that have compared siblings within the same
family have consistently shown that later-borns have a lower GPA than first- and earlier-born sib-
lings (Kalmijn and Kraaykamp, 2005), are less likely to graduate from high school (Härkönen,
2014), or to go to university (Barclay, 2018), and have lower completed educational attainment
(Black, Devereux, and Salvanes, 2005a). In Sweden second-borns, third-borns and fourth-borns
typically achieve around 30%, 40%, and 50% of a year less education than first-borns by age 30,
respectively (Barclay, 2015a). Past work strongly suggests that these birth order differences in
attainment are attributable to differences in how children are raised rather than any biological dif-
ferences between siblings or differences in the in utero environment by parity. Studies on sibling
groups where social and biological birth order differ, such as sibling groups where a child has died,
or sibling groups of adopted children, show that it is social birth order that explains differences in
attainment rather than biological order (Kristensen and Bjerkedal, 2007; Barclay, 2015a). Fur-
thermore, it is worth noting that biomedical factors actually predict worse long-term outcomes for
first-born children, who are more likely to be born with low birth weight (Kramer, 1987), and to be
born pre-term (Astolfi and Zonta, 1999), both of which typically lead to worse long-term socioe-
conomic outcomes (Conley and Bennett, 2000; Black, Devereux, and Salvanes, 2007). Studies on
birth order and academic attainment therefore not only suggests that the first-born and earlier-born
advantage is attributable to differences in how children are raised, but also that these differences in
nurture are sufficiently great to overcome physiological disadvantages amongst first-borns at the
time of birth.
    Family size is also assumed to have a negative effect on attainment, with each additional child
leading to further dilution of resources and the attendant tradeoff between number of children and
how much attention and resources parents can devote to each one (Becker and Lewis, 1973; Becker
and Tomes, 1976; Blake, 1981). Indeed, most research correlating completed family size with the
   INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF BIRTH ORDER AND FAMILY SIZE ON EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT               9

attainment of children has shown that growing up in a larger family is negatively correlated with
educational and labor market success (Blake, 1989; Steelman et al., 2002). However, although the
effect of family size on attainment has been an object of substantial research attention, completed
family size is a rather poor way of capturing resource dilution within the family, because it assumes
that each child in a family of a given size has access to a similar pool of resources. Family size
is rather experienced as a time-varying factor, increasing as more children are born, decreasing as
others leave the home. Birth order captures this time-varying nature of resource dilution within
the family, though it does so most effectively for the first years of life, which is when parental
investment is likely to matter the most (Stanovich, 1986; Bast and Reitsma, 1998; Sénéchal and
LeFevre, 2002; Cheadle, 2008). Nevertheless, contemporary studies that have used a twin birth as
an exogenous shock on family size are still able to capture the importance of the introduction of
an additional, unexpected, sibling on resource dilution for those children that are born before the
twin birth (Rosenzweig and Wolpin, 1980).
  Past research on birth order and educational attainment not only accounts for why later-born
children should achieve lower educational attainment than first- and earlier-born siblings, but also
suggests that a child’s later-born parents should have lower educational attainment than their first-
and earlier-born aunts and uncles. If parental educational attainment has an effect on the attainment
of their children, then we would expect that the birth order of the index person’s parents should
matter for educational attainment even net of the index person’s own birth order. For example,
the first-born child of a first-born mother should achieve higher levels of educational attainment
than the first-born child of a third-born mother. We would also expect that a larger family size in
the parental generation should have a negative effect on parental attainment, which should in turn
have a negative effect on the attainment of their own children. Given that we expect that the effect
of parental birth order on offspring educational attainment is driven by later-born parents having
lower educational and occupational attainment, we expect that after we adjust for parental attained
education and social class the effect of parental birth order on offspring educational attainment
will be substantially or completely attenuated. If this is indeed the case, this would suggest that
the effect of parental birth order follows a two-generation Markovian process.

                                        DATA AND M ETHODS

Data. In this study we use Swedish population register data with multigenerational linkages to
examine how birth order and sibling group size in the parental generation is related to educational
attainment amongst their children at age 30. We examine educational attainment amongst Swedish
men and women born between 1960 and 1982, whose parents were born between 1938 and 1969.
In our analyses we focus on families where both the parents and children were born in Sweden.
In Sweden each individual has a personal identity number (PIN) that enables records to be linked
across a variety of administrative registers. The Swedish multigenerational register also contains
information on the PIN of the mother and father of any given individual. Information on the PIN
of the mother and father allows any given individual to be linked to any biological kin, including
siblings, cousins, and grandparents.
     To examine the relationship between the birth order of parents and the educational attainment of
their offspring, it is essential to have three generations of data. Information on the identity of the
grandmother and grandfather (Generation 1 [G1]) is needed to identify the birth order of the parents
(G2), while information on the fertility of the parents (G2) is need to identify the birth order of the
grandchildren (G3). We classify a sibling group (G2 and G3) as a set of individuals who share a
biological mother and father. A cousin group (G3) is based upon sharing a biological grandmother
and grandfather. Figure 1 provides a graphical illustration of our data structure. Although we
describe this in greater detail below, in the ‘Statistical Analyses’ section, a key dimension of our
study is the use of a cousin fixed effects design, which has implications for our sample selection.
We compare cousins in order to reduce confounding from factors shared amongst parents, aunts,
and uncles. These factors include grandparental socioeconomic status, which might affect both
fertility behaviour as well as the educational attainment of the parental generation (G2), and which
are unmeasured because of the early time period. This means that we exclude ‘only cousins’ from
our analysis. An ‘only cousin’ might have multiple siblings, but not have any cousins within their
own generation, either because their parents were only children, or because their aunts and uncles
did not have any children of their own. In our analyses focusing upon birth order we also exclude
   INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF BIRTH ORDER AND FAMILY SIZE ON EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT 11

sibling groups at the G2 and G3 level which experienced a multiple birth such as twins, as this
confuses the measurement of birth order. However, in our analyses of how sibling group size in
the parental generation (G2) affects offspring (G3) attainment, we utilize those sibling groups to
take advantage of the exogenous increase in family size stemming from a twin birth.

The Swedish Educational Context. Education in Sweden is state funded at all levels, and tertiary
education is free for Swedish citizens (Halldén, 2008; Högskoleverket, 2012). In Sweden family
resources are therefore less important for the transition to tertiary education than in other contexts,
such as the United States. The Swedish education system is divided into three sections: (1) 9 years
of compulsory schooling (grundskolan); (2) three additional years of secondary school (gymna-
sium); and, (3) the tertiary section (Halldén, 2008). Tertiary education in Sweden today consists of
two parts. The first is a traditional university education, with degrees at the Bachelors (kandida-
texamen), Magister (magisterexamen), Masters, Licentiate, and Doctoral levels. The second part
is a vocational tertiary education (högre yrkesutbildning/högskolor) (Halldén, 2008). Students in
tertiary education are eligible for financial support from the Swedish state for living costs in the
form of study grants and student loans with low interest rates (Högskoleverket, 2012), minimising
the need for reliance on family resources for maintenance. In 2012 approximately 33% of the
Swedish population had undergone post-secondary education, which was slightly higher than the
OECD average (Högskoleverket, 2012).

Outcome Variable. The primary outcome variable in this study is educational attainment in years,
measured in the year that the index person turned 30. This measure is based upon the number

of years that correspond to the specific level of education achieved by age 30, and may not in all
cases reflect that actual number of years that an individual spent in the educational system. We
also conduct a number of additional analyses, using high school grade point average (GPA) and
inflation-adjusted (CPI) logged earnings averaged between ages 29 to 31. The detailed results
from those analyses are included in the supplementary section of our paper, but we also describe
the results briefly in the results section below.

Control Variables. In our analyses focusing on the effects of parental birth order we adjust for a
number of different factors that may be linked to both parental (G2) and offspring (G3) birth order,
and educational attainment. We adjust our analyses for maternal sibling group size (G2), paternal
sibling group size (G2), grandmaternal age at the time of birth of the mother (G2), grandmaternal
age at the time of birth of the father (G2), and maternal and paternal birth year (G2). These
variables capture conditions at the time of birth, with the exception of parental sibling group size,
which may be not settle until later childhood. We adjust for the completed sibling group size of
the parents as there is a correlation between sibling group size and educational attainment (Black
et al., 2005a), and higher birth order siblings will be drawn from larger sibling groups. We adjust
for grandparental age at the time of birth as later-born siblings are typically born to older mother

and fathers, and advanced parental age may be associated with educational outcomes (Barclay
and Myrskylä, 2016). We control for birth year in order to adjust for educational expansion over
time (Breen et al., 2009; Breen, 2010), which is likely to benefit later-born siblings and cousins
(Barclay, 2018).

Mediator Variables. We consider two groups of variables that mediate the relationship between
parental birth order and offspring educational attainment. The first group of mediating variables
refers to sociodemographic characteristics of the grandchild generation (G3), including the birth
order of the index person (G3), the sex of the index person (G3), the sibling group size of the index
person (G3), the birth year of the index person (G3), and maternal and paternal age at the time of
the birth of the index person (G3). These factors may well be influenced by parental birth order, and
are also known to influence educational attainment. Most important amongst these is the birth year
of the index person (G3), as being born in a later calendar year during a period of rapid educational
expansion is known to be associated with a higher average educational attainment (Breen et al.,
2009; Breen, 2010).
  Our second group of mediator variables pertain to educational and socioeconomic attainment
of the parents. Our expectation is that the association between parental birth order and offspring
educational attainment operates entirely through the educational and socioeconomic attainment of
the parents. We evaluate this mechanism by adjusting for the attained education and social class of
the mother and father (G2). Maternal and paternal educational attainment is based upon the highest
attained level of educational attainment. Highest maternal and paternal educational attainment is
grouped into eight categories, which are: primary (<9 years); primary (9 years); secondary (10-11
years); secondary (12 years); tertiary (13-15 years); tertiary (15+ years); graduate school; and,
missing. Maternal and paternal social class is based upon the Erikson, Goldthorpe and Portocarero
occupational class scheme (EGP) (Erikson et al., 1979), measured between ages 30 and 40 using
information on occupation from the Swedish censuses in 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990.

Statistical Analyses.

Parental Birth Order. To examine the relationship between birth order and educational attainment
at age 30 we use linear regression with and without the application of fixed effects. We first
estimate the association between parental birth order and offspring educational attainment using
the full sample, without implementing fixed effects:



(1)           y = β0 + βl BOl + ε

(2)           y = β0 + βl BOl + βm G2-Controlsm + ε

(3)           y = β0 + βl BOl + βm G2-Controlsm + βn G3-Mediatorsn + ε

(4)           y = β0 + βl BOl + βm G2-Controlsm + βn G3-Mediatorsn + βo G2-Mediatorso + ε




where y refers to years of educational attainment at age 30, BO refers to a vector of the birth order of
the mother (G2) and father (G2), G3-Controls refers to a vector of the control variables at the level
of the third-generation, G2-Controls refers to a vector of the control variables at the level of the
second-generation, and G2-Mediators refers to a vector of the G2 mediating variables, i.e. attained
socioeconomic status and educational attainment of the parents. Model 1 estimates the total effect
of maternal and paternal birth order on offspring educational attainment. Model 2 adjusts for
confounding factors measured at the time of the parents birth, and Models 3 and 4 successively
introduce control variables for mediating variables at the G3 and G2 level, respectively. Models 1,
2, 3, and 4 are OLS models that use the full population. Descriptive statistics for the population
used to estimate Models 1, 2, 3, and 4 are shown in Table 2.
      INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF BIRTH ORDER AND FAMILY SIZE ON EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT 17

  Our fixed effects analyses are based upon a shared grandparental ID, meaning that we compare
full biological cousins. Since an individual can have two sets of cousins, we have two analytical
samples: maternal cousin groups, and paternal cousin groups. Our cousin fixed effects analyses
are therefore based upon the following six models:



(5)      yi j = β0 + βl BOl,i j + βm G2-Controlsm,i j + α j + εi j

(6)      yi j = β0 + βl BOl,i j + βm G2-Controlsm,i j + βn G3-Mediatorsn,i j + α j + εi j

(7)      yi j = β0 + βl BOl,i j + βm G2-Controlsm,i j + βn G3-Mediatorsn,i j + βo G2-Mediatorso,i j + α j + εi j

(8)      yik = β0 + βl BOl,ik + βm G2-Controlsm,ik + δk + εik

(9)      yik = β0 + βl BOl,ik + βm G2-Controlsm,ik + βn G3-Mediatorsn,ik + δk + εik

(10)     yik = β0 + βl BOl,ik + βm G2-Controlsm,ik + βn G3-Mediatorsn,ik + βo G2-Mediatorso,ik + δk + εik




where y refers to years of educational attainment at age 30, the indexes i, j, and k refer to individual
i in maternal cousin group j, and paternal cousin group k, α is the fixed effect for maternal cousin
group j, δ is the fixed effect for paternal cousin group k, and ε is the residual. Models 5, 6, and
7 are linear regressions estimated on the maternal cousin analytical sample, implementing cousin
fixed effects. Models 8, 9, and 10 are linear regressions estimated on the paternal cousin analytical
sample, implementing cousin fixed effects. As with the OLS models without cousin fixed effects
(Models 1 to 4), we control for confounding variables measured at the time of the parents birth in
Models 5 and 8, and introduce control variables for mediating variables at the G3 and G2 level,
respectively in Models 6, 7, 9, and 10. Further descriptive statistics for the maternal cousin and
paternal cousin group samples are shown in the Supplementary Information, in Tables S1 and S2.
  We also run a number of additional analyses to examine the extent to which parental and child
birth order (and gender) moderate each other (i.e. interact) in predicting the educational attainment
of the children. For example, we examine whether sharing the same birth order has any effect on
educational attainment above and beyond the main effects of parent and child birth order. We
operationalise birth order three ways to examine these interactions. We first examine whether
18                                   BARCLAY, LYNGSTAD, CONLEY

the parents and child share the same ordinal birth order, we then examine whether they share a
similarity in being a first-, middle-, or last-born child, and finally we examine whether they are
similar in being either the first- or a later-born child. In further analyses we also examine whether
parent-child birth order and gender homophily interacts with the educational level of the parent to
influence educational attainment, and so examine whether this homophily is particularly important
when the parents have greater human capital at their disposal.


Parental Sibling Group Size. Another objective of our study is to examine how resource dilution in
the parental generation, related to family size, affects the attainment of the subsequent generation.
Since family size is endogenous, we study twin births as an exogenous shock on family size (as first
proposed by Rosenzweig and Wolpin, 1980), to examine the relationship between parental sibling
group size and educational attainment amongst their children. The Swedish Multigenerational
Register allows us to identify twins, and the parity at which the twin birth occurs. Although our
focus is on the educational attainment of the grandchild generation (G3), who are born 1960-1982,
we study how fertility and twinning in the grandparental generation (G1) affects the family size of
the parental generation (G2). As the parental generation were born between the 1930s and early
1970s, this is before the first in vitro fertilisation (IVF) assisted birth took place in Sweden in 1982;
consequently, twin births are a valid exogenous instrument for family size for the cohorts that we
study.
     To estimate these models we use a two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation strategy (Angrist
and Pischke, 2008, Chapter 4). We estimate the following equations:



(11)                   FAMILY SIZEG2 = α0 + α1 TW ING2 + α2 X + υ

(12)                             EDUG3 = β0 + β1 FAMILY SIZEG2 + β2 X + ε




where FAMILY SIZEG2 is the final family size of the mother or father, TW IN is a binary indicator
for a twin birth in the family, X is a vector of control variables, and EDUG3 is the educational
attainment of the offspring (G3) at age 30. Equation 11 is the first-stage estimation, and equation

12 the second-stage. We estimate these 2SLS models separately for the mother and father. We
control for the birth year of the mother or father, as well as the age of the grandmother (G1) at the
time of birth, as maternal age at birth is related to the probability of twinning. To estimate these
models we use what has been called the ‘twin-first’ approach (Black et al., 2009). The TW ING2
variable is a binary indicator denoting whether the nth birth was a twin or not, estimated on the
population of children born before the nth birth in families with at least n births. For example, we
estimate these models on the population of first-born children in families with at least two children,
whose mother may or may not have had a twin birth at parity 2. We estimate these models for
mothers and father separately, for values of n between 2 and 4. To be clear, twins themselves
are not included in the analysis, and the key variable pertains to whether or not an individual was
exposed to a twin birth, implying exposure to a larger family size than would otherwise have been
expected, as well as the potential consequences such as further resource dilution amongst siblings.

Parental Birth Order. We begin by presenting the results from our analyses of the relationship
between parental birth order and the educational attainment of their children at age 30. Figure 2
shows the results from models using the full population of individuals for whom it was possible
to link three generations using the Swedish register data. The results shown in Figure 2 do not
implement the cousin fixed effects approach. Figure 2 consists of four panels, successively dis-
playing the results from Models 1 to 4. These model numbers correspond to the equations detailed
in the ‘Statistical Analyses’ section above. Full results tables for these models can be seen in the
Supplementary Information, in Table S3.
  Models 1 to 4 in Figure 2 show the correlation between maternal and paternal birth order and
offspring educational attainment at age 30. The results from Model 1 are the total effects of parental
birth order, capturing all intermediary mediating processes between parental birth and offspring
educational attainment. The results from Model 1 show show that, relative to having a mother
who was first-born, having a mother who was third-born is associated with 0.07 less years of
education by age 30, and having a mother who was fifth-born is associated with 0.33 less years
of education at age 30. Likewise, having a father who was third-born is associated with 0.03 less
20                                   BARCLAY, LYNGSTAD, CONLEY

years of education by age 30, and having a father who was fifth-born is associated with 0.27 less
years of education at age 30. Introducing additional controls for parental (G2) characteristics in
Model 2 actually increases the size of the point estimates. We see that, relative to having a first-
born mother or father, having a mother or father who is second-born is associated with having
approximately 0.20 years less education by age 30, and having a mother or father who is fifth-born
or later is associated with having over 0.40 years less education by age 30. This change in the
estimates between Models 1 and 2 is related to the fact that later-born parents were on average
born into a later birth year, and as a consequence of educational expansion in Sweden they had
more educational opportunities, with consequent benefits for their own educational achievement
and subsequently the educational achievement of their children. By controlling for parental birth
cohort in Model 2 we partially adjust for those period changes in educational opportunities.
     In Models 3 and 4 we introduce additional covariates in order to control for mediating variables
at the grandchild level and the parental level. Model 3 focuses on mediating variables at the
grandchild level. The results from Model 3 are relatively similar to those from Model 2, and we
see that, relative to having a mother who was first-born, having a mother who was second-born
is associated with 0.14 less years of education by age 30, and having a mother who was fifth-
born is associated with 0.33 less years of education at age 30. Likewise, having a father who was
second-born is associated with 0.13 less years of education by age 30, and having a father who
was fifth-born is associated with 0.30 less years of education at age 30. Thus, even net of the
index person’s own birth order and birth year, amongst other factors, having a later-born parent is
associated with lower educational attainment at age 30. In relation to the summary statistics for
this population, 0.30 years of education by age 30 is equivalent to 13% of a standard deviation,
which is far from a trivial association.
     As we discuss earlier in this manuscript, we not only want to examine the association between
parental birth order and offspring educational attainment, but also to examine the pathway by which
that association operates. One possibility is that the effects of grandparental fertility outcomes (the
determinant of parental birth order) are fully channeled through parental socioeconomic attain-
ment, corresponding to a memoryless Markov process. The second possibility is that there are

multigenerational effects above and beyond the two-generation dyad. To examine whether the as-
sociation between grandparental fertility and grandchild educational attainment is a consequence
of parental birth order, in Model 4 we also introduce additional covariates for the highest level of
educational attainment of both the mother and father, as well as their attained social class position,
measured between ages 40 and 50. As Figure 2 shows, when we control for parental educational
and social class attainment, the association between parental birth order and offspring educational
attainment is significantly attenuated. Relative to having a first-born mother or father, having a
mother or father who is second-born is associated with having 0.01 years less education by age 30,
and having a mother or father who is fifth-born or later is associated with having over 0.06 years
less education by age 30. Although these are very small differences, the differences are statisti-
cally significant. Nevertheless, since these models only control for observed confounding factors,
there may be residual confounding. We now turn to our estimates using the cousin fixed effects
approach that should help us to capture unobserved confounding from factors shared within the
extended family.
22                                     BARCLAY, LYNGSTAD, CONLEY

     Figures 3 and 4 show the results from models where we implement a cousin fixed effects design,
comparing cousins from generation 3 who share grandparents. Using this approach we attempt to
control for background factors that are related to both the fertility outcomes of the grandparents
as well as the attainment of the grandchildren many years later. Such background factors could
include socioeconomic resources, as well as unobserved underlying health conditions within the
family. Figure 3 shows the results from Models 5, 6, and 7, which are based on the maternal cousin
group sample. Here we focus on the point estimates for maternal birth order, since it is unobserved
maternal background characteristics that are being effectively controlled for by comparing mater-
nal cousins to one another.
     Model 5 in Figure 3, controlling for factors fixed at the time of the parents birth, illustrates that
the relationship between maternal birth order and offspring educational attainment is somewhat
mixed, but the differences are generally not statistically significant. The only exception is that
having a fourth-born mother is positively associated with offspring educational attainment. In
Model 6, we introduce additional covariates for mediating factors measured at the level of the
index person (G3), or the grandchild generation. After controlling for G3 characteristics, most
importantly birth year, we see that having a second-born mother relative to a first-born mother is
associated with having 0.09 years less education at age 30. Furthermore, having a fifth- or later-
born mother relative to a first-born mother is associated with having 0.18 years less education at
age 30. In Model 7 we again control for the attained educational and social class of the mother
in order to examine whether effects of grandparental fertility flow only through their effects on
parental educational and socioeconomic attainment. Here we find that the effects of maternal birth
order are attenuated more severely, and the estimated effects for maternal birth order are also no
longer statistically significant.
     The reason for the difference in the estimates for maternal birth order between Models 5 and
Models 6 and 7 is related to educational expansion as well as the cousin fixed effects approach.
In the cousin fixed effects modeling approach we create a mechanical relationship between birth
order and birth year, where later borns are almost always going to be born into a later birth year
(this is completely deterministic in sibling FE model, but there is more potential for covariance
in a cousin FE model focusing on parental birth order). When we control for G3 birth year, as

we do in Model 6, we completely control away the benefits of educational expansion because
G3 is the generation whose educational attainment we are actually measuring and who benefit
directly from being born into a later birth year. By excluding a control for the birth year of G3
in Model 5 parental birth order unwittingly captures important intermediary processes, including
secular trends in educational enrollment. As a result, the estimates from Model 5 indicate that later
parental birth order tends to be associated with increasing educational attainment, but this is only
because later-born parents are also more likely to give birth in a later calendar year than their older
siblings, which then captures the increasing educational enrollment in Sweden in this period.
  The results shown in Figure 4 repeat these analyses on the sample of paternal cousins, and
here we focus on the association between the birth order of the father and offspring educational
attainment. The results for paternal birth order from Models 8, 9, and 10 correspond relatively
closely to the results for maternal birth order from Models 5, 6, and 7. In Model 8 we observe a
positive, though non statistically significant, association between paternal birth order and offspring
educational attainment. As explained above, this is primarily due to educational expansion and

the lack of a control for offspring birth year (G3). In Model 9 we find that having a second-
born father relative to a first-born father is associated with having 0.04 years less education at
age 30, and having a fifth- or later-born father relative to a first-born father is associated with
having 0.11 years less education at age 30. In Model 10 we introduce additional controls for the
father’s educational and social class attainment, and find that the effects of paternal birth order
on offspring educational attainment are reduced almost to zero, and are no longer statistically
significant. These results strongly suggest that the effects of grandparental fertility outcomes on
grandchild attainment largely, if not completely, flow through the intermediary generation.
     We have also conducted a number of robustness checks to examine the sensitivity of our results
to our statistical modeling choices. We have checked whether coding birth order according to
being first-, middle-, or last-born leads to meaningfully different results, and it does not. We
have also recoded birth order according to a first- versus later-born dichotomy, and this does not
affect the conclusions that we would draw either. We have also estimated models using a more
detailed control for parental birth year, using individual-year dummy variables rather than the

Parent-Child Birth Order Interactions. The results from models examining whether there is an
effect of parent-child birth order homophily on offspring educational attainment net of the main
effects of parental birth order and child birth order are shown in Table 3. The results shown
in Table 3 are based upon cousin fixed effects models applied to the same maternal cousin and
paternal cousin group samples used in the analyses presented above in Figures 3 and 4. These
models include the same set of control variables as Models 7 and 10 for the maternal and paternal
cousin group analyses respectively, along with an additional term for whether the parent and child
shared the same birth order position.
  We focus on displaying the point estimates for parent-child homophily, because the additional
regression output is extremely large. These results are available in full upon request. Table 3 shows
26                                   BARCLAY, LYNGSTAD, CONLEY

that we do observe an independent effect of parent-child birth order homophily, and that in most
cases this independent effect is positive and statistically significant. However, we also observe that
this effect is substantively negligible. A child who has the same birth order as the parent, whether
that is defined as the same ordinal position, also being first-, middle- or last-born, or also being a
first- versus a later-born, has 0.01 to 0.02 more years of education by age 30 relatively to his or her
cousins who were not birth order homophilous with the parents.
     Table 3 also shows the results from analyses where we examine whether there is an effect of
parent-child birth order and gender homophily. Again, these models use the same samples and set
of covariates, but include an additional term for whether the parent and child shared the same birth
order position and gender (e.g. the first-born son of a first-born father). The results in Table 3 show
that parent-child homophily on both birth order and gender is associated with a more meaningful
increase in educational attainment for the child than if there is homophily on birth order alone.
Nevertheless, even when parents and children share birth order position, however operationalised,
as well as the same gender, the net increase in educational attainment is at most 0.05 years of
education, and typically closer to 0.03 or 0.04 years of education by age 30. It may be worth
noting that parent-child birth order and gender homophily seems to be more beneficial for sons
than it is for daughters, but these differences are extremely small in the context of educational
attainment by age 30.
     We have also run additional analyses examining whether parental educational level interacts with
parent-child birth order and gender homophily to influence educational attainment. For example,
does a first-born son of a first-born father have a greater correlation in education than a second-
born son with a first-born father. Tables 4 and 5 examine this question using the maternal cousin
and paternal cousin samples, respectively. We will focus on the results examining the interaction
between parent-child homophily and maternal educational level in Table 4, as residual confounding
in the maternal cousin group is most effectively controlled for in those analyses. Table 4 shows
that when examining parent-child birth order homophily alone, we do not find that there is any
statistically significant shift in the degree of parent-child educational similarity. However, when
we examine parent-child homophily on both birth order and gender (i.e. a first-born mother and
a first-born daughter rather than, say, a first-born mother and first-born son), then we do find a
   INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF BIRTH ORDER AND FAMILY SIZE ON EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT 27

statistically significant interaction. In this case we find that the positive effect for the child of
sharing the same birth order and gender position as the parent increases the higher the level of
education of the mother. That is to say, sharing the same birth order and gender position as the
mother is more beneficial for the child when the mother has higher levels of education. This is true
whether we operationalise birth order according to ordinal position, first-middle-last, or a first- or
later-born distinction. The pattern of results that we observe amongst the maternal cousin sample
is also seen in Table 5, showing the results from the paternal cousin group analyses. Here we
also see that parent-child birth order homophily alone does not interact significantly with paternal
educational level, but when there is parent-child birth order and gender homophily, those whose
fathers have higher levels of education benefit disproportionately. It seems that parent-child birth
order and gender homophily shifts the slope of intergenerational transmission, where parents who
share the same gender and birth order position are more similar in educational levels than the
children who do not share those characteristics with the parents. Furthermore, we find that parent-
child birth order and gender homophily is most beneficial when the parents have higher levels of
human capital resources to transmit to their children.
  In this study, we conduct a large number of statistical tests, which raises the multiple comparison
problem. Overall we would emphasise that, since we use population data and the standard errors
are generally very small, we should largely focus on the direction and substantive magnitude of
the point estimates. Nevertheless, statistical testing can still be informative even when applied to
population data because it tells us about the variance underlying the estimates: indeed, when an
estimate does not reach even the conventional 5% significance threshold with a very large N, that
tells us something important about how noisy the underlying pattern is. In these analyses of the
interaction between parent-child birth order homophily and parental education level, we perform a
number of different tests, but find that the point estimates are relatively similar across comparable
models, and we also find consistency in the patterns of statistical significance (e.g. across the
different operationalisations of birth order when examining parent-child birth order and gender
homophily). This suggests that we are not simply obtaining significant p-values at random as a
result of running multiple different significance tests.

Parental Sibling Group Size. In further analyses we examine in detail the relationship between
sibling group size in the parents generation and whether that has any effect on offspring educa-
tional attainment. More specifically, we examine whether an exogenous shock to the sibling group
size experienced by the parents through a twin birth has any consequence for the educational at-
tainment of their own children. The results from those analyses are shown in Table 6. We estimate
these models for six different samples. The first two samples are first-born mothers, and first-born
fathers, whose parents may or may not have given birth to twins at parity two. The second two
samples are first- and second-born mothers and fathers, whose parents may or may not have given
birth to twins at parity three. The third two samples are first-, second-, and third-born mothers and
fathers, whose parents may or may not have given birth to twins at parity four.
     Table 6 shows the estimates resulting from both the first and second stages of the 2SLS estima-
tion procedure. The first stage estimates in each case show that there is a very strong correlation be-
tween a twin birth and eventual family size, which is consistent with previous research using twins
as an instrument for family size in the Nordic context (e.g. see Black et al., 2005a; Baranowska-
Rataj et al., 2017). The results from the second stage estimates, however, show that there is no
statistically significant, nor substantively meaningful, association between sibling group size in
the parental generation and offspring educational attainment, with one exception; the children of
first-, second-, and third-born fathers who experienced a twin birth at parity 4 have significantly
lower educational attainment. The estimate suggests that this exogenous shock to the sibling group
   INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF BIRTH ORDER AND FAMILY SIZE ON EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT 37

size of the father leads to 0.18 years lower education at age 30 amongst the children. Although this
may reflect a true negative effect, it is somewhat surprising that this is the only association that is
significant or with a substantively meaningful effect size, suggesting that it should be interpreted
with caution and in the context of the other negligible effects.
  Overall we find that these results suggest that grandparental fertility outcomes, and its subse-
quent effect on resource dilution in the parental sibling group, has no multigenerational effect on
grandchild educational attainment.


Additional Analyses of High School GPA and Long-term Earnings. In addition to the analyses
presented above, we have conducted additional analyses examining high school grade point aver-
age, measured at age 16, as well as inflation-adjusted logged earnings averaged over ages 29 to 31
as outcome variables. The results from those analyses lead to same conclusions as those that we
draw from our analyses of educational attainment. The results from these additional analyses of
GPA and long-term earnings are shown in the Supplementary Information section of this article, in
Tables S6 to S14.



                                            D ISCUSSION

  In this study we have used a remarkable multigenerational population dataset in order to exam-
ine whether family demographic factors related to grandparental fertility, specifically birth order
and family size, have any effect on the educational attainment of subsequent generations. In do-
ing so, we are some of the first to explore the multigenerational effects of demographic processes
and the complimentary processes of demographic and socioeconomic reproduction that have been
underappreciated in the previous literature (Mare, 2011). We find that grandparental fertility be-
havior is indeed associated with grandchild educational attainment, but that this effect flows almost
completely through the educational and socioeconomic attainment of the parents in the middle gen-
eration of the three generations that we study. That is to say, grandparental fertility influences the
educational and socioeconomic attainment of the parents through the family size and birth order
that they experience, but grandparental fertility has little to no effect on the grandchildren once we
adjust for the educational and socioeconomic attainment of the parents. Indeed, to this end our
38                                   BARCLAY, LYNGSTAD, CONLEY

study suggests that parental birth order could even be employed as an instrument for parental edu-
cational and socioeconomic attainment, since its effects on the subsequent generation flow clearly
through that attainment channel.
     While our study speaks directly to the multigenerational importance of demographic factors for
the socioeconomic attainment of subsequent generations, it also offers an insight into the find-
ings of the much larger literature that has sprung up in recent years examining social stratification
and mobility from a multigenerational perspective. This body of research has grappled with the
question of whether social reproduction follows a Markovian process, where the attainment of any
generation is influenced only by the attainment of the directly preceding generation, or whether
there is a residual effect of grandparental, and even great-grandparental, status and resources net
of the socioeconomic status of the parents. Increasingly research in this tradition has drawn the
conclusion that grandparents do matter above and beyond the parents (e.g. see Warren and Hauser,
1997; Chan and Boliver, 2013; Zeng and Xie, 2014; Anderson et al., 2018). However, measure-
ment of socioeconomic status is typically subject to measurement error as educational level and
occupational status have many sub-dimensions. For example, educational level subsumes subject
specialisation as well as quality of the training institution and the training itself. Occupational
status, and even specific occupation, subsumes information like status within the workplace, how
many people an individual is supervising, and the nature of the organisation and industry in which
an individual is employed. All of those factors, and others, mean that measuring the importance of
grandparental socioeconomic status for grandchild attainment is complicated and error-prone.
     Although the measurement of grandparental socioeconomic status is often subject to measure-
ment error, the measurement of grandparental fertility is far less vulnerable to this criticism. Family
size and birth order in the parents generation in our population register data are measured with great
accuracy, and as we have described in detail earlier, both birth order and family size are related
to educational and socioeconomic attainment. Since birth order can be considered a quasi-random
assignment to parental investment, and a twin-birth in the parental generation can be seen as an
exogenous shock to the sibling group size and therefore resource levels within the sibling group,
our study is able to get at the causal effect of resource distribution in the parental generation and
how this may or may not influence the subsequent generation. We do find that parental birth order,
   INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF BIRTH ORDER AND FAMILY SIZE ON EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT 39

though not parental family size, is associated with the educational attainment of the grandchild
generation, but that this association is wiped out after accounting for the attained education and
socioeconomic status of the parents measured in later adulthood. In short, this study suggests
that multigenerational demographic effects follow a Markovian process, and given that our mea-
sures are much less vulnerable to measurement error, and benefit from exogeneity, our findings
suggest that if multigenerational social stratification and mobility studies were able to measure
grandparental social status to the same high standard as we measure grandparental fertility, grand-
parental socioeconomic status would not be associated with grandchild outcomes either. Although
our analyses of parent-child birth order and gender homophily do indicate that there are also non-
Markovian processes operating, these effects on offspring educational attainment are relatively
small.
  It is also worth noting that our findings present themselves in Sweden, which has comparably
speaking, low levels of inequality, a strong welfare state that supports the most needy, and a free
educational system, including tertiary education. Thus, we expect that the intergenerational birth
order effect that we observe in this study would be at least as likely to present itself in other coun-
tries whose social and political architecture exacerbates intergenerational inequality to a greater
extent than in Sweden, and where rates of social mobility may be lower. However, it is worth also
mentioning the specificity of the macro-demographic conditions in the period over which we study
these multigenerational effects. Many of the grandparents whose fertility we examine in this study
were born during the fertility transition in Sweden. Although total fertility was declining during
this period, it was higher than today, attributable to lower levels of fertility control. Even though
birth order was clearly a notable determinant of educational attainment within each generation, it
is possible that birth order effects will become stronger over time as parents spend more time with
children, focus even greater attention on quality over quantity, and practice longer birth spacing,
as parental investment during the earliest years of life seems to be an important factor driving the
birth order effect.
  A noteworthy finding in our study is that we observe that parent-child birth order and gender
homophily exerts only a small positive influence on the educational attainment of the child, but
that this influence is stronger when parental education levels are higher. It seems that parents
40                                    BARCLAY, LYNGSTAD, CONLEY

with higher levels of human capital reserve a certain degree of favoritism for the child whose
position within the family corresponds most closely to their own in childhood. That is, it seems
that first-born fathers favor first-born sons, middle-born mothers favor middle-born daughters, and
so on. That this favoritism should be observed at all is somewhat surprising, and even more so
that it should be observed amongst parents with higher levels of education. It may be that a closer
identification between parents and the child whose position in the family is reminiscent of their
own is widespread, but that parents who have greater levels of education simply have more skills
to pass on to them, hence the greater educational performance of the homophilous child in the
long-run. Given that first-borns are the most common birth order in the general population, and
increasingly so given declining fertility, this kind of parental favoritism may be a small part of the
explanation for why first-borns are generally found to outperform later-born siblings; parent-child
matches on being the first-born child are likely the most common pairings.
     More generally, our study also has the potential to shed light on the literature on the intergen-
erational effects of parental education on offspring educational attainment. Studies have generally
used one of three different study designs to estimate the causal impact of parental education on
offspring education: twin studies, adoption studies, and instrumental variables. Twin studies on
this topic exploit differences in educational attainment between identical (monozygotic) twins, and
examine educational attainment amongst their children. These studies, using data from the United
States, Denmark, and Norway, have consistently shown a positive effect of paternal education on
offspring educational attainment, but rarely a positive effect of maternal education (Behrman and
Rosenzweig, 2002; Antonovics and Goldberger, 2005; Bingley et al., 2009; Hægeland et al., 2010;
Pronzato, 2012). Research examining how parental educational level influences the educational
attainment of adopted children, using data from the United States, Norway, and Sweden, typically
shows that both maternal and paternal levels of education matter for adoptee attainment (Dearden
et al., 1997; Plug, 2004; Björklund et al., 2006; Sacerdote, 2007; Hægeland et al., 2010). Stud-
ies using compulsory school reforms as an instrument to investigate whether parental educational
attainment effects offspring educational have shown that in the UK and Norway greater mater-
nal education increases education amongst the offspring, while greater paternal education does
not have a significant effect (Chevalier, 2004; Black et al., 2005b). However, a study using data
   INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF BIRTH ORDER AND FAMILY SIZE ON EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT 41

on compulsory school reforms from the United States has shown that both maternal and paternal
education matter for offspring attainment (Oreopoulos et al., 2006). While these studies do consis-
tently find that parental educational level does exert a small effect on the educational attainment of
their children, there are inconsistencies in whether it is the mother’s or the father’s education that
matters the more. If, as we argue, parental birth order can be seen as an instrument for parental ed-
ucational attainment, our study suggests that both maternal and paternal educational levels matters
for offspring educational attainment, but that maternal educational level matters slightly more. This
is consistent with a broader literature that demonstrates the importance of parental educational lev-
els, but particularly maternal educational level, for the developmental trajectories of children (e.g.
Kalil et al., 2012).
  In conclusion, we do not find that family size in the parental generation matters for the subse-
quent generation, but we do find that parental birth order matters, albeit indirectly, for offspring
educational and labor market attainment net of the child’s own birth order. This intergenerational
birth order pattern suggests that differences in grandparental investment between siblings in the
parental generation matters not only for their own educational attainment, but that this also has
spillover effects into the subsequent generation due to the effects on parental educational and
socioeconomic attainment. Thus, we observe the production of inequalities within families and
across generations, an all the more remarkable finding since we are able to adjust for unmeasured
confounding by comparing full cousins who share the same biological grandparents. Differences in
parental investment (or grandparental investment) within a family are naturally much smaller than
the differences in parental investment that are observed between different families, and our study
therefore highlights just how important parental investment is for offspring attainment, and how
this has the potential to accumulate over subsequent generations. However, as we have detailed,
these multigenerational patterns seem to be entirely, or almost entirely, explained by the effect that
grandparental investment has on parental educational and labor market attainment. When we take
account of the level of education and labor market success that parents have attained by age 40 or
50, the differences in parental investment exercised by the grandparents no longer matter for the
grandchildren; the effects of grandparental investment appear to flow entirely through the parental
generation, and this process of multigenerational stratification thereby seems to approximate a
42                                 BARCLAY, LYNGSTAD, CONLEY

memoryless Markovian process. Given these findings, we can speculate that multigenerational
effects of grandparental socioeconomic resources on grandchildren may need to be re-evaluated.
