                CONTRACTS AND THE MARKET FOR EXECUTIVES


                               ABSTRACT
          The paper reviews empirical findings on executive
compensation in light of marginal productivity and contract
theories. The executive labor market performs three functions.
First, control must be distributed and assigned among executives.
The most talented executives are efficiently assigned to control
positions in the largest firms when talent and the marginal product
of control are complements. These gains or rents are partially
captured in larger earnings. In fact, the elasticity of top execu-
tive pay lies within a tight band around .25 among industries, time
periods, and countries where it has been estimated.        Second,
executive contracts must provide incentives for managers to act in
the interests of shareholders.    Potential loss of reputation,
bonding and takeovers probably substitute for direct monetary
incentives in this task.   Nevertheless, the elasticity of top
executive pay with respect to accounting rates of return lie near
1.0. The elasticity with respect to stock market returns is much
smaller, though precisely estimated, near 0.1. Differences of
opinion remain on whether the market provides enough incentives to
align interests between ownership and control. Third, the market
must identify new talent and reassign control over careers from
older to younger generations. Competition among executives for top
positions and the diminishing incentive effect of future rewards
with age implies that compensation should increasingly tilt rewards
to current performance over the course of a career.       Available
evidence supports this prediction.

 I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

             The vital function of business executives in
                                                            efficiently directing
 the vast amounts of resources under their control makes
                                                             the executive labor
 market an especially interesting one to study. Berle and Means raised the

 fundamental contractual issue by pointing out possible conflicts of interest

 arising from separation of ownership and control. It has taken
                                                                     many years
 for the economics profession to put these matters in proper perspective

            The first important response was to identify a market for

corporate control [Manne (1965)], whereby the threat of involuntary

termination would provide incentives for managers to align their actions

with shareholders' interests. The remarkable level of activity in the

American corporate-control market in recent years has dispelled any

lingering doubts about the importance of this mechanism.       Still, there
remain differences of informed opinion on its
                                                   efficacy for solving the
problem.

            Second generation debates on the managerial theory of the firm

[Marris (1963), Baumol (1967)] focused attention on the firm's objective

function. If managers operated the firm in shareholders' interests then

they would maximize profits, and if they catered to their own interests then
such   things as sales and the amount of assets controlled would enter into

the firm's objectives. An empirical question
                                                was immediately suggested:
did executive earnings respond more to profitability or to sales? The

investigations provoked by this question were among the first empirical

studies of agency.

             It would be interesting to report that these studies provided

empirical basis for the extensive theory of agency that has been developed

recently, but that is not the way it happened. Rather, much of that

development paralleled theoretical research on information economics.

Whatever its source, the executive labor market is one of the most importan:

practical applications of the new theory. Theory in turn has provided a

useful framework for thinking about the data and for showing precisely how

various mechanisms may be devised to align the interests of control and

ownership.     I attempt to join the theoretical and empirical strands of this

literature in this paper. It is organized around the three main economic

problems that the executive labor market must solve: the distribution and

assignment of control among executives; providing performance incentives;

and identifying talent and reassigning control in the course of career

development.

             Section II briefly takes up the problem of the allocation of

control, given incentives. The idea is that personal power and influence in

an organization depend on the interactions between talent and the

productivity of control. If there is complementarity between the two it is

efficient to assign greater control to more talented persons. In a market

equilibrium, the most talented executives occupy top positions of the

largest firms, whcre the marginal productivity of their actions is greatly

magnified over the many people below them to whom they are linked. This

explains why earnings of top executives in large firms are so large, and why

executive pay is positively correlated with firm size. The empirical
                                      3




elasticity of top executive pay with respect to firm size is approximately

 .25 for all industries and time periods for which it has been estimated.

          Sections III and IV take up the agency-incentive question, given

the allocation of control. Theory predicts that the structure of pay

strikes a compromise between incentives and insurance. Much evidence

supports that prediction. The direct incentive component is of particular

interest. The elasticity of compensation with respect to accounting rates
of return is in excess of 1.0; and the elasticity with respect to the stock

market rate of return is approximately .10.   However, there exists no

theoretical benchmark to serve as a guide for what size number should be

expected, and disputes remain on whether compensation mechanisms provide

enough incentives to elicit efficient management behavior.

          Section V joins the assignment and incentive questions. How are

competent and talented managers identified and how is control reallocated

over the course of careers across successive, over-lapping generations? For

this task the labor market must keep a running score on available talent and

adjust the assignment of control accordingly. Competition is thereby

induced among contenders to influence the scoring process and gain greater

rank and control over their careers. Such competition, of which promotion

to higher paying and more responsible positions is an important part, is the

means by which control is transferred across the generations. Career

incentives serve as better substitutes for current performance incentives at

earlier stages of a career than in later stages, when a rapidly diminishing

horizon reduces any incentive effects of future status on current behavior.

Available data support the idea that compensation is increasingly structured

to reward and weigh current performance more heavily over the course of a

career, as theory suggests.

          The final section draws out some suggestions for further work.



II.   THE MARGINAL PRODUCTIVITY THEORY

          Great power to direct resources and the large earnings that go

with it are what make the executive labor market so interesting. Power and

income are related in a market economy, where remuneration is proportional

to one's marginal contribution to production. Early work began to connect

marginal productivity to business decisions within hierarchical control

structures -- see Reder's (1968) excellent survey for references.

Activities of top management are magnified geometrically because they affect

recursively the productivity of all who work below them in the organization.

This "scale of operations' effect, multiplying little bits over each of many

units, accrues to the more talented managers as economic rent in a

competitive equilibrium, much like a "superstar" effect (Rosen (l98l).

          Top management inputs have much in common with local public goods.

consisting as they do of commands and decisions affecting the productivity

of the organization as a whole. What type of goods should be built and on

what scale? What niche should the firm play in the market and how should

its products be priced? Although a detailed theory of the division of labor

in management organization is unavailable, a simple hierarchical model

illustrates the essence of the idea [see Rosen (1982) and Miller (1982) for

more details].

          A. The Model

           Consider a hierarchy with a fixed span of control, s, throughout

every branch. Then the organization is a strictly triangular tree with s

branches at every node. Production occurs at the bottom layer. Higher

levels are exclusively devoted to "management" activities, which refine and
                                          5



augment production worker output. Decisions made at a higher level get

dissipated somewhat in percolating down the tree, but link in a

multiplicative way to more production workers and have larger marginal

product the higher up they start.

              Let z be a worker's talent (measured as output in self-

employment). Assume that a level-j manager produces (kz+mz. l units of

service jointly with each of the s immediately subordinate workers below

him,   where k and m are positive constants independent of j and       m + k < 1.
Then a one management level firm produces output of s(kz1 + mz0). A two

level firm produces s2(k(kz2 + mz1) + mz0) units, and by recursion           an n-

layer organization with sn production workers, produces output of



(1)                Yn — sn(kn z +k
                                 n-i
                                    mz    +..   .+mz )

                        Az'+ L) sn-jj

                                           i
                              i—i


where j   —   0 is the bottom production level layer, j   —   n is CEO and
A — sk > 1.0 is the net span of control. From the second expression, the

CEO contributes A'z to output, a j-level manager contributes A3mz and          a
production worker contributes inz.     That there is one CEO, 5nj level-j

managers and s production workers gives total production in the firm.

              The marginal product of talent is larger at higher levels of a

hierarchy, through a chain letter-like effect. The CEO effectively is

"cloned" (sk)'1z times through subordinates itt the chain-of-command. Lower

level managers are cloned only (sk)3mz times (for j<n) because their          input
                                                      6



has a shorter distance to travel down the tree and is further discounted (by

m < 1) arising from the need to spend time processing supervisors' orders.

          Let W(z) be the wage of a ievel-j manager of talent z.

Additivity of equation (1) implies that output is linear in talent within

levels. Therefore, incremental product accrues as rent to talent within

levels according to:



(2)            W(z) —      Wj
                                  + Amz, j — 0,           1,   .   . . , n-l


where (wi) are constants, determined by equating market supply and demand in

the assignment of workers by talent to levels.

          Total rent accruing to the person at the top of an n-level

organization is the difference between output and costs of lower level

workers. Defining profits as revenue minus costs, using (2) and simplifying


                                  n-i
(3)       I (z) —   A z       -
                                   'c

           n              n        L              J
                                  i —O




This too is linear in Z, The first term can be interpreted as the unit

toll the CEO collects for each of the An times he is cloned through all

subordinates. The second term is the payment the CEO must make to all

level-j subordinates for that privilege while letting them collect their own

ability rents through their subordinates.

          The earnings-talent gradient is linear within levels in (2) and

(3), but is highly nonlinear between levels because the market equilibrium

assigns talents to positions along the upper envelope of (2) and (3). The

envelope is strictly convex, following from the fact that the marginal
                                        7


product of talent is increasing in level in (1). Consequently, a

competitive market allocates talented people to higher level positions in

 larger firms. Complementarity between talent and productivity inherent in

hierarchical structures -   - 8Y/8z   increasing in j   in   (1) -   - is   what makes
this so. Scarce talents of the most capable managers are economized
                                                                                    by
assigning them to positions at or near the top of the largest firms, where

their ability is magnified to greater effect by spreading it over longer

chains-of-command and larger scales of operations. These magnification

effects accrue to these executives as rent. This is what sustains
                                                                              high
average earnings of top level executives in large firms and also implies

that firm size and executive pay should be positively related. Since the

firms we are concerned with here have average assets of $58 and
                                                                            large
numbers of employees and other stake-holders, multiplicative scale-of-

operations effects loom large: a little extra talent at the top can have

enormous effects on total output. The social gain- to devising efficient

incentive mechanisms and to identifying the most talented managers are

likely to be correspondingly large.

          B. The Evidence

          Top executive salaries increase with the size of firm. Most of

the evidence relates to the top five ex utives of American corporations as

reported, by law, in annual proxy statements to shareholders. Lower ranking

executives have not been studied very much because no public data            are

available, though a few studies have used proprietary data on such persons.

          Most of the evidence on firm size and executive pay comes from

empirical attempts to parcel out executive pay to firm size or growth

"causes" on the one hand, and to the profitability of the firm on the other.

The preceding analysis shows that such attributions of causes are
                                     8


conceptually ambiguous and not mutually exclusive because large firms are

more likely to be headed by more able executives and this has little bearing

on whether firms can be treated as sales or as profit maximizers. Unusual

talents and abilities must earn scarcity rents even in the absence of   agency
and incentive problems.

          Many of these studies have encountered multicollinearity problems.

Firms with large assets and sales revenues also have large accounting

profits in absolute terms. The common factor, bigness, is at work. Even in

comparing a giant firm with a merely large one, the sheer effects of scale

dominate comparisons in cross-firm salary regressions and often make the

regressors colinear [Cisel and Carroll (1980), Durtlevy (1985)). There is no

"solution" to a multicollinearity problem and any way they are cut, scale

effects show up powerfully in the data on top executive pay.

          The numerous studies that bear on the relation between pay and the

scale of resources controlled represent something of an empirical zoo. The

main problem in assessing the evidence is that specifications vary widely

from study-to-study. Multicollinearity plays some role here and so do such

trivialities as different choice of units of measurement and log transforms

without presenting enough sample information for readers to construct

elasticities. A definitive study will be one that estimates all existing

specifications on one consistent data source.

          A start in this direction for scale effects appears in Kostiuk

(1989). His own estimates are based on 73 large U.S. corporations over the

1969-81 period. The elasticity of executive annual-salary-plus-bonus with

respect to sales of the firm is in the .2 to .25 range. Including firm-

fixed effects does not change things. The elasticity is the same in the

time-series "within" firm comparison as in the cross-section "between" firm
                                       9


comparison. A firm   that   is 10 percent larger than another on average pays

its top executives 2.5 percent more; arid when the latter firm grows by 10

percent, its top executives are on average paid 2.5 percent more in salary

and bonuses. Murphy (1985) reports a similar estimate on a related sample,

but using a broader definition of pay that includes deferred compensation

and stock options: these components of pay are not very sensitive to size

and scale variables. The regression specifications are sufficiently

different between the two studies to suggest that the estimated elasticity

is fairly tnsensitive to specification.

          More convincing evidence comes from comparing studies that used

much different data. Kostiuk's and Murphy's estimates are in the vicinity

of Roberts' (1956) early estimate of .35 for selected manufacturing firms in

the U.S. in the late 1940s and 1950. Using American data from 1937-39,

Kostiuk (1989) finds an asset elasticity of .3, close to the .25 elasticity

estimated on U.S. data in 1967-71. Furthermore, Cosh (1975) has estimated

an asset elasticity of .26 for Britain during 1969-71. This is remarkably

close to that found for the United States. Barro and Barro (forthcoming)

find an asset elasticity of .32 for CEOs of U.S. commercial banks in the

1980s. Even those studies for which elasticity cannot be computed [McCuire,

et al. (1962), Winn and Shoerthair (1988), Ciscel and Carroll (1980) --

exceptions are Kokkelenberg (1988) and Lewellen and Huntsman (1970)] find
strongly positive effects of sales or assets on executive pay.

          The relative uniformity of the elasticity of executive pay with

respect to scale across firms, industries, countries and periods of time is

notable and puzzling because the technology which sustains control and

scale should vary across these disparate units of comparison. Thus the

uniformity of estimates is a little too good to be true. One suspects
                                     10


copycatting behavior among firms in compensation policy, yet the Conference

board compensation surveys that possibly provide the information for such

comparisons group the data by industry. And copycat behavior cannot accoun:

for the 1930s estimate because the data were scarcely available. It surely

cannot extend from the U.S. to the U.K. conparison. A convincing

explanation is an open question.



III.   INCENTIVE PAYMENTS

          Much of the recent interest in executive labor markets comes from

new conceptual developments on incentive aspects of labor supply.

          A. Pay and Hours of Work

          High ranking executives in large corporations earn large amounts

of money, averaging $500,000 per year in salary and bonus alone. Adding

deferred pay, options, and pensions sometimes changes it by more than one

order of magnitude. Systematic data on the hours worked by high-ranking

business executives are not available, but much informal evidence indicates

that both hours worked and the intensity of work are among the largest of

any specific occupational group in the economy. There is no shortage of

labor supply in the usual sense and in fact salaries are independent of

hours worked. Apparently, self-regulation, peer pressure, and monitoring by

superiors are adequate to maintain great work intensity and long hours.

          B. Agency: Nature of the Problem

          The interesting question is whether or not executive efforts are

directed toward the proper goals. Do business managers and executives

direct their work to serve the interests of shareholders and other

stakeholders or do they use them in more self-serving ways?
                                     11


          At heart this agency problem represents some limitation on

possibilities for decentralizing the functions of management in market

economies. Specialization of knowledge and information, and the capital

requirements of large enterprises virtually dictate a managerial function

that is itself specialized and separated from ownership but tied to the

fortunes of one enterprise. The resources controlled by such firms are so

large that they must be assembled from far and wide. Individual owners

cannot shepherd their resources in that way due to lack of skill, specific

production and market knowledge, and motivation. Instead, they must place a

certain amount of trust in a management team to take proper actions on their

behalf. Herein lies the agency problem.

          The formal problem is to design contracts to induce executives to

act in their shareholders' interests. Various mechanisms have been

identified that might accomplish this task. Economists have confined their

attention to an idealized problem where the technology, scope for actions

and outcomes are common knowledge among principals and agents and only the

action taken is private information of the agent. Principals know a great

deal about the business, including what actions should be taken conditional

on circumstances. They simply don't know what circumstances arose in any

given realization: only the agent knows that. This is a far more

constrained view than the idea of Berle and Means or even that of the law on

principal and agent relations, where the agent typically is hired to render

services of exclusive technical or other specialized knowledge that cannot

be known to principals because it is not their business.
                                      12


          C. Penalties for Misbehavior

          Incentive schemes can either penalize unwanted behavior (negative

feedback) or reward desirable behavior (positive reinforcement). Ambiguity

arises because rewards for good behavior imply, by lack of reward, penalties

for poor behavior and is resolved by adopting some norm of "expected

behavior." The earliest approaches to agency theory suggested penalties as

efficient incentives [Mirrlees (1976)] .   Diminishing   marginal utility of

money makes the monetary reward required to induce good behavior larger than

the monetary penalty needed to discourage bad behavior.

               1. Bonding Solutions to Agency Problems

               A performance bond is the prototype. Malfeasance is

discouraged by a potential penalty because the agent puts personal wealth in

jeopardy, "up front," as the bond. If the norm of good behavior is

maintained, the agent is paid opportunity costs plus interest on the bond.

If malfeasance is detected, the bond is seized and the worker is fired. The

potential unraveling problem at contract termination is solved by extending

the worker's horizon and not returning the bond until after "retirement" as

a pension (see Becker and Stigler [1974] for a very clear account). There

exists a locus or trade-off of bond, detection-probability combinations that

motivate the agent to adopt good behavior. Since resources used for

monitoring have opportunity costs, it is economical to make the bond as

large as possible and the probability of detection as small as possible

[Becker (1968)1 (ignoring type II errors).

          Economists have used considerable imagination in applying this

model. Lazear (1979) interpreted the bond-pension scheme very broadly. In

his model workers are paid less than their value to the firm when young but

more than their value when old. The negative difference between pay and
                                     13


value is a gradual posting of bond, with the worker effectively "investing"

in the firm and becoming a "partner" for all practical purposes. This model

implies a reduction in turnover. Studies of job turnover have established

that after an experimentation period at the start of the life cycle,

permanent attachments are made and turnover drops precipitously. Once a

stable job has been found, it persists for remarkably long periods.

Unfortunately, business executives have not been singled out for study, and

there are serious gaps in the executive data for this purpose. However, a

few conclusions may be warranted:

          (i) Executives at or near the CEO rank in large corporations hold

their positions for fairly long intervals and have been employed by the firm

for a very long time. For example, in the samples used by Kostiuk (1989)

and Murphy (1985), the average top level executive was 55-57 years old, had

been in the position for seven or eight years, and had worked for the

company for more than 25 years. In the larger Forbes sample of almost 1300

large corporations over 1974-1986, Jensen and Murphy (1990) report that CEOs

who left office during that period had, on average, served for ten years.

In the case studies discussed by Vancil (1987), 80 percent of "retired" CEOs

remained on their firm's board of directors, and more than one-third served

as Chairman of the Board. Barro and Barro (forthcoming) show a marked

increase in departure probabilities of commercial bank CEOs after 63 years

of age and associated with normal retirement. This is probably true of most

industries.

          (ii) There is more turnover below the very top ranking positions

and in smaller firms. Nevertheless, Leonard's (1990) proprietary sample

suggests that the matching process typically is completed by age 34, the

average age at which older executives were hired by their current employers
                                       14


in the sample. Casual evidence suggests substantial lower level executive

turnover upon succession changes of top level management. A study by

Lichtenberg and Siegel (1989) shows elimination of management/white-collar

jobs when plants change ownership in leveraged buyouts. There is evidence

that the same thing happens in unfriendly takeovers, mergers and

acquisitions.

          These observations are consistent with bonding and firm-specific

capital accumulation among business executives, but knowledge of magnitudes

is not available to assess their deterrence effects. The deterrence value

of a bond depends on its size compared to the value of resources at risk of

mismanagement and appropriation. Since a person's rank and responsibility

in an organization grow over the life cycle, it is likely that implicit

bonds are more efficacious for younger executives who have not yet gained

control of much of the firm's resources. And since the value of large

corporations exceeds the wealth of top managers by many orders of magnitude,

bonds provide less scope for solving the agency problem at the top.

                2. Loss of Reputation as Bond

                ReDutational. considerations serve a bonding function in

agency relationships, and though they lurk in the background of agency

theory, formal analysis has proved elusive. An important exception is Fama

(1980), who considered a model where observers use an agent's prior record

and past history of performance to infer some personal trait, such as

honesty. Knowing this, the agent has incentives to act in ways that affect

the market's beliefs. The agency value of reputation arises because current

behavior has an enduring "memory when the legacy of the past is used to up-

date current beliefs. Then current actions have long term consequences if

the discount rate is not too large. Loss of reputation serves as a
                                         15


deterrent when the capital value of these consequences for earnings is

greater than the benLfit of malfeasance, sloth and error in a current

action.

          Fama (1980) analyzed market equilibrium for a simple structure

without discounting which converged to first-best efficient managerial

behavior. Holmstrom (1982b) showed that discounting and risk aversion limit

the extent to which reputation polices incentives. For example, finite life

limits the extent to which the legacy of the past persists into the future

(see Telser (1980) for the need for random horizons in self-enforcing

agreements, and Radner (1985) on discounting in multi-agent problems).

Reputation plays an ever smaller role in contract enforcement as the agent

gets older because there is less to lose. At the end of the contract there

is nothing to lose.

          This horizon difficulty is reinforced by the fact that

opportunities for misconduct increase as the successful agent's control over

resources increases over the life cycle. One can be sympathetic, as I am,

to the idea that there is much more to loss of reputation than merely

financial opportunities --   social   opprobrium, disapproval from one's peers,

and loss of self-esteem have substantial deterrence value to many people,

yet remain skeptical about their overall role in enforcing agency relations.

Like performance bonds, reputation is likely to be more efficacious earlier

rather than later in the life cycle.

               3. The Stock Market and Corporate Control

               As everyone knows, changes in ownership and control achieved

new heights in the l980s. The takeover phenomenon has much independent

interest in the field of finance [see Jensen (1988)] and is beyond the scope

of this review. However, a few findings have direct bearing on the subject
                                      16


at   hand. Hostile takeovers and tender offers and attempts have attracted

all of the research attention. Insofar as they represent a difference of

opinion between current and potential new management on the efficient use of

the firm's resources, they serve to check some abuses of current management

in the use of those resources.

           Successful hostile takeovers result in wholesale changes in

management of the object firm. Evidence on reemployment opportunities of

displaced top executives is scanty, but displaced executives probably do not

find many doors open to them. It is also known that even unsuccessful

takeovers serve to reallocate resources to the control of others through

divestiture. Evidently the implied penalties to existing management from

both successful and unsuccessful takeovers serve as some discipline for

aligning current stockholder and managerial interests.

           Nevertheless, other findings suggest that this discipline is

incomplete. For instance, there is often substantial severance pay to top

executives of object firms in mergers. The stock market views these "golden

parachutes" as productive in converting what wotild otherwise be hostile

reactions to friendly ones in takeover overtures [Lambert and Larcker

(1985)), yet the implied behavior for those seeking such security seems

curious. Second, object firms in takeovers tend to be in declining

industries, where industry effects might be difficult to disentangle from

firm-specific management effects (Morck, Shleifer and Vishny (1988),

Lichtenberg and Siegel (1987)). Third, the takeover premium is about 40

percent (Jensen and Ruback (1983)). Thus it appears that existing managers

can squander one-third of the firm's value before the threat of displacement

becomes truly serious. Fourth, the market value of the average acquiring

firm in a takeover shows little or no change. The market apparently puts
                                       17

small   value in finder's fees and reorganization rents that might be expected

from these activities. Perhaps competition among bidders accounts for this

last finding, but it can't account for all of it if these activities are

costly. It is not obvious why, when outsiders eliminate inefficient

managers, practically all of the return should go to the shareholders of the

mismanaged firms. Finally, Bhagat, Shleifer and Vishny (1990) find that

l980s reorganizations "deconglomerized" many of the horizontal mergers

assembled in the 1960s and 70s. Hostile takeovers and attempts resulted in

spinning off business lines to specialist firms and not to other

conglomerates. A convincing theory of why these conglomerates were formed

in the first place is not yet available.



IV.     REWARDS TO ELICIT EFFICIENT ACTION

            All of the penalty modes constrain, but do not eliminate self-

serving behavior. Hence there is scope for reward mechanisms to help align

the interests of managers and shareholders.

             A. Risk Sharing and Incentives

             A fairly general approach was developed by Holmstrom (1979], who

examined the following problem: Suppose an agent is hired by a principal to

produce good x with production function x —      f(1,c),   where 2 is effort and

is a random variable with zero mean and known distribution. The agent is

risk averse with concave utility u —   U(c,i),   where c is consumption. The

principal is risk neutral. All production and utility functions are common

knowledge and outcome x is jointly observed by principal and agent.

However, the action 1 and the random variable        are exclusive private

information, either controlled or observed, of the agent. The principal has

full property rights in x, which has unit price, and, for simplicity,
                                      18


supplies no inputs into the production process. The agent is paid a share

s(x) of the proceeds of x because 2 and e are not separately observed by the

principal: The goal is to characterize the equilibrium determination of

s(x).

          The method of solution is interesting. It converts the market

equilibrium problem into a two-stage maximum problem. The first step

analyzes the agent's choice of I that maximizes expected utility given s(x).

This yields a mapping from s(x) to labor supply 2. The second step solves

for the function s(x) that maximizes either the principal's expected profit

or the expected utility of the agent, given the labor supply behavior in the

first step. If profit is taken as maximand, another constraint is that the

worker must expect to receive the known utility level of another job. If

expected utility is taken as maximand, the added constraint is that the

principal receives at least the expected return in some other activity.

These alternatives give two extreme points on the utility-possibility

frontier. Intermediate points are similarly obtained. Competition in the

labor market insures that the equilibrium contract •lies on the utility-

possibility frontier.

          There is tension between efficient action and efficient insurance

in this problem. Were everything observable, the two could be unbundled.

Then the risk-neutral principal would supply full insurance to the risk-

averse agent by paying a fixed salary independent of outcome. The agent

would willingly supply optimal effort (expected marginal product equals

marginal cost) and monitoring would eliminate shirking.   if the agent is

risk neutral there are no gains from trade. The agent acquires ownership

rights to x and supplies optimal effort as a residual income recipient in

self-employment. In all other cases, payment based on output alone through
                                        19


s(x) gives only one instrument to perform two real allocative functions.

There aren't enough independent prices and margins to do either one

sufficiently: The principal has to offer less than complete insurance to

give the agent incentives to put forth effort.

          It is remarkable that very little more can be said, in general, to

characterize s(x). Payments that are decreasing in x through part of its

range can't even be ruled out [Grossman and Hart (1983)]! This negative

result provides very few restrictions on data and makes the theory difficult

to apply. What's worse, the contracts actually observed in agency

relationships typically are of very simple forms which aren't predicted by
this model.

          The reason for these complications is difficult to describe.

However, Holmstrom and Milgrom (1987) prove that s(x) takes the simple

linear form of a two-part tariff when income effects are absent in

preferences and the technology shocks        are i.i.d. An intertemporal version

shows intuitively how it works. Consider an indefinitely repeated problem
when   is white noise and the action 2 is chosen before e is revealed in

each round. With no income effects, the agent is content with the same

amount of insurance each time irrespective of wealth, and similarly for the

risk-neutral principal. Furthermore, i.i.d. production disturbances imply

that each round looks exactly like every other from the production/incentive

point of view. It is efficient for the agent to choose the same action in

every period, because the agent's marginal rate of substitution between

effort and consumption is independent of wealth and the expected marginal

product of effort is constant. In the linear payoff schedule s(x) — a + bx

which implements the scheme,   serves as the insurance component and      as

the incentive component [Stiglitz (1975)]. If s(x) were nonlinear, the
                                                     20


dgent would have undesirable incentives not to take the same action each

time; e.g., to accumulate work into a large pile and do it all at once in a

range where s'(x) is increasing.

             B.       The Optimal Piece Rate

             Following Holmstrom and Milgrom (1989), consider the linear model

for a risk averse agent with constant absolute risk aversion who produces

two inputs, x1 and x2, for a risk neutral principal. Labor supplied by the

agent is the only input. The agent receives a total payment y consisting of

a fixed lump sum         and   revenues from production of x1               and x2, each with
separate piece-rates b1 and b2:



             x    —      +                                i   —
                                                                  1,2


(4)          y — a +             +
                         b1x1        b2x2


             u — U(y      -
                              c(21,22))
                                            —
                                                -exp(-R[y - c(11,22)])


where   R is the coefficient of risk aversion,                          is the effort devoted to

activity i, y is gross income, c(i1,12) is the agent's (convex) cost of

effort and         and E2      are random variables with zero means and covariance
matrix

             Following the two-step procedure, take parameters (a,b1,b2) as

given and calculate the agent's labor supply to each activity: Substituting

from (4), the agent chooses                  and 22 to maximize



(5)          Eu — EU(a +      +      +      +                           -

The first order condition is 8Eu/321 — Eu'                                                               — 0.

                                                                                        [b      -



Consequently,

from which the labor supply functions                                       —                       are obtained by
                                                                                £(b1.b2)
inversion. Comparative statics on (6) yields the familiar



(7)          a/ab —          (l)c./
where   —               -                 > 0.         It follows that 3e/3bi > 0: an increase in
             c11c22         c122
the payment for an output increases the effort devoted to it. Also,

82/3b

decreases the effort supplied to the other.

             In the second step, the risk neutral principal has

price of x. Consider the case where the expected return to the principal

is driven to zero. Then (a,b1,b2) is constrained by



(8)          E —    0 —               -                 +         -                     -   a

The market equilibrium contract (a,b1,b2) is the one that maximizes the

agent's expected utility Eu, subject to the labor supply functions derived

in the first step and to (8).

             Substituting (8) into Eu

gives two equations in two unknowns to solve for b1 and b2.

            Equation (11) illustrates the balancing between incentives and

insurance in the optimal contract. The marginal costs of effort,
                                                                                             c1 and c2,
would equal their marginal rewards,          p1 and p2, in a first best solution.                      In

(11) there is a wedge between the marginal cost and marginal benefit of

efforts in each good. These are weighted by the marginal response of effort

to its internal price to arrive at an average deviation and balanced against

risk considerations in the last term of (11). Relevant risk in the contract

is an average of the variances of each output weighted by internal prices

and the extent of risk aversion. Departures from first-best incentives

increase with risk and the agent's sensitivity to it.

            A little more progress can be made by manipulating (11) to



(12)        b —   (Rfl(cj    -         -

unwieldy, but two special cases suffice for present purposes.

          (i) Let c12 —    12          Then the two activities are independent

of each other and (12) reads as



(13)      b* —                          i —   1,2


Piece rates vary inversely with risk aversion, R, the size of the risk, a..,

and the relative responsiveness of labor supply to price, c, and vary

positively with the market value of output produced,

          (ii). Let c12 > 0 and a12 — 0.            Now the activities compete with

each other because doing more of one increases the marginal cost of the

other. Substituting into (12), one eventually arrives at



          b —   b* plus   a term in (Rcji(c12        - c)   -
                                                                1]


       *
where b is defined in (13). The second term in this expression is negative

so long as c.. >
                   c12, that is, if, from (7), the own responsiveness of
effort to price is no smaller than the cross responsiveness. Then b is

smaller .than b*. Piece rates are smaller when activities compete with each

other in the agent's effort. There are negative externalities between the

two activities when c12 is positive. These are effectively "taxed" by

reducing the marginal incentive components in the contract, so substitution

between activities gives rise to relatively insensitive internal incentives,

to "low powered" incentives in the sense of Williamson (1985).

          B. Some Qualifications

          Another, perhaps more fundamental reason why the optimal contract

might back off from sensitive performance incentives is that output and

performance of managers often are hard to measure. The services rendered by
                                     24


business managers in large firms cannot be assessed on a fixed scale of

attributes. If the list of variables is incomplete, then scoring

performance on such a scale might exaggerate the production of those

attributes that are only imperfectly correlated with the true value of the

service. Important intangibles would not be rewarded sufficiently. Though

the point is an old one, it has been applied only recently to labor market

incentives. Baker (1989) shows that imperfect correlation between the

assessment of performance and true output acts like a reduction in p in the
             *
formula for b above. It reduces the weight of marginal incentives in
determining executive pay, and by implication, increases the weight of fixed

salary.

          Such considerations are more appropriate for lower level managers

than for those close to the top of the ladder. Contributions of lower level

managers to the success of an organization are difficult to isolate,

submerged, as they are, in the joint output of the team as a whole. Life-

cycle considerations also play an important role there (see below).

Incentives can't be so diluted for high-ranking people, who take ultimate

responsibility for the success of the organization as a whole. If they are

rewarded on market valuation and profitability of the firm, there is no need

to assess and price out each of the many activities that contribute to it.

There is no need to reduce the "power" of incentives to them [Lazear

(1986))

          An important qualification remains. Rewards that promote good

incentives must be indexed to outcomes that managers can alter. Stock

market values and current profits are only partly affected by managerial

decisions. They also are affected by business conditions beyond any

manager's control. Lazear and Rosen (1981) pointed out that relative
                                       25


comparisons wash out common components of variance among competitors and

isolate specific performance-related components. The idea is analyzed most

completely by Holmstrom (1982a) who showed that relative comparisons

eliminate a source of extraneous risk for agents. Increasing the signal-to-

noise ratio makes managerial incentives more effective and contracts more

efficient.

             C.   The Evidence

             Top executive compensation in a large firm is set by the Board of

Directors, often with the assistance of management consultants [Tosi and

Comez-Mejia (1989)). The contracts themselves are not public information,

but there is little doubt that remuneration is tied to the fortunes of the

firm. There are, however, differences of opinion about how performance is

measured for compensation purposes and about the magnitude of the effects.

             The earliest studies on the sales-profits debate summarized above

generally found larger effect of sales than of profits (Roberts (1956),

McGuire, et al. (1962)). Later studies [Lewellen and Huntsman (1970),

Kokkelenberg (1988), Winn and Shoenhair (1988)) tended to find stronger

effects of accounting profits on compensation, but at least an equal number

have found evidence for both [Meeks and Whittington (1975), Kostjuk (1986,

1989), Ciscel and Carroll (1980), Leonard (1990)), with the picture slightly

clouded by multicollinearity. Since size must be an important correlate of

pay if more talented persons control greater resources, posing the agency

question in terms of sales versus profits is not meaningful in the available

data. The managerial hypothesis that size is larger than it otherwise would

   is a counterfactual that cannot be answered at the moment. Looking at

all the studies together I cannot see clear winners in the earlier debate.

Both performance and scale are important. I confine attention to those
                                        26


studies where elasticities are presented or can be computed. All of the

estimates refer either to the CEO or to the top five executives. Some use

salary and bonus as independent variable, others a more comprehensive

definition that includes deferred compensation and options.

          Kostiuk (1986) estimates a semi-elasticity of the accounting rate

of return on compensation (defined as dlog(compensation)/dr, where r is the

rate of return) of about 1.25 for the United States in both the l930s and

early 1970s. This compares quite well with Cosh's (1975) estimate of 1.0

for Britain in the early l970s. In recent years, empirical studies have

tended to use the stock market rate of return as the performance measure

rather than accounting rates of return. This reduces the elasticity

estimate by almost a factor of 10.

          Murphy (1985) estimates a semi-elasticity of compensation with

respect to the rate of return to shareholders of .12 to .16 using a 73 firm

sample of firms during 1969-81. Murphy (1986) produces a similar estimate

on a much larger Forbes sample of about 250 large firms over 1974-84.

Earlier, Masson (1971) estimated statistically significant effects of stock

returns on CEO compensation from a 39-firm sample over 1947-66, though the

coefficients themselves are not reported. Coughlin and Schmidt (1985)

estimated a semi-elasticity of .10 to .15 on a 40-firm sample from Forbes

during 1978-80. The study is notable for using the abnormal stock return

(estimated from CAPM)   instead   of the raw return. Murphy (1985) tried both

abnormal and total returns in a within-firm compensation regression. Most

of the estimated effect goes to the raw return, and it doesn't seem to

matter which one is used, so long as both aren't used together. Again,

there is evidence that this estimate is remarkably uniform from study to
                                          27


study, e.g. ,   consider   that Barro and Barro (forthcoming) report an estimate

of .17 for bank CEOs over 1982-87.

           Coughlin and Schmidt (1985) were among the first to use a relative

performance measure, yet Murphy's (1985) empirical competition between

relative and absolute stock returns suggested that relative performance

didn't matter. Relative performance evaluation was principally addressed by

Antle and Smith (1986) using Masson's 1947-66 sample. They found only weak

evidence to support the idea. It was definitely rejected for 15 out of 37

firms studied, while wrong signs on the systematic and firm-specific

components were obtained for many others. Barro and Barro (forthcoming)

find no evidence of relative performance evaluation among bank CEOs, even

though there were marked differences in fortunes among regional economies

and their constituent banks during the period of analysis.

           A recent study by Gibbons and Murphy (1990) uses the largest

(Forbes) sample and provides the most evidence supporting relative

performance evaluation. They include the average rate of return on stock in

the firm's industry and the firm's own rate of return in the compensation

regression, rather than abnormal performance, CAPM-measures. They find

positive effects of own return on executive compensation and negative

effects of industry average return. While it is the strongest evidence for

relative performance effects yet found, anornolies remain because industry

effects are larger at the most aggregate level than at the firm's own four-

digit level. The estimated effect may be sensitive to how relative

performance is measured. Hence the overall picture on relative performance

effects is somewhat more on the negative than positive side of the ledger.

           Most studies so far have examined whether pay and performance have

positive partial correlation. This is the natural first approximation, but
                                     28


there are only a few more ambitious studies that purport to examine

causation. This program was begun by Masson (1971), who investigated how

various components of pay affect firm performance. The method used is

flawed and has not been pursued. Leonard (1990) regressed the rate of

return on equity on various aspects of pay and incentives for executives

within ten levels of the top in a proprietary sample. No clear general

picture emerges because the effects differ in sign when estimated within and

between firms. Abowd's (1990) study on these proprietary data is notable

for asking whether changes in the sensitivity of pay to performance affects

subseQuent performance. Evidence of such effects is found for stock market

performance indicators, but not for accounting measures. The inventory of

studies is too small to make definitive judgements on causality right now.

Hopefully more studies along these lines will be forthcoming.

          Finally, some studies have examined the sensitivity of pay

components to performance. Most studies above conclude that current

performance rewards come about through adjustment of the bonus and

components of compensation other than salary. Salary is a substantial part

of compensation, but acts more like the fixed term   in the development

above. One thinks that salary adjustments should respond to longer term

components of performance and bonus to shorter term components, but this is

an undertudjed point. Eaton and Rosen (1983) consider the difference

between long- and short-term incentives by examining the correlates of

current and deferred pay components. However, Miller and Scholes (1982)

argue convincingly that these forms of compensation are tied up with tax

laws so it is difficult to distinguish the two. For instance, stock options

were not used for compensation until the early 1950g. when upper bracket

marginal tax rates were very high. Morck, Shleifer and Vishny (1988a) find
                                          29


a curious nonmonotonic relationship between management stock ownership and

firm performance. Using a cross section of large U.S.firms in the 1980s,

they find that performance measured by Tobin-Grunfeld's Q increases with

stock ownership of Board members (including the CEO) when it is less than 5

percent of total stock, decreases with ownership in the 5 to 25 percent

range, and perhaps increases again above that range. No compelling

explanations have appeared as yet for this unusual finding.

            D. Assessment

            Though there is little doubt that top executive's incomes vary

with the fortunes of their firms, the picture is mixed relative to theory.

Confirming evidence from several independent studies and samples leaves us

fairly secure that the effect of stock returns on log compensation is in the

0.10 -   0.15 range. The many estimates of accounting rates of return on
compensation don't lend themselves to such ready comparisons, even though

most studies do find positive effects. The best available comparable

estimates are in the range 1.0 -   1.2,   and quite a bit larger than for rates

of return to stock ownership.

            I cannot express a clear preference between these two

alternatives. Many economists simply dismiss accounting profits as too

easily manipulatable by top managers to be suitable contractual measures of

performance. Such dismissal is simply wrong. Not only is it known that

explicit provisions of executive contracts are in fact tied to accounting

numbers, but the deeper intellectual question is whether market or

accounting returns are more informative for executive incentives [Lambert

and Larker (1987)]. It cannot be true that accounting information is

worthless in the giant firms in question, since they simply couldn't exist

without it. Finally, accounting numbers are the main source of information
                                     30


not oniy for managerial decisions. They also inform the stock market. Top

executives are in a repeated game, constantly observed by bird-dogs, market

makers and, even worse, raiders. This limits possible misrepresentation for

compensation purposes. For sure, depreciation methods and special charges

can be chosen advantageously on occasion. Yet these manipulations can't

occur very often and have future costs as well as current benefits.

          Undoubtedly, stock values are less easy to manipulate in this

sense, but how much information about performance do they contain? The

stock price of a firm changes for many reasons that are independent of its

performance. Some underlying causes such as shifts in industry demand have

similar effects on accounting profits. Others, such as changes in the

market discount rate, are specific to the stock market alone. There are

parallel sources of independent noise for accounting measures. Putting them

side by side, which measure has the greater signal power for managerial

performance?   Strong findings on relative performance evaluation would have

shed light on this, but only one study has found evidence for it. Bonus and

other payment mechanisms are seldom explicitly triggered by stock

performance in executive contracts. Options and deferred stock appreciation

rights are exceptions, but their value depends as much on the general state

of the stock market, which managers cannot affect, as on firm-specific

performance.

          Jensen and Murphy (1990) argue that the empirical relationship

between pay and performance, while positive, is too small to provide

adequate incentives for managers to act in shareholders' interests. Using

the Forbes 1974-86 sample, they regress the arithmetic first difference in

annual CEO compensation (including the change in personal wealth tied up in

the firm) on current and lagged arithmetic changes in shareholder wealth and
                                         31


a few other variables. An attempt is made to eliminate the effects of

market noise by using relative performance indicators, though they are
unsuccessful here.

            An estimate for dlog(compensation)/dr of .1 estimated in earlier

studies seems "reasonable," so it comes as a considerable surprise that the

estimated values in the arithmetic regression for d(compensation)/dr are

extremely small. The differences are due to the fact that the ratio of CEO

compensation to shareholder wealth is vanishingly small in these giant

corporations (on the order of 6xl04 at the median and l0 at the mean).

In the simplest specification, the first difference regression implies that

annual salary and bonus increase by a mere $l3.50-$21.00 when shareholder

wealth changes by $1M. Adding the effects of own stock holdings, options

and the like increases the estimates to $32.50. Since mean compensation is

more than $.5M per annum and personal wealth is much larger than that, these

are very small sums indeed, small enough to raise questions about the role

for compensation mechanisms to align the interests of managers and owners.

            Still, Jensen and Murphy's (1990) estimates are substantially

smaller than those implied by other studies. Considering that both

dividends and the number of shares of stock outstanding hardly changes in a

short time series the rate of return on stock ownership, r, is

approximately equal to the percentage change in total market shareholder

value. Let V represent the arithmetic first difference of total

shareholder value and ty the arithmetic first difference in salary and

bonus. Jensen and Murphy estimate        —    Ay/V       l.35x105. The semi-
elasticity estimate discussed above is         —   log   y/r —   (y/y)/Ar   for which

.1 serves as lower bound. Now, since            V/V, it follows that

b2   b1 •   V/y   and b1   b2y/V, where y and V are evaluated near the mean of
                                         32



the sample. Since y/V —          at   the mean, the implied estimate of , when

     .1, is 10 -- or almost eight times larger than their estimate of
b2
l.35xl05. This implies a total effect of at least $100 salary and bonus

change per $lM change in shareholder value, compared to their estimate of

$l3.5-$20.00. Working their estimate the other way round leads to an

implied elasticity near .014 and much smaller than the direct estimate of .1

found by others in these data.

          Functional forms must account for these differences. Most

empirical economists would argue for using log rather than arithmetic

differences because the latter are dominated by large firms. Furthermore,

the arithmetic effect is expected to decrease for large firms (as Jensen and

Murphy confirm) because the risks are larger. Since the rate of return is

largely independent of size, the directly estimated elasticity form (b2)

better controls statistically for size effects.

          Going out on a limb, the 1O estimate of i        implied   by the log

version suggests that CEO's lose $100,000 in direct pay per $1B decline in

stock value. Now a $1B change is large -• about 20 percent of the average

firm's value in the sample. However, the $100,000 is in the range of 20

percent of average compensation. Considering that CEO personal asset

holdings are almost surely less diversified than the average stockholder

[Lewellen (1968), Deckop (1988)], CEOs risk a considerable portion of their

personal wealth from the actions they take on behalf of shareholders. What

isn't so clear from theory is what a reasonable benchmark would be. Is the

.1- .15 elasticity estimate too small or too large? The theory hasn't

focused enough on that number to provide an answer.

V. CAREER INCENTIVES

          Much of the literature has analyzed incentives in a timeless

context. Interactions between the selection and incentive problems give

rise to important new issues when the problem is examined over a persons

career. Resources must be reassigned among managers over time, as older

generations retire and are replaced by younger generations. Aspiring

executives start their careers in low level positions and work their way up

through the ladder to higher level positions over the life cycle. How a

career develops depends on the quality of the person's previous work, what

talents were demonstrated in lower positions, and the talent of other people

who are available to be selected. Selection and incentives are intertwined

by competition for promotion to higher-paying positions and by attempts to

affect the selection process.

          A. ature of the Problem

          Again, the manager's horizon is crucial to this problem. Career

considerations are more important at the beginning of a career than at the

end. Toward the end of a career, if not before, the cards have been dealt

and one's hand is pretty much known. Higher level reassignments are

unlikely, or impossible. At that point the potential influence of future

prospects vanishes and only current incentives matter. Analyzing the very

top level executive labor market with a timeless context is a good

approximation for this reason. However, learning, incentives and aspects of

competition for positions necessarily arise when examining the market as a

whole.

          A promising approach is taken by Gibbons and Murphy (1990b), who

extend the linear piece rate model to many periods. The model is

specialized to only one activity but is generalized to include two sources
                                       34


of noise. Uncertainty about the agent's ability is added to the pure

randomness and/or measurement error in the mapping from effort to output in

early periods.

            The problem is solved by backward recursion. Consider two

periods. The solution in the last period follows that outlined above, with

the proviso that it is conditioned on whatever is known about the person's

ability   at the end of the previous period. Information    has no value in the

final   period and there is no investment in it by either   principal or agent.

Information acquired in the first period does have value because it can be

exploited later. Given anticipated optimal behavior in the second period,

investments, in information give extra first-period work incentives over and

above the piece rate. Specifically, the agent has incentives to increase

the signal-to-noise ratio in output to enable better assessment of ability.

Raising the first period piece rate isn't so necessary for incentives

because learning and piece rates are substitutes for each other. Such

substitution actually occurs in Gibbons and Murphy (1990b) for risk reducing

reasons, and the piece-rate price b is actually smaller in the first period

than in the second.

            Earlier, Murphy (1986) had contrasted pure learning with pure

incentive theories of the executive labor market. In the learning theory

the manager is paid the value of expected productivity estimated from

previous output. Bayesian inference implies that more is learned at the

beginning of a career than at the end because additional samples hardly

affect the posterior distribution when the number of observations is already

large. On the other hand, the atemporal incentive problem looks much the

same from one period to the next. Thus the learning model would imply less

sensitivity of compensation to output for more experienced executives while
                                     35


the pure incentive model would not. When the two forces are combined,

incentives to invest in learning still decline over time and less learning

takes place, but now it is necessary to substitute current performance

incentives for diminishing career incentives over the life-cycle. This

implies that sensitivity of pay to current performance should actually

increase for more experienced executives whose horizon is shorter than the

less experienced.

          8. Promotions and Career Incentives

          Career considerations loom large in promotion of executives across

ranks in the corporate structure. Evidence exists that much human capital

investment is related to these kinds of job changes [Sicheraian and Galor

(1990)) in the labor market generally. Still, there are reasons to suspect

that these aspects of work are much more important for executives than for

other workers. Advancement in rank in the officer corps of a military

organization is a useful rigid hierarchy version of the process to keep in

mind (though the up-or-out feature usually isn't encountered in firms).

Large firms, such as oil companies with far flung foreign operations, rotate

high level personnel through the system and through the ranks much like the

military. No doubt differences in style and technology make it a poorer

approximation for many firms, yet essential elements remain common to all of

them.

          Promotions focus an executive's career attention on those discrete

points when a "window of opportunity" opens for possible advancement.

Typically these windows fit some predetermined rough outline of the firm's

organization structure and there is competition for them from contenders,

both within and without the firm. This process can be modeled as a

tournament (see Lazear and Rosen (1981) for an early analysis). Competitors
                                         36


with the highest scores on some performance criteria are declared winners

and get promoted to a better job. Comparison methods in statistical

experiments come to mind as a possible model, with the crucial difference

that the objects of the experiment can and do take actions to influence the

outcome. Where one gets classified in this competition makes an enormous

economic difference to a person.

          It is interesting that within-firm competition sometimes can be

structured to approximate socially optimum incentives by adjusting the wage

structure across job ranks. The idea is simple. Incentives to put forth

effort to win are increasing in the difference in prizes between winning and

losing. Since incentives vanish when the difference in compensation

vanishes and increase without bound in the other direction, there exists a

between-rank wage structure that promotes the optimal amount of effort (in

the sense that the expected marginal product to the firm of such effort

equals its marginal cost). Much has been made of setting the scope and

limitations of this result. Levinthal (1984), McLaughlin (1988), and

Mookerjee (1989) provide excellent surveys to which the reader is referred

for details .     Instead   of providing another review, I use the idea to

illustrate some effects of career considerations on the organizational wage

structure.

             Think of a career as stochastically climbing a ladder. Ultimately

the person comes to rest at some rung, perhaps at the top but usually

before. This scheme loosely follows a sequential design-of-experiments,

where "losers" are successively culled from the sample and not allowed to

continue. It economizes sample size and gains information efficiently.

Incentive issues arise from the stopping rule. A person's horizon in this

game falls to zero when being passed over for promotion enough times
                                         37


eliminates opportunities to continue. From that point on current monetary

incentives and monitoring must motivate job performance. However, those who

are still "alive" and contending in the promotion game have a longer horizon

which weighs into their decision to put out efforts to climb higher. Simple

formulations of this problem have been analyzed [Rosen (1986)). The value

of winning at any stage is not only the winner's prize (compensation) at

that level, but also includes the value of an option to compete for larger

prizes at higher levels. The value of this option reflects career

considerations.

           The value v of contending in a game in which there are t stages

remaining is



(14)              v — max(P(1,2)v       + [I -
                                                 P(i,2)1W1   -
                                                                 cC2)}


where P(.,2) is the probability of winning when own effort £ is expended and

efforts 2 are expended by other competitors, W1 is the compensation paid

to the loser and c(s) is the (convex) cost of effort. The first order

condition for this problem is



(15)              (vi - W+i)0P/81 —     c'(l)

Defining    —   (âlog   P/8log )/(8log c/3log 2), manipulating (15) into an

elasticity form and substituting out for c in (14) yields a recursion for v



(16)              v —          + (l)W
                                                 38


where        —                 is   evaluated at the Nash equilibrium effort levels and

probabilities. Assuming 0 <                 < 1 and using the boundary condition that

   —         where           is the highest ranking prize (the CEO's compensation), the
       W1,
solution to (16) is



(17)                 —              .8)5W1 +          tw2 + . . . + t6wt +


where 5W —               -      is   the difference in prizes between adjacent ranks.

The option value v in (17) is the sure prize W1 if the contest is lost

plus the discounted sum of differences in rewards between ranks in future

rounds. The discount factor                 depends on the probability of winning and

the costs and technology of doing so. Subtracting W÷2 from both sides of

(17) and comparing it with (15) shows that the incentives to win are

increasing in the option value, specifically,



(18)                     (v1W+i) —             8t 1)6W1 +      .
                                                                   t-l2   +   .   +



             The firm desires that effort expended by people in higher

positions be at least as large as that expended at lower levels, if the

multiplicative effects in section II exist. This is why executives work

such long hours. In a pure incentive game where the contenders are known to

be of similar talent, $ works out to be a constant independent of t and and

it can be shown that compensation differences between adjacent ranks below

the top are necessary to induce nondecreasing effort across ranks. However,

the option to continue plays out at the final round, so the difference in

compensation between the CEO and first Vice President must be increased to

make up for it. There is an extra prize at the top.
                                      39


           The economics is that this increment acts to extend the effective

 horizon, "as if" the promotion ladder were of infinite length and

 competitors were in a game which continued forever. The idea survives many

 generalizations. It suggests that the wage structure in a hierarchical

organization should exhibit a certain "convexity;" whereby CEO
                                                                 compensation
 is out of step and elevated above the rest for motivational purposes in the

organization as a whole. More generally, when managers compete to change

their positions over their careers, wages at any given level have spillover

effects on the incentives of contenders at lower levels.

          Competition generated by these kinds of relative performance

evaluation can lead to moral hazard problems. Competitors
                                                            may collude [Dye
(1984)] and put forth less effort than is appropriate, to the detriment   of
the organization as a whole. Alternativly, there may be opportunities for

destructive activities of competitors to denigrate the work of others and

make one's self look better by comparison [Lazear (1989)]. Such antisocial

behavior can be partially controlled by reducing the stakes and narrowing

wage differentials between ranks, but it comes at the cost of reducing

effort in the organization as a whole. It might also be controlled by

recruiting personnel for these positions from outside the organization. An

alternative view has been little studied: Breton and Wintrobe (1986)

describe a form of competition within a patronage system. The CEO

encouraged competition among his immediate subordinates, who in turn served

as patrons for those lower down the hierarchy. Those further below knew the

game and took actions to improve the standing of their patron in the eyes of

the CEO because that could improve the subordinate's standing. The scheme

has qualities of an "invisible hand," though used to totally corrupt

purposes in their case study.

          These moral hazards are not specific to tournament structures.

Rather they apply to any incomplete scoring scheme for assessing talent.

Tirole (1986) analyzes collusion between an agent and supervisor, both

against the principal. Milgrorn (1988) considers the effects of socially

unproductive activities taken by an agent to influence the scoring system.

Both considerations appear to generate incentives for more rigid and

bureaucratic rules within an organization relative to using internal prices

to self-regulate behavior.

          C. Evidence

          Data limitations on executive careers and incomes below the top

have limited empirical work in this area. Some of the implications of these

models have been borne out in experiments and a few have not [Bull, et al.

(1987,1988)], but there is less evidence from the market itself. Rosenbaurn

(1984) documented career paths through promotion in a case study of one

large firm. Proxy statements of large firms often list total compensation

of the highest paid twenty or thirty executives and suggest that top

executives are indeed paid substantially more than those immediately below

them. This is confirmed in Leonard's (1990) proprietary sample, where

differences in pay increase markedly between adjacent levels in moving from

bottom to top. He also reports that pay increments are negatively

correlated with promotion prospects, consistent with requirements for

incentive maintenance when competition is stiffer. Yet, in a single year

cross-firm comparison, O'Reilly et al. (1988) found that pay differences

between CEO and vice presidents were negatively correlated with the number

of vice presidents. A positive correlation is expected if more vice

presidents are contending for the CEO position. Perhaps some of them aren't

competing. The convexity implication within firms is also found by Lambert,
                                       41


et al. (1989) in a large proprietary sample. Differences in pay between

levels increase rapidly with rank in their sample, and the CEO earns on the

order of $100,000 more, compared to $10,000 - $30,000 median differences at

lower levels.

          There is evidence supporting direct substitution of current for

career incentives of CEO's as time to retirement decreases. Gibbons and

Murphy (1990b) examine Forbes' sample CEOs who left their firms over 1974-

89. The elasticity of pay to stock market value is the usual .10 when these

people had many years remaining, but rises to .18 when they had few years

left. Previously, Murphy (1986) found that the relation between CEO pay and

stock market rate of return was larger in earlier years of CEO tenure in

both position and in the firm,   and Barro and Barro (forthcoming) found
declining sensitivity of pay to performance with age of CEO. However,

neither studies time-remaining nor controls for CEO stock holdings, which

tend to grow withtenure. Own stock holding in the firm gives immediate

performance incentives and reduces the need for sensitivity in direct

compensation.

          Available evidence generally supports some of the life cycle and

other implications of these models. However, more evidence is needed.



VI. CONCLUSIONS

          This survey demonstrates great scope for fruitful empirical and

theoretical research in this area. As usual, much remains to be done.

          On the empirical side, inquiry must dig deeper into the management

hierarchy. In some ways our preoccupation with top executives is examining

the tip of the iceberg. However, much effort at data development will be

necessary for such endeavors. Empirical investigation also must be
                                     42


broadened beyond the U.S. to other countries. How will these remarkably

uniform estimates compare around the world? It is commonly alleged, for

example, that Japanese business executives earn much less relative to

production workers compared to their American and Zritish counterparts. It

would be very interesting to know if the compensation elasticities of .25

for scale and .10 for shareholder wealth nevertheless hold true in Japanese

firms. In addition, executive ranks recently have opened up to women in

many countries. The marked increase in available supplies of managerial

talent should have large consequences on the executive labor market, which

remain to be worked out and examined empirically.

          Of the many theoretical issues on the research agenda, a few stand

out. First, many alternative mechanisms for affecting managerial incentives

have been identified. How should the effects of reputation, bonding,

takeovers and compensation contracts be parceled out? To what extent do

these alternatives act as substitutes for each other, or as complements?

Second, perhaps the idea that shareholders are the only principals in the

executive contracting problem is too simple. There is much to be said for

the view of a firm as a "nexus of contracts." Then control decisions affect

the wealth of many contract holders in the firm. For example, shouldn't

debt holders [Fama and Jensen (1983)] be included as claimants of the firm's

resources and included in the empirical estimates of wealth elasticities?

Furthermore, what limits the scope of control? Labor economists have

increasingly recognized the importance of firm specific human capital; and

firm-specific capital is often involved in contracts with specialty

suppliers and other intermediaries. All of them have a stake in how the

firm is managed. Evidence on this broadened "stakeholder" view of claimants

is hardly to be found, and though it is not compelling for the case of
                                     43


hostile takeovers [Shleifer and Summers (1988), Kaplan (1989)], these issues

are likely to be more generally important. They deserve more attention.

          Finally little has been done on executive succession and how

incompetent executives are rooted out, short of the draconian takeover

solution. Vancil's (1987) interesting account of how CEO's are chosen is

necessarily limited by the small selection of firms in its case study

approach. Any executive selection process is subject to error, but little

if anything is known about how mistakes are corrected. If, as I maintain,

competence has extraordinary marginal product for top management positions

in large firms, how incompetence is revealed and handled must be important.

Formally, the job falls to the Board of Directors. Yet there is much

opinion and some evidence (e.g., board compositions change when the CEO

changes [Hermalin and Weisback (1988)]) that Boards are themselves

controlled by the CEO. The implied limits on monitoring would appear to

make the contractual approach more important.
