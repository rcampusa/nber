                                            ABSTRACT


        The paper surveys a theory of FDI, which captures a unique feature: hands-on management
standards, that enable investors to react in real time to a changing economic environment. Equipped
with superior managerial skills, foreign direct investors are able to outbid portfolio investors for the
top productivity firms in a particular industry in which they have specialized in the source country.
Consequently, FDI investors would make investment, both larger, and of higher quality (namely,
with large rates of returns), than the domestic investors. The theory can explain both two-way FDI
flows among developed countries, and one-way FDI flows from developed to developing countries.
Gains to the host country from FDI stem from the informational value of FDI. The predictions of
the theory are consistent with evidence from panel data: larger FDI coefficients in the domestic
investment and output growth regressions relative to the portfolio equity flow and international loan
coefficients, reflect a more significant role for FDI in the domestic investment process than other
types of capital inflows.

              FDI Contribution to Capital Flows and Investment in Capacity




1.     Introduction



The name "Foreign Direct Investment" usually brings to mind a significant contribution of

FDI to domestic investment and to capital inflows. However, there has been a lot of

skepticism concerning the contribution of FDI to these engines of growth. As noted by

Froot (1993), FDI (the purchase by a domestic resident of a controlling stake in a foreign

company) actually requires neither capital flows nor investment in capacity. Conceptually,

FDI is an extension of corporate control over international boundaries: "When Japanese-

owned Bridgestone takes control over the US firm Firestone, capital need not flow into the

US. The equity purchase can largely be financed by US domestic lenders. Any borrowing

by Bridgestone from foreign-based third parties also does not qualify as FDI (although it

would count as an inflow of portfolio capital into the US). And, of course, in such

acquisition there is no investment expenditure; merely an international transfer in the title

of corporate assets."    Does this example capture the essence of FDI in emerging

economies?



The answer we provide in this paper, based on a new theory, and new empirical evidence, is

that FDI flows does play an important role in the skimming of high productivity investment

projects and thereby contributes significantly to domestic investment in both the quantity

and the quality dimensions.




                                             2
2.     Old and New Theories



Theories of FDI can essentially be divided into two categories: micro (industrial

organization) theories and macro-finance (cost of capital) theories. The early literature that

explains FDI in microeconomic terms focuses on market imperfections, and on the desire of

multinational enterprises to expand their market power (see Caves (1971)). Subsequent

literature centered more on firm-specific advantages, owing to product superiority or cost

advantages, stemming from economies of scale, multi-plants economies and advanced

technology, or superior marketing and distribution (see Helpman (1984)). According to

this view, multinationals find it cheaper to expand directly in a foreign country, rather than

through trade, in cases where the advantages associated with cost or product are based on

internal, indivisible assets based on knowledge and technology. Alternative explanations

for FDI have focused on regulatory restrictions, including tariffs, quotas, that either

encourage or discourage cross-border acquisitions, depending on whether one considers

horizontal or vertical integrations.



Studies examining the macroeconomic effects of exchange rate on FDI focussed on the

positive effects of an exchange rate depreciation of the host country on FDI inflows,

because it lowers the cost of production and investment in the host countries, raising the

profitability of foreign direct investment. The wealth effect is another channel through

which a depreciation of the real exchange rate could raise FDI. A depreciation of the real

exchange rate, by raising the relative wealth of foreign firms, could make it easier for those

firms to use retained profits to finance investment abroad and to post a collateral in

borrowing from domestic lenders in the host country capital market (see Froot (1991) and

Razin and Sadka (2001)). There is also a large literature on different forms of spillovers



                                              3
from inward investors in the form of new technologies, new ideas and capital accumulation

on the growth of output in the domestic economy. (see Blomstrom, Kokko and Globerman

(2001)).



What is the essential difference between portfolio investment and FDI investment from the

point of view of corporate governance?



Management under portfolio equity ownership may be plagued by a free-rider problem.

Under disperse ownership, if an individual shareholder does something to improve the

quality of management, the benefits will accrue also to all other shareholders, see Oliver

Hart. In contrast, FDI investor, who is endowed with management skills and gains control

of the firm, has better incentives to pursue proper monitoring of management, and will be

in better position to micro manage the firm. Furthermore, based on possessing "intangible

capital" in her source country, the FDI investor can apply more efficient management

standards in the host country compared to domestic investors. Thus, the unique advantage

to FDI, that has only recently been explored, is the potential for superior micro-

management, based on the specialization in niches of industry. Important issues with FDI

from this standpoint are: (1) Which are the salient characteristics of the free-FDI-flows

equilibrium, when FDI investors take control over domestic firms. (2) What constitute the

gains from FDI flows to the host economy, given that the foreign investors appropriate the

private rewards resulting from their superior management skills; and (3) Whether or not the

free-FDI-flows regime is more efficient than free-portfolio-flows regime.



In an integrated capital market, with full information, all forms of capital flows (FDI, loans,

and Portfolio equity and debt) are indistinguishable.        In the presence of incomplete



                                              4
information, these flows are significantly different from one another. In Razin and Sadka

(2002), we developed a stylized model of FDI in the presence of imperfect information with

respect to the firm's productivity.



We formalized the unique advantage of FDI investment over other types of investment in a

stylized model. Suppose that initially all firms are still owned by original (domestic)

uninformed owners, and suppose that the productivity shock is purely idiosyncratic. At the

beginning of the first period, when investment decisions are made, firms are still

uninformed about the productivity shock (the productivity level of the specific firm which

they own). It will be revealed only in the second period, when output from new capital

becomes public knowledge. In order to make new investment the firm must incur first a

fixed setup cost. As the firms are all ex-ante identical, if they have to make the investment

decision based on this level of information, they will all invest the same, in accordance with

the expected level of the productivity factor. Assume now that at this stage, before the

productivity factor is known, foreign direct investors step in.         Once acquiring and

effectively managing the firm, the FDI investor can better monitor the productivity of the

firm than her domestic investor counterpart. She can thus fine-tune the level of capital

stock more closely to the value of the productivity factor. Anticipating this fine-tuned

investment schedule, the value of the firm to the potential FDI investor is larger than the

reservation value to the original owner, and the corresponding bid value to potential

domestic investors. Therefore, FDI investors will outbid domestic investors for the firms in

the domestic industry. Competition among potential FDI investors will drive up the price

close to the price which reflect the upgraded management of the firm. The initial domestic

owners will gain the rent, which is equal to difference between the FDI investor's shadow

price and the initial owner's reservation price.



                                               5
If the competition between potential FDI investors is perfect, all the benefits from the

superior FDI management skills accrue to the host economy, leaving the FDI investors with

a return on their investment just equalling the world rate of interest. The gains to the host

economy from FDI inflows can on this case be classified into two categories. First, there

are the conventional gains that stem from opening the economy to the new flow of capital,

thereby allowing a more efficient intertemporal allocation of consumption (e.g., via

consumption smoothing). Second, there are the intrinsic gains associated with the superior

micro-management by FDI investors. The entire gain of the FDI investors is captured by

the domestic economy because of assumed perfect competition among these investors over

the domestic firms. If, however, there is imperfect competition among FDI investors the

gains will split between them and the host country.



The economic gains from FDI, relative to portfolio inflows, lie only in the efficiency of

investment, since in both cases there are consumption smoothing effects and the same

world interest rate (r) prevails in the host country in both the FDI-flows regime and the

Portfolio-flows regime. In other words, the gains from FDI, in comparison to portfolio

flows, do not include the traditional gains from opening up the domestic capital market to

foreign capital inflows because these traditional gains are present also in the Portfolio-flows

regime.   Razin and Sadka (2002) were able also to show that, under some plausible

conditions on the form of the production function, the size of the aggregate stock of capital

is larger under FDI than under Portfolio equity flows.



3.     The Evidence




                                              6
Like its theoretical counterpart, empirical work has tended to focus either on underlying

factors to explain the location of FDI flows across countries or on explaining the cyclical

behaviour of FDI flows using macroeconomic variables, and assessing the contribution of

FDI flows to investment and growth.



To what extent is there empirical support for such claims of the significant impact of FDI

on domestic investment?



3.1     Previous Literature



A comprehensive study by Bosworth and Collins (1999) provides evidence concerning the

effect of capital inflows on domestic investment for 58 developing countries during 1978-

95. The authors distinguish among three types of inflows: FDI, portfolio investment, and

other financial flows (primarily bank loans). Bosworth and Collins find that an increase of

a dollar in capital inflows is associated with an increase in domestic investment of about 50

cents. (Both capital inflows and domestic investment are expressed as percentages of

GDP.)      This result, however, masks significant differences among different types of

inflows.    FDI appears to bring about close to a one-for-one increase in domestic

investment; there is virtually no discernible relationship between portfolio inflows and

investment (little or no impact); and the impact of loans falls between those of the other

two. These results hold both for the 58-country sample and for a subset of 18 emerging

markets. (See Figure 1; source: Loungani and Razin (2001)).

        estimated impact of $1 of the indicated capital flow on domestic investment.


An additional (striking) feature of FDI flows that was noted in previous literature is that the

share of FDI in total inflows is higher in riskier countries, as measured either by countries'

credit ratings for sovereign (government) debt or other indicators of country risk (see

Figure 2). There is also some evidence that the FDI share is higher in countries where the

quality of corporate governance institutions is lower. What can explain these seemingly

paradoxical findings? One explanation is that FDI is more likely, compared with other

forms of capital flows, to take place in countries with missing or inefficient markets. In

such settings, foreign investors will prefer to operate directly instead of relying on local

financial markets, suppliers, or legal arrangements.



3.2         Determinants of FDI Flows: A Gravity Model



Loungani, Mody, Razin and Sadka (2003) employ a gravity model of bilateral FDI and

portfolio capital flows in order to explain determinants of the mobility of financial capital

across countries. The authors identify three main categories of variables that significantly

explain FDI inflows in the data. First, they find a positive correlation between the degree

of     industry-specialization in the source countries and FDI flows into the destination



                                               8
countries.   Second, the ease of communications between the source country and the

destination country (as measured by telephone densities in each country) is found to have

positive effects on the size of FDI flows. Third, countries with higher debt-equity ratios of

publcly traded companies attract less FDI flows; these findings are summarized in Table 1.



In Loungani, Mody, Razin and Sadka (2003) we interpreted the industry-specialization

measure in the source country as an indication of a comparative advantage to the potential

foreign direct investors in eliciting good investment opportunities in the destination

country, relative to domestic investors in the host country. This advantage may stem, for

example, from the ability of FDI investors to apply better industry-specific micro-

management standards. In the theory this element is captured by assuming a lower cost of

cream (high-productivity-firms)-skimming on the part of foreign direct investors. The

second category of variables underscores the role of information as a determinant of FDI

inflows. As banks are the main providers of debt capital in emerging markets, and they

usually conduct rigorous scrutiny of the credit worthiness of their debtors, we conjecture

that, ceteris paribus, firms with high debt-equity ratio tend to be more transparent. In this

case, the advantage of FDI investors in their cream-skimming skills (that is, the selection of

high productivity firms) is less pronounced and therefore FDI inflows are less abundant.

4.       FDI Flows, Investment and Growth: Panel Data



Recently, Hecht, Razin and Shinar (2002) find that the effect of FDI inflows on domestic

investment is significantly larger than either portfolio equity or loan inflows; see table 2.

They provide also evidence that FDI inflows promote efficiency: The effect of FDI on GDP

growth is higher than the effect of other inflows, after controlling for the effect of capital

accumulation on GDP growth; see table 3.

4.1       Empirical Framework for the Panel-Data Analysis



In this sub-section we describe our econometric approach for the estimation of the

interactions between domestic investment, FDI flows, international loans, and international

portfolio investment. The sample consists of 64 developing countries, including Israel1, in

the period 1976 to 1997 (22 years in total; see appendix 2). All the variables but the

dummies are expressed in terms of gDP percentages. The source of data is the WDI

database (see appendix 1). The system of equations is given by:



1.        I=       β i1 j + β i 2 I (−1) + β i 3 DY + β i 4 DY (−1) + β i 5 FDI + β i 6 P + β i 6 P + β i 7 L + β i8G

The 4-equation system has four endogenous variables: I, FDI, P and L as dependent

variables and observations. Every equation also includes, as an explanatory variable, the

dependent variable lagged one period. The exogenous variables used for identification are

government expenditure (G), a dummy variable for multiple exchange rates (Res1), a

dummy variable for restrictions on current account transactions (Res2), and lagged

dependent variables.



Table 2 describes the interactions among the endogenous and the exogenous variables in

the 4-equation system.

Two versions are estimated: OLS regressions, as a benchmark, and TSLS regressions with

a country-specific effect.     To avoid nonstationarity of the residuals in the 4-equation

system, we introduce lagged dependent variables on the right hand side of the equation

system.

                                             12
Tables 3-6 present the estimation results, and we discuss them equation-by-equation.



Table 3 describes the effects of capital inflows on domestic investment.



The coefficient of FDI is significant in the OLS and TSLS regressions. FDI long-run effect

on domestic investment is 0.94 in the OLS regression and 0.68 in the TSLS regression.

Thus, potential for an upward bias in the OLS estimation procedure appears to be validated.

Indeed the effect of FDI on domestic investment is smaller in TSLS regressions. The loan-

coefficient is significant and positive both in the OLS and the TSLS regressions, at a

similar magnitude. However, the long run coefficient (adjusted for the lag structure of the

regression) moves up from -0.35 in the TSLS regression. The Coefficient of the portfolio-

investment variable is not significant in the OLS regression and becomes significant in the

TSLS regression. Interestingly, the long run effect FDI on domestic investment, 0.68

exceeds the corresponding effect of portfolio investment, 0.53, which in turn exceeds the

effect of loans, 0.35.

explanatory power of the regression is however poor and most of the right-hand side

variables have non-significant coefficients. The regression analysis, effectively, flashes out

an auto-correlation process of the portfolio investment flows.

Output Growth



Table 7 describes the effects of capital inflows on Growth.       The coefficient of FDI is

significant in the OLS and TSLS regressions. FDI long-run effect on output GROWTH is 0.1

in the OLS regression and 0.23 in the TSLS regression. The effect of FDI on output growth is

smaller in TSLS regressions. Thus, potential for a downward bias in the OLS estimation

procedure appears to be demonstrated. The long run coefficient in the TSLS regression is

0.23.



The loan-coefficient and the portfolio coefficient are not significant in the OLS and the TSLS

regressions. However, the long run coefficient of portfolio flows exceeds 0.1.

Portfolio Inflows



Table 11 describes the effect of output growth on portfolio investment inflows.          The

explanatory power of the regression is however poor and most of the right-hand side variables

have non-significant coefficients. The regression analysis, effectively, flashes out an auto-

correlation process of the portfolio investment flows.

We summarize the main findings of the panel-data analysis, as follows.



(1)   FDI flows have an independent larger effect on domestic investment and output

      growth than loan flows and portfolio flows (the latter are the least effective).



(2)   Among the main determinants of capital inflows, domestic investment, or output

      growth, have more pronounced effects on FDI inflows, than on loans and portfolio

      flows.




                                              23
5.    Conclusion



Kindleberger (1969) suggested that in order to think about FDI we must ask not why capital

might flow into a country, but rather why some particular asset would be worth more under

foreign than under domestic control. I discussed here a theory of FDI, which captures a uniqe

feature: hands-on management standards that enable investors to react in real time to a

changing economic environment. Equipped with superior managerial skills, foreign direct

investors are able to outbid portfolio investors for the top productivity firms in a particular

industry in which they have specialized in the source country. Consequently, FDI investors

would make investment, both larger, and higher quality, than the domestic investors. The

theory can explain both two-way FDI flows among developed countries, and one-way FDI

flows from developed to developing countries. Gains to the host country from FDI stem from

the informational value of FDI.



The predictions of the theory are consistent with the evidence: larger FDI coefficients in the

domestic-investment and output-growth regressions relative to the portfolio equity and

international loans inflow coefficients, reflects a unique role for FDI in the domestic

investment and growth process.



I would like to end with a cautionary word based on the Irish case. It may be argued that the

heavy subsidization of FDI in Ireland in the past two decades resulted in impressive GDP

growth, but with less pronounced effect on the well being of Irish residents, as proxied by the

Irish GNP growth rates. Gains to the country that serve as host to FDI flows are not

necessarily captured by the increase in domestic investment, and productivity, to which FDI

flows give rise.

A few missing data items regarding loans for Israel were taken from the bank of Israel

resources.




2.    Definitions of series



TERMS OF TRADE (DTT) adjustment (constant LCU) (NY.TTF.GNFS.KN) - The terms

of trade effect equals capacity to import less exports of goods and services in constant

prices. Data are in constant local currency. The change is calculated as the difference from

one year to the other.



PUBLIC SPENDING ON EDUCATION (ED3), total (% of GNP, UNESCO)

(SE.XPD.TOTL.GN.ZS) - Public expenditure on education (total) is the percentage of GNP

accounted for by public spending on public education plus subsidies to private education at

the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. For more information, see WDI table 2.9.



GDP PER CAPITA (CY), PPP (current international $) (NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD) - GDP

per capita based on purchasing power parity (PPP). GDP PPP is gross domestic product

converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international

dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar in the United States.

Data are in current international dollars. For more information, see WDI tables 1.1, 4.11,

and 4.12. For the estimation we used the logarithm of CY.



FOREIGN        DIRECT         INVESTMENT         (FDI),   net   inflows   (%    of      GDP)

(BX.KLT.DINV.DT.GD.ZS) - Foreign direct investment is net inflows of investment to


                                            30
acquire a lasting management interest (10 percent or more of voting stock) in an enterprise

operating in an economy other than that of the investor. It is the sum of equity capital,

reinvestment of earnings, other long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the

balance of payments. For more information, see WDI table 5.1.



GENERAL GOVRNMENT CONSUMPTION (G) (% of GDP) (NE.CON.GOVT.ZS) -

General government consumption includes all current spending for purchases of goods and

services (including wages and salaries). It also includes most expenditures on national

defense and security, but excludes government military expenditures that are part of

government capital formation. For more information, see WDI table 4.9.



GROSS DOMESTIC INVESTMENT (I) (% of GDP) (NE.GDI.TOTL.ZS) - Gross

domestic investment consists of outlays on additions to the fixed assets of the economy plus

net changes in the level of inventories. Fixed assets include land improvements (fences,

ditches, drains, and so on); plant, machinery, and equipment purchases; and the

construction of roads, railways, and the like, including commercial and industrial buildings,

offices, schools, hospitals, and private residential dwellings. Inventories are stocks of goods

held by firms to meet temporary or unexpected fluctuations in production or sales. For

more information, see WDI tables 1.4 and 4.9.



GDP GROWTH (DY) (annual %) (NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG) - Annual percentage growth

rate of GDP at market prices based on constant local currency. Aggregates are based on

constant 1995 U.S. dollars. For more information, see WDI tables 4.1 and 4.2.

(BN.KLT.PTXL.CD) - Portfolio investment excluding liabilities constituting foreign

authorities' reserves covers transactions in equity securities and debt securities. Data are in

current U.S. dollars. This series was divided in the matching GDP to get the portfolio

investment as a share of GDP.



BANK AND TRADE-TRADE LENDING (L) (PPG + PNG) (NFL, current US$)

(DT.NFL.PCBO.CD) - Bank and trade-related lending covers commercial bank lending and

other private credits. Data are in current U.S. dollars. For more information, see WDI table

6.7. This series was divided in the matching GDP to get the loans flows as a share of GDP.



TOTAL FINACIAL FLOWS (TLY64F – is the sum of FDI, Portfolio & loans), Total

Portfolio flows (PLY64) and Total loans (OLY64) are the sum of all relevant flows divided

in the sum of relevant GDP. It includes 64 developing countries.
