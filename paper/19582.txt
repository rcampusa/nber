Constructing a PCE-Weighted Consumer Price Index

                                              ABSTRACT

This study investigates the effects of simulating the Consumer Price Index (CPI) with alternately sourced
weights on the inflation experience for an average US consumer. The Bureau of Labor Statistics currently
uses household spending data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) to construct expenditure
category weights, or “item” weights, in the CPI. The Bureau of Economic Analysis also estimates
consumer expenditures, but does so at a national level for publication of Personal Consumption Expenditures
(PCE) in the National Income and Product Accounts. In this paper, 2005-2010 price indexes that utilize
PCE weights instead of CE expenditure weights are compared with the CPI-Urban in order to evaluate
current CPI weighting methods. These comparisons show that the annualized growth rate over five
years of an adjusted PCE-weighted CPI is slightly lower than that of the CPI-U, while a reweighted
index that uses PCE expenditure definitions grows much more quickly than the CPI.

         Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) data are a source of frequent debate in the federal statistical

community. Pundits have criticized the household survey with arguments ranging from population and

item coverage bias to inaccurate reporting as disadvantages of using CE data.2 However, alternatives to

the Consumer Expenditure Survey are scarce, and CE data have many advantages, including scope and

population specificity. A variety of agencies and statistical programs utilize CE data, but one of the most

important uses of CE data is in the construction of weights for the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI),

produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Reported expenditures in the CE survey are used to

calculate the relative importance, or expenditure weight, of each item category in the index. In order for

the CPI to be an accurate measure of price change, it is vital that the weight data are accurate and

representative of the appropriate population. If there is a systemic bias in the CE weights, there could be a

bias in the resulting CPI.

         This paper examines CPI weights using an alternate weighting scheme under current CPI

methodology. This is done by comparing official 2005-2010 CPI index values with index values derived

from secondary source weights. Creating these indexes and comparing them to the published CPI allows

us to gain a better understanding of item representativeness and item response accuracy in the CE-sourced

CPI aggregation weights. In this study, Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data from the Bureau

of Economic Analysis are the secondary source. Ultimately, we find that an index weighted to PCE levels

matches the urban Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) very closely in trend and magnitude but grows at an

annualized rate that is about 0.1% lower than the CPI-U growth rate over the 2005-2010 period. An index

weighted to PCE levels that is not adjusted for definitional differences has an annualized 5-year growth

rate that is 0.3% higher than the CPI-U rate.

                                             2. Importance of CE in the CPI

            One reason that CE data are currently used in CPI production is the level of item, geographic, and

population disaggregation available from the survey. The CPI utilizes expenditure values for five distinct

population sub-groups, which are then combined to create a variety of indexes for specific populations

such as “Urban”, “Wage-Earner”, and “Elderly”. Detailed demographic data ranging from respondent age

to housing tenure to social security recipiency status are collected in the CE Survey and can be used in

index research. In addition, CE data are collected for 38 geographic zones known as index areas, which

are the primary level of geographic index aggregation in the CPI. These sub-national population and

geographic distinctions are possible because in the CE, survey data are collected at the household rather

than national level.

            CE collates expense reports for over 200 unique expenditure categories, which can then be used

to construct category expenditure estimates. The survey is conducted continuously on a monthly basis,

providing users the ability to derive monthly, quarterly, and annual expenditure estimates. In this regard,

the CE Survey is unique. It is currently the exclusive source of monthly and annual expenditure estimates

as required by the CPI program to construct elementary item-area indexes for the CPI.3

            The alternative source of consumer expenditure data in this report, the PCE component of the

National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA), is produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

These data are based on a census of retail establishments conducted every five years and on a variety of

other sources rather than on a single survey, and they are widely used as a measure of national

consumption expenditures. This paper examines the accuracy and reliability of CPI data by comparing the

official CPI, based on CE expenditure weights, to experimental indexes based on PCE expenditure levels

using a PCE/CE spending factor. Because the PCE data are national data and the CE data are available at

a local area level, the PCE/CE spending factor used in the paper must be applied identically across all

areas and population groups. The comparisons that follow discuss indexes created for the years 2005-

2010.

3   CPI methodology is explained in detail in the BLS Handbook of Methods, available at http://stats.bls.gov/opub/hom.

                                                                 3
            Two alternative indexes were constructed for the analysis. The first of these indexes, called PCE-

UNADJ, uses PCE expenditure levels with CPI item definitions without adjusting PCE data for coverage

differences (for example the inclusion of expenditures for rural households) or conceptual differences (for

example PCE‟s inclusion of employer-provided health insurance). The second index, called PCE-ADJ,

uses PCE expenditure levels adjusted for CPI item definitions, coverage, and concepts. A PCE alternate

weighting scheme is also useful in providing a check of the two data sources against each other. Both

PCE and CE measure consumer expenditures, but they do so with very different approaches.



                                             3. Data and Hybrid Index Design

            Previous work has studied weighting bias, deflator differences, and expenditure ratios between

PCE and CE to stimulate discussion and methodological improvement. This paper builds upon that body

of work by reconstructing CPI aggregation weights using PCE expenditure levels and item definitions to

create hybrid indexes. These hybrid indexes use CPI index methodology and CE expenditure data to

construct weights as the CPI does; however, CPI expenditures in the hybrid index aggregation weights are

multiplied by factors that adjust them to PCE expenditure levels. The following pages discuss the realities

of creating such PCE-calibrated CPIs using current CPI methodology and describe both results and

drawbacks of such work. Designing a PCE-calibrated CPI is especially valuable to the current discussion

of CE design, as it gives us a better idea of whether CE item response is both accurate and representative.4

The similarity of the CPI-U and PCE-calibrated indexes and item relative importances provides insight

into CE accuracy.

            To create PCE-calibrated indexes, a concordance between CPI and PCE item classifications is

required. With this concordance, PCE expenditures are approximately matched to CPI item classifications

and used to adjust the CPI expenditure weights to the levels where they would be if the CE reported

absolute expenditures at the same level as PCE. This constitutes the PCE scope index in this study: an

                                                                  4
index that is calibrated to PCE expenditure levels in the CPI goods and services categories that

correspond to PCE categories. The PCE scope index is referred to as PCE-UNADJ in this paper.

         The other created index goes one step further and tries to account for the fact that some PCE

categories match CPI categories in concept but not in expenditure definition; in this index, factors derived

from secondary source data are used to adjust PCE expenditures to match CPI definitions in categories

where the two data sources differ. For example, both PCE and CPI measure eggs and milk expenditures in

the same way, but they measure medical expenditures differently. CPI only uses out-of-pocket consumer

spending for medical goods and services including insurance premiums, whereas PCE includes all

expenditures made both by and on behalf of consumers for medical goods and services, taking into

account additional expenditures such as employer and government contributions. Therefore, this index

includes a factor that adjusts PCE medical expenditures to include out-of-pocket payments only. This

index is referred to as PCE-ADJ for the purposes of this paper. The methodology section below elaborates

on this process.


3.1 Previous Consumer Expenditure Data Comparisons

         Numerous authors have undertaken important research into the comparison of PCE and CPI data

on consumer expenditures to examine the quality and accuracy of CE. This previous work delves further

into potential causes of bias and error between PCE and CE. Lebow and Rudd (2003) approached the

issue of weighting bias in the CPI after the 1990s brought about tremendous change in CPI methodology. 5

They constructed a set of PCE weights to compare to CPI weights in the same time period by performing

a variety of adjustments to PCE data and then aggregating the weights. They excluded out-of-scope items,

adjusted medical, housing, and education expenditures to more closely align with CPI values, and they

attempted to adjust for population differences between the two data sources using a factor.

         Fixler and Jaditz (2002) compared the CPI and the PCE deflator, the BEA‟s price index computed

from PCE data, to derive the magnitude of index difference attributable in 1992-1997 to each type of

major difference: formulaic, conceptual, and implementation-related.6 They focused on what they called

an “accounting” solution that attempted to adjust for each of the major differences and calculate its ratio

of the index discrepancies; Fixler and Jaditz did not try to examine weighting or pricing issues directly.

         McCully, Moyer, and Stewart (2007) built on work like that by Fixler and Jaditz to expand the

time period addressed forward to 2007 and calculated formula, scope, weight, and “other” effects, such as

seasonal adjustment, that cause fundamental differences between the deflator and the CPI.7

         Garner, Janini, Passero, Paszkiewicz, and Vendemia (2006) have produced a variety of papers in

which they construct and update expenditure category ratios between PCE and CE data.8 Those authors

constructed ratios for both comparable and non-comparable goods and services categories, taking care to

examine each category in their paper and explain the caveats to the comparison and provide some reasons

why ratios differ from one. A ratio of indicated a perfect expenditure match for a given item category

between PCE and CE. Many other authors including Clark (2003), Triplett (1978 and 1981), and others

have also examined the PCE and CPI; the work of the authors mentioned above adds to the debate about

differences between the two subjects.

         All of the papers discussed above bring to light a variety of fundamental issues in attempting to

relate PCE and CE or CPI data. Garner, Janini, Passero, Paszkiewicz, and Vendemia (2006) explain data

collection methodology differences between the two. CE obtains its data through a series of diary and

interview surveys of consumers. In contrast, PCE data come from a variety of data sources but are

primarily derived from the quinquennial Economic Census, with data from trade and industry surveys to

supplement in the off years (or non-benchmark years).

         Many authors speak of the item scope differences between the two surveys. As McCully, Moyer,

and Stewart (2007) explain, CPI includes out-of-pocket consumer expenditures and PCE includes

purchases both by and on behalf of consumers. Two big conceptual differences discussed by Fixler and

Jaditz (2002) are population and implementation at the component level. In most cases, they argue, CE

data should be a subset of PCE data. PCE includes expenditures by military personnel and third party

payers such as employers that CE does not allow. However, CE and CPI go outside of the bounds of PCE

in some areas. PCE does not include items that it considers coercive, such as vehicle registration and

licensing, which are included in both CE and the Consumer Price Index. PCE also does not include CPI

and CE items such as lawn mowers and garden tractors, household maintenance and repairs, and fishing

and hunting licenses.

        There are even differences in definition between items that match each other in the two indexes,

such as apparel and food. In many cases, PCE and CPI categories will be a perfect match, except that the

item classification results in CPI arranging items in a way that is slightly different from how it is done in

PCE. For example, CPI and PCE apparel categories concord perfectly, except that CPI includes wallets,

umbrellas, and purses in apparel under accessories. PCE includes these items not in apparel but in

luggage. Some of this structure knowledge comes from concordance research conducted as a

collaborative effort between the CE, CPI, and PCE offices at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of

Economic Analysis (Blair, Cage, Garner, McCully, and Passero 2011).

        Garner, Janini, Passero, Paszkiewicz, and Vendemia (2006) note that previous studies have

shown that although underreporting in CE and diminished representativeness or respondent accuracy may

be a cause for the difference between PCE and CE results, the magnitude of PCE revisions indicates that

there are potential estimation issues coming from those data as well. Issues may also arise in the way that

PCE uses a variety of data sources. The general consensus among authors who studied both PCE and CE

data was that one could not be chosen as the whole source of bias and difference between the two, and all

agreed that there was further work to be done.

3.2 Index Methodology

          There are two experimental indexes in this study: an index that is PCE-calibrated using PCE

valuation of consumption (PCE-UNADJ) and an index that is PCE-calibrated using CPI valuation of

consumption (PCE-ADJ). PCE-UNADJ is created in the following manner:


1. A CPI entry level item9 (ELI) to PCE series code10 concordance is created with input from the Bureau

     of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This is because the CPI uses a proprietary

     classification system that does not align perfectly with the PCE system: there are many goods and

     services that are classified in general categories in one system and in disaggregated categories in the

     other system. There are also goods and services that have different definitions between PCE and CPI

     and no clear match between their PCE and CPI classification codes. In the concordance, ELIs are

     assigned to the lowest-level matching PCE series code publicly available. Although this is sometimes

     a perfect match, sometimes multiple ELIs matched to one broad PCE code, and sometimes an ELI

     had to be split between multiple PCE codes in the concordance. Using this concordance, all ELIs are

     broken down into one of three categories: out of PCE scope, one PCE series code per ELI, and

     multiple PCE series codes per ELI. One example of an ELI that falls outside the scope of PCE is

     TF011:

                               AND DRIVER'S LICENSE


     CPI apparel demonstrates an example of the other two types of ELIs, ELIs that match to exactly one

PCE series code and ELIs that must be split between multiple PCE series codes:

  More information on ELIs can be found in BLS Handbook of Methods Chapter 17 (http://stats.bls.gov/opub/hom): “Within
each item stratum, one or more substrata, called entry-level items (ELIs), are defined. There are a total of 305 ELIs, which are the
ultimate sampling units for items as selected by the BLS national office. They represent the level of item definition from which
data collectors begin item sampling within each sample outlet.”

                                                                                        personal items



     The ELI AA021 maps into only one PCE series code, DMBCRC. AA022, however, maps mostly into

     DMBCRC but also maps in part to DLUGRC. This is because CPI includes wallets and umbrellas in

     apparel, whereas PCE includes those items in luggage.11


2. Allocation ratios are assigned to each ELI-PCE code combination so that all ratios for an ELI

     summed to one.12 All ELIs that matched perfectly to one PCE code, regardless of the number of ELIs

     per PCE code, receive a value of „1‟ as in the example above for ELI AA021. ELIs that are not

     included in the scope of PCE are given a value of „0‟, as shown above in the TF011 example.13 All

     other ELIs are divided into their component PCE series codes using underlying CE expenditure data

     at the observation level. For most ELIs, this means using data at the CE Diary survey level. For the

     few split ELIs that are only available in the interview portion of CE, an even split ratio is provided for

     all PCE codes that mapped to the ELI. This is the case in two education ELIs and one other goods and

     services ELI. In the apparel example above, a scan of all 2003-2008 AA022 Diary data shows that 7%

     of all AA022 expenditures were wallets and umbrellas, whereas 93% of AA022 consists of other

     accessories. Therefore, the AA022 allocation ratios are 0.93 for DMBCRC and 0.07 for DLUGRC.




11
   The ELI-to-PCE-series-code concordance can be viewed on the CPI website at http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpipceconcd.pdf.
12
   If the ELI did not completely map to PCE, i.e., part but not the ELI but not the entire ELI was out of PCE scope, then the ratios
for that ELI would sum to the percentage of ELI expenditures that were within scope for both CE and PCE. For example, the
ratios for EE031, “Other Information Services”, sum to approximately .98 because a small web services component of that ELI
does not map to PCE at all.
13
   In some cases, it may be possible to find expenditure data in the National Income and Product Accounts that corresponds to
these goods and services. However, this study makes no attempt to supplement PCE expenditure data with secondary source data
in such a manner to account for item categories included in the CPI but excluded from PCE. A similar procedure could be
implemented in a later version of this paper.

                                                                 9
3. The ratios are multiplied by CE expenditure data and then summed by PCE code assignment to create

    a set of total CPI expenditures by PCE code for each year in the period.


4. Using NIPA underlying table 2.4.5U. Personal Consumption Expenditures by Type of Product and

    the CPI expenditure data from Step #3, PCE/CPI factors are created for each PCE series code. For

    example, in a PCE category where PCE reported $200 of expenditures and CE reported $100 of

    expenditures, the PCE/CPI factor would be two.


5. The factor is applied to expenditure data and then applied to the CE micro-level data to recalibrate

    CPI aggregation weights to PCE values for the 2003-2008 period. For example, an ELI that matched

    one-to-one in definition with a PCE series code would have a recalibration factor of one. If PCE

    reported $200 in expenditures for that PCE code and CPI reported $100 in expenditures for that PCE

    code, then the factor would be two as in Step #4. Because of the perfect definition match, the PCE

    calibration for this ELI would simply apply a factor of two to the micro-level data.


6. The adjustments in Step #5 are made for each ELI at the reported CPI expense level. The resulting

    adjusted costs are then weighted and summed to the elementary CPI item-area category level,

    annualized for the 2003-2004, 2005-2006, and 2007-2008 expenditure reference periods, and

    converted into aggregation weights.

7. The new aggregation weights are used to create indexes for 2005-2010 using standard CPI-U

    methodology.

Because two market basket structure changes have taken place in the CPI over the past few years, the

aggregation weights are adjusted depending on the market basket structure used in that year. The final

result of this work is a set of annualized biennial expenditure weights by CPI item-area category that are

used to create PCE-UNADJ using CPI index aggregation methods. That is, the indexes presented here all

employ the same formula and biennial weight update process used in the CPI-U, whereas the PCE

indexes published by the BEA use quarterly weights and a Fisher Ideal index formula.


                                                    10
        An important difference between the CE and PCE weights is that the former are calculated and

implemented in the CPI at the item-area level. For example, the CPI employs “apple” category weights

for 38 geographic areas and matches them to 38 corresponding area-level basic price indexes. In contrast,

PCE weights and indexes exist only at the national level. This paper uses elementary item-area prices and

adjusted weights. Due to data availability, we assume that the PCE/CPI expenditure ratio is uniform

across US areas and create the calibration factors and PCE-ADJ adjustment factors at a national level to

apply them to the local 38-area CPI data.

        To create PCE-ADJ, the original recalibration factors are modified by secondary source data to

create a new set of factors that not only reflect differences in item definition, but also reflect differences

in expenditure definition. The CPI apparel example above is a difference in item definition: CPI wallets

and umbrellas are listed in clothing accessories, whereas PCE wallets and umbrellas are included in

luggage; the ratios for both PCE-UNADJ and PCE-ADJ are created so that the wallet and umbrella value

from CPI apparel is recalibrated by PCE luggage expenditures. An expenditure definition difference can

be seen in CPI education: CPI higher education tuition reflects only out-of-pocket payments, whereas

PCE higher education tuition reflects all payments – out-of-pocket and third party; the expenditure factor

must be adjusted by a constant that represents the average US out-of pocket spending on college tuition as

a percentage of total US spending on college tuition. After this proportion adjustment is made, the process

aligns perfectly with the process used to create PCE-UNADJ in Steps #4-7 above.

        In this project, a variety of adjustments are made to differentiate PCE-ADJ from PCE-UNADJ, or

to adjust PCE categories with different expenditure definitions to fit CPI expenditure definitions. In many

cases, this adjustment removes third party payments from PCE expenditure data. Table 3 below contains

the adjustments and affected ELIs.

        For PCE-ADJ, student tuition and board expenditures from PCE-UNADJ are adjusted to exclude

third party payments such as grants using National Center for Education Statistics data on total and out-

of-pocket costs of college for American students.14 Medical expenditures that typically include some

insurance payment component are adjusted to exclude third-party payments made by employers,

government, and others using data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality‟s Medical

Expenditure Panel Survey (2008).15 Utilities, rent, homeowners‟ insurance, financial services fees, vehicle

insurance, and vehicle maintenance and repair are adjusted using the CE-PCE ratios in Garner, Janini,

Passero, Paszkiewicz, and Vendemia (2006) to fit PCE levels.

            The homeowners‟ insurance ratio of 8 is an approximation from the text of the paper rather than

an official ratio, and it is used because homeowners‟ insurance is included in a large-scope ratio of “other

household operations” that has a value closer to 1.03. The ratios from Garner, Janini, Passero,

Paszkiewicz, and Vendemia (2006) are not ideal for such an index because they include other factors

beyond expenditure difference such as item under- or over-reporting.19 However, in these cases, quality

national data that separated item costs by the expenditure type needed are unavailable.

4.1 Item Representation

            In the 2007-2008 annualized weights (which correspond to the 2010 index values), the mean item

stratum PCE-UNADJ-to-CPI-U expenditure ratio is 1.65 – this is a simplified approximation of the ratio

that was applied to CE data in Step #3 to create weights for PCE-UNADJ and PCE-ADJ. The mean item

stratum PCE-ADJ-to-CPI-U expenditure ratio for the same time period is 1.51. It aligns well with the

final expenditure totals: at $9.3 trillion, the 2010 final weighted PCE-UNADJ expenditure total was

slightly less than twice the CPI-U expenditure total of approximately $5.1 trillion. In contrast, the 2010

final weighted PCE-ADJ expenditure total of $7.5 trillion was 1.46 times the CPI-U total – these

expenditure totals correspond with the 2007-2008 annualized weights.

  The goal of this paper is to produce broad-level PCE/CE ratios to shed a critical light on how the two have changed over the
years. These ratios may differ from one for a variety of reasons other than differences in the way category consumer expenditures
are measured.

                                                               13
         Tables 4 and 5 show more detail for the items with the highest and lowest CPI-U/PCE-ADJ ratios

– this is the inverse of the PCE-ADJ-to-CPI-U ratio discussed previously. These cases in which the

adjusted PCE expenditure value differs most from the CPI value can be indicative of item representation

issues or of areas where the PCE-ADJ secondary source adjustments could be more finely tuned. “Child

Care and Nursery School”, as seen leading Table 4, is an excellent example of this. Babysitting, a person-

to-person component of child care, frequently involves payments between individuals and is therefore

more likely to be represented in the CPI. For the purposes of this paper, child care in one‟s home has been

removed from the ratio allocations to account for this definition difference, because that is the lowest

accurate level at which the “Child Care and Nursery School” data can be disaggregated to remove

babysitting. However, not all in-home child care is considered to be babysitting, which may be the cause

behind the high ratio seen below.

         Table 5 lists item strata with the lowest CPI-U/PCE-ADJ expenditure ratio– this is equivalent to

the highest PCE-ADJ/CPI-U expenditure ratio. Item strata that consistently have much higher PCE-ADJ

expenditure levels than CPI-U expenditure levels include “Floor Coverings”, “Other Video Equipment”,

and “Technical and business school tuition and fees”. In Table 4, there are multiple notable medical item

strata, which is indicative of the possibility that the broadly applied medical expenditure adjustment used

in PCE-ADJ may not be a perfect fit for all medical expense categories.

         Figures 1 and 2 show scatterplots of the CPI-U and PCE-ADJ expenditure values for each item

stratum, with rent and a few other large expenditures such as tuition and vehicles excluded in Figure 2 so

                                                      14
that all other item trends may be more easily examined. From these scatterplots, it is easy to see that the

expenditure levels used to calculate the PCE-ADJ and CPI-U are similar, because their ratio lies along the

45-degree line. In other words, after secondary source adjustment to CPI definitions, these items have

roughly the same absolute expenditure value in both CE and PCE.




        In both figures, a 1:1 ratio line illustrates item stratum expenditure level trends; items below the

line have a higher PCE-ADJ expenditure level than CPI-U expenditure level, while items above the line

have a higher CPI-U expenditure level than PCE-ADJ expenditure level. A majority of the 211 item strata


                                                    15
fall below the line, which indicates, as expected due to the PCE weight adjustments, that overall

expenditure levels for most items are higher in the PCE-calibrated CPI-U than in the published CPI-U.




        Table 6 shows item category relative importances for the three indexes using December 2005

weights. As expected, there are large differences in medical relative importances between PCE-UNADJ

and PCE-ADJ and small differences in these relative importances between the CPI and PCE-ADJ. Shelter

relative importances are very different between both PCE indexes and the CPI-U not because of dramatic

differences between the two data sources in housing expenditure levels, but rather because of total

expenditure differences in other categories (such as medical care). In other words, although the budget

share of housing is smaller using PCE data than CE data, both PCE and CE agree on how much is spent


                                                   16
total on shelter – the share itself changes because other goods and services increase their proportions of

total spending in the PCE indexes.

        It is also important to note that some items show larger differences between the CPI-U and PCE-

ADJ, which could be indicative of an item representation issue in CE. Four categories that are commonly

cited as being underrepresented in CE due to respondent behavior are apparel, other goods, tobacco, and

alcohol. The evidence from this study supports the expectation that those four categories might have

lower CE representation than PCE representation. Tobacco and alcohol, which are believed to be

underreported because of their sensitive nature, also have a significantly smaller relative importance in

the CPI-U than in PCE-ADJ index. Apparel and other goods may be underreported in CE because of

proxy reporting: if only one member reports expenditures for the entire household, they may be more

aware of family food, housing, and education purchases than of the clothing and other personal goods




                                                   17
purchases made by all household members.20 Both of those categories also have significantly higher

relative importance values in both PCE-calibrated indexes than they do in the CPI-U.

         PCE-UNADJ relative importances are slightly different. Because medical care is measured so

differently between the two sources (CE and PCE) and therefore carries a large adjustment in this study,

medical care makes up almost a quarter of PCE-UNADJ, but makes up only five percent of the CPI-U

and PCE-ADJ. In accordance with the other adjustments made to create PCE-ADJ, the PCE-UNADJ

transportation and housing categories have lower relative importances than the corresponding CPI-U and

PCE-ADJ categories, while PCE-UNADJ education is a bit higher. Slight variations exist in some of the

other item categories such as recreation and other goods. This merits further investigation; it is possible

that there could be a significant difference in item representation in one of those categories as well.


4.2 Index Levels and Change

         When the PCE-calibrated indexes and the CPI-U are compared between 2005 and 2010, it is clear

how closely the published CPI-U and PCE-ADJ track each other. As shown in Figure 1 above, the CPI-U

tends to be slightly higher than PCE-ADJ. However, overall the PCE-ADJ 5-year annualized growth rate

is 0.071% lower than the CPI-U 5-year annualized growth rate. In contrast, the PCE-UNADJ 5-year

annualized growth rate is 0.338% higher than the CPI-U 5-year annualized growth rate.

         Lebow and Rudd (2003), constructing an index similar to PCE-ADJ, concluded that the CPI has

an upward bias of approximately 0.1 percent per year due to inaccurate weights. Their conclusion was

based on comparison of indexes using CE and PCE weights over the 1987-2001 period, with those

weights computed at the 24-item level. This paper, using a later time period and a more detailed weight

and index decomposition, shows a difference of 0.071 percent, which is of the same magnitude as Lebow

and Rudd‟s results but slightly lower.

         Figure 3 demonstrates the shape and direction of the indexes. As previously noted, both indexes

containing the CPI definitions (CPI-U and PCE-ADJ) exhibit similar rates of change and rise more slowly

20
  Garner, Thesia I., George Janini, William Passero, Laura Paszkiewicz, and Mark Vendemia provide an in-depth discussion of
underreporting in the context of PCE/CE ratios in their 2006 paper.

                                                            18
than the index that uses PCE expenditure valuation (PCE-UNADJ). The fact that the CPI-U and PCE-

ADJ indexes exhibit similar rates of change is logical because their expenditure definitions match in two

large categories: medical expenses and education.




        Figure 3 also shows that the PCE-UNADJ index has risen more quickly than the CPI-U and PCE-

ADJ indexes. The PCE-UNADJ index series diverges from the CPI-U and PCE-ADJ index series after

October 2008 due to the larger weight given to medical care and education items. From October 2008 to

the end of the study period, the All-Items CPI-U index increased 1.20%, while the medical care and

education CPI-U indexes increased 7.16% and 8.93% respectively. Combined, these categories contribute

to a larger rate of inflation for the PCE-UNADJ series compared to the CPI-U and PCE-ADJ series.

        Most items in the CPI-U and PCE-ADJ indexes have similar relative importances between the

two indexes, with one notable exception. Shelter, the category that has a relative importance almost 10

percentage points higher in the CPI-U than in the PCE-ADJ, might be expected to be the reason that the


                                                    19
PCE-ADJ diverges from the CPI-U for most of the time between 2005 and 2010.21 The shelter CPI-U

index increased 0.46% from October 2008 through December 2010 – a price change lower than the All-

Items index change. Between October 2008 and December 2010, the average monthly shelter-only CPI-U

index change differed from the average monthly CPI-U index change for all items by a mere 0.010%. A

look at 1998-2010 CPI-U data reveals that the two average monthly CPI-U index change values differed

by only 0.015% (with the All-Items index increasing slightly more rapidly than the shelter-only index)

between the two indexes. Despite the difference in weights, shelter price change is more similar to the rest

of the CPI than education and medical services, and so it has a lower impact on the experimental index

results than the latter two items.




           Figure 4 shows the 12-month index change values for each of the three indexes. While 2006-2010

average 12-month index change for the CPI-U is approximately 2.013%, that value is 0.003% lower for


21   Section 4.1 includes a discussion of why shelter relative importances differ between PCE-ADJ and CPI-U.

PCE-ADJ and 0.441% higher for the PCE-UNADJ index. However, the difference between CPI-U and

PCE-ADJ 12-month index change ranges from 0.371 to -0.373 over the 2006-2010 period.



4.3 Caveats

        As mentioned above, there are a variety of ways in which it is nearly impossible to create a

perfect PCE-calibrated CPI due to differences in the nature of the data. Although secondary source data

make the ratio estimates for education and medical expenses more useful, they are applied broadly in the

creation of PCE-ADJ rather than disaggregated down to the item level. It is unlikely that the ratio of

medical expenditures paid out-of-pocket by consumers will be identical for the purchase medical

specialist services and prescription drugs or primary care doctor visits. It is also possible that the

proportions of education expenditures for public and private universities are different between the CPI

and the NCES survey from which the tuition ratio is derived. There may ratios other than those created by

Garner, Janini, Passero, Paszkiewicz, and Vendemia (2006) in which the non-consumer portion of the

ratio can be removed in aggregation, although they are difficult to find in secondary sources.

        In addition, the populations covered by the aggregate CPI-U and PCE data are very different.

CPI-U data cover urban, non-military, non-institutional households, whereas PCE data cover domestic

consumers including third parties that make purchases on behalf of consumers. PCE does not include

domestic consumers who have been and will be in the country for less than one year.

        Across all time periods, the total expenditure values for items HA01 and HC01 – the two major

CPI shelter categories – are nearly identical for the CPI-U and its PCE-calibrated counterparts. As shown

in Figure 1 above, Owners‟ Equivalent Rent falls extremely close to the CPI-U/PCE-ADJ=1 line in 2005.

However, the relative importance of housing in the CPI-U is higher than the relative importance of

housing in both PCE-UNADJ and PCE-ADJ because CE expenditure levels in housing more closely

match PCE expenditure levels than expenditure levels in other item categories do; in many item

categories outside of housing, CE expenditure levels are lower than PCE expenditure levels.



                                                    21
        Other small discrepancies may arise in specifics of the concordance and in the scope of the two

consumption datasets; PCE and CPI both contain items that are out-of-scope in the other consumption

data. To produce the two indexes above, four ELIs from the three market basket structures used had to be

removed altogether because they are considered out-of-scope in PCE and therefore have no expenditure

value. Vehicle registration and license fees are seen as coercive and not included in PCE, while gardening

and lawn services and inside home maintenance and repair are not included in PCE because they are

considered intermediate expenditures of homeowners. Some additional portions of CPI items, such as

hunting and fishing licenses, are excluded from PCE. In such cases, the portion of the ELI that is not used

in PCE was removed, causing these ELI proportions to sum to less than one. There is also the potential

for item definition differences that were not addressed in the concordance used for this study. This is

because CE uses survey data, and item definition interpretations can vary from respondent to respondent.

For example, PCE disaggregates the CPI “souvenirs” UCC out to categories that describe the individual

components. Guidebooks and programs are included in books, postcards are included in stationery, and t-

shirts are a part of apparel. However, determining this disaggregation in the CPI can be nearly impossible

because some respondents simply write “$20 souvenirs” rather than “$15 t-shirt, $5 postcards” in the

diary portion of the survey.

        Finally, an unsolved methodological debate arose during this project that involves the way in

which PCE-CPI expenditure ratios were calculated for ELIs that had to be split between PCE codes. Data

are PCE-calibrated by fitting CPI expenditures into PCE series categories, but the data must then be

mapped back into CPI items (one level above ELIs) to construct expenditure weights as CE data are in

CPI production. For the purposes of this paper, data are mapped into the item categories corresponding to

the ELIs from which their CPI expenditures originally came. However, a future improvement to this

methodology would be to identify the CPI items that best match where the PCE expenditures map so that

CPI price quotes are functionally “moved” into the categories that best fit the PCE calibration rather than

staying in their original item categories.



                                                    22
                                                      5. Future Research

            PCE and CE data have been compared for years at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and in the

broader federal community.22 There is still much work to do, however. If anything, this paper illustrates

the need for further analysis in this area. The PCE-calibrated price indexes constructed here explore only

a few of the many possibilities that exist in bringing current CPI data closer to the data used in PCE.

Although some of these possibilities seem infeasible currently, there is always the hope that more light

will be shed on them in future efforts.

            One area in which methodological improvements could be made is in population matching. CE

and CPI populations differ from the PCE population, which is a problem rooted in the way the data are

collected. PCE data come primarily from the production side as part of the National Income and Product

Accounts and are typically the result of equations that remove all non-consumer use allocations from the

total purchase value of a good or service to create a personal consumption value. CE (and therefore CPI)

data are collected directly from the consumer, a practice that allows for more population limiting

specificity. These data are limited to non-military, non-institutionalized households and, in the case of the

CPI-U, can be further limited to exclude consumption by rural households. Finding a method by which to

more closely match the CPI population to the PCE population would allow for more accurate use of PCE

weights in an alternate CPI.

            Further study into the historical differences between the CPI-U and an index similar to PCE-ADJ

would also be very useful. Being able to see ten or more years of comparative data instead of five would

help researchers better understand the differences and how they have changed with time and item

structure updates in both the CPI and PCE. CPI has undergone two item structure changes in the past few

years, and PCE has moved from one benchmark year period to the next. These changes could potentially

have a large effect on the data but also help us more easily identify bias and data inaccuracies as they

change from structure to structure or period to period.



22
     See Lebow and Rudd (2003) or Fixler and Jaditz (2002) for examples of this.

                                                                23
        A larger-scale update to the methodology used in this paper lies in the items themselves.

Although this concording exercise focuses on the weight side of the Consumer Price Index, it would be

beneficial to create a hybrid CPI that matches PCE definitions for both weighting and pricing. Similarly, a

set of hybrid indexes created using concorded UCCs rather than concorded ELIs could create a more

accurate comparison by fine-tuning the good- and service-level comparisons. UCC structure can also

change, and the methodology used here only focused on item and ELI structure changes when

determining allocation ratios.

        Finally, there are a few ways in which data from the Consumer Price Index can be used to create

a more accurate representation of a PCE-calibrated index. An index could be constructed by modifying

the level of aggregation in the CPI. A CPI aggregated to the major group (apparel, education and

communication, food, other goods, housing, medical, recreation, transportation) level would remove

many definitional discrepancies between PCE and CPI, allowing us to focus on the largest differences.

Going in the opposite direction, more detailed concording research could be done to break data down for

classification at the individual observation level, causing each data point in the CPI or PCE data to be

intentionally mapped to its correct ELI or PCE series code. This would mean the creation of a “true”

PCE-UNADJ or PCE-ADJ but would also involve mapping both NIPA and CPI data to underlying

categories.



                                              6. Conclusion

        This paper contrasts current BLS Consumer Price Index values with the values derived from

PCE-calibrated Consumer Price Indexes adjusted to PCE and CPI good and service definitions.

Ultimately, the results indicate that adjusting PCE weights to CPI expenditure definitions yields an index

(PCE-ADJ) that closely tracks the CPI-U. However, there are also strong differences between the two

indexes, particularly once results are disaggregated to the item level. We see differences in item relative

importance in the apparel, alcohol, and tobacco categories that may be indicative of an item



                                                    24
representativeness issue in those categories in the CE survey. Overall, the PCE-UNADJ annualized

growth rate over five years is 0.338% higher than that of the CPI-U, while the PCE-ADJ annualized

growth rate over five years is 0.071% lower than that of the CPI-U.

        As shown above, there is still a lot of ground to cover in order for this work to accurately

represent the two indexes. Some aspects may be more difficult to correct in future work, such as

adjustments for population and scope differences between PCE and CPI, while others may provide an

excellent opportunity for further research, such as more detailed item concording using further

disaggregated data from both the BLS and the BEA. The closer these indexes come to accurately

representing the real CPI and a real PCE-valued CPI, the more useful they are in examining the

representativeness of CE survey data. Finding that PCE and CE have similar item-level outcomes may be

useful in future survey design to reduce respondent burden or allow for detailed data quality checks.

Large differences would indicate that it may be time to reexamine the motivations and methodology in the

two consumer expenditure datasets. Although, when using this index data, we cannot show whether

match issues are due to CE bias or PCE methods, the above results and future work will help us to better

determine how to continue refining our data collection and aggregation methods.
