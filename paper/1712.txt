     This   paper derives the dependency of optimal tariff and inflation tax on

tax collection and enforcement costs. The analysis is done for a small, open

economy. The existence of such costs can Justify tariff and inflation tax

policies as optimal revenue-raising devices. This paper suggests that greater

government demand for revenue will increase the use of inflation and tariffs as

revenue devices. The analysis derives elasticity rules that tie optimal tariff

and inflation rates to the costs of tax collection.

                    Inflation, Tariffs and Tax Enforcement Costs



                                        by

                                  Joshua Aizenman



     Public finance literature has frequently concluded that efficiency

considerations do not justify the use of tariffs as a means of raising revenue

in a small open economy. Instead, one should apply consumption taxes [see

Corden (19814) and the references listed there]. Similar results were shown

for optimal inflation tax: if one views money as input in the delivery of

consumption goods, one should not use inflation tax as revenue device (see

1-Jercowitz and Sadka (19814) and Kimbrough (1985)).1 However, we can not escape

the observation that small economies, frequently LDC, use both tariffs and

inflation   tax as revenue devices. Crude empiricism suggests that   less
efficient tax collection and tax enforcement authorities, as well as larger

government revenue needs, tend to increase the applicability of inflation tax

and tariffs as revenue devices (on the use of inflation tax, see Fischer

(1982)).

     The gap between traditional public finance literature and the empirical

regularities is a result of the tendency of the literature to overlook the role

of costs of tax collection and enforcement. The purpose of this paper is to

derive the dependence of optimal policies on collection costs. Once we

recognize that various taxes are associated with different collection costs, we

can reconcile the empirical observations regarding the use of inflation and

tariffs with cost—benefit principles. Inflation tax and tariffs have

relatively low collection costs because inflation tax is an implicit tax and

tariffs are collected at a centralized place——the port of entry of imports.
                                         2




Optimality is achieved by equating across feasible taxes the sum of the

marginal deadweight loss and the marginal collection costs associated with

extra revenue. Consequently, one will expect that if the coLLection costs

associated with consumption taxes are significant, inflation tax and tariffs

will also be used as revenue sources.

     Section I starts with a simple Cobb-Douglas example, demonstrating the

above result by deriving the reduced form solution for optimal tariff as a

function of government size and cost of tax collection. The analysis then

solves for the optimal tariff for a general utility. Section II studies the

role of costs of tax collection in determining optimal inflation. This is done

for the case of an economy where money serves as an "input" in the delivery of

consumption. To simplify presentation, Section II neglects the role of

tariffs, which can be added easily. The analysis solves the implied elasticity

rule that ties optimal interest rate to costs of' tax collection. Section III

contains concluding remarks.


I. Costs of Tax Collection and Optimal Tariff

     It is instructive to start the analysis with a simple Cobb—Douglas

example, from which we can derive the reduced form of the optimal tax

structure. Suppose that a representative consumer has the following utility:



                    log X + 8 log Y +   y log   C;   c +   8   z   1          (1)




Y is the imported good and X is the domestic good where G is the public good

supplied by the government. The consumer is endowed with X units. The

government can raise taxes via two channels: a tariff at a rate T       and

consumption tax at a rate 0 .   Denoting by q the external terms of trade,
the consumer budget constraint is given by
                                                     3




                                    X       [X + q(l +             ÷   0]                       (2)




        Because there are no assets in this simple economy, consumption tax 0 is

equivalent to an endowment tax 0, ,                defined by 0         e/(1 + 0), where the

equivalent budget constraint is now



                                     X(1 -    0)    X + q(1 + T)Y.                             (2')




        Optimization of utility (1) subject to the budget constraint reveals that

consumption of X and Y is given by:



                                             X     a(i — 0)X                               (3a)



                                                         —   o)X
                                                                                           (3b)
                                                   q(1 + T)



        We introduce costs of tax collection by assuming that there are real costs

associated with the collection of revenue via consumption (or endowment) tax

and that tariff revenue can be raised costlessly. As a result net government

revenue       is


                                        G     Xo(1 -     ) + tqY                               (14)




where    4,    denotes   the cost   of collecting consumption taxes, defined in

percentage term. The problemof the government is to choose taxes so as to

maximize the indirect utility of' a representative consumer subject to the

budget constraint 14
                                                     14




         Applying equations 3a - 3b to equation 1 we find that the utility of a

 representative consumer is given by



                    U(t,0)       C + log(1 — 0) — Blog(1 + T) + y log G                                         (5)



 where C is a constant.

        Using equation 3b, 14 we can denote the government budget by



                                g    0(1 —       +                  8(1 —   0)                                (141)
                                                          1




where g is the government expenditure, normalized by the endowment

 (g =   G/X).   Combining 5, 14' we see that the problem facing the government is

to choose 0, -r     to maximize



            log(1 — 0) —                                                    +

      Several observations are in order. In the absence of collection costs

(4,   0) only consumption tax is used, at a rate that reflects the priority

given to government activity (0              1
                                                          r       0).        Next, positive collection

costs justify the use of tariff as a revenue device. The information conveyed

by equations 6 - 7 is summarized in Figure 1.                      In that figure the negatively

sloped AB schedule characterizes the relation between the optimal values of

Ct, 9). For a given        (ci, ,   y) the       position of the equilibrium along the

negatively sloped schedule depends on the cost of tax collection, •. For

example, in the absence of collection costs (4,                         0)   we are at point A.    P.



positive collection cost is associated with an internal solution at point C.

A higher 4,   shifts   C towards point B, being associated with a higher tariff, a

lower endowment taxes and a drop in government consumption. For                             >


we reach point B, where only a tariff is applied . A higher priority given to

government activity (dy > 0) shifts the frontier to P'B', and the corres-

ponding internal equlibrium to point C'. Thus, a higher priority given to

government activity raises the corresponding consumption tax, without altering

the optimal tariff rate. The final result reflects the assumption of a

constant marginal cost of tax collection. It can be verified that with an

increasing marginal cost of tax collection (- >                         0),    higher priority on

government activity will raise both taxes2                    (    >    0,       > 0).   Direct

inspection of 6, 7 reveals that the presence of collection costs (4,                            > 0)

      Let us procede now to the case of a general utility, focusing on the

 determination of optimal tariff in the presence of costs of tax collection.

Let the utility of a typical consumer be:



                                                U(X, Y)                                                         (9)




      To simplify the exposition , we take g to be given exogonously at its

optimal target. The consumer sets X, Y as to maximize equation 9                                    subject   to

its budget constraint; equation (2'). The first order conditions are given by



                                                U x                                                           (10)



                                                 x q(l + -r)                                                  (11)

where A is the associated Lagrange multiplier.

     Let us assess the welfare change ()                              resultant          from a change in tax

Using the first order conditions

                                       +                          + q(1      +    t)Y .                       (12)

Because the consumer is moving on his budget constraint, we learn from 2' that



                                + q(1 + -r)AY z                  —x    o —       qYA-r                        (13)




Thus, by combining equations 12 and 13

                                X AGO


The government change (0, r) keeping its revenue the same (aG=O), so

equation U implies:



                            — X A0 — qThr z — X(0D) +                rqY   (114)




Combining 12', 1)4 we get



                                            —        i (o) + rqY           (15)
                              X GO

     The change in tax policy acts upon welfare in two ways: First, it changes

the resources devoted to tax collection, which are reflected by the first term

of equation 15; next, it affects the distorted activity (consumption of Y).

The marginal welfare gain resulting from this change is the distortion (-rq)

times the change in the distorted activity (Y), as reflected in the second

term of equation 15. To gain further insight into the optimal tariff

determination, note that for a constant marginal cost of tax collection, 1)4

indicates that

    Applying 16 to 12', one gets

 Optimal tariff is set such that the right hand side of 17 is zero, thus:

                                                                              (20)



Consequently, positive collection costs can justify the active use of tariff' in

a small, open economy. This result provides a formal verification of the

argwnent in Corden (19824), which suggests that relatively low collection costs

for trade taxes are the essential requirement for trade taxes to be optimal

revenue-raising devices in the small economy model.


II. Costs of Tax Collection and Inflation Tax

      In this section we derive the dependence of inflation tax on tax

collection costs. For simplicity of exposition, we focus on the case of' a one

good open economy, fully integrated with the international capital market. The

analysis can be readily extended to allow for optimal tariff as well as other

taxes. Consider a two period endowment model, where the consumer preferences

are described by:



                             U                                                (21)

where Lt stands for leisure in period t, and                for the consumption in

period t, t      0,1. The presumption made in this paper is that money provides

services by reducing the cost of exchanging goods. The use of real balances

promotes more efficient exchange and in so doing saves costly resources. These

resources might include time and capital which would be used to co-ordinate

various transactions3. To simplify exposition, the paper studies the case in

which the exchange activity is time intensive. A possible way of capturing

this notion is by assuming that leisure is a decreasing function of the

velocity of circulation. I.e, a drop in the velocity of circulation is

associated with a higher intensity of money per transaction, allowing one to

save on the use of time in facilitating transactions, thereby increasing

leisure.4 Thus:

                                    LL(v);L<0                                          (22)




where v              'Mt
                                being the price of good X in period t5.

        An intertemporal model is chosen to generate a meaningful opportunity cost

of holding money. For simplicity of exposition, we take the case of only two

periods. Our model can be readily extended for a general periods model,

without altering the main results. We consider the case of a floating exchange

rate system, in which there exists a traded bond, B              ,   paying real interest
rate r*, where *     stands for foreign values. An endowment tax at a rate 0

is applied in both periods. The budget constraint in period zero is given by:



                           P0X0 +    + P0B       P0(1 - o)Xo +       o                 (23)



where        denotes the initial supply of money balances,               the endowment of

good X, and 0 corresponds to the endowment tax.

      To simplify exposition, we assume zero initial holdings of traded bonds.

 In the next period our consumer is facing a budget constraint given by:



                    F1x1 + H1               M0 + P1(1 +        r*)B         +               —              (214)

     Our consumer finances consumption and the use of money balances from his

initial endowment. This endowment includes money balances carried over from

period zero, endowment of good X, and the income paid on the traded bond. We

denote by i the nominal interest rate defined by the traded bond: one

monetary unit purchases j1— bonds in period 0, which pay
P                         0
    (1 + r*) in monetary terms in period 1. Thus:

     Let us denote real balances in period t (Mt/Pt) by mt, and by Z the

discounted value of (Z0, Z1):

As in Section I, we assume that endowment taxes are associated with collection

costs       .    To simplify, we take       to be constant at the margin. The private

budget constraint is given by equation (27), which takes government policies as

given. Private agents maximize their utility subject to this constraint. For

the resultant optimal behavior of the private sector, 28 implies the

corresponding government revenue. Because our system is homogeneous, the real

equilibrium will not be affected by an anticipated equi-proportiorial rise in

                To fix ideas, consider the case in which the value of M0 is given

(H0 = M0)       and the government sets M1. In such a case money balances will

increase by H1 — H0        in period 1 as a result of the issue of new money to

finance part of government's purchases of goods and services. Let us denote by

p   the   rate of monetary expansion (p = (M1 - M0)/M0).                      Combining 28a, 28b we

obtain as the net present value of government revenue ( in terms of X0)

                              —      m1                               m0i     —

     Combining 27, 29 we get



                                    X(1 —   o)      = G   +   X                                (30)

equation 30 is the fundamental budget constraint. Net present value of private

plus public consumption equals the net present value of the endowment, adjusted

by the resources spent on tax collection. For a given, known government

policy, private agents maximize utility U subject to equation 27, resulting

in the following first order conditions:

The policy applied by the government has the effect of changing p ,                                without

induced due to higher anticipated inflation which would, in tern, tend to

     The resultant welfare change is composed of two terms. The first

corresponds to the marginal change in resources spent on tax collection, the

second referes to the marginal change in the distorted activity, weighted by

the distortion             .    Given the government budget constraint 29 we can

also determine that AG         0 and m0               rn0 implies:

positive interest rates. For example, if the elasticity of money with respect

to the net interest rate (n') is 0.25, values of 4 given by (.014, .07,

.17, .25) correspond to optimal values of i equal to (.05, .1, .5, 1).

141, less elastic demand raises optimal i, in accordance with the Ramsey's type

results.


                               Concluding Remarks

     This paper has derived the functional dependecy between costs of tax

collection, optimal tariff and inflation tax. It was shown that positive

collection costs can justify the application of both policies as revenue

devices. This, in turn, implies that in case of higher revenue needs or less

effective tax collection, inflation taxes and tariffs will be used more

frequently. This also implies that liberalization and stabilization attempts

should be approached in the broader context of government capacity to replace

inflation and tariff with alternative source of funds, or government capacity

to cut public sector activities.8 Finally, our results were conditional on

the assumption that enforcement costs of tariffs and inflation tax are small

relative to alternative taxes. This might not hold in a country that tended

to "abuse" the above policies, through smuggling activities (in the case of a

tariff) or currency substitution (in the case of inflation).

      1The optimum quantity of money rule literature goes back to Friedman

 (1969). Similar results in a general equilibrium framework have been obtained

by Jovanovic (1982). For related analyses of inflation in a public finance

context see, for example, Phelps (1973), Frenkel (1976), Siegel (1978) and

Helpman and Sadka (1979).

                 is a function of the tax rate (     (o)) , one         get that

                      where 6 stands for d log 4/d log e.

      3For such a model, see Dornbusch and Frenkel(1973).

      1Such a formulation can be found in Aizenman (1985), which derives the

compiementarity of commercial policy, capital controls and inflation tax for

the case where those are the only available taxing devices.

      5We assume that only domestic money is used on co—ordinating domestic

transactions. The underlying structure of the economy described here is that

of a centralized market only in the case of financial transactions (bonds).

There is no centralized exchange of goods among domestic consumers. The

asymmetry between financial transactions and the domestic exchange 'f goods

among consumers is reflected in the specification of the velocity of money,

which is defined only for transactions that involve consumption.

     6Notice that because the analysis is conducted in two periods there is no

future in period 1. It can be shown that in a model with n periods,
                                                       A
