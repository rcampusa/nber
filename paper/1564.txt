                                   ABSTRACT




     In this paper we employ index number theory in addressing the problem of

adjusting real national income and real domestic product for changes in a

country's terms of trade. More specifically, using recent developments in the

theory of production, we address the problems related to measuring: Ci)   real
output produced and real input utilized by the private business sector;

(ii) productivity growth or technical change; (iii) the effects on domestic real

output of changes in the terms of trade; and (iv) the impact on final sales to

domestic purchasers of changes in the balance of payments deficit, in a

consistent accounting framework.

     This treatment of international trade allows us to undertake comparative

statics analyses using only production theory, whereas in the traditional

paradigm which treats traded goods as perfectly substitutable with a class of

domestic goods, a general equilibrium framework is required. We illustrate our

suggested solutions using U.S. data for the years 1968—82.

1. Introduction

          For many years, natinal income accountants have attempted to

measure the effects of terms of trade changes on national welfare. More

recently, the terms of trade1 adjustment issue has been approached from the

viewpoint of economic theory- and welfare economics by Svenson and Eazin

[19831, Lloyd and Schweinberger 119831, Greenlees and Zieschang t1981], and

Hamada and Iwata [198111. These authors treat the terms of trade adjustment

issue by considering the effects on a single consumer or by using a community

utility function. Both of these approaches involve difficult problems of

aggregation over consumers.

          Our alternative approach to the measurement of the impact of terms of

trade changes is to consider the problem from the point of view of the producer.

In this alternative approach, our objective function becomes real output

rather than welfare. We assume that exports and imports flow through the

production sector and we show that an increase in the price of exports rela-

tive to imports has an effect that is similar to an increase in total factor

productivity.

          More specifically, using recent developments in the theory- of

production,2 we address the problems related to measuring: Ci) real output

produced and real input utilized by the private business sector; (ii) produc—
                                          —2—


tivity growth   or   technical change; (iii) the effects on domestic real output

of changes in the terms of trade; and (iv) the impact on final sales to

domestic purchasers of changes in the balance of payments deficit in a con-

sistent accounting framework. We illustrate our suggested solutions using

U.S. data for the years 1968—82.

            Our solution to the problem of measuring real output, real input,

productivity,    and "welfare" (the combined effect of   technical change and

changes    in the terms of trade) turns out to be numerically very close to the
"Divisia" measurement techniques pioneered by Jorgenson and Griliches t1967,
19721   and Christensen and Jorgenson t19701. Our translog approach however
allows    us to give very precise interpretations of our   indexes, including a
decomposition of the indexes into individual comparative static effects ——        the

impact on the overall index of the change in a set of exogenous variables such

as   the prices of imports   or the prices of exports.

            Theoretical   development   and empirical implementation of these indexes

requires recognition of three distinct classes of (net) outputs, and their

corresponding prices, produced by the private business sector: (i) sales to

domestic purchasers (consumption goods, investment goods, and sales to the

government sector); (ii) sales to foreign purchasers (commodity or merchandise

exports); and (iii) purchases of foreign inputs (commodity or merchandise

imports). We view foreign commodity trade as passing through the private pro-

duction sector: all commodity exports are produced by the production sector and

all commodity imports enter the private production ;ector and are combined with

transportation, wholesaling, retailing and other inputs before being sold to

domestic purchasers.
                                     —3—


          This treatment of trade, following that of Burgess [19714], and Kohli

[1978], allows us to answer hypothetical questions about internationally traded

goods using only production theory, whereas in the traditional paradigm which

treats traded goods as perfectly substitutable with a class of domestic goods, a

general equilibrium framework is required. Consider a hypothetical increase in

the relative price of an exported good between periods t—l and t. If other fac-

tors remain constant, the econonny can divert resources from export production

toward domestic goods production and still maintain the previous balance of

trade deficit or surplus. Thus the effect of an increase in export price is

similar to an increase in total factor productivity; "welfare" increases here in

response to changes in trade flows rather than technical change, in the sense

that there is an increase in output producible with a given vector of inputs

because of an exogenous change. In reverse, if the price of an imported good

increases and domestic inputs remain constant, then in order to maintain a

balance of trade equilibrium the economr will have to devote more resources to

producing exports or cut back on imports. In either case domestic production

will have to decrease.

          The extensive literature on the problems of adjusting real national

income and real domestic product for changes in a country's terms of trade3 does

not provide any persuasive solutions to the problem of measuring these impacts.

Our procedures, however, allow us to determine the size of the required decrease

(or increase in the export price case mentioned) using index number theory

analogous to the usual productivity measurement framework. Although this
approach deals only with the private production sector of the economy, this

restricted focus allows us to develop index number formulae which are firmly

based on production theory and thus which possess well—defined optimality

properties .

          The paper proceeds as follows. In section 2 we outline the translog

approach to productivity indexes. Our end result is the same as that obtained

by Diewert [1980; 1493, but we now have a more satisfactory precise

interpretation   of   the productivity index. In section 3 we defIne translog

real product and real input indexes. Section 14 shows how the translog input,

output and productivity indexes may be decomposed into products of individual

translog price and quantity effects. These price and quantity effects provide

valuable comparative statics type information about the economy's product

function. In section 5 we outline the translog production function approach to

modeling the effects of changes in the prices of exports and imports and

define "welfare" indexes capturing the impacts of both technical change and

changes in the terms of trade. In section 6, we switch our focus from the

economy's private domestic product (which includes exports minus imports) to

the private production sector's sales to domestic purchasers (which excludes

exports minus imports). We rework our translog approach, replacing the

product function by the sales function. This allows consideration of the

deficit effect, which measures the impact on output produced for domestic

purchasers of changes in the economy's balance of trade deficit. In section

7, we outline an alternative nonparameteric approach to the measurement of

productivity and to the effects of changes in the terms of trade, which is
                                      —5—


necessary if the private production sectorts balance of merchandise trade

surplus changes sign going from one period to the next. Finally, in section 8

we illustrate the theory using U.S. data, and in section 9 we provide

concluding remarks.



2. Transiog Productivity Indexes

          Suppose that there are Nd domestic goods, N exported goods,

Nm imported goods (or N = Nd + N + Nm net outputs) produced and utilized by

the private production sector of an econorrr. Suppose in addition, that there

are M primary inputs. Denote the aggregate private production sector's set of

technologically feasible combinations of net outputs and primary inputs by rt,

a subset of N + M dimensional space. Thus if (y, v) crt, the N dimensional

sional vector of net outputs y      (y1,...,y)T can be produced by the private

production sector if producers can utilize the non—negative N dimensional vec-

tor of inputs v   (vl,....,vM)T >        If y > 0 (<0), then the th net out-

put is an output (input), netted over all producers in the private production

sector.

          Define the economy's period t private gross domestic product func-

tion r product function gt in brief by:


Ci)       gt(py) E maxy{P : (y,v)crt}


where p   (p1, ...,   )T   >>    is a (hypothetical) positive vector of net out-

put prices that private producers face6 and v ) 0M is a non—negative vector of

primary inputs that are (hypothetically) available to producers during period
                                       —6—




t.    Thus gt(p, v) is the maximum   value   of domestic outputs plus exports minus

imports (where these goods are priced out at the relevant prices p in the p

vector), given that the vector of primary inputs v is available7 and given the

period t aggregate technolor at set rt. We assume that the technolo&Y set

rt is a closed, convex cone, so that the aggregate technolor is subject to

constant returns to scale.8 In this case, gt(p, v) will be a convex and

linearly homogeneous function in p, and a concave, riondecreasing and linearly

homogenous function in v. In fact, under a few additional regularity con-

ditions on rt, gt will completely characterize the technolor set rt, i.e.,

there is a duality between rt and gt•9

           Let Pt >>      be the observed price vector for net outputs during

period t and let yt vt be the corresponding vectors of net outputs and pri-

mary inputs respectively for period t. If producers are competitively

profit maximizing during period t and the product function gt(p, v) is dif-

ferentiable at (t,yt), by Hotelling's Lemma we have the following

relationship between yt Pt and Vt:


(2)        yt = Vgt(p tt
                      ,v


where Vgt      (agtIaPl,...,agtfapN)T denotes the vector of first order partial

derivatives of gt with respect to the components of p. Let w

              >>       denote the positive vector of input prices that producers

face during period t.-° Then by a shadow pricing result that may be found in

Diewert [l971; i)40]      we have the following relationship between wt, Pt and
                                           —7—



(3)       wt = Vg         ttt
                           (p ,v )


         t                                   t
where Vg is the gradient vector of g with respect to the components of v.

          We are now ready to define a new family of theoretical productivity

indexes that is similar in spirit to the families of output price and output

quantity indexes defined by Fisher and Shell 11972] and Samuelson and Swamy

1l971.   Let p >>           be a reference net output price vector and let v >>       0M

be a reference primary input vector. Define the period t theoretical

productivity Index depending on p, v by:


(}4)
           t      -
          R (p,v) = g (p,v)/g
                             t
                             t—l
                                 (p,v).

          Using definition (1), we see that Rt(pv) is the percentage

increase in output (valued at the reference prices p) that can be produced by

the period t technology set compared to the period t—1 technology set, given

that in both cases the private production economy is utilizing the reference

primary input vector v. Thus there are an infinite number of theoretical pro-

ductivity Indexes of the form defined by (4):             one for each reference price

and quantity vector p, v.

          Two special cases of )          will   be of interest to us:


             t        t,pt—l                             fL = gt,p
                                                          t -        t t t—li'p t,v t).
I   ,            -
                 =    g   ,vt—1.)/gt—l,kpt—l,vt—1   );               ,v )/g



          RLt
                 is   a Laspeyres type theoretical productivity index which uses

period t—1 output prices and primary input quantities as reference prices and

quantities, while            is a Paasche type productivity index which uses period t

reference prices and quantities. The interpretation for both indexes is
                                         —9)—




the percentage increase in private product that has occurred solely due to

improvement in technolo&y ——    or the organization of production —— going from
period t—l to period t.

          Under the assumption of competitive profit nximizing behavior, we
                                 t                      t
may identify the denominator of RL and the numerator of R; i.e., we have for

all t:



(6)
             tt t
          g (p ,v )
                          tt ttv
                      =p y =     w


The second equality in (6) follows from our constant returns to scale assump-

tion. Our problem in evaluating         and R is that we cannot evaluate the

hypothetical products, gt(pt_l,vt_l) and gt_l(pt,vt). However, it turns out

that e can precisely evaluate an average of               and      if we assume that the

functional form for gt has the following translog form for all periods

t=O,l,..., T under consideration:

                                N                        N N

where    =        ij ji and the parameters satisfy various other
             a1
restrictions that ensure gt is linearly homogeneous in p and v)-2 The important

thing to note about definition (7) is that we allow all of the first order

parameters of gt to depend on t; only the second order parameters (the au,

8ij and mm) are restricted to be constant over time. Another important point

to note is that gt defined by (7) can approximate an arbitrary twice con—

tinuously differentiable function to the second order. Hence there is pro—
                                                               —9—


bably little loss of generality from an empirical point of view in assuming

that the private product function of our economy under consideration can be

adequately represented by the gt defined by (T).



Theorem 1:

                  Suppose gt and gt_l are defined by- (7) and there Is competitive pro-

fit maximizing behavior in each period. Then the geometric mean of the two

produqtivity Indexes defined by (5)                            is   precisely equal to the transiog impli-

cit output index divided by the translog input index between periods t—l and

t;    i.e.,

           Note that the right hand side of (8) can be evaluated given just

price and quantity data for periods t and t—1. Thus although we cannot iden-

tify the individual productivity indexes, R and R, we can measure their

geometric mean very accurately.

           The number b defined below (8) is the translog output price index

implicit translog output quantity index, %(p ,p ,y

is the translog input quantity index, %(wt_l,wt,vt_l,vt). Thus (8) may be

rewritten as:



(9)        (RtRt)l/'2 =   (pt_1,pt,yt_1,yt)/Q(wt_l,wt,vt_l,vt).

           The rather remarkable result, (8) or (9), may be derived in an

alternative fashion using the quadratic leimna in the presence of discrete

variables developed by Denny and Fuss 11983a1 11983b] •114

           Alternative approaches to the measurement of productivity- based on

the Malmquist l953] — Hicks 11981; 256] efficiency- index idea may be found in

Caves, Christensen and Diewert 11982; 110l_8] and Diewert 11983; 1077—831.



3. Translog Real Product and Real Input Indexes

           The translog productivity index, (8) or (9), is consistent with tra-

ditional concepts of productivity growth measurement; i.e., %/Q0 represents

the growth in output independent of input growth, or "pure" technical change.

The next step is to consider the definitions and interpretation of the com—
                                               —11—



ponent indexes of (RRt)3./2=Rt the translog (or Divisia) output or product and

input quantity indexes          and Q0.

          To define real (i.e., deflated) product, we shall first define an

output price deflator. We follow the example of Fisher and Shell 11972],

Samuelson and Swamy 119714; 588—92] and Dlewert 11983; 10551 and define

the private business sector's theoretical output price index between periods

t—l and t using the reference period r technolor set Cr             will   be set equal to

t or t—]. later) and using the reference primary input vector V >> 0M as:


            t—l t     -  r, t    r,
          Pp ,p ,v,rj = g p ,v)/g p,v
                                     t—l


where Pt >>       and pti >>           are the observed positive (net) price vectors

for periods t and t—1 respectively. Thus P(pt_1,pt,vt_l,t_l) =

gt_l(pt,vt_l)/gt_l(pt_l,vt_l)          is the proportional increase in period t—1

nominal product if prices of net outputs were changed from period t—1 prices

to period t prices, but the technolor and primary input vectors were held

constant at their period t—1 levels. This special case of (io) (and one other)

will be of particular interest:

           t -=   t—1

                                                      ); P g (p ,v )/g (p
                                                                           t t—l t
                                                                                 ,v



   is a Laspeyres type theoretical output price index which uses the period

t—1 techno1or set and the period t—1 primary input vector                   as reference

quantities, while        is a Paasche type index which uses the period t reference

techno1or set and quantities.

         The following theorem shows that we can calculate the geometric

conditions.



Theorem 2 (Dievert [1983; 10621):

          Suppose gt and gt_l the private product functions for periods t

and t—1, are defined by (7) and there is competitive profit maximizing beha-

vior in each period. Then


(12)          (tpt)1/2 =                               b


          t.-l t t—           t
where P0(p      ,p ,y        ,y )   is   the translog output price index which is equal

to b defined below (8).

          The above theorem suggests that the empirically calculable trarislog

price index p(ptlptytlyt) is an appropriate output price deflator

between periods t—1 and t. We suggest that a good measure of real product

growth between period t—1 and t is the corresponding translog implicit quan-

tity index       defined by:


               t—l t t—1 t -= p
                 ,p ,y  ,y )
                                            t 'yt/pt—l yt—1    /   t—].    t t—1 t
                                                                          ,p ,y   ,y
          Q0(p                                               P0'p

          Turning now to the problem of measuring real input, define the

theoretical input quantity index between periods t—1 and t using the reference

period r technolor set and the reference output price vector                           >>   as:

/   ..          t—l     t      -  r         t r (p,vt—1 ).
I114)     Q(v         ,v ,p,r) = g (p,v jig

          As usual, two special cases of (114) are of interest:

             The following theorem shows that we can calculate the geometric mean

of the unobservable theoretical indexes                     and      using the price and quantity

data for periods t and t—l under relatively unrestrictive conditions.

             The above theorem suggests that the empirically implementable

of real input growth between periods t—1 and t. We suggest that a good input

price deflator between periods t—l and t is the corresponding translog impli-

cit price index P0 defined by:


             ..',
                     t—1    t t—1 t            t t t—1 'vt—1           t—l t t—1 t

               To summarize, we suggest that the private production sector's output

price deflator should be defined by (12), the corresponding real product index

by (13), the real input index by (i6) and the corresponding input price defla-

tor by (17). The result indexes preserve account identities so that the value

of inputs will equal the value of outputs in each period. The output price

deflator and the input quantity index have nice economic interpretations in

terms of theoretical indexes. Finally, If the above system of accounting Is

followed, our preferred productivity index defined by (9) in the previous sec-

tion is simply the ratio of our suggested real product and real input indexes,



.      Translog Price and Quantity Effects
               In this section, we further decompose our indexes to provide

economic interpretations for the components of our output price deflator

               The indexes P and P provide answers to the following hypotheti-

going from period t—l to t, p1 to p, holding constant other prices and
primary input availabilities and also holding the technology constant at the

period t—]. or period t level.

             The following counterpart to Theorem 2 (which may be proven in the

same manner) shows that we can calculate the geometric mean of the Laspeyres

and Paasche price effects for good n using observable price and quantity data

for periods t—l and t.


Theorem b:

             Suppose gt and gt_l have the translog functional form as in (7) and
there is competitive profit maximizing behavior in each period. Then for nl,

             £nb     (1/2) (ptyt/ptsyt) +   (tltl/t1.t1fl    £n(pt/pt).


             Note that the product of the b equals the aggregate output price

effect defined in Theorem 2; i.e., we have



(20)               b = b = (tltt1t) = (tt)1/2
             n1
Thus we may decompose the aggregate price change going from period t—1 to t

into a product of individual price changes.

          Turning now to the input side, for each input in, we may define the
                                      t          t

               The indices Q and                 provide answers to the following hypotheti-

cal questions: what is              the proportional change in private product       that can be

attributed to the change in the mth primary input going from period t—1 to

period t, vt to Vt, holding constant output prices and other primary input

availabilities and also holaing the technolor constant.

               The following counterpart to Theorem 3 (which may be proven in the

same manner) shows that we can calculate the geometric mean of the Laspeyes

and Paasche quantity effects for input m using observable price and quantity

data for periods t—l and t.

   Thus we may decompose the aggregate quantity change going from period t—l to t

   into a product of individual quantity changes or effects. Furthermore,

   referring back to (8), we see that the theoretical productivity index (RtRt)ht2

   may be written as the nominal product ratio pt.yt/pt•'l.ytl divided by the

   product of the price effects and quantity effects.

              Note that Theorems 1 and 5 may be interpreted as (global) corn—

'parative statics theorems about the private product functions gt_l(p,v) and
    t
   g (p,v).


   5. The Translog Product Function Approach to Changes in the Terms of Trade

              We are finally ready to attack the problem of measuring the effects

   of changes in prices of imported and exported goods on the output of the pri-

   vate business sector of an econonr. A possible obvious approach to this

   problem is to treat changes in the prices of traded goods using the output price

   effects defined in the previous section. However, it seems useful to define

   combination theoretical indexes that include the effects of changes in the pri-

   ces of all internationally traded goods and then see if we can measure special

   cases of these theoretical indexes with observable price and quantity data.

              Recall that at the beginning of section 2, we stated that there were

   Nd domestic goods, N exported goods and N imported goods for the private

   production sector. We now partition our old output price and quantity vec-

   tors, Pt and y, into three subvectors of the appropriate dimensions; i.e.,

   taking transposes, we have

              The proof of this theorem follows along the lines of Theorem 3. Our

empirically implementable terms of trade adjustment index, d/e, turns out to

be (roughly speaking) an index of export prices divided by an index of import

prices. The indexes are not quite conventional indexes since the weights,

                                  Our adjustment index d/e provides a very pre-

cise answer to a question which has intrigued national income accountants for

50 years.

              The careful reader will be able to show that d/e is also equal to a

product of our old output price effects b defined below (19), where the pro-

duct Is taken over all internationally traded goods.

              Suppose we wish to measure the combined effects of technical

progress and improvements in the terms of trade, holding all domestic inputs

fixed. Such an index might be termed an (output) "welfare" change index.

Consider the following family of such indexes:

where      is a positive vector of reference domestic commodity prices of dimen-

 sion Nd and v is a positive reference vector of primary inputs. Note that

gt_l is the product function using the period t—l technolor set while gt uses

the period t technolor set. As usual, we consider two special cases of (26):


 (27)
             t   -   t t—l t t t—l           t—l    t—l   t—].   t-.l t—l       and

                       dPxPm" )/g d'x               'm
            The following counterpart of Theorem 1 shows that we may calculate

the geometric mean of the Laspeyres and Paasche private product welfare

indexes using observable data.


Theorem 1: Suppose the product functions gt and gt_l have the translog func-

tional form as in (7)     and there is competitive profit maximizing behavior in
each period. Then


(28)        (ww)"2 = (a/bc)(d/e)         =
                                             (4R)hI'2(A4)/2
where   a, b and c are defined below (8) and d and e are defined below (25).
           Thus the "welfare" change index on the left hand side of (28) is
equal to the product of our earlier productivity index (RRt)l!2 times our
terms of trade adjustment factor (A4)4l'2.
           Unfortunately,     formula (25) is not the end of the story. There are

two conceptual problems with the product terms of trade adjustment indexes

defined by (214):     (1) since the value of exports minus the value of imports is

part of the private business product, the theoretical adjustment indexes do
                                         —21—


not isolate the change in domestic production dd that could be attributed

to changes in export and import prices and (ii) the theoretical indexes

defined by (21) do not impose a balance of payments constraint on the private

business economy. Thus in the following sections, we take an alternative

approach to measuring the effects of changes in the prices of internationally

traded goods on domestic production which allows us to consider these problems.


6.     The Translog Sales Function Approach to Changes in the Terms of Trade

             Consider the following f'unction s defined by:16


(29)
              st(pdpxpmvvO) maxyyy{Pd•Yd: (y,y,_y,v)crt;

                                              —          +        o}.
                                       PXYX       PmYm       v0


             We call s the domestic sales function for the period t technolor

set rt. Besides its dependence on rt, 5t          depends on five sets of variables:
N)     d'   a positive vector of Nd domestic commodity prices; (ii) p, a positive

vector of N export prices that private domestic producers face (in terms of

domestic currency),1? (iii) p, a positive vector of Nm import prices that pri-

vate domestic producers face (in terms of domestic currency),18 (iv) v, a posi-

tive vector of M quantities of primary inputs that are available to the

private production sector, and (v) a scalar v0, a bypothetical balance of

merchandise trade deficit that the private production sector is allowed to

run. If v0 <     0,   then —v0 is the trade surplus that the private production

sector must produce. The sales function st(pd,px,p ,v,v0) tells us how

much doiestic output the period t economy can produce (valued at the reference
                                             —22--




prices          given that the vector of primary inputs V        is   available, exports

may    be sold at prices p, imports may be purchased at prices m and the
private production sector is allowed to utilize a balance of trade deficit

of size v0. The sales function is the producer theory counterpart to

Woodland's [1980] indirect trade utility function.19

            Define the private production sector's period t (net) deficit

(surplus if negative) on merchandise trade by


(30)        v0 =
                t_    t t
                     p'y    —
                                t t
                                p°y   = value of imports — value of exports.


When we evaluate the sales function               at the observed period t arguments,

using the assumption of competitive profit n.ximizing behavior and the




                         ttt tt tt t

                 addition to the above assumptions, we assume that s is differen—


adapting   the arguments in Diewert [1983; l092_l091], we find that the first
order   partial derivatives of s are equal to          the   following observable vectors:

                       do
                     tt tttt
                                        =


                                             t
            V     s (Pd,P,P,V ,v0) =

                tt ttt t t
                      (PdPxPmV ,v0) =

            V stt  t t ,v0)
                pd'p'p' tt= t            v   ,   and
                                                —23--




                    st(p,pt,pt,vt,v)      =   i.
             vvo

            It     is evident from (31) and (32) that the deficit v0 plays a role

which is similar to the role of a primary input: a bigger deficit (holding

other things constant) will lead to a bigger equilibrium value of domestic

sales. Note that the price of the deficit variable is 1, the exchange rate.

            In this section, we plan to rework most of the material presented in

          VLL)U ? OL LJ.L11ø UJ UJ1 t              Ld1 UU1Ub l..J bJb .J. U1i( ..LUI1 bO I

gt     our old domestic product function. Thus instead of measuring the effects

of technical progress and changes in foreign prices on gross domestic private

product, we now want to measure the effects on gross private sales. Since this

is the itput. which actually gets Into the hands of domestic purchasers, for

short term "welfare" change measurement the sales concept may be more relevant

than the product concept.

            The counterpart to the theoretical productivity index Rt(p,v)
                               t
defined by (1k) is now B (p,v,v0)

            In the remainder of this section, we assume that the functional form

for s is the translog functional form; i.e., £n st(p,v,v0) is defined by

the right hand side of (7),         except that summations of the form ml, ...,              M are

              Comparing our new empirically implementable productivity index

defined by the right hand side of (314) with our old productivity index defined

by (8), we see that if the deficits v and v' are small, then p'y will be

close to pt.yt =          wtv   and the term c0 will be close to one, and hence the two

productivity indexes will be very close to each other.

              If v' and v are both negative, then formula (314) is still valid

if we cancel out the minus signs in £n(v0/v0                 )   before   taking the logarithm.

However, if v1 and v are of opposite sign, then we cannot derive (314). We

will   deal with this opposite sign case in the following section.

question: what is the proportional change in private domestic sales that can

be attributed to a change in the private sectorts balance of trade deficit

from      to v, holding constant output, export and import prices, and holding

constant the technolor set and primary input availabilities.

          Under the hypothesis of Theorem 10, we have


(2)       (Q0Q;0)"2 =           c
where c0 is defined below (3k).

          The results (26), (39) and R2) may be interpreted as global com-

parative statics theorems, relating to the sales functions s and st.

          We now define the following theoretical terms of trade sales

                   a manner analogous to the old product adjustment indexes

cits v and v' are small in magnitude, our new terms of trade adjustment

index d*/e* will be numerically close to our old index d/e.

            The following counterpart of Theorem 7 shows that we may calculate

the geometric mean of the Laspeyres and Paasche private sales welfare indexes

using observable data.


Theorem 12: Suppose the sales functions s and                    have the translog

behavior in each period. Then

                                            )           )

      Thus the "welfare" change index on the left hand side of (16) is equal
                                                t*t* 1/2 and our new terms
to the product of our new productivity index      F, )

       The indexes         and         defined by (15) capture the combined comparative

statics effects on private domestic sales of changes in export prices, import

prices and technology, holding constant domestic output prices, primary input

and the balance of trade deficit. However, we may want our "welfare" index to

also capture the effects of a change in the balance of trade deficit; if the

deficit increases, there will be an "exogenous" increase in domestic sales

that   is in some respects similar to a short run increase in total factor
productivity.   Thus we define the following theoretical "total welfare" change

indexes which incorporate the effects of changes in total factor productivity,

prices of exports and imports, and changes in the deficit:

         The material presented in this section has been contingent on the

assumption that the balance of trade deficits have the same sign                         in adjacent
periods. Our translog approach fails if this condition is not satisfied, since

c is not defined in this case. Empirically, we find that V0                           does   change

sign. What then should we do? We address this question in the following sec-

tion.

7.      The First Order Approximation Approach

        The translog approach to modelling the sales function fails when V0 changes

sign going from period t—l to period t. In this section, we outline an

alternative nonparametric approach to modelling the sales function (which

perhaps has a more general validity) which does not fail if V0 changes sign.

        The basic idea can be explained rather easily. From (32), we can evaluate

the first derivatives of the sales function s at the period t data point.

Hence we can form first order approximations to the two special cases of the

various theoretical indexes that always were of interest In the translog

approach. We then take the geometric mean of our two linear approximations.

The quadratic approximation lenitna of Denny and Fuss 11983a1 [1983b] leads us to

believe that our mean index Is accurate to the second order.

        Let us apply the           above idea to the productivity indexes
                                                                                                          t*

       The proof of the above theorem is by computation. The theorem is similar

to results in Diewert [19781 [1983;1099] 23

       If we use the chain principle to construct our index numbers in an

empirical application rather than the fixed base principle, changes in prices

and quantities will be relatively small going from period to period. Hence, by

Theorem l, the translog indexes defined in the previous section will

approximate very closely the nonparameteric indexes defined in this section.

The advantage of the translog indexes is that they are exact for a translog

sales function which can approximate any sales function to the second order.

The nonparameteric indexes have only a formal first order approximation property

in terms of approximating an arbitrary sales function, but they numerically

approximate the translog indexes to the second order, and hence have an indirect

second order approximation property. Moreover, the nonparaxneteric indexes have

a practical advantage over the translog indexes: they are well defined even if

the balance of trade deficit changes sign going from one period to the next.

     We turn now to an empirical application of the index number theory pre-

sented above.


8. Empirical Illustration

     Empirical implementation of the theoretical structure outlined in the

previous section requires straightforward calculation of a number of translog

or Trnqvist indexes of output, inputs and trade, and combination of these

components into the composite productivity or welfare indexes. We have

computed these indexes for the United States to illustrate their use for

assessing the effects of international interdependence on national economic

 information on national output, capital and labor inputs, exports and imports.

 We   have developed the output, import and        export data for 1968—1982 from the

 National     Income and Product Accounts, (u.s. Department of Commerce [1981],

  1982), [1983]), and have used real capital stock data constructed by the

 Bureau of Labor Statistics (u.s. Department of Labor [19831) and real labor

 data updated form Jorgenson and Fraumeni [1981], since these series closely

 approximate our theoretically- ideal indexes.

as translog indexes of the components of each measure, and quantities

(yt and yt) were determined implicitly. For 1967—82, value and price data

for nine different types of exports and ten types of imports were available,

which were used to compute chain price indexes. For 1960—67, however, only

only two components were available; durable and nondurable goods. In this

section, the shorter time period was used. For purposes of comparison,

however, indexes for 1960—82 were computed and the resulting indexes are pre-

sented in the Appendix.

were provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Division of Productivity- and

and B. Fraumeni.2


8.b. Empirical Implementation and Results

      The first indexes to consider are those based on the product function

given by (1), hereafter denoted the product approach. Recall that the pure

theoretical productivity index Rt(pv) represented by (b) captures only

changes in technolor between two periods holding all other arguments of g('),

including input levels, constant. Rt is measured as a translog or T6rnqvist

implicit output index Q =        a/b   divided by a direct translog input index                 =

from (8). For empirical implementation, a is calculated directly as the ratio
                         tt t—lt—l
of the value of output p y / P Y                 and b Is calculated as a translog price

index of output, where the output identity ptyt =           ptyt   +   ptyt   —   ptyt   is

explicitly recognized. Using (13), the implicit output index                       is calculated

as a/b. The input index,          =    c,   in turn, is calculated directly as a translog

quantity index of K and L.

      The resulting productivity growth measure (R,R)1'2 = a/bc and its

multiplicative components a, 1/b, and 1/c are presented in Table 1. Note
                                                      —3R.-



that this multifactor productivity index captures large drops in productivity

in 1970, 1975, 1979—80, and especially 1982. 1975 and 1976 were poor

productivity years ——                 there   was a 2% drop in productivity —— which caused

concern in the late 70's about the observed "productivity slowdown". However,

the late 1960's were also disappointing and 1977 appeared very strong in terms

of productivity growth, indicating that productivity trends cannot be charac-

terized by a unique productivity downturn in 1973. In addition, 1980 exhibited

productivity.                  This suggests a trend toward deterioration of productivity

growth over time, much of which can be attributed to output fluctuations

represented by a/b.

          To incorporate the effects on U.S. "welfare" of changes in the terms of

trade in addition to changes in technical efficiency, the adjustment index

(44)11112 =       d/e must be calculated. Using (25), d/e is computed empirically as
the product of the components of export and import price effects.

          The translog adjustment index At for the product approach is reported in

Table 1. The index is generally close to 1.0, since internationally traded

goods are such a small proportion of total output, even in the most recent

years of the sample.                  However, in l97l and 1980 (two enerr shock years),

increases in the prices of imported goods relative to exported goods were

responsible for declines in real output of about 1 1/2% in each year. With

the exception of these two years, the "welfare" index W, obtained by

multiplying Rt and At, does not vary significantly from Rt; for a

relatively closed econorrr like the U.S., improvements in the terms of trade

have a relatively small effect on economic welfare defined in this manner.

     The second approach to measurement of productivity change and the effects

of international trade, the "sales—approach" can also easily be implemented

empirically.    Recall that using this approach it is possible to determine
the impact of changes in the deficit v =     PY
measure corresponding to this approach is (R R )

part of Table 1. The components of this measure are also reported; a*, l/b* and

l/c* are computed as before except that the indexes are weighted by the value of

sales. The deficit component c is defined below (3i) for all periods where the

deficit did not change sign. For the five periods where the deficit did change

sign,c is undefined and so are the corresponding entries for 1/c,            Rt, W
and T •     The R   index corresponds closely to R defined from the product

    B   can be adjusted by A = d /e defined similarly to d/e above (but

weighted by sales) to generate W, which is close to the analogous measure

W. The sales approach, however, allows us also to consider the deficit effect

c0. The impact of   this effect was small,   with the exception of the year 1977,

where the increase in the trade deficit relative to 1976 was large enough to

account for an approximate 1.6% drop in real output.

    In Table 2, we present productivity, adjustment and welfare indexes for

the translog product and sales approaches discussed above as well as the first

order approximations to the sales approach measures, ,       , P, and             It is

evident from the Table that the approximations closely correspond to the

appropriate translog sales approach indexes for the years where the deficit does

not change sign.

     Finally, we summarize some of the information contained in these indexes

by average annual growth rates over selected periods in Table 3. The first

two periods to consider represent pre and post OPEC time periods 1968—73

and 1973_77.25 Note that these trends are measured between peak productivity

growth years. We also consider growth rates to the end of the sample period;

growth rates were calculated both to 1981 and 1982 for comparison since the

1982 values pull the trend downward so dramatically.

     The overall productivity picture that emerges from these measures is

one of cyclical but secularly decreasing productivity growth. There is

clearly no unique productivity growth drop post—1973. Consider the pure

productivity growth measure based on the product approach,      The average

annual growth rate from 1968 to 1982 is negative; productivity appeared to

decrease by .1% per year. The breakdown into time periods, however, indicates

that this is caused by the last years of the sample. Productivity was

observed to grow by .8%/annum from 1968—73 and .7% from 1973 to 1977 ——   not

a large drop. By contrast, productivity declined by almost .7% over the last

time periods, 1977 to 1982.

    Much of this observed drop is due to the 1982 data. If the growth trend is

measured from 1968 to 1981, the average annual growth rate is .3%. This also

causes the post—1977 growth rate to appear much higher; for this period

productivity growth per year is measured as .5%, a drop from the earlier years

but not a substantial drop.

     The trends calculated from the     index, the product approach measure

adjusted for terms of trade, are lower than those without consideration of

welfare     changes from changes in the terms of trade. This is largely a

result of the large increases in import prices from the oil shocks —— much of

the observed decline is post—1973. This is consistent with the 1ypothesis that

with an increase in import prices relative to export prices, to maintain the

same deficit the economy must have less production; an increase in p relative

to p Is analogous to a decrease in total factor productivity. The relative

growth rates between time periods are, however, similar to the unadjusted
            +
measure R .

      The growth rates calculated from the approximation Indexes         and

based on the sales approach are very similar to those calculated from Rt

and W. This is as expected since they are measuring the same phenomena, they

are just based on slightly different approximation assumptions. Using this

approach, however, we may also consider the deficit effect represented by the

     index. Recall that this index reflects exogenous changes in domestic sales

from an increase in the deficit that increases "welfare" similarly to short

run increases in total factor productivity. It is clear from a comparison

of     to       that total welfare growth including the deficit effect

is higher than that recognizing only the impact of the terms of trade.

even appears relatively higher in 1977 and 1982 than does the pure

productivity measure B •     Note also that the growth rate of B and T between
1973 and 1977 is the same. This is, however, a coincidence; the composition

of the productivity growth rate over the period is quite    different.
      It appears, therefore, that adjustments of U.S. productivity measures for

terms of trade and deficit effects do not have a substantial Impact on

trends in productivity. They do not, for example, provide a useful rationale

for the "productivity slowdown" through the late 1970's and especially the early

1980's. The small effect of trade adjustments is likely the result of the

small proportion of international trade carried out in the U.S. relative to

total national income. These procedures do, however, provide us with a way to

incorporate and assess the effects of international trade flows in our

measurement of national real output.


9. Concluding Remarks

     This paper has focussed on defining index numbers for productivity and

"welfare" which are well defined for discrete data, based on production theory,

empirically irnplementable, and decomposable to obtain directly interpretable

effects of individual exogenous changes such as changes in technical change

and the terms of trade. Using our framework, the effect on welfare of changes

in terms of trade can explicitly be developed as analogous to technical change

or total factor productivity changes.

    We have shown that the translog approach to generating these index

numbers results in empirical indexes that are geometric means of hypothetical

(unobservable) theoretical indexes. From these empirical indexes we have seen

that adjustments to traditional productivity indexes to generate welfare

indexes reflecting changes in terms of trade do not substantially change the

observed pattern of productivity growth for the United States. We found

slightly less growth of total welfare than productivity, resulting mainly from

an adverse terms of trade effect but attenuated somewhat by the deficit

effect. We would, however, expect the effects to be larger for an econonj for

which imports and exports were a larger portion of total sales.

export prices divided by     an   index of import prices (or the reciprocal of the

above).

and Diewert 11976, 1978, 19831.

             4• Our approach is closest in spirit to the work of Gollop 11982].

Unfortunately, he did not distinguish between export prices and prices of

domestic commodities, so he could not address the terms of trade adjustment

issue.

            6. Conceptually, these are before consumer tax but after government

subsidy prices. If there are taxes on intermediate inputs, then in theory we

should distinguish the total production of the good by the originating

industry and the total input utilization of the good by other industries. In

the latter case, the relevant price is the originating industry price plus the

per unit tax on the intermediate good that the using industries must pay.

Transportation inputs create similar theoretical complications.


          7. Primary inputs consist of different grades of labor, capital,

inventories, land and other natural resources.


          8. Some parts of our growth accounting methodology can be adapted

to deal with Increasing returns to scale technologies as In Denny, Fuss and

May 11981] or Caves, Christensen and Diewert 11982], but then exogenous

(econometric) estimates of the degree of returns to scale are required. In

this paper, we want our growth accounting methodology to depend only on obser-

vable prices and quantities.


          9. The product function gt was introduced to the economics litera-

ture by Samuelson 11953] for the case of sectoral production functions with no

joint or intermediate production. In the general case, gt was defined by

Gorman 11968]. Complete duality theorems between gt and rt   were   established

by Diewert 119731   and McFadden 11978].

          10. Thus wage rates should include all taxes and fringe benefit

components, capital Input prices should be ex post user costs of the type

constructed by Christensen and Jorgenson 119701, and land user costs should

include property taxes.


          11. See also Samuelson [1953; 201 and Gorman 11968; 1531.


          12. These conditions may be found in Diewert [1971; 139]. The

translog functional form is due to Christensen, Jorgenson and Lau 119711; the

translog product function defined by (7) is due to Diewert 119714] and Russell
                                     —15—



and Boyce 119714].


           13. Recall that if good n is an import good, then       and y will

be negative and the (p/p') term in b will be raised to a negative power.

Thus the output price index b is essentially a price index of domestic outputs

and exports divided by a price index of imports. We follow Jorgenson and

Nishimizu 119781 in calling b a translog price index rather than a Tornqvist

index.


           lb. Denny and Fuss 11983b; 3181 also show why a suitable average of

first order approximations yields a second order approximation. Their result

may provide an intuitive explanation for (8), which essentially says that a

certain theoretical index may 1e approximated to the second order using only

first order information.


           15. The proof of Theorem 2 is analogous to the proof of Theorem 3.


           16. Diewert [1983; 1086] called this function the period t balance

of trade restricted value added function. A similar function was defined by

Archibald 11977; 60—61].


           17. Thus these prices should include any export subsidies.


           18. Thus these prices should include any customs duties, taxes and

tariffs.


           19. Note that st(pdppvv) regarded as a function of

   and v has mathematical properties similar to those of gt(pv) while

   regarded as a function of x' m and       has properties similar to those
possessed by an indirect utility function. Under our regularity conditions on

rt, s will be: (i) nondecreasing, concave and linearly homogeneous in v, v0,

(ii) nondecreasirig, convex and linearly homogenous in d' (iii) quasiconvex

and homogeneous of degree zero in p, m and v0, (iv) nondecreasthg in the

components of    and (v) nonincreasing in the components of


          20. We also need to use our assumption that p and      are price

vectors denominated in units of domestic currency so that exchange rates are

unity.


          21. The homogeneity and curvature properties of     will place

various restrictions on the parameters (which we will not write out here).

Throughout this section, we assume that the quadratic coefficients of the

various period specific translog sales functions s are constant, even though

some results (such as those in Theorems 9 and 10) can be derived under weaker

conditions (in the sense that some of the quadratic coefficients can depend on

time).


          22. The term d*c/e* correspond to the translog terms of trade

adjustment fact or   defined in Diewert 11983; 10981.


          23. Following the termino1oy introduced in Diewert 119781, we

might term the translog indexes to be superlative while the non—parametric

indexes are pseudosuperlative.


          2I. The BLS labor quantity series is an unweighted manhours series

and hence is unsuitable for our purposes. We wish to thank Hike Harper at BLS

and Barbara Fraumeni for their help in providing the updated data series.

          25. The time periods often considered in the literature include

also pre—1965 and 1965—T3 instead of 1968—73. To allow for a comparison of

the earlier years, productivity measures from the 1960—82 data are considered

in the Appendix.

Appendix
     This appendix provides indexes analogous to Tables 2 and 3 but including

the years 1960—67. These indexes are based on less disaggregated data than

the indexes reported in the text; the export and import data include only two

components each, durables and nondurables. Therefore, for example, the impact

of petroleum price increases, which has an independent effect for the later

data sample, is muted.

     In general the indexes here indicate similar trends, although the

productivity decline over time is more evident in these numbers because of the

availability of the earlier data. The growth rate of productivity in the

1960—65 period was 2% per year, much larger than for any period in the later

sample,   and the   1965—73    growth   rate was 1% per annum, compared to .8% when

considered only from 1968. The 1965—71 numbers are also provided here to

emphasize the existence of periods of large productivity declines before 1973,

although this is clearly not as disastrous as the average over the 1973—82

period; the 1982 6%     drop   in productivity tends to distort the picture when

presented as an average over time. Note, finally, that although the terms of

trade and deficit effects adjusted productivity in the same direction as for

the later period, earlier in the sample, the effects were not as substantial,

resulting in a larger slowdown in "welfare" over time than in productivity.
