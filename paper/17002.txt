                                              ABSTRACT

In Beijing, the metropolitan government has made enormous place based investments to increase green
space and to improve public transit. We examine the gentrification consequences of such public investments.
Using unique geocoded real estate and restaurant data, we document that the construction of the Olympic
Village and two recent major subway systems have led to increased new housing supply in the vicinity
of these areas, higher local prices and an increased quantity of nearby private chain restaurants.

Introduction


       In Beijing, the city’s government is investing to improve local infrastructure.      Over the last

ten years, the government has constructed new subways and built the Olympic Park, which played

a pivotal role in the 2008 Summer Olympics.             These investments have cost billions of dollars.

Four new subway lines were built during 2000 to 2009, with the total investment of 50.3 billion

RMB. 20.5 billion RMB was spent to construct the 2008 Olympic Park between 2003 and 2008.1

These place based investments have been concentrated in some of the less desirable areas of

Beijing.

       In this paper, we use unique data to study how developers and restaurant entrepreneurs

respond to this change in the quality of specific areas within Beijing. We test whether public

investments and private sector investments are complements that act synergistically to gentrify

previously depressed areas within this booming city.

       Our investigation of the real estate market consequences from place based investments in a

fast growing developing city contribute to a recent U.S literature focused on urban gentrification.

Guerrieri, Hartley and Hurst (2010) document spatial spillovers such that exogenous increases in

income in one community bid up real estate prices in adjacent communities.                  Kahn (2007)

documents the increase in local home prices in major U.S cities such as Boston and Washington

DC that have opened “walk and ride” subway stops for fast new subways.              Schwartz, Susin and

Voicu (2003) estimate how crime reduction differences within New York City have contributed to

local real estate price appreciation.            Kahn, Vaughn and Zasloff (2010) report evidence of

gentrification in Los Angeles communities that lie just inside the California coastal boundary zone.

Sieg et. al (2004) show that an unintended consequence of successful Clean Air Act regulation in

Los Angeles has been to trigger migration and gentrification in previously poor areas of the city

whose air pollution has sharply decreased.

       In many of these cases, a government financed or regulated place based amenity

improvement triggers a social multiplier effect in specific parts of a city.          The government’s

investment has a direct effect of improving the local area’s quality of life. This is capitalized into

higher rents.      As gentrification takes place, the local area will self select people who can afford to

1
    The official exchange rate is 7 RMB per dollar.
pay this rent premium.           A type of snowball effect ensues as the gentrification of the

neighborhood attracts better stores and restaurants and this in turn attracts more high skilled

people to live nearby (Waldfgoel 2008).

      This paper documents that similar dynamics are taking place in those Beijing areas where the

state has made significant investments.         Using several new data sets, we report three new facts.

First, homes near the new government infrastructure sell for a price premium.                            Second,

developers are increasing the number of housing units produced in a vicinity of this infrastructure.

Third, new restaurant openings have also increased in the neighborhoods close to the Olympic

Village and the new subways.          These findings all support the claim that public investment and

private investment are complements.



Recent Local Infrastructure Improvements in Beijing



      The two largest local infrastructure improvement projects that have taken place recently in

Beijing are the construction of new subway lines and the development of the 2008 Olympic Park.

Four new subway lines were built between 2000 to 2009 (Lines No. 4, 5, 10 and 13), which cost

$50.3 billion RMB. The construction of the 2008 Olympic Park started in 2003 and was

completed in 2008, with the total investment of 20.5 billion RMB. The Olympic Park occupies

11.57 square kilometers and 73% of it is green space so it added a major green amenity to

Beijing.2 Figure One displays the locations of the Olympic Park and the four new subway lines.3



                                  **** Insert Figure One about here ****




2
  Carlino and Coulson (2004, 2006) use cross-city hedonic techniques to document that attracting a NFL team to a
city raises local housing prices. Our estimates of the impact of the Olympic Village on local home prices reflects
an analogous localized treatment. Unlike a sports stadium, the Olympic Village offers a bundle of increased
green space and access to new infrastructure for holding large capacity events.
3
    According to China Urban Construction Statistical Yearbook (2001-2009), there were three major local
infrastructure improvement projects which cost over 10 billion in Beijing: construction of new subway lines (50.3
billion), 2008 Olympic Park (20.5 billion) and Beijing Capital Airport Terminal 3 (25 billion). The Airport
Terminal 3 is far away from Beijing’s urban area. So we choose to study the first two key public investments in
Beijing.
These spatial investments were not chosen at random.4              To better understand the sitting process,

it is necessary to provide some details about Beijing’s governance structure.              The administrative

system has three levels: Beijing municipality, district and Jiedao (Jiedao is referred to as zone

thereafter in this paper). While the Beijing Administrative Area consists of eighteen districts,

both the municipal government and the public regard the inner eight districts (Dongcheng,

Xicheng, Chongwen, Xuanwu, Chaoyang, Haidian, Fengtai, Shijingshan) as the urbanized area or

“Beijing Metropolitan Area” (BMA), which is the spatial range we examine in this paper. BMA

has an area of 1368 square kilometers.5 Beijing is a monocentric city with key government

functions and cultural opportunities available at the City Center. The CBD (TianAnMen Square

and JianGuoMenWai Avenue) dominates the spatial distributions of population, land price and

home price (Zheng and Kahn, 2008). There are four ring roads in BMA from the inner to the outer

city—the second, third, fourth and fifth ring roads, respectively (See the bold circles in Figure

One). Within the BMA, 135 Jiedaos (zones) exist as the fundamental administrative organization

(the average size of each Jiedao is about 10 square kilometers).            Unlike the United States, which

has a highly decentralized public goods provision system, public infrastructure and services are

provided by the Beijing municipal government. Services such as transportation, education and

healthcare are provided at this level.       The Jiedao (zones) are only responsible for street cleaning,

distributing subsidies to low-income households and enforcing the “one-child” policy. Jiedao is

not responsible for infrastructure construction and public service provision. Therefore, the

locational choice of local public investments is a centralized decision made by the municipal

government. In this sense, the zone in this paper is like a U. S. census tract, which is a

geographical unit of analysis that allows for research and data collection but not a political actor

using tax revenue to provide public services.

       To investigate the motivations behind Beijing municipal government’s place based public

investment decisions, we searched old documents and media reports, as well as interviewed

relevant government officials. The Government chose to locate the 2008 Olympic Park outside of

and adjacent to the North 4th Ring Road6, close to the 1990 Asian Games Village which was



4
    Below, we will examine pre-treatment trends across the city.

    This media report offers an example: http://house.focus.cn/news/2000-03-23/4579.html
located inside of the North 4th Ring Road. The Asian Games Village area had developed into a city

subcenter with office buildings, shopping places and new residential communities before the

Olympic Park was built. The Government had a dual goal for this location decision. The first, of

course, was to ensure a successful Olympic Games.                The Government favored the place that

already had good existing infrastructure as well as a large green space. The existing sports

facilities built at the time of the 1990 Asian Games could also be taken advantage of. The second

goal was to further gentrify this area. The Zhongguancun (IT) subcenter is not far away. By

constructing the 2008 Olympic Park, the Government aimed to further gentrify this area to be a

larger subcenter with high-skilled industries and high quality of living.

     When deciding where to build the subway lines, the Government considered several factors.

The first was to mitigate current road congestion or to meet the anticipated ridership growth

(especially for the subway stops in and around the city core).7 The Beijing Municipal Government

regarded subway construction as basic infrastructure provision intended to nudge growth to the

previously under-developed areas. The history of urban development in Beijing left an important

urban form legacy—North Beijing where most of government branches, universities and schools

are located is more developed and richer than South Beijing.                       The Beijing Municipal

Government aims to promote the development in South Beijing by investing in more

infrastructure projects there and restructuring the industry mix.8 Building more subway lines there

is one of the key stimulus policies.9 New subway lines also extend to surrounding satellite towns

to support their development.



New Residential Construction in Beijing



     Over the last ten years in the Beijing Metropolitan Area (built-up area), 80 to 100 thousand

units of new commodity housing have been built each year. New housing units are constructed and

sold by real estate developers. A typical residential project developed by a developer always


7
  For instance, the Beijing Municipal Commission of Urban Planning recently declared that subway line 6 and line
7 will be constructed to cope with the ridership growth of subway line 1 and the road congestion around the
Beijing West Railway Station.

http://finance.ifeng.com/roll/20101215/3058359.shtml
contains a couple of towers and hundreds or even thousands of housing units.

       We study the spatial distribution of new housing construction using data on new commodity

housing sales in Beijing from the first quarter in 2006 through the fourth quarter in 2008. The unit

of observation in this dataset is a housing unit, with an average floor-area of 148 square meters.

There are altogether 1,596 projects and about 232 thousand units in our dataset. Table One

provides descriptive statistics. The price for such newly-built commodity housing is high and has

been surging for about seven years in Beijing. The total value of an average housing unit in our

sample is 1,442 thousand RMB (220 thousand USD), which is 21 times the average annual

household income in 2006 Beijing10.              The upper middle class and the wealthy (both Beijing

locals and the rich from other cities or aboard) tend to buy those new commodity housing units.

Therefore the construction of new commodity housing projects does provide evidence of

gentrification.

       This micro transaction dataset is not available to the public. We have a long-term

collaborative relationship with Beijing Municipal Housing Authority, which helps us to obtain this

valuable data set. We acknowledge that this time period is relatively short but we are unable to

extend it to earlier years, because the transaction data for the years before 2006 are in paper form.

We are not able to convert them into electronic form.          Our data set does cover the time period

when there was considerable new housing construction and the time period when the Olympic

Park and the new subways were being built.

       In this paper, the unit of analysis for the home price hedonic regressions is a housing unit,

while the unit of analysis for the quantity regressions is a zone. We geocoded all housing unit sales

on a Beijing GIS map. From the GIS map (Figure One) we can see that the majority of new

residential construction takes place between the third ring road and the fourth ring road. There is

little new construction inside the second ring road (the most inner ring road) where places are well

developed and the redevelopment cost is very high. There is also less new construction in the

places outside the fifth ring road since such remote locations are under-developed with short

supply of infrastructure and public services. We run a simple OLS regression of zone-level

development density (the units of new construction per square kilometer, in logarithm) on the

distance to CBD and its quadratic term, and find a clear reverse-U shape relationship:

10
     Data source: Beijing Statistical Yearbook 2007.
     Log(Development Density) = 2.064 + 0.123*D_CBD – 0.008*D_CBD2

                              (10.67***) (3.34***)          (-5.30***)               R2=0.059



The R square is relatively low, so there may be other spatial factors affecting the locations of new

residential development. This paper studies the determinants of new residential construction by

zone by quarter from 2006Q1 to 2008Q4.



The Beijing Residential Development Process



     Urban land is owned by the state. In practice, the local (city) land bureau is responsible for

the vast majority of allocations of land through auction sales of leasehold rights (70 years for

residential land use). After the year 2004, leaseholds are, in principle, all sold at public auction.

Henderson et. al. (2009) provide a detailed background of China’s urban land market and the

institutional arrangements of auction sales of leasehold rights. They find evidences showing that

corruption may exist in land auction process. Corruption is not the focus of our paper, but we test

if our data supports Henderson et. al. ’s argument.

     Developers incur costs through buying land leasehold right from local government and

constructing and operating the building. The costs of building materials and labor can be regarded

as constant across space within Beijing. We have a third geo-coded micro data set of recent

residential land auctions to recover the hedonic cost per unit of land throughout the city. Our land

data set includes 86 land parcels which were auctioned during 2005-2008. Figure Two shows the

distribution of these land parcels in Beijing Metropolitan Area.

     Once developers have purchased the land leasehold right, they engage in contracting the

design and construction work to design companies and builders. In principle, developers cannot

hold the vacant land in hand for longer than 2 years. But this “2-years rule” is sometimes violated

by developers without effective penalty. They can start to pre-sale the units when the progress of

on-site construction work reaches a certain threshold (in Beijing, only after the main structure is

completed the developer can start presale, about 90% or so of the construction).
Distinguishing Private Developers from State Owned Enterprise Developers



       The new residential towers are produced by SOEs and private developers in Chinese cities.

There are 577 private developers in our sample. The top ten biggest ones produce 17% of the total

units built by private developers. We investigate whether SOE (State owned enterprise) developers

and private developers respond to such public investment signals equally.

       In the commodity housing development sector, SOE developers and private developers

compete with each other. In our sample, there are altogether 833 real estate developers, 30.7% of

which are SOE developers. The average sale price and unit size of the units developed by SOE

developers is 10,039 RMB per square meter and 156 square meters, and the averages produced by

private developers are 10,233 RMB per square meter and 163 square meters. So they produce

similar products. The two developer groups also compete in land auctions, and they face the same

explicit labor costs and building material costs (for institutional background on land auction, see

the next section). However, SOE developers may be implicitly subsidized since they face less

uncertainty in forecasting future public infrastructure investment planning. They may also face

smaller bureaucratic and regulation costs, as well as financing costs if they can get cheaper loans

from SOE banks.11



The Empirical Framework and Results


       We have a three-fold empirical strategy.              First, we use hedonic techniques to examine

whether local infrastructure improvements are capitalized in residential property price and land

leasehold price (land price thereafter). At this step our unit of analysis is a residential property


11
     SOEs have some privileges to resources and finance. The existing four largest banks in China are all
state-owned. They are willing to lend their money to SOEs in various industries, including real estate development,
because the banks think the risks are low -- those SOEs are too big to fail (Deng et. al., 2010). SOE developers
also have close connections with the central or local governments (depending on it is a central SOE or a local
SOE). They may be able to obtain internal information on public investment plans for infrastructure or urban
planning details. They may also escape from being punished when violating the real estate development rules set
by the government. For instance, they may be able to hold their vacant land in hand for longer than 2 years which
violates the “2-years rule”, or increase the FAR limitation for a particular land parcel.
project by quarter or an auctioned land parcel.            Second, we estimate count level regression

models to study the spatial distribution of new housing supply. Based on a revealed preference

argument, these new housing unit count regressions establish which Beijing geographical areas are

attractive locations to real estate developers. The unit of analysis in this case is a zone.12         Third,

we use restaurant data to estimate count regressions. In a similar spirit as Waldfogel (2008), we

test whether restaurant counts increase in the vicinity of the new Olympic Village and new

subways.      To preview our results, we find that the new government infrastructure is capitalized

into sales prices. The count of new housing and new restaurants increases in a vicinity around the

new Olympic Village and new subways.




Home Price and Land Price Hedonics



     We estimate two sets of hedonic regressions. One set is home price hedonics and the other is

land price hedonics. We are especially interested in the capitalization effects of the new

infrastructure projects; namely the Olympic Park and the new subways (see Table A3 in the

Appendix for the event dates of the Olympic Park and new subway lines).



                                 **** Insert Table Two about here ****



The home price regressions are presented in Table Two. Each project has many housing units. The

sale of a project may last several quarters, and for each quarter, many housing units in that project

are sold. The unit of analysis is the average sale price for each project for each quarter. We include

zone fixed effects in the equation to control for the effects of existing public goods such as schools

and local green parks. In Column (1), we find a significant negative price gradient with respective

to the distance from CBD, and the size of this negative gradient (-0.019) is the same with that in

our earlier study (see Zheng and Kahn, 2008). In Column (2) we include the residential project’s

distance to the closest old subway stop. There are two old subway lines built prior to 2000 in


12
  We assume that each developer viewing himself as “small” takes these hedonic gradients as given and chooses
where and how much to construct.
Beijing, and the areas around these stops are well-developed business clusters. As expected, places

near old subway stops have higher home prices. We notice that after including the distance to old

subway stop, the CBD gradient variable becomes insignificant.                    These two distance measures

are highly correlated.

      In Column (3) we include the residential project’s distance to the 2008 Olympic Park and its

distance to the closest new subway stop. The latter distance has two versions: D_NEWSUB_S

refers to the start effect, while D_NEWSUB_C refers to the completion effect. The constructions

of the four new subway lines had already been started before our study period, so D_NEWSUB_S

is a static variable. D_NEWSUB_C is a dynamic variable—during our study period, when the

construction of a new subway line was completed, this variable changes thereafter13. Through this

way, we are able to test whether prices adjust before the infrastructure is put into use14. We find

that the construction start effect is quite significant and the size is large. Home price decreases by

0.6% when its distance to the closest new subway stop increases by 10%. This means that the

capitalization effect takes place immediately after the news of new subway line construction is

started. Since the construction of the 2008 Olympic Park took a relatively long time period, we

interact the log of this distance variable with a linear time trend variable to capture the gradually

increasing effect. This interaction term is also significantly negative, showing that home prices

near the Olympic Park have been growing. In Column (3) we substitute the subway start variable

(D_NEWSUB_S) with the completion variable (D_NEWSUB_C). The completion effect becomes

smaller.

      We recognize that we are attributing all of the post-treatment variation to the construction of

the Olympic Park and the new subways. To substantiate our claim, we construct a few control

groups.15     The Beijing municipal government has put forward a series of subway construction

strategy plans. According to these plans, 20 new lines will be built during 2000 to 2020 and the

total mileage will reach over 1,000 kilometers. In those strategy plans the exact locations and

13
   For instance, in 2006, a certain residential project’s D_SUB_C is the minimum value of all the distances from
this project to existing subway stops. After subway line 5 was completed in 2007, this distance variable will be
replaced by the minimum value of all the distances to existing stops plus line 5 stops. If this project is close to one
of the line 5 stops, this distance variable will decrease.
14
   We are unable to test the announcement effect separately because the announcements and starts of the four lines
were both before our study period.
15
   Greenstone, Hornbeck, and Moretti (2010) offer the most compelling case control study of the causal effects of
local investments. They compare the ex-post outcomes for areas that attracted an industrial production plant to
other areas who were the “runner up” in attracting the plant but lost.
construction dates of the proposed new subway lines are ambiguous. Till 2008, the four lines we

study had been constructed, and the locations of the other 2 lines had been announced (Line 6 and

Line 7), but the exact construction time of the latter 2 lines is uncertain. Therefore the 2 un-built

subway lines provide us a control group. We create a new distance variable (D_UNBUILT_SUBh)

measuring each residential project’s distance to the closest un-built subway stop. We find that for

the places where the government intends to build new subway lines, only those where the real

construction has been started experience home price appreciation. A possible explanation for this

insignificant announcement effect is that the Beijing municipal government does not have a clear

timetable for its subway construction strategy plan, and the proposed rough timetable is always

changing. Therefore even the subway line locations are announced, it is still uncertain concerning

when the lines will be built.

       In all of the regressions we control for whether the residential project is built by a SOE

developer. Holding other factors constant, SOE sell their commodity housing units at a price

discount but this discount is insignificant.



                                    **** Insert Table Three about here ****



       There are two auction types in China’s urban land auction market—listing ("two stage

auction") and bidding (regular English auction).16             In the land price hedonic regressions reported

in Table Three, the unit of analysis is a land parcel sale. Since the sample size is small, we are

unable to include zone fixed effects. We include the fixed effects of the land parcel’s physical

condition when it is auctioned (the connections to basic public infrastructure facilities, such as

water, road, electricity, etc. There is a ranking of four levels, so three dummies are included). In

Column (1) and (2), we find that the price gradient’s distance to CBD elasticity is much steeper

16
     Cai et. al. (2009) argue that in theory the latter type would most likely maximize sales revenue for “cold”
properties with fewer bidders. But listing auction is more corruptible, so city officials intend to divert hotter
properties to this form. They find the corruption evidence by comparing the “hotness” and prices of the land
parcels under these two auction forms. In our sample we compare the two groups’ average distances to CBD,
subway stops and the Olympic Park. We find that the listing land parcels do locate in better locations. Our land
price regressions also show that the listing land parcels are slightly cheaper than bidding ones though the effect is
insignificant.
than what we estimated in the housing price hedonic. Proximity to old subway stops is

capitalized into land prices.   In Column (3) we include the two new infrastructure improvement

variables. The Olympic Park variable is marginally significant but the new subway (start) variable

is insignificant. Recognizing that we do not know when market prices reflect information, in

column (4) we change the definition of the “new subway” indicator from the start measure to the

completion measure.     This variable’s coefficient is significantly negative. Land price decreases

by 1.4% when its distance to the closest subway stop increases by 10%. It seems that land prices

respond to public amenity investments more slowly than home prices. In Column (5) we also

include the control variable (D_UNBUILT_SUBl) and it is insignificant.       The construction of

new subway lines does trigger the appreciations of land prices and home prices nearby.      In all of

these regressions we control for SOE and auction type. SOE buy land leaseholds at slightly (but

not significantly) higher prices.



Gentrification Evidence Based on New Housing Construction



     We now test whether developers are building new housing near the new infrastructure sites.

Such new housing is expensive and is bought by the upper-middle class and the wealthy.

Therefore, by tracking where new commodity housing projects are developed we are able to

identify the gentrified areas with increasing purchasing power.

     Tables Four and Five reports the results of the quantity regression by zone/quarter.      Table

Four reports the results using OLS while Table Five reports the results using a negative binomial

count model. We control for quarter fixed effects, and standard errors are clustered by zone. We

include the distance to CBD (D_CBDz) and its interaction with linear time trend to test the

suburbanization effect. In Column (1) and (2) all residential property units are counted. Column (3)

and (4) only count the projects developed by SOE developers; while Column (5) and (6) count that

by non-SOE developers, to see if there are any differences between the development location

decisions by those two developer types. In Column (1), the two variables of new infrastructure

improvements (log(D_OLYPMICz)*TIME_Q, log(D_NEWSUB_Sz)) are both significant. In

Column (2) we substitute D_NEWSUB_Sz (start) with D_NEWSUB_Cz (completion), and the latter

has a larger effect and is more significant. So the construction activity response may lag the price
response to new infrastructure improvements. The above evidence supports the claim that the

public infrastructure is triggering a gentrification process as more new commodity housing

construction emerges near the Olympic Park and along the four new subway lines. If a zone's

distance to the closest new subway stop (construction completed) increases by 10%, the number

of sales in the zone drops by 4.3%. Little new residential construction takes place near old

subway stops, and the significantly negative interaction term of D_CBDz*TIME shows that as time

goes on, more and more new housing units are built further away from the city center.17 This may

be due to the fact that land is much scarcer and redevelopment cost is high around the city center

and the old subway stops. The control group variable’s coefficient (log(D_UNBUILT_SUBz)) is

also statistically insignificant.

      We divide the sales to SOE-developed ones and non-SOE-developed ones and run separate

quantity regressions. SOE developers respond to public infrastructure investments more

sensitively. The coefficient of the Olympic Park distance variable is larger for SOEs than that

for non-SOEs. The coefficient of new subway distance variable (completion) is significant for

SOEs but not for non-SOEs.            SOEs have an advantage of obtaining the internal information of

the exact locations of new infrastructure investments ahead of time due to their close relationships

with government bureaus, so they are able to respond to such new infrastructure investment

projects faster than their counterparts in the private sector.18

   We interact the distance from CBD variable with quadrant dummies to allow the distance gradient to vary
within Beijing.

   SOEs are likely to have an information advantage in deciding where they invest because of their “insider”
relationship with government bureaus. In theory the construction plan of such huge infrastructure projects
(timetable and exact sites) should be clearly listed in the master plan which should be released to the public. So it
should be a public knowledge. However, in this fast-growing economy, the urban development and redevelopment
activities are rapidly and intensively booming. The city government and its urban planners are unable to make a
long-term and clear infrastructure investment plan. It is possible that in some cases, SOE developers are able to
have better information or obtain the internal information earlier than private developers because the former group
may have closer connections with the local government.
Gentrification Evidence Based on Chain Restaurant Openings



New Restaurant Openings in Beijing



     We examine the spatial distribution of locally available restaurants (a typical type of local

private goods) and its change over time within Beijing. The restaurant industry provides a good

indicator of residential sorting and gentrification.   If more people are moving into an area and if

they are richer than the average person, then we will expect to see the count and quality of

restaurants to rise over time in the “treated” areas. Similar to Glaeser et. al.’s (2001) work on the

rise of the “Consumer City”, we envision the growth of “Consumer Neighborhoods” near the new

public infrastructure.

     Since no systematic data on restaurant cuisine and patronage exists in Beijing, we have to

construct our own indicators. We identify the restaurant chains that fit the preferences (taste,

service quality and price) of the upper-middle class and the wealthy who can afford new

commodity housing. We interviewed 20 representative households in 5 new commodity housing

communities to get a list of 33 chains they favor (11 western-cuisine ones and 22 Chinese-cuisine

ones, see Table A1 in the Appendix for a list of these chains). These chains account for 42.8% of

all restaurant chains operating in Beijing.     We used the most famous food guide and review

website www.dianping.com to collect the location and opening date information for all the 902

establishments of these 33 chains. We geocoded the locations and mapped them.           Figure Three

displays the data. The market for chain restaurants in Beijing has been growing quickly. There

were only 303 establishments by the end of 2005, but at the end of 2008 this number tripled. We

further compute the number of existing restaurants (as a stock variable) and new restaurants (as a

flow variable) by zone/year. The zone-level correlation coefficient of new restaurants and

newly-built commodity housing units sold is 0.21.

     Tables Six and Seven reports the results of the restaurant quantity regressions by zone/quarter.

Table Six reports the results using OLS while Table Seven reports the results using a negative

binomial count model.      Chain restaurant openings follow the same spatial patterns as that of

new commodity housing construction—more restaurants opened around the Olympic Park and
new subway stops. In Column (1), if a zone's distance from the closest new subway

stop (completion) increases by 10%, the annual number of chain restaurant openings in the zone

drops by 2.0%. In Column (2) this effect is even larger (2.4%) when we substitute the subway

completion variable with construction start variable, which supports our gentrification hypothesis.

We also find that new chain restaurants are opening near existing subway stops. In Column (3) we

include additional control variables and they are statistically insignificant. The interaction term of

D_CBD*TIME shows that chain restaurants are also suburbanizing.

Conclusion


     Government infrastructure projects can have dramatic effects on local real estate markets.

Whether the example is Boston’s Big Dig or the possibility of a Subway to the Sea in Los Angeles,

such major public projects have been shown to stimulate spatially targeted private investments.

This paper has documented that the same dynamic plays out in Beijing.

     As the city government invested in the Olympic Village and in new subways, local home

prices increased, developers increased their construction and more restaurants of higher quality

opened nearby.    All three of these pieces of evidence support the claim that government

investment and private sector investment are complements that work together to gentrify

previously under-developed areas.

     But, gentrification is not a “free lunch”. The urban poor are likely to be displaced from land

whose value has increased. We do observe that, at the places where infrastructure improvement

and new real estate development are taking place in Beijing, the homes of poor people, such as

rural migrants, are demolished and they are pushed further out to the remote suburban areas.

Those poor people do not leave Beijing because they can find jobs here, but they have to commute

longer distances from the city fringe to work places. To mitigate this problem, the Beijing

municipal government has built a limited number of public affordable housing projects near
suburban subway stops. But only the poor households with Beijing local hukou permits are

eligible to live in such subsidized public housing.

     We do not know if our results will generalize to smaller Chinese cities. Some mayors of

small cities in China have ambitions to build major infrastructure projects such as huge town

squares.   The causal effects of such investments are unclear.    Will such investments slow

out-migration or accelerate in migration?
