                                         ABSTRACT

We study the effect of recent legalization of recreational marijuana use (RMLs) in the United
States on Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income claiming,
proxied by new applications and new benedficiaries, over the period 2001 to 2019. We combine
administrative caseload data from the Social Security Administration with state policy changes
using two-way fixed effects regression. We find that RML adoption increases new disability
application rates. However, there is no change in new beneficiaries post-RML. We provide
suggestive evidence that the observed changes in applications post-RML are potentially driven by
increases in marijuana misuse and selective migration.

1       Introduction
Marijuana use has been prohibited under federal law in the United States since the Marijuana
Tax Act of 1937. Beginning in 2012, 12 U.S. states have adopted laws that legalize recre-
ational marijuana use among adults 21 years and older. These recent state laws reflect the
most progressive stance since federal prohibition in terms of an individual’s ability to legally
consume marijuana. In particular, RMLs surpass, in terms of providing legal protection
for marijuana use, earlier state-level policy changes related to marijuana decriminalization
(Pacula, Chriqui, & King, 2003) and legalization of the product for specific medical purposes
(Pacula, Powell, Heaton, & Sevigny, 2015). In addition, federal lawmakers are proposing to
decriminalize marijuana (e.g., the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement
[MORE] Act of 2019), which would mark a profound shift in U.S. drug policy.1
    Given that RML adoption by U.S. states is a relatively recent phenomena, few studies
have evaluated the effects of these policy changes. However, the early literature provides sug-
gestive evidence that these state laws increase marijuana use, both casual use and, perhaps
more troubling, problematic use (Kim et al., 2016; Cerdá et al., 2017; Miller, Rosenman, &
Cowan, 2017; Cerdá et al., 2019; Dragone, Prarolo, Vanin, & Zanella, 2019). A concern with
expanded marijuana use is that such use will lead to addiction and associated social ills.
    We explore the effects of recreational marijuana legalization on Social Security Disability
Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program claiming. SSDI and
SSI are social insurance programs that provide cash assistance to U.S. residents with work-
limiting disabilities. SSDI provides benefits to disabled workers. In 2017 this program
cost the U.S. $138B (Social Security Administration, 2018a). SSI is a means-tested welfare
program for low-income disabled or blind individuals with limited work history. In 2017, the
costs of SSI were $55B (Social Security Administration, 2018b). Beneficiaries are eligible for
public health insurance; Medicare for SSDI beneficiaries and Medicaid for SSI beneficiaries.
These two programs provide disability benefits to approximately 16M U.S. residents. While
costly, both programs offer income support and health insurance to individuals and their
families who become disabled and cannot work.

    Legalization of marijuana and/or reducing criminal penalties associated with possessing this product
is not unique to the U.S. and indeed reflects a trend among many, but certainly not all, countries. For
instance, Argentina legalized medical marijuana in 2017, recreational use of marijuana was legalized in
Canada in 2018, public possession of marijuana is a non-criminal offense punished through fines in Israel,
Mexico decriminalized possession of small quantities of marijuana in 2009 and a 2018 Supreme Court ruling
states that prohibiting marijuana cultivation for personal use is unconstitutional, and in 2020 there will be
a referendum on legalization of recreational marijuana use in New Zealand.



                                                     1
    Legalization of recreational marijuana may influence disability claiming through at least
two channels. Disability has become a substitute for paid employment among some individ-
uals who are marginally attached to the labor market (Autor & Duggan, 2006). For some
workers, legalization of recreational marijuana may alter the costs and benefits of claiming
disability, plausibly leading to a rise in such claims. For instance, recreational use of mari-
juana may reduce a worker’s marginal product through intoxication and health impairments.
Alternatively, recent work suggests that RMLs increase medical use of marijuana, displacing
standard medications used to manage symptoms related to pain, mental illness, and other
chronic and acute health conditions (Bradford & Bradford, 2016; Ozluk, 2017; Bradford &
Bradford, 2017; Bradford, Bradford, Abraham, & Adams, 2018; Bradford & Bradford, 2018;
Wen & Hockenberry, 2018). If marijuana allows for improved symptom management, claim-
ing should decrease. In line with improved symptom management, recent studies suggest
that work-capacity increases following a state medical marijuana law (MML) (Nicholas &
Maclean, 2019; Ghimire & Maclean, 2020). Finally, policies can induce individuals to mi-
grate to/from the adopting locality (Moffitt, 1992), which can change composition of treated
and untreated individuals and is therefore part of the policy effect. The impact of selective
migration on disability claiming is not obvious. Thus, the net effect of RMLs on disability
claiming is ex ante unclear. We provide the first evidence on this question.
    To study the effects of RML adoption on disability claiming, we combine administrative
caseload data maintained by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on new applications
and new beneficiaries (i.e., applications deemed legitimate by SSA examiners after a formal
review) with two-way fixed effects models over the period 2001 to 2019. To shed light on
mechanisms through which RML adoption may lead to changes in disability claiming, we
leverage data on reported marijuana use and admissions to substance use disorder (SUD)
treatment for which marijuana is listed as a contributing substance, and migration.


2     Data and methods
2.1    Claiming data
We draw administrative data on the number of processed claims from the SSA State Agency
Monthly Workload Data (SAMWD) 2001 to 2019. We focus on two disability flow variables:
new applications and new beneficiaries – applications that are determined to be meritorious
by SSA examiners. We consider three types of claims: SSDI and/or SSI (‘all’), SSDI,
including SSDI-only and concurrent SSI/SSDI claims (some individuals with particularly

                                              2
low earnings can qualify for both programs), which we refer to as (‘SSDI’), and SSI-only
(‘SSI’). Disabled children are eligible for SSI, but we remove these entries.
   We convert all and SSDI claiming variables to the rate per 10,000 non-elderly adults
(21-64 years) using population data from the U.S. Census and age-share information from
the Current Population Survey (CPS) (King et al., 2019) as SSDI is available to non-elderly
adults. For SSI claiming, we use the adult population (21 years+) as there is no upper age
limit on eligibility for this program. We choose 21 years as current RMLs do not allow legal
access to marijuana among younger individuals. We use the term ‘eligible adults’ for these
population variables. We aggregate the monthly-level data to the state-quarter-year level to
smooth out seasonality.2


2.2     RMLs
We use data on state RML effective dates collected by Chan, Burkhardt, and Flyr (2019)
and ProCon.org to capture states’ law environment, see Figure 1. We construct a variable
coded one in state/quarter-year pairs with an RML in place and coded zero in state/year
pairs when there is no RML. We code an RML as in place in the first full quarter in which
the law is effective.


2.3     Methods
We estimate the relationship between RMLs and disability claiming with the following two-
way fixed effects regression model:

                        Ds,p = β0 + β1 RM Ls,p−4 + Xs,p β2 + λs + γp + µs,p                              (1)

    Ds,t is a disability claiming rate variable in state s in period (quarter-year) p. RM Ls,p−4 is
an indicator for a state RML, we elect to lag the variable by one year (four quarters) to allow
time for the legal status to change, marijuana use to adjust, and finally for disability outcomes
to change. Xs,p is a vector of state-level characteristics that plausibly predict disability
claiming: indicators for an MML, a prescription drug monitoring program, a Medicaid Health
Insurance Flexibility and Accountability [HIFA] Waiver, the 2006 Massachusetts healthcare
reform, and Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion (Pacula et al., 2003; Atherly,
Dowd, Coulam, & Guy, 2012; Courtemanche, Marton, Ukert, Yelowitz, & Zapata, 2017;
   2
    We have also aggregated the data to the annual level to further remove seasonality and results (available
on request) are not appreciably different.

Wen & Hockenberry, 2018; Sabia & Nguyen, 2018),3 and demographics from the monthly
Current Population Survey (King et al., 2019). λs is a vector of state fixed effects and γt
is a vector of period fixed effects. We cluster standard errors around the state. We weight
regressions by the state eligible adult population.


3       Results
3.1     Summary statistics
Table 1 reports summary statistics for the full sample, and for states that pass and do
not pass an RML by the end of our study period. Summary statistics for the RML state
sample are reported for the period prior to RML adoption. In the full sample, the number
of all disability, SSDI, and SSI new applications per 10,000 eligible adults are 31.39, 22.71,
and 7.07. The corresponding rates for new beneficiaries are 7.53, 1.71, and 2.12. Claiming
rates are somewhat lower in RML states than in non-RML states. For instance, the overall
disability new application rate per 10,000 eligible adults is 28.84 in RML states and 32.60
non-RML states. An RML is in place in 3.5% of the state-period pairs.


3.2     Validity
A necessary assumption for the two-way fixed effects model to recover causal estimates is
that the treatment (i.e., states that passed an RML) and comparison (i.e., states that did
not pass an RML) group would have trended similarly in terms of outcomes (i.e., disability
claiming) had the treatment group not been treated; ‘parallel trends.’ While this assumption
is untestable as counterfactual trends for the treatment group are not observed, we estimate
an event-study to provide suggestive evidence.
    Tables 2 and 3 report event study results for new applications and new beneficiaries,
respectively. We note that a small number of lead variables rise to the level of statistical
significance, but overall adopting and non-adopting states appear to move broadly in parallel
pre-RML. We interpret these findings as providing suggestive evidence that our data can
satisfy parallel trends.
    3
    We incorporate MMLs adopted outside the range reported in Sabia and Nguyen (2018) using the ProCon
database (https://marijuana.procon.org/legal-recreational-marijuana-states-and-dc/; last accessed May 24,
2020). We use the Kaiser Family Foundation Medicaid expansion database to incorporate expansions that
occurred after those included in Courtemanche et al. (2017), see https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-
indicator/ (last accessed May 24, 2020)


                                                   4
3.3     Disability claiming
Table 4 reports our main findings. We observe that RML adoption leads to an increase in new
disability applications, but not new beneficiaries. In particular, following RML adoption,
all disability, SSDI, and SSI new applications per 10,000 eligible adults increase by 1.25,
0.75, and 0.44 per 10,000 eligible adults. The relative effect sizes (i.e., comparing coefficient
estimates to the baseline mean pre-RML in adopting states) are 4.3%, 3.7%, and 6.1%. We
observe no change in the number of new beneficiaries overall or for either program (SSDI or
SSI) individually post-RML.
    We also examine the importance of dispensaries, locations in which marijuana can be
purchased (Table 5). Results suggest that dispensaries are important for SSI claiming –
both new applications and new beneficiaries, but not overall or SSDI claiming.


3.4     Marijuana use
We expect that RMLs influence disability claiming through increased marijuana use. We
next explore this ‘first stage’ effect using the public use two-year average National Survey on
Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) (past 30-day and year use among adults) and the Treatment
Episodes Dataset (TEDS) (admissions to SUD treatment with any reported marijuana use).
NSDUH and TEDS data are available at the annual level. Results are listed in Tables 6 and
7 and show that marijuana use and admissions increase post-RML. For example, any past-
year marijuana use increases by two percentage points (23%) and the number of admissions
with marijuana listed as the primary substance per 10,000 adults increases by 1.85 (24%).4


3.5     Migration
We next examine the impact of RMLs on across-state migration using data from the CPS:
any migration, and migration to/from an RML state (Table 8). Results suggest that there
is no change in net migration post-RML, but migration to (from) an RML state increases
(decreases). These results suggest that some of our claiming results may be driven by changes
in RML state residents.5
  4
     In unreported results we observe no evidence of differential pre-trends between adopting and non-
adopting states across marijuana use and admissions variables. We estimate the effect of RMLs on ad-
missions to SUD treatment with no marijuana listed and do not observe changes in this outcome. This
finding suggests that we are not simply capturing a change in how admissions are recorded at treatment
admissions. All results are available on request.

     We observe no evidence of differential pre-trends between adopting and non-adopting states. Results
are available on request.


                                                   5
4    Robustness checking
We conduct sensitivity analysis to assess the stability of our findings. We include state-linear
time trends, use the contemporaneous RML, lag the RML by two years, remove population
weights, and and excludes states that have an MML but not an RML in place (Tables A1
and A2). We also conduct a ‘leave-one-out’ analysis in which we sequentially exclude each
RML state (Figures 2 and 3). Results are robust, although we note that we lose precision in
the application regressions when we remove the population weights.


5    Discussion
In this study we provide the first evidence on the effect of recent state RMLs on disability
claiming. These programs are costly to federal and state governments, but are valuable to
disabled individuals who are unable to work as they provide health insurance and income
support. Overall, we find that RMLs increase applications but have no observable impact on
beneficiaries (i.e., applications deemed suitable for benefits by SSA examiners). The effects
sizes for new applications are modest: following RML adoption all disability, SSDI, and SSI
applications increase by 4.3%, 3.7%, and 6.1%. One interpretation of our findings is that
applications increase post-RML, but the additional claims promoted by law passage are not
legitimate as determined by SSA case reviewers.
    We provide evidence of a first stage using survey and administrative data, and show
that marijuana use increases following RML adoption. Further, RMLs lead to changes
in migration patterns. But marijuana use and migration may be mechanisms for observed
changes in disability applications. Overall, our results suggest that any benefits from medical
use of marijuana post-RML (e.g., improved symptom management) are offset by the impact
of misuse and migration.
    Our findings add to the growing literature that evaluates the overall effects of expanded
access to marijuana through regulation. This literature documents that such expansions in
access lead to both benefits and costs. Our findings can be interpreted to imply a cost:
some workers, following RML adoption, attempt (but are not ultimately successful) to sub-
stitute labor market participation with disability. Policy makers should consider both when
establishing marijuana regulation. The optimal law likely varies across states based on state
demographics, underlying health status, labor market conditions, related policies and pro-
grams, and so forth.
