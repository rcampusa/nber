                                          ABSTRACT

Using value-added models, we find that high schools impact students' self-reported
socioemotional development (SED) by enhancing social well-being and promoting hard work.
Conditional on schools' test score impacts, schools that improve SED reduce school-based
arrests, and increase high-school completion, college-going, and college persistence. Schools that
improve social well-being have larger effects on attendance and behavioral infractions in high
school, while those that promote hard work have larger effects on GPA. Importantly, school SED
value-added is more predictive of school impacts on longer-run outcomes than school test-score
value-added. As such, for the longer-run outcomes, using both SED and test score value-added
more than doubles the variance of the explained school effect relative to using test score value-
added alone. Results suggest that adolescence can be a formative period for socioemotional
growth, high-school impacts on SED can be captured using self-report surveys, and SED can be
fostered by schools to improve longer-run outcomes. These findings are robust to tests for
plausible forms of selection.

I      Introduction
     Literature in economics, psychology, and sociology documents that socio-emotional skills and
mindsets, such as adaptability, grit, motivation, empathy, conflict resolution, problem-solving, and
teamwork are strongly related to education and adult outcomes (Farrington et al. 2012; Duckworth
et al. 2007; Dweck 2006; Lindqvist and Vestman 2011; Heckman and Rubinstein 2001; Borghans
et al. 2008; Waddell 2006 Kautz et al. 2014; Deming 2017). These skills and mindsets (also known
as soft or non-cognitive) are distinct from the numeracy and literacy skills emphasized in most
traditional education systems. In response to this growing knowledge base, many high schools
are training teachers to attend to socio-emotional development (SED) and incorporating socio-
emotional learning into their curriculums and self-report assessments.1
     But, can high schools influence self-reports of SED and does it matter for long-run outcomes?
Education policy and practice have preempted definitive evidence that SED can be meaningfully
shaped in high school. For example, while intervention research has demonstrated that some socio-
emotional factors are malleable, there is debate about whether and to what extent this is true for all
socio-emotional factors (Revelle 2007; Rimfeld et al. 2016; Cred´
                                                                e et al. 2017). Second, because
the self-report measures that are typically used to assess SED in schools are susceptible to response
biases, there is uncertainty regarding whether one can accurately measure impacts on these socio-
emotional skills in ways that are informative for policy (e.g., West et al. 2016; Dweck and Yeager
2019). Finally, because most research on soft skills reflect correlations between measures of soft
skills and long-run outcomes, evidence on the extent to which school-generated improvements on
these self-reported skills causally improve subsequent outcomes is limited.2
     To progress on these issues, we leverage a uniquely detailed data-set that links students to
schools with self-reported survey measures of SED over time. School value-added models seek to
identify schools' causal impacts on student outcomes by comparing end-of-year outcomes across
schools, while conditioning on lagged outcomes and other covariates. Using the SED measures
in a value-added framework, we (a) estimate schools' causal impacts on self-reported SED, (b)
establish the extent to which individual schools impact on SED (based on self-reports) persist over
time, (c) explore the relationships among school impacts on different measures of SED, and (d)
determine the extent to which attending a school that positively impacts self-reported SED leads to
    1 In2004, Illinois was the first state to develop SEL standards and performance indicators. Since then, at the
state level, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, Tennessee, and Wisconsin have all incorporated
measures of SEL into their curriculum (CASEL). There are also many individual school districts and charter school
networks in other states that have implemented SEL learning.
    2 While some studies find that interventions at the primary (Alan et al., 2019) and middle school levels (Cohen et al.

(2006) and Blackwell et al. (2007)) can improve soft skills and test scores in the short run, there is little evidence of
long-run impacts. One exception is Dee and Penner (2019) who examine an intervention of which SEL training was
a component. A meta-analysis of several growth mindset interventions, found small effects on academic achievement
that were not mediated by self-reports of growth mindset (Sisk et al. 2018).

improved outcomes in high school and greater longer-run educational attainment.
     School effects on SED cluster in two domains; promoting hard work and promoting social
well-being. Accordingly, we compute leave-year-out estimates of school value-added (Chetty et al.
2014; Jackson 2018) on a hard work index and a social well-being index, and also standardized
achievement tests. Using these leave-year-out estimates, we explore how attending a school that
increases SED in other years (i.e., a high SED value-added school) improves both short- and
longer-run outcomes. The standard deviation of estimated school effects on test scores and the
SED measures are similar (between 0.06 and 0.09 ), and these effects are all positively corre-
lated with each-other.3 However, conditional on test score value-added, high SED value-added
schools improve attendance, reduce disciplinary incidents, improve course grades, reduce the num-
ber of school-based arrests, increase high school graduation, increase four-year college going, and
increase college persistence. For this wide array of outcomes, using both SED and test score value-
added more than doubles the variance of the explained school effect relative to using test score
value-added alone. We can rule out most plausible sources of selection and we present several tests
(such as within-sibling comparisons) that support a causal interpretation of our results.
     We move beyond showing correlations between SED and long-run outcomes by documenting
a wide array of short- and medium-run outcomes that are impacted by attending a school that
causally improves SED. This work validates SED value-added as capturing school impacts on real
skills and traits (as opposed to reporting biases). The analysis presents an important early step in
our understanding of how schools may influence socio-emotional development of older adolescents,
how it can be measured, and how this can be useful for policy.

II     Data
     We use administrative data from Chicago Public Schools (CPS). CPS is a large urban school
district with 133 public (neighborhood /charter/ vocation/ magnet) high schools. CPS students
are primarily African American (42%) and Latino (44%), and from families with disadvantaged
economic backgrounds (86%). The main analysis data-set includes cohorts of 9th grade students
who attended a neighborhood, charter, or magnet high school between 2011 and 2017 (n=157,630).
When we examine longer-run outcomes, we focus on cohorts of 9th grade students between 2011
and 2014 (n=55,560) because these students are old enough to have attended college. Only first
time 9th graders are included to eliminate sample selection biases due to grade repetition.
     Measures. Our key variables are survey measures of SED4 : interpersonal skills, school con-
nectedness, academic engagement, grit, and study habits. Responses are collected by CPS on a
    3 These estimated magnitudes are in line with Loeb et al. (2018) and Fricke et al. (2019) who examine the variance

of school effects on SEL growth. These important papers do not examine impacts on other outcomes.
    4 These measures were developed by the UChicago Consortium on School Research.

survey administered to students in 2008-09, and then every year from 2010-11 onward. Survey
response rates were high on average (78%), however, nonresponse was higher for low-achievers
(see Appendix Table S2). Note that our analysis of impacts on longer run outcomes is based on all
students irrespective of survey completion. Each survey measure was comprised of several items
and students responded to each item using point scales to indicate agreement (e.g., 1=Strongly dis-
agree, to 4=Strongly agree). Rasch analysis was used to model responses and calculate a score for
each student on each construct (for measure properties for select years see Appendix Table S3).
    Two of the SED survey measures relate to one's relationship with others in the school. The
first of these is Interpersonal skills, which includes the following: I can always find a way to help
people end arguments. I listen carefully to what other people say to me. I'm good at working with
other students. I'm good at helping other people. The second such construct is School Connected-
ness which includes the following: I feel like a real part of my school. People here notice when I'm
good at something. Other students in my school take my opinions seriously. People at this school
are friendly to me. I'm included in lots of activities at school.
    The other three SED survey measures capture students' orientation toward hard work. The first
of these is Academic Effort, which includes: I always study for tests. I set aside time to do my
homework and study. I try to do well on my schoolwork even when it isn't interesting to me. If
I need to study, I don't go out with my friends. The second construct is the perseverance facet of
Grit which includes: I finish whatever I begin. I am a hard worker. I continue steadily towards my
goals. I don't give up easily. The third construct is Academic Engagement which includes: The
topics we are studying are interesting and challenging. I usually look forward to this class. I work
hard to do my best in this class. Sometimes I get so interested in my work I don't want to stop.
    We combine the social-related questions into a Social index and the hard-work-related questions
into a Work Hard index. The construction of these indices was informed by conceptual frameworks
for SEL. Appendix A shows that school effects on the individual survey constructs cluster into these
two broader categories so that this categorization, in addition to being theory-driven, is justified by
the data. To create each index we standardize each construct, compute the average of the included
measures, and then standardize the index to be mean zero unit variance.
    Test Scores: The "hard" skills measure in our data are standardized test scores.5 To allow for
comparability across grades, test scores were standardized to be mean zero unit variance within
grade and year among all CPS test takers. For each student we average the standardized math and
English scores, and then standardize the Test Score index to be mean zero unit variance.
    Our first longer run outcome is high school completion. About 79 percent of first time 9th
   5 6th through 8th grade CPS students took the ISAT prior to 2014 and the NWEA or the PARCC thereafter. 9th
graders took the EXPLORE assessments before 2014, and took the PARCC thereafter.

graders in CPS graduate high school. Our second key long run outcome is enrolling in college. Our
college data come from the National Student Clearinghouse and are merged with all CPS graduates.
We code a student as enrolling in college if they are observed in the NSC data within two years of
expected high school graduation (2010 through 2014 cohorts only). About 57 percent of first-time
9th graders enrolled in college. The data also include intermediate outcomes such as attendance,
course grades, and discipline outcomes. The data are summarized in Table 1.

III     Methods
    Our analysis involves two key steps. First, we aim to identify those schools that improve stu-
dents' SED and test scores. With this information in hand, we then estimate the effects of attending
schools that improve these measures. We discuss each step in turn.
Step 1: Identifying School Impacts on SED and Test Scores
    We use value-added models to estimate schools causal impacts on 9th -grade SED and test
scores. Our value-added model seeks to isolate the causal effects of individual schools on stu-
dent measure q  Q = {test scores, social well-being, hard work} by comparing measures at the
end of 9th grade to those of similar students (with the same incoming test scores, survey measures,
course grades, discipline, attendance, and demographics, all at the end of 8th grade) at other schools.
A school's value-added on a measure q captures how much that school increases that measure be-
tween 8th and 9th grade relative to the observed changes for similar students (based on the attributes
listed above) at other schools. Formally, we model the 9th grade measure q of student i who attends
school j with characteristics Zi jt in year t as below. Zi jt includes lagged measures (i.e. 8th and 7th
grade test scores, surveys, discipline, and attendance), gender, ethnicity, and free-lunch status, in
addition to the socio-economic status of the student census block proxied by average occupation
status and education levels. Our full model also includes school-level averages of all individual
lagged outcomes. For each measure q, to obtain estimates of the impacts of attending school j in
year t relative to the average school (i.e.,  VA                                               VA
                                              jt ,q ), we estimate (1) below, where i jt ,q =  j,q + i jt ,q .


                                            qi jt = q Zi jt + i jt ,q                                      (1)

The student-level residual from this regression is ui jt ,q . The average school-year level residuals
from this regression is our estimated impact on measure q of attending a school in a given year.
Where N jt is the number of students attending school j in year t , this is

will an be unbiased estimate of the value-added on school j in year t for measure q.
    When using value-added to predict outcomes for a particular cohort, we exclude data for that
same cohort when estimating value-added to avoid mechanical correlation. As in Jackson (2014),
these leave-year-out (or out-of-sample) predictions of school effectiveness are based on the value-
added for the same school in other years. If the value-added in year t + 1 were equally predictive
of outcomes in year t as those in t + 4 or any other year, then the best leave-year-out predictor
for a school would be the average value-added for that school in all other years. However, the
correlations in Appendix B show that estimates for more temporally proximate years are more
highly correlated with each-other. As such, following Chetty et al. (2014), to improve precision,
we allow greater weight to value-added from years close to the prediction year and less weight to
years that are farther away temporally. Our leave-year-out predictor for measure q in year t is

                                                             t -1

                                                                            ^ VA
                                                                              jm,q ]                                (3)
                                                            m=t -l


The vector of weights ^ q = (^ t -l ,q , ..., ^ t -1,q , ^ t +1,q , .., ^ t +l ,q ) are selected to minimize mean
squared forecast errors (Chetty et al., 2014). A school's predicted value-added on measure q is our
best prediction based on other years of how much that school will increase q measure between 8th
and 9th grade relative to the improvements of similar students at other schools. We use leave-year-
out predictions for all analyses, but for brevity, we refer to them simply as a school's value-added.
Step 2: Estimating Effect of Value-Added on Outcomes
    To quantify the effect of attending a school with one standard deviation higher predicted value-
added on outcomes, we regress each outcome on the standardized predicted value-added for the
                                                                                ^ jt ,q is the standardized
different indexes (plus controls). Specifically, where Yi jt is an outcome, and µ
out-of-sample predicted value added on measure q  Q = {test scores, social well-being, hard
work}, we estimate the following model by OLS.

                                      Yi jt =       ^ jt ,q + 1 Zi jt + t + i jt
                                                  q µ                                                               (4)
                                                qQ


All variables are as defined above and t is a year fixed-effect. Standard errors are adjusted for
clustering at the school level.6 In some models we report estimates using only a single value-added
   6 Note that individuals with missing 8th grade measures (i.e., surveys or test scores) are given imputed values based
on all other observed pre-treatment covariates. We regress each survey measure or test score on all observed pre-8th
grade covariates. We then obtain predicted 8th grade survey measures and test scores based on this regression. Those
with missing test scores or surveys in 8th grade are given this predicted value. Note that all results are similar when
missing values of 8th grade measures are not imputed.



                                                                6
predictor, while in others we include several at once. For each regression model, we compute the
variation in the outcome that can be explained by the included value-added estimates. Specifi-
                                                ^ = qQ 
cally, after estimating equation (4) we compute F        ^q µ
                                                            ^ jt ,q . This is the impact of attending
school j based on the linear relationship between the value-added estimates for that school j and
the outcome. Var(F ^ ) is therefore the variance of the predictable impact of schools based on the
value-added estimates. By comparing the explained variance in models that include only test score
value-added, only SED value added, and all the value-addeds, we can assess how much additional
predictive power there is in each value-added measure over the others.
   To take the estimated effect of value-added as reflecting schools' causal impacts requires that,
on average, there are no unobserved differences in the determinants of outcomes between students
that attend high- and low-value-added schools. To assess this, we estimate models like equation
(4) predicting each observed covariate (when no covariates are included as controls). We find no
discernible differences in the observed characteristics of those assigned to high and low value-added
schools for any skill measure (See Appendix C) ­ indicating that this condition is satisfied.

IV     The Impact of School Value-Added on SED and Test-Scores
   Here we establish that schools' SED value-addeds do, in fact, predict school impacts on SED.
The coefficients in the top panel of Table 2 represent the effect of attending a school with one-
standard deviation higher value-added (for each measure) on self-reported 9th grade social well-
being. For brevity, we will refer to social well-being value-added as social value-added. As ex-
pected, social value-added is highly predictive of school impacts on social well-being. Using only
social value-added, the coefficient of 0.0895 ( p-value<0.01) in column (1) indicates that attending
a school that has one standard deviation higher predicted social value-added (i.e., going from a
school at the 85th percentile of the social value-added distribution versus one at the median) would
improve social well-being by 8.9 percent of a standard deviation­ compelling evidence that schools
can, and do, impact reported social well-being and that these impacts are persistent over time.
   While work hard value-added predicts 9th grade social well-being when on its own, in models
that include both dimensions of SED value-added (column 4), work hard value-added has little
additional explanatory power. In column 3, we explore the extent to which school impacts on test
scores predict social well-being. In models with test score value-added only, the coefficient on test
score impacts is 0.0347. This is much smaller than the predictive power of the social well-being
value-added. In models that include test score value-added and both SED value-addeds (column 5),
test score value-added does have some independent explanatory power. However, relative to using
the SED value-addeds, adding test score value-added increases the explained variance by only 1.9
percent. That is, virtually all of the detectable variation in school impacts on self-reported social
well-being (using all three value-addeds) is captured by social value-added.

                                                 7
    We now turn to school impacts on the self-reported work hard dimension in middle panel of
Table 2. In models with work hard value-added only, attending a school that has one standard de-
viation higher work hard value-added improves self-reported work hard in 9th grade by 6.3 percent
of a standard deviation ( p-value<0.01). Models that use social value-added only are similar to
those that use work hard value-added only. In models that include school value-added on both SED
measures simultaneously, the coefficient on work hard is the largest (0.0456) but that for social
well-being is statistically significant (0.025). Relative to work hard value- added alone, adding so-
cial value-added increases the explained variance by a modest 8.9 percent. In models with test score
value-added only (column 3), the coefficient on test score value-added is 0.0276 ( p-value<0.01).
This is much smaller than the predictive power of work hard value-added. In models including all
three value-added measures (column 5), test score value-added has little independent explanatory
power. Indeed, relative to using the SED value-addeds, adding test score value-added increases the
explained variance by only 1.7 percent. In sum, the best predictor of a school's impact on work
hard is school value-added on work hard ­ social well-being value-added has a small amount of
independent predictive power for impacts on the work hard dimension, while test score value-added
has no independent predictive power.
    We also conduct similar analyses for 9th -grade test scores (lower panel of Table 2). In models
that use test score value-added only (column 3), attending a school with one standard deviation
higher predicted test score value-added increase 9th -grade test scores by 6.27 percent of a standard
deviation ( p-value<0.01).7 Interestingly, value-added on SED measures are almost as good pre-
dictors of impacts on test scores as test score value-added. In models with both the SED and test
score value-addeds, each measure independently predicts test scores in 9th grade. Relative to using
test score value-added only, adding the SED value-addeds increase the explained variance by 42
percent. This stands in stark contrast to the pattern for SED measures­ where the vast majority of
a schools effect on SED is captured by the SED value-addeds. Remarkably, value-added on SED
contains considerable independent explanatory power in explaining school impacts on test scores ­
suggesting that SED may be foundational for academic success. We now explore how independent
variation in SED value-added matters for other outcomes that may mediate long-run impacts.

V      Impacts on Potentially Mediating Outcomes
    On Track: The first other outcome we explore is an "on track" indicator. This indicator identifies
students as on-track if they earn at least five full-year course credits and no more than one semester
F in a core course in their first year of high school. Students who are on-track in Chicago at the
end of 9th grade are more than three times more likely to graduate high school in four years than
    7 Theseestimates are in line with Jackson (2013) that finds that the standard deviations of school effects in North
Carolina are about 9 and 6 percent of a student standard deviation for math and English, respectively.


                                                          8
off-track students. Importantly this is a more accurate predictor of graduation than achievement
test scores or background characteristics (Allensworth and Easton, 2005). We report the estimated
impacts of school value-added in Table 3. Using each of the value-added measures individually,
(columns 1 through 3) each value-added measure individually predicts being on-track. However,
the estimated effects are larger for the SED measures. Specifically, attending a school with one
standard deviation higher social value-added leads to a 1.9 percentage point increase in the likeli-
hood of being on track ( p-value<0.01), that for work-hard value-added is 2.07 percentage points
( p-value<0.01), and that for test score value-added is 1.26 percentage points ( p-value<0.01). Rel-
ative to a model with test score value-added only, the explained variance using both test score and
SED value-added is about 5 times lager ­ indicating that (a) much of what schools may do to keep
students on track to graduate high school is largely unmeasured by impacts on standardized tests,
and (b) school impacts on self-reported survey measures capture much more of a school's impact
on staying on track than impacts on test scores.
   Course Grades: The second panel of Table 3 reports impacts on 9th grade GPA. In models with
the individual value-addeds, the coefficients on social value-added is 0.0335 ( p-value<0.1), that
on work hard value-added is 0.0446 ( p-value<0.05), and that for test score value-added is 0.0206
( p-value<0.05). The work hard dimension is more predictive of GPA than the social well-being
dimension. In models that include all value-added measures simultaneously, none is statistically
significant. However, the explained variance in the model with all three measures is 5 times as
large as the test score value-added model, and 1.5 times as large as the models using only the SED
value-added ­ reinforcing the importance of having measures of school impacts beyond test scores.
   Attendance: Impacts on 9th grade absences are in the third panel of Table 3. The point estimates
in column (1) through (3) indicate that each value-added measure individually predicts better at-
tendance in 9th grade. However, social value-added explains more variance than the other two.
A one standard deviation increase in test score value-added leads to 0.674 fewer absences. By
comparison, a one standard deviation increase in social value-added reduces absences by 1.23 days
(about twice as large) ­ an effect size of roughly 0.06 or an 8.2 percent reduction compared to the
average. Relative to the test score value-added only model, adding the SED value-addeds increases
the explained variance by a factor of roughly 3. The fact that social well-being value-added is the
most predictive of reduced absences suggests that more well-adjusted students, who feel a greater
sense of belonging, are more likely to attend school (see Walton and Brady 2017 for a review of
belonging research in academic contexts).
   Discipline: Next we examine impacts on the number of disciplinary incidents. Most disci-
plinary incidents occur in grades 9 and 10, so we focus on 9th grade. The fourth panel of Table 3
reveals that social well-being value-added and test score value-added predict fewer incidents, while
work hard value added does not. A one standard deviation increase in social value-added reduces

                                                   9
the number of incidents by 0.009 compared to only 0.0064 for test score value-added. The ratio of
the explained variance using all three value-added measures to the variance explained using social
value-added alone or test score value-added alone is 1.3 and 2.1, respectively. Consistent with this,
in the combined model, only social value-added predicts impacts on the number of incidents.
   School-Based Arrests: A key medium-run outcome that we examine is having a school-related
arrest among those who are old enough to have graduated high school (bottom panel of Table
3). These are arrests for any activities conducted on school grounds, during off-campus school
activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by a school official
(link). During our sample period 4.1 percent of all students had a school-based arrests, 5.3 percent
of males, and 7.9 percent of African American males. While disciplinary outcomes are correlated
with being arrested ( = 0.325) one is not a very strong predictor of the other, and the long-term
implications are very different. Indeed, roughly 20 percent of juvenile arrests in 2010 were school-
based arrests (Kaba and Edwards, 2012), so that these have important long-term implications.
   In models with each value-added individually, increasing social value-added reduces the like-
lihood of an arrest by 0.65 percentage points ( p-value<0.01), increasing work hard value-added
reduces the likelihood of an arrest by 0.746 percentage points ( p-value<0.01) and increasing test-
score value-added reduces the likelihood of an arrest by 0.451 percentage points ( p-value<0.01).
The SED value-added measures have greater predictive power than test score value-added. The
ratio of the explained variance using all three value-addeds relative to using test score value-added
alone is 2.76 ­ indicating that one can capture more than twice the variability in school impacts on
arrests using the test score and SED value-addeds together than using test score value-added alone.
Using all three, the standard deviation of the predicted school effect is 0.8 of a percentage point.
Compared to the average, this represents a relative risk decrease of about twenty percent. Note
that because these value-addeds make students more likely to remain in school (shown below), the
documented reductions in school-based arrest rates are a lower bound. Looking among the two
SED measures, work hard value-added has the strongest predictive power, but not greatly so.
   In sum, schools that raise test scores are not always those that improve SED and vice versa.
Schools' SED value-addeds are stronger predictors of impacts on all outcomes (excluding test
scores) than test score value-added. Among the SED dimensions, some schools improve social
well-being, while others promote working hard. Consistent with them impacting two different
socio-emotional dimensions, work hard value-added is a stronger predictor of the academic out-
comes (such as on-track and GPA), while social value-added is more predictive of impacts on non-
academic behaviours (such as attendance and disciplinary incidents). Value-added on both SED di-
mensions are much more predictive of effects on school-based arrests than test score value-added.
Because school-based arrests likely have important longer-run implications beyond academic out-
comes, these results underscore the importance of evaluating schools effects on non-academic out-

                                                 10
comes (Beuermann et al., 2018).

VI     Predicting Educational Attainment Outcomes
   We report impacts on longer-run educational attainment outcomes in Table 4. In models that
include a single value-added measure at a time, a one standard deviation increase in test score
value-added (i.e., going from an average school to one at the 85th percentile of the effectiveness
distribution) increases the likelihood of high school graduation by about 1 percentage point (column
3), that for social value-added is 1.47 percentage points (column 1), and that for hard work value-
added is largest at 1.57 percentage points (column 2). The variance of school impacts on high
school graduation explained by work hard value-added is 87 percent larger than that explained
using test score value-added. In the model with all three value-added measures (column 5), the
standard deviation of the predicted school impacts is 0.0185. Using the SED value-added increases
the explained variance by over 160 percent relative to using test score value-added alone. Because
much of the predictable school impacts on high school completion are captured by the surveys,
using the test score value-added increases the explained variance by only 38 percent relative to
using work hard value-added alone, and by only 25 percent using only the two SED value-addeds.
   The second panel of Table 4 reports the impact on enrolling in college within 2 years of expected
high-school graduation. In models that include a single value-added measure, a one standard devi-
ation increase in test score value-added increases college-going by 1.36 percentage points, that for
social value-added is 1.53 percentage points, and that for hard work value-added is 1.92 percentage
points. If one uses all three value-added measures, the standard deviation of the predicted school
impacts is 2.2 percentage points. Using the SED value-addeds increases the explained variance
by 113 percent relative to using test score value-added alone. In contrast, using the test-score and
SED value-addeds increases the explained variance by only 34 percent relative to using work hard
value-added alone, and by 30 percent using only the two SED value addeds. In sum, relative to
using test score value-added, the SED value addeds increases our ability to identify school impacts
on longer-run outcomes considerably. We summarize the magnitude of the predicted school effect
using the different value-addeds and using all three visually in Figure 1.
   To delve deeper into the college results, we explore impacts on attending a 2-year or a 4-year
college. We find no effects on 2-year college going (not shown). In contrast, we find large ef-
fects on four-year college going (third panel of Table 4). In the single value-added models, a one
standard deviation increase in test score value-added increases 4-year college going by 1.83 per-
centage points, that for social value-added is larger at 2.67 percentage points, and that for work
hard value-added is largest at 3.13 percentage points. A one standard deviation increased in pre-
dicted school impacts (based on all three value-added measures) would increase four-year college
going by 3.48 percentage points. Using the SED value-addeds increases the explained variance by

                                                 11
over 180 percent relative to using test score value-added alone. In contrast, using all three mea-
sures versus using the SED value-addeds increases the explained variance by only 18 percent ­
reinforcing the relative importance of school impacts on socio-emotional development. The fact
that the impacts on four-year college going are larger than those for high school completion shows
that the college-going effect is not driven entirely by increased high school completion. Indeed,
if all of the high school graduation effect lead to increased college-going, then it could explain at
most 0.0185/0.0222 = 83% of the overall college-going effect and 0.0185/0.0348 = 53% of the
four-year college going effect. This suggests that much of the increased college going is due to
students who would have graduated high school being more likely to attend college.
   Finally, the results in the bottom panel show estimated impacts on persisting in college beyond
the first year. Each of the value-added estimates predict positive impacts on college persistence (i.e.,
being observed in a second year of college). The standard deviation of the predicted school impacts
(using value-added on all three measures) on persistence is 1.7 percentage points. The same figure
for college going is 2.2 percentage points, suggesting a persistence rate of roughly 1.7/2.2=0.77.
This suggests that about 77 percent of the effects on college going remains one year after col-
lege entry. Given average persistence rates of about 72 nationally, these impacts suggest that the
marginal college goers have one-year persistence rates that are similar to the average student.

Additional Testing For Selection
   We have demonstrated that there is no selection to schools on observables. To show that our re-
sults are not driven by selection in unobserved dimensions we implement two additional tests (see
Appendix C). First we show that students whose homes are zoned for schools with higher SED
value-added attend schools with higher value-added and have better outcomes. Specifically, in a
two-stage least squares (2SLS) framework using the value-added of the residentially zoned high
school as an instrument for the value-added of the attended high school, we find similar effects
of SED value-added on outcomes as the OLS estimates. This shows that our result are not driven
by better students (in unobserved dimensions) selecting to better schools outside their attendance
zones. Second, to rule out that the 2SLS results are driven by better families selecting to better
neighborhoods, we show that our results are similar (albeit less precise) even when making com-
parisons among the subset of siblings that we can identify in our data. The 2SLS model is robust to
selection within families, while the siblings model is robust to selection across families. As such,
while none of these tests is dispositive in isolation, together they are compelling evidence that our
estimated school impacts on SED and the main results reflect true causal impacts.

VII      Discussion and Conclusions
   We identify persistent school impacts on two distinct dimensions, promoting social well-being
and hard work, indicating that surveys can be used to reliably measure SED (net reporting biases)
and that schools can foster SED beyond elementary school. This is the first paper to validate
school impacts on SED out-of-sample, provide evidence that the estimates are causal, document
potentially instrumental mediating outcomes (e.g., attendance, GPA), and show that both crime and
longer-run educational attainment outcomes are influenced by attending a high school that improves
SED. Moving beyond correlational evidence, this is the first paper to link schools' causal impacts
on self-reported SED to longer-run outcomes. Our finding that school impacts on SED have larger
effects on short- and long-run outcomes than schools' test score impacts has important implications
for how policy-makers measure school quality. The analysis presents an important early step in our
understanding of how schools may influence socio-emotional development. To better inform policy,
further investigation is needed into what school practices, policies, and conditions tend to promote
SED, and how those may differ from those that promote test score growth.

      Notes: Results are based on regression of 9th grade measures on out-of-sample Social, Work hard, and Test Score Value Added. All models
include individual demographic controls (race/ethnicity, free and reduced price lunch, and gender), 8th grade lags (math and ELA test scores, survey
measures, absences, and discipline), and school-level averages for the all demographics and lagged measures, as well as year fixed effects. Missing
8th grade measures were imputed using 7th grade measures and demographic characteristics. Sample size varies by outcome due to missingness.
Results do not change if we restrict results to a balanced sample.

Notes: For each model, we take the fitted values based only on the value-added estimates as the predicable portion
of school impacts on each outcome. We then compute the standard deviation of this predicable variation under each
model. Note that because the school value-addeds are standardized to be unit variance across all schools (as opposed
to across all students in the regression samples) the standard deviations of the predicted effects are not exactly equal to
the reported effects of increasing value-added by one standard deviation.

          Notes. All measures are anchored to 2010-11 step and item difficulties. Infit and outfit measures greater than 1 indicate underfit to the Rasch model and values
     lower than 1 indicate overfit. Generally, infit and outfit values in the range of 0.6-1.4 are considered reasonable for survey measures. Reliability represents individual
     reliability and includes extreme people. The patterns are very similar for years 2013 through 2018.

A     Correlations Across Measures
    Given that we have school impacts on several skill measures, it if helpful to see if they are
related to each-other. To explore this, we report the correlations between the school impacts on
the various skill measures in 9th grade. These are reported in the lower panel of Table S4. The
estimated school impacts (across the 133 schools) are all positive. That is, schools that improve
one skill measure tend to improve the others. While all the correlations are positive, some variable
are more closely related to others. For example, the correlation between math test score impacts
and English test score impacts is 0.657. This is consistent with other studies. Interestingly, the
correlation between test score impacts and impacts on the SED measures are reasonably large. The
correlation between math value-added and the value-added on the individual surveys constructs
are between 0.31 and 0.46. The correlations are similar for school impacts on English scores and
the various surveys. To explore the extent to which schools tend to cluster in their impacts, we
also conduct exploratory factor analysis. The factor ladings are reported in Table S5. The factors
models suggests three distinct underlying factors. The first factor is most strongly related to the
two test score impacts. the second factor is most strongly related to the survey measures relating
to academic motivation and effort (grit, study habits, and academic engagement). The third factor
is most strongly related to the two survey measures that relate to social well being (belonging, and
social skills). While there is not complete separation of variables in the model, it clearly identified
three district dimensions of school output.
    Based on these results, we create a social index by combining the two social survey questions,
we create a hard working index by combining the academic engagement questions, and we create
a test score index by combining the two test scores. We also create a an overall survey index that
combines all the survey questions. To create each index we (1) standardize each measure, then we
(2) compute the arithmetic mean across the included measures, and (3) standardize the combined
index to be mean zero unit variance. The correlations across school impacts on the indexes are in
the lower rows on Table S4. The two survey dimensions are highly correlated, but not perfectly
so. The correlations between school impacts on the social index and the hard work index is 0.6.
As we will show below, while there is much shared variation, there is explanatory power in the
independent variation in each index. The correlation between school impacts on test scores and
impacts on the summary survey indexes are about 0.47. This suggests that any single index could
likely predict improved outcomes in an average sense. However, the policy relevant question is
whether the school impacts on surveys can provide additional information, and the extent to which
school impacts on self-reported survey measures reflect improvement in crease skills.

B     Stability of School Effects Over Time
    The first test of whether schools have systematic impacts on survey measures is whether school
impacts in one year are correlated with impacts in other years. As pointed out in Jackson (2014)
in the presence of transitory shocks, standard analysis of variance may lead one to conclude that
schools have systematic impacts when in fact they do not. As such, an alternate approach is to
explore the extent to which school value-added is persistent over time. The basic logic is that if a
school is able to systematically improve students' SED, it should be able to do so in multiple years.
To test this, for each of the SED or test score measures in 9th grade, we computed our annual
value-added estimates from (4) and correlated them for the same schools over time. We report the
correlations between a school's value-added in year t and in years t + 1 through t + 5 in the top
panel of Table S4.
    We start with the test score impacts. Looking at math scores, the correlation between a schools
impact in adjacent years (i.e., years t and t + 1) on math scores is 0.43. Specifically, a school that
is above average at raising math scores in one year is likely to be above average in the following
year. However, the relationship is far from one-for-one. Specifically, a school that was at the
98th percentile of math score value-added in one year, would be expect to be at the 81th percentile
the following year. Looking at relationships two years apart, the correlation falls to 0.281. This
means that a school that was at the 98th percentile of math score value-added in one year, would be
expect to be around the 70th percentile two years later. Looking at more than three years out, the
correlation stabilizes at around 0.12. This suggests that a school that was at the 98th percentile of
math score value-added in one year, would be expect to be around the 61st percentile three to five
years later. This is clear evidence that school impacts do persist over time, but that the extent of the
persistence is modest. It is important to note that school value-added is estimated with error so that
these correlations are a lower bound on what we would observe if school impacts were perfectly
measured (i.e., with no errors).
    The basic pattern of persistent effects that are stronger for adjacent years is observed for all the
SED and test score measures. For grit, the one-year correlation is 0.265. This persistence level
is smaller than that for math, suggesting that school impacts on grit are nosier than those in math
test scores. This one-year correlation is similar for the other survey measures other than school
connectedness (which has a correlation of 0.433). To put these correlations into perspective, a
correlation of 0.265 implies that a school that was at the 98th percentile of grit, effort, academic
engagement, or social skills value-added in one year, would be expect to be at the 70th percentile
the following later. As with the test score impacts, the persistence is lower with greater temporal
distance. For all the survey measures, the correlation between impacts in year t and year t + 3 is
about 0.12. This implies that a school that was at the 98th percentile of value-added for any of the


                                                  27
survey measures in one year, would be expect to be at the 60th percentile three later. While these
persistence effects are modest, they are statistically significantly different from zero ­ compelling
evidence that schools do have systematic impacts on self-reported measures of socio-emotional
development.
   In sum, the results indicate that (a) both SED and test-score value-added in one year is predictive
of value added in the next, and (b) value added estimates for temporally close years will be a better
predictor of value added than years that are temporally distant. In essence, this reveals that school
value added (on both test scores and SED) has some persistence over time but does exhibit some
"drift". We will exploit this fact when predicting a schools impact on hard or soft skills based on
impact on other years.




                                                 28
C     Testing For Selection
    Because students are not randomly assigned to schools, there is a concern that our estimated
value-addeds are related to unobserved predictors of outcomes so that our estimates are biased.
While there is no way to prove that the value-addeds of the attended schools are unrelated to unob-
served determinants of outcomes, we present several test to show that this is likely satisfied in our
setting.

No Selection on Observables
    First, to show that our school SED value-addeds are not biased, we show that they are unrelated
to observed determinants of student outcomes. That is, similar to a test for random assignment, we
show that there is balance of covariates between high and low value-added schools. To show this,
we estimate the following model by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).

                                     Zi jt =      ^ jt ,q + t + i jt
                                                q µ                                                 (5)
                                               qQ


The parameter estimates of q provide a test of whether the observed covariate (Zi jt ) is correlated
with the value-added on dimension q. If strong observable predictors of the outcomes are unrelated
to our school value-added estimates (i.e. q = 0 for all covariates), then it is plausible that unobserv-
able predictors are also unrelated to our value-added estimates so that our estimates are unbiased.
We show evidence of this empirically in Table S1. If our estimated school value-addeds were
correlated with student characteristics, then the coefficient on the value-added predictors would
be significantly different from zero. We estimate this model with all three predictors across 33
pre-treatment student characteristics ­ resulting in 99 estimates. None of these point estimates is
statistically significant at the 5 percent level. Remarkably, this is also true across the 99 models
that have each value-added dimension individually ­ indicating no selection on observables. While
this evidence supports a causal interpretation of our estimates, we also present tests of selection in
unobserved dimensions below.

Attendance Boundary Instruments
    Even though we show no evidence of selection on observables, one may worry about selection
on unobservables. To address this, we construct instruments that remove the sorting bias that may
exists when individuals chose to attend a school outside their zoned area. In Chicago, almost two-
thirds of children attend schools other than their zoned school (Hing and Jenniver), so that this is a
potential concern. To show that this does not bias our results, we propose an instrumental variables
approach that instruments for the value-added of the school attended with the value-added of the
residentialy assigned school. This approach eliminates all selection to non-zoned school that could


                                                    29
have led to bias.
    The first stage regressions are strong for all value-addeds ­ yielding first stage F-statistics above
20. The two-stage-least-squares (2SLS) regressions are reported in Table S6. Looking at work
hard value-added (middle panel), a comparison of columns 1 and 2 reveals that the OLS and 2SLS
models for work hard in 9th grade are similar and not statistically distinguishable from one-another.
Looking at columns 4 and 5, and then 7 and 8, reveals that the OLS and 2SLS models of work hard
value-added are also very similar for high school completion and college-going. Owing to much
larger standard errors in the IV model, the point estimate on college-going is not significant, but
it is very similar to the OLS estimate. Note however that the effect on high school graduation is
significant at the five percent level in both the OLS the 2SLS models. The lower panel present a
very similar pattern for social well-being value-added.8 In sum, our SED value-added measures do
not appear to be biased by selection on unobservables. These 2SLS estimates will only be biased if
those families that attend the zoned schools tend to self-select into neighborhoods along unobserved
dimensions that are correlated with school value-added. We address this possibility.

Sibling Comparisons
    To account for the possibility that families may select into neighborhoods in ways that would
lead to bias in our 2SLS approach, we also estimate models that rely on within family comparisons.
For a small subset of the data we are able to identify siblings. That is, we can identify siblings in
the data after 2015. As such, for families that have more than one sibling who were in CPS after
2015 we can make within-family comparisons. We were able to identify 11,640 families in which
more than one sibling is observed in 9th grade. Of these that have multiple children old enough
to have graduated from high school we have 3352 such families. For those old enough to have
enrolled in college, this number falls to 1393 families. Because we cannot identify all siblings
prior to 2015, these data are imperfect and incomplete. However, if we are able to find similar
effects in this small sub-sample as in the broader sample, it would be compelling evidence that
our estimates are not biased by family selection to neighborhoods. We can remove any correlation
with potentially confounding family characteristics by comparing students from the same family
who attended different schools. This is achieved by adding a family fixed effect to our main model
in equation (4). The within-family estimates are presented in Table S6. The sibling models are
presented in columns (3), (6) and (9). As one can see, in the lower two panels, the estimated
impacts of SED value-added are robust to the inclusion of the family fixed effects. That is, while the
standard errors are much larger in the family fixed effects models, the point estimates for impacts
on both work hard and social well-being value added on high school completion and college going

consistent across specification. However, test score value-added is not the focus of our study.

are very similar to the OLS models.9 This indicates that selection of families does not drive the
estimates.
    Taken together, we show that (a) our value-added estimates are unrelated to all observed covari-
ates, (b) our estimates are not driven by selection to schools outside one's attended zone, and (c)
our estimates are not biased by certain kinds of families sending their children to different schools.
If our results were driven by selection to schools across families, it would bias our IV results but
not our sibling results. If our results were driven by selection to schools within families, it would
bias our sibling results but not our 2SLS results. If there were selection (either within or across
families) one would expect that strong predictors of outcomes would be related to our estimated
value-added­ but this is not the case. While none of these tests is dispositive in isolation, together
they are compelling evidence that our estimated school impacts, and the main results, reflect true
causal impacts and are not driven by any selection bias.
