        The Level and Distribution of Economic Well—Being



                           ABSTRACT




     This paper summarizes and critically evaluates what is known

about postwar trends in both the level and distribution of economic

well—being. Although certain non—income aspects of well—being

are considered, the primary focus is on the level and inequality of

income. Considerable attention is paid to recent controversies

over the effects of transfers in kind and changing life—cycle income

patterns on the overall trend in income inequality.

I.   Introduction and Preview

      The ultimate purpose of an economy, it may fairly be
said, is to enhance the material well-being of its people.

In the philosophical pecking order, such a crass and narrow

..goal may not appear as lofty as, let us say, inner peace
and spiritual uplift. But, as has oft been remarked, it
is difficult to feed the soul while the stomach is empty.

      Because of the absolutely central position of the task
of producing more and better goods, and distributing them
equitably (what a loaded word that is!) among the citizenry,
the topics of the other chapters in this book may justifiably

be considered subservient to this one. Changes in the financial
system, in taxation and public expenditure, in the structure

of industry, in international economic relations, and so on,

are all most naturally appraised by asking how much they
contribute to economic well-being. Thus this chapter may,
without stretching the imagination too far, be thought of

as the ttoutputsti produced by the other chapters' "inputs."
At least this is the preeminence I claim for my topic.
      How well has the U.S. economy performed the two central

tasks of raising living standards and enhancing economic

equality during the postwar period: The basic story is
                                                           2.



simple enough to summarize in a few words, though complex
enough to require volumes for a complete account. Where
the average leve. of economic well-being is concerned, the
record is one of steady ioveme            Not an unblemished
record to be sure, and not as spectacular a record as the

postwar "economic miracles" of Germany and Japan, but a
creditable record nonetheless.

      However, when we turn to consider the J.sibution
of economic welfare--economic equality, as it is commonly

called--the central stylized fact is one of constaçy. As
measured in the official data, income inequality was just
about the same in 1977 (the last year for which data were
availablewhen this was written) as it was in l91.7. Though
this seems a straightforward conclusion, it actually conceals
a host of controversies and puzzles. For the stability we
observe in the income distribution is not the result of a

boring, static economy, nor the result of some "natural

economic    law," as   Pareto (1897) thought. Rather it is the
result of a confluence of powerful forces, some pulling toward

greater equality and some pulling toward greater inequality,
which together produced a great underwater swirl while
causing barely a ripple on the surface.

      For example, the American population experienced
substantial demographic changes during this 30-year period.
The causes of these changes were varied, complex, in part
                                                                  5.



 obvious and in part obscure, but in any case well beyond
 the scope of this chapter.1 What matters for our purposes
 is that, given the way income distribution data are compiled,
t1se demographic shifts would have produced a substantial
 trend toward greater inequality had not other factors inter-

 vened. It will not be giving away the plot to suggest that
 government transfer programs played a major role in that

 intervention.
         Even the basic stylized fact that income inequality
 has remained constant since World War II has not gone unchallenged.

 It has been argued, for example, that if we measured income
 more comprehensively than we do, or if we measured it over

 periods longer than a year, a clearer trend toward equality
 would emerge. As we shall see, seemingly mundane issues
 like how to define and measure income are of considerable

 importance in appraising the economy's postwar performance;
 and they also raise some surprisingly profound (and perhaps

 insoluble) issues.
         Since this chapter is a long one, it will be useful

 to provide a reader's guide at the outset. Section 2
 disposes briefly of some preliminary issues of measurement- -

 the   measurement of welfare, the measurement of income, and

 the measurement of inequality. The next two sections, which
 comprise the bulk of the paper, address the two central topics

 of the chapter--postwar trends in the yJ of income (Section

 )     and its           (Section 14.).   Section   14., in particular,

 examines in some depth the controversies alluded to just above.
                                                        1eV.




Section   then takes up several peripheral aspects of the
distribution of income which seem to be of special interest--

poverty, black/white income differentials, and male/female
income differentials. Finally, in Section 6, the myopic
concentration on income is remedied           by examining
postwar developments in non-income aspects of well-being
such as leisure, wealth, health, and so on. Section 7
offers some brief concluding remarks.




2. Preliminaries
      A. From the Sublime to the Ridiculous

      The essay begins with a strategic retreat which moves
farther and farther from a concept that is interesting but

unmeasurable (welfare) and closer and closer to a concept that

is measureable but possibly uninteresting (money income as

defined by the Census Bureau). Like most strategic retreats,
this one does accomplish something. But it must be admitted
that its direction is dictated more by expedience than by
principle. The retreat takes place in several stages.
      The first step is to admit that man does not live on

bread alone. Political freedom, peace, inner tranquility,
a happy family life, and so on may be far more important to

many people than the bill of goods and services they consume.

Still, it would be the height of folly for an economist to
write an essay on these more ephemeral aspects of human welfare.
                                                                 5.



On grounds of comparative advantage, therefore, I will for
the most part restrict my attention to what is normally

considered flQj well-being.
        The second step is to concede that there is little

scientific basis for deciding how much "utility" any specific

individual gets at any particular time, and even less for
deciding whether Laurel gets more or less than Hardy. Two
avenues therefore remain open. We can look at levels and
distributions of items which are presumed to yield utility,

such as consumptiongoods and leisure time. Or we can look
at peoples' opportunities, as summarized by their endowments

and the prices they face, on the assumption that people
with more generous opportunities achieve correspondingly
higher levels of satisfaction.2

        While part of our army will stop to fight the battle
here, most of it will retreat one step more--to the use of
current income to summarize the whole opportunity set. Now
we know this is not quite right. Two individuals with
identical opportunities will have different incomes if their
preferences differ.3 Ill health may mean that more current
income is necessary to achieve any given level of satisfaction,
or a    large store of   accumulated wealth may mean that less is

necessary.    While several    of these qualifications will be
dealt   with in what follows, the data dictate that the analysis
be   conducted mainly in terms of income.
                                                        6.


      B.   The Measurement of Income
      Perhaps the worst news is saved for last. The only
reasonably consistent time series of income distributions

covering a long period            comes from the annual Current

Population Survey (cPS), which uses an income definition

that is far from the economist's (or anyone else's) ideal.1

Economists define an individual's income as the amount he
could consume without depleting his wealth--the sum of his

expenditures plus any increase in his wealth. What does
the CPS offer us? Basically, a distribution of money income
in which some sources of income are grossly underreported,
capital gains are excluded, cash transfers are included but

transfers in kind are excluded, and from which no deduction

is made for income and payroll taxes. Measured income thus
falls far short of the ideal concept of income. Given the
wide cleavage that already exists between well-being and

even this ideal   concept of   income, one might well wonder if

our data do not leave us with a grin without a cat. I
proceed nonetheless in this essay to analyze the grin.
However, some time will be spent in Section 1t questioning
whether a better measure of income might tell a different

story about postwar trends in income inequality.
      Our interest in the level and distribution of income
clearly is motivated by a belief that we can use these two

numbers as approximate indicators of economic welfare.
Specifically, we would like to believe that higher or more
                                                      7.



equally distributed incomes mean that society is "better off."
Having decided, for lack of a superior alternative, to use
census money income, the next step is to decide on the
recipient unit. Whose incomes shall we study?

      This question, which may seem foolish and "academic"

at first, is in fact very important because of the demographic

changes mentioned earlier. For it appears that one of the
items that Americans have purchased with their postwar

prosperity has been the privilege of living apart from their
relatives. Think what happens, for example, when higher

living standards and/or more generous public transfer programs
enable junior, or grandma and grandpa, to move into an
apartment of their own. A new economic unit is       formed,
with a rather li income, thus bringing down the average
level of income and raising its inequality. Both economic
indicators will therefore signal a deterioration in welfare,

though we may presume that these changes in living arrangements
actually make the parties involved better off.5

     We, therefore, must exercise extreme caution in inter-
preting postwar trends in income distribution. The Census
Bureau offers separate income distributions for

("a group of two or more persons related by blood, marriage,

or adoption and residing together") and for ated
individuals, as well as a oled distribution that combines
both types of units. In this essay, we will pay attention
                                                           8.


to   each of these distributions, and to the interrelationships

among them.

        Further perplexities enter when we ask another question:

why should we be interested in distributions of            incomes
instead of incomes measured over some alternative accounting

period? One answer is straightforward and prosaic: that's
the way the data come. But a deeper answer is not so easily
obtained. If we could measure income over any accounting
period we wished, what accounting period would be best?
        It seems clear that periods like a day or a week are

far too short to generate meaningful data on income inequality.

All of us have weeks of zero income (at least on a cash

accounting basis), without being "poor" in any real sense.

So longer periods are necessary. But why stop at a year?
Clearly a year is far too short an accounting period to place

many people meaningfully within the income distribution.
For example, since investment in human capital typically

leads to rising age-earnings profiles, many people who are
quite well off in a lifetime sense may appear quite "poor"
during certain years. For these and other reasons many

economists, including myself (Blinder, l97, 1976), have
been attracted to the distribution of        pe incomes,
though even this choice is not unobjectionable.
       As we shall see, there is evidence that income distributions

over multi-year accounting periods display less inequality
than income distributions for a single year. More importantly,
there is reason to believe that a stronger trend toward
                                                                 9.


equality might emerge if        somehow   we were able to measure
the distribution        of lifetime income.
          C. The Measurement of Ineguaij6
           are many ways to measure how "equal" or "unequal"
          There

any given distribution of income 5; but the availability
of   data dictates that we concentrate on two. The first is

straightforward and requires no elaboration: we can examine
trends in the shares of total income accruing to specific

income groups such as the poorest fifth, the richest fifth,

etc. The second is something called the iatj, and
requires some explanation.7
          Income distributions are typically displayed in a

convenient graphical device invented by M.0. Lorenz (1905);

two such oren are depicted in Figure 1. To construct
a Lorenz curve, begin with a square whose dimensions represent
l00/° .        Along the horizontal axis, measure the cumulative
percentage of consumer units, starting from the poorest;
along the vertical axis, measure the cumulative share of
income received by these units. Data on income shares then
appear as points within the square, and the curvilinear line
connecting them is the Lorenz curve.

          Every Lorenz curve has four basic properties:
          1.     It must begin at the origin, since zero units
have zero income.

          2.     It must end at the upper-right corner of the

diagram since 100% of the units must receive all the income.

          3.     If incomes were distributed equally, the Lorenz
curve would be a diagonal line connecting these two points,

since the "poorest't 207° of units would receive 20% of the
income, the "poorest" 1O% would receive li0io,     and   so on.
       .     In   a real economy, in which significant income
differentials exist, the Lorenz curve will "sag" downward

from this diagonal line representing perfect equality. The
reason is straightforward. If there is any inequality at

all, the poorest 20% of units must receive less than 20/°
of the income, the poorest Ii.0% must receive less than
and so on.

       Lorenz curves are useful in depicting inequality because
curves that lie           to the diagonal represent distributions
with s inequality. This is also illustrated in Figure 1
which shows, for the family income distribution, the most

equal and most unequal distributions during the entire postwar
period. (The fact that they are so close together illustrates
the aforementioned stability of the income distribution.)

In fact, the area between the Lorenz curve and the diagonal

(shaded in Figure 1), expressed as a fraction of the area
beneath the diagonal,8 is often used asa summary measure of
inequality. This fraction is called the Gii      ratio, after
its inventor Corrado Gini (1936), and it is clear that higher
Gini ratios connote greater inequality.
       Since Gini ratios appear so frequently in this essay,
a word on   their interpretation is in order. The Gini ratio
                                                            ii.



is a purely mechanical measure of inequality, while our
interest in inequality is as an indicator of social welfare.

Suppose in comparing two income distributions we find that
distribution A assigns less income         to the poorest 20'°

of families and   to   the richest 20 than does distribution B.
(Distribution A naturally has to assign more income to the

middle 60/° of families.) Which distribution has more
"equality"? Clearly A is more equal at     the   upper tail (the
rich  are not quite so rich), but B is more equal at the lower
tail (the poor are not quite so poor). But which distribution
is "better"? It is clear that the answer is unclear. It
depends   on whether society attaches more importance to income
differences at the high or low end of the income distribution.

But the Gini ratio (or, for that matter, any summary statistic)

tolerates no such ambiguity. It will state for example,
that the Gini ratio for distribution A is .36 while that for

distribution B is .37. For this reasor, we must take care in
pronouncing distributions with lower Gini ratios as "better."

          There is, however, one important circumstance in which
the Gini ratio can be relied upon to properly rank different
income distributions. This is the case where the Lorenz

curves do not cross (as                in Figure 1), for then

the more unequal distribution will always get the higher Gini
ratio. The conclusion then is this. When Lorenz curves
cross, the Gini ratio may rank income distributions incorrectly,
                                                         12.



and thus cannot be taken very seriously. However, when Lorenz
curves do not cross, such misrankings cannot occur and the

Gini ratio provides useful information. Fortunately for us,
most of the inequality comparisons we have to make are between

Lorenz curves that do not cross.9




 _nd si           Level of Inc orne and Cons ut ion
       I turn now to the first of the two major concerns of

this chapter: what has happened to the average level of
economic well-being in the United States since World War II?

As noted earlier, I will at first stealthily translate this

question to: what has happened to the average level of
postponing the consideration of non-income aspects of well-
being to Section 6.

       The basic story is, of course, extremely well known.

The postwar U.S. economy has generally produced growth of

per capita incomes, though that growth has been punctuated
by periodic recessions.1° This stylized fact is illustrated
in Figure 2, which charts the behavior of real disposable

income per capita from 1914.7 to 1978. The trend in consumption,

naturally enough, has followed the trend in income rather

closely. But the aggregate data conceal some dramatic changes

in patterns of consumption.

the            of income, we need no restrict ourselves to Census
income since much better measures are available in the national
income accounts (Nm).

          The NTh concept that comes closest to Census income
is Personal Income (p1). And it is easy to remedy several

problems with Census income by supplementing P1 with other NIA
data. First, as a crude way of accounting for (a smoothed
version of) capital gains, we can add corporate retained
earnings to personal income. Second, we can put P1 on a more
consistent post-transfer but pre-tax basis (like Census income)
by including not only the employee's share of the payroll tax
but also the employer's share. Making both these changes in
the N data leads me to an income concept that I call

aat_aaacQa1
          A more fundamental problem with Census income, however,

is the illogic of adding in transfers but failing to deduct
the taxes that pay for them. This is easily remedied in the

aggregate data by deducing both personal income taxes and
payroll taxes (both shares) from augmented personal income to
arrive at an income concept that I call Augrnented Disposable
          12
Income.

          The decade-by-decade annual growth rates in real Census

income, real augmented personal income,, and real augmented
disposable income1 are presented in Table 1. Not surprisingly,
for the postwar period as a whole the growth rates of Census

income and augmented personal income are almost identical,

while the growth rate of real augmented disposable income is

about one-third of a percentage point less. Compounded over
50 years, these figures mean that from 1914.7 to 1977 real

augmented P1 per family increased 95% ,   while   real augmented
DI per family increased 77% .   The gap is accounted for by

an increasing burden of personal taxation (with, presumably,

a corresponding increase in public services).

       When we break the 50-year period down into decades,
the close agreement between Census income and augmented

personal income starts to melt away. More importantly, a
striking difference between the postwar economic progress of
families and unrelated individuals (Uls) emerges. For both
groups, and for any of the income measures, the middle decade

(which was dominated by the long boom of the .l960s) exhibited

the strongest growth. But the rankings of the other two decades
is reversed. Apparently, families fared much better than Uls
between 1914.7 and 1957, while tJIs fared much better than

families during the most recent decade. Why? The reasons
are to be found in the demographic shifts summarized in
Tables 2 and 5. These tables show that while demographic

changes during 1914.7-1957 were mostly minor for families, Uls
become more likely to be female or elderly. By contrast,

during the last decade Uls became much less likely to be
female, while more families became female-headed. (Both

groups became younger on average.)

Where Did It Come_From?

         Naturally, all the components of personal income

participated in the postwar growth, though certainly not
equally. Table 1i. shows that wages, interest, and transfers

accounted for greater shares of augmented personal income in

1977 than was true in 1911.7, whereas proprietor's income, rents,
                                                       11;.
and corporate profits accounted for smaller shares.
Where_Did It Go?

         The concept of augmented personal income as defined
here can be div±ded into three principal uses:
         1. spending: the sum of personal consumption
expenditures, interest paid to businesses, and transfers to

foreigners,           indirect taxes;

         2. saving: personal saving as in the NL    2lus
retained   earnings
         3. taxes: personal taxes as in the NTh pJs
contributions for social insurance plus indirect taxes. (This
can be   viewed as purchases of public consumption.)

         Using this three-way split, Table 5 shows that spending
has commanded a dwindling share and taxes have commanded an

expanding share during the postwar period. The share of

savings exhibits no trend, though saving rates were unusually
low in three of the last four years. Closer inspection of
these data reveals that the share of consumption stabilized

between 62 and 63% around 1966, or so, and the share of taxes
stabilized near 30 percent around 1968 .      Thus since 1968

American consumers have paid about 30 percent of their gross

incomes to the tax collector, saved about 7 percent, and

spent the remaining 63 percent.
         B.   Pa tterns of Cons upion., 191i 7-19.11

         So income and consumption have grown mightily over the

postwar period. How have American consumers spent this

largesse? An examination of postwar changes in consumption
patterns is interesting for the profile it draws of the
American way of life. And it also holds a few surprises.
A logical place to start is with changes in budget shares.
What fraction of each dollar of consumer spending was spent

on various items in 1914.7 and 1977? Which items commanded an

increasing share of the consumer's budget and which a decreasing
share?

          Table 6 contains some answers; but there are too many
numbers    in this table for it   to "speak for itself, and many
others hidden in the data that underlie it. Let        us   see what
story these data tell.
         At the coarsest level of aggregation, the table shows
just   about what we expect. Americans are now spending more

of their budgets on housing, medical care, private transportation,
recreation, and personal services than they were in 1911.7.

At the same time, they are spending less on food, clothing,

and public transportation. But if we peer a bit below the

surface, some fascinating details emerge.

Food

        Spending on virtually every category of food declined
in relative importance over this 30-year period, including
even meajs away Q_Q (which came as a surprise to me).
They claimed 6.7 out of every dollar in l91.7, but only 5.2
in 1977. (One can only imagine what the French would think

of this)
        The most dramatic decline, again surprisingly, was f or
aj--which accounted for only 2.li% of the
1977 budget as against 5.3% in 1911.7.     In fact, real consumption
of alcoholic beverages per capita increased only 12% over the

30 year period, despite the fact that its price relative to

all consumption items fell by 261° .     Americans are indeed
drinking (relatively) less.
        Accompanying the decline in relative spending on food
came a noticeable                        (though not necessarily
in their nutritive content). As Table 7 indicates, per capita

consumption of beef almost doubled, per capita consumption of
chicken almost tripled, and consumption of such luxury and
convenience items as ice cream, processed fruits, and processed

vegetables registered dramatic increases. Concurrent with
these increases came sharp declines in per capita consumption

of such obviously inferior goods as pork, lard, potatoes,
and corn meal. Consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables

also declined, though one may legitimately question whether
this marked an increase in living sL.andards. (Adelle Davis

            The costs of owning or renting a home or apartment

claimed 15.57° of consumer budgets in 1977 as against 9.970
in l9I.7. Almost all of the increase is accounted for by

                            as growing income levels and strong
incentives set up by the income tax system combined to induce

a substantial shift from renting to owning. In l9I.0 only

it.I% of Americans owned their own home; by 1970,63% did

(See Table 8, Part A).
            It is worth noting that the rapid escalation of

housing prices that we have experienced in recent years was
flQ.. characteristic of the postwar period as a whole. In

fact, between 197 and 1977 housing prices increased only
15110   while   consumer prices in general increased 165 /0

Housing commanded an increasing budget share because real
per capita consumption of housing tripled.
            Some data compiled by Lebergott (1976) enable us to go
somewhat beyond these rather dry statistics. (See Table 8,

Part A.) Between 1914.0 and 1970, çowdig diminished
significantly. The fraction of housing units with more
persons than rooms declined from 20 percent to 8 percent,

and the average number of persons per room fell from .7
to .62 .       The         of housing also improved. The average
age of the housing stock fell by 1-4.   years,   the fraction of

housing units with running water increased from 7010 to 981°
and the fraction with flush toilets increased from 60% to

96T°

       Other   improvements in the way Americans are housed
become apparent only when we look at expenditures on household
operation. While the total budget share spent on this category
did not change, its composition underwent radical surgery.
Table 6 shows, for example, that the budget share allocated
to household_ap1iances fell almost in half between 1914.7 and

1977. What this conceals is that the very steep decline in
the relative prices of these items16 enabled Americans to

have more and more while spending less and less. By 1977,

     spending per capita on household appliances was more
than double what it had been in 1914.7, and the        of household

durables must have increased by much more than this. Lebergott
(1976) reports, for example, that the fraction of American
families owning mechanical refrigerators increased from 1V/°

to 9910 between 1914.0 and 1970. The penetration of televisions

went from zero in 1914.0 to virtually i0OY° by 1970.

       Sourçes_of power for household operation tell a

fascinating tale. Spending on electricity more than doubled

despite a çjxj, in its relative price; real spending per
capita increased more than five-fold. Concurrently, fuel oil
and coal demanded a decreasing share of consumers' budgets

despite a sharply jncreij relative price. In fact, household
usage of fuel oil and coal was unchanged in absolute terms

between 1914.7 and 1977 despite a 53Y0 increase in population.

There was, in brief, a veritable revolution in the way homes
                                                                 20.


were heated--away fromdirty fuels like coal and wood, which
also require considerable effort to use, and toward cleaner
and more convenient fuels like oil, gas, and electricity.

Lebergott (1976), for example, reports that the fraction of
U.S. families heating by wood or coal dropped from 78'°    to    ii.% ,


while   the fraction using oil or gas rose from 22°/° to 82"Io   ,



between 1911.0 and 1970. (See Table 8, Part B.)
           There were other notable changes as well. The average

American used the teijione about 5 1/2 times as much in 1977
as in 1911.7, but did so while allocating a budget share only

twice as large.

           One   further item which is of trivial importance in
consumer budgets nowadays,    but is nonetheless interesting for
the light it sheds on postwar changes in America, is spending
On                     In 1911.7, Americans spent 1./° of their
budgets on domestic service--a sum almost as large as what they

spent on doctors and dentists, and even larger than what they
spent on either local public transportation or private education.

About   one household in lii. had a domestic employee. By 1977,
the   price of domestic service had increased 2l/° (versus 16%
for consumer prices in general); only about one household in
27 had a domestic worker;1 and this budget item claimed only
0.6 out of every consumer dollar. In real terms, the consumption
of domestic services declined               by 31% (or 55% on
a per capita basis). In the murder mysteries of the 1970s, the
butler was never there to do it.
                                                                21.




         Food, clothing, and shelter are supposed to be the
three basic necessities. Like food, clothing gobbled up a
smaller and smaller share of the consumer's budget during the

postwar period. By 1977, consumers were spending only 8 of
every dollar on clothing (including shoes, jewelry, and accessories)
as compared to 1l in 1911.7.   In part, this was due to a decline

in the relative price of clothing (by 281° from 1911.7 to 1977);

but even real spending on clothing grew noticeably slower than

total spending.

         Food, clothing, and shelter together, it may be noted,
absorbed fully 861° of total spending in 197 but less than
75% in 1977. Room was being made for non-necessities.


         Spending patterns on transportation goods and services
reveal a pattern that is fascinating even though its basic
outlines are well-known. The almighty jJe was already
well ensconced on the American scene by 1914.7--claiming 8'/° of

consumer budgets for its purchase, care, and feeding (as
compared with only 1.8% for all forms of purchased transportation).
But the automobilization of America accelerated during the postwar

period. By 1977, consumers were spending 13.1 out of every
dollar on their cars, and a negligible O.8 on purchased

transportation.
         When we recall that air travel was almost non-existent

in 1911.7, but dominated purchased inter-city travel by 1977,

the comparison is more dramatic still. Purchased transportation
                                                            22.



excluding_air_travel took l.7 out of every consumer dollar in

1914.7, but only O.L in 1977. It is only a slight exaggeration
to say that the postwar period witnessed the death of the train,
the bus, and the subway.
Recreation

          Spending patterns on recreational goods and services
offer some surprises. Even including foreign travel as

recreation,18 the share of recreational spending in consumer

budgets increased only 1.5 percentage points during the postwar

period.     This is much less than Madison Avenue has led us to
expect. Furthermore, more than all of this increase was
accounted    for by only thrae categories of spending: foreign
travel (from O.'o to i.o'/°) purchases of televisions, radios,
and similar gocds (from O.9'' to i.5'°); and purchases of

recreational hardgoods such as toys, sports equipment, bicycles,
boats, etc. (from 1.2% to 1.8%). The case of TV's is
particularly remarkable since they claimed an increasing budget
share despite a price that fell absolutely by 16% (that's

right )19    America's love affair with the television is a notable
feature of the postwar period.
         Several categories of recreational spending actually
made decreasing claims on the consumer's budget, notably
admissions   to soectator events (movies, theater, sport events)
which received only O.6 out of every consumer dollar in 1977
as compared to 1.2 in 1914.7. And this occurred despite the

fact that prices for such events rose 300% (as compared to

only 165% for overall consumer prices). Real purchases of
                                                         23.



such admissions actually eclia 16u/0 despite rising population
and rising real income. So much for the alleged boom in movies

and spectator sports.
Personal Services
         Personal services are an odd mixture including such

diverse items as private educational spending, life insurance,
legal fees, and the costs of stock brokerage. All of these
grew rapidly, with spending on stockbrokers displaying the fastest
growth (increasing more than 18-fold) and life insurance costs
having the smallest (increasing more than 8-fold).

Medical Care
         Everyone knows that Americans are spending more on

medical care than they did early in the postwar period (9.6%

of consumer budgets as compared to 14..5'/o). And everyone knows

that consumers are unhappy about the soaring costs of medical
care. The tremendous increase in the share of the budget going
to medical care is due both to its increasing relative price
and to a rapid increase in real consumption of medical services,
especially hospital services. While health has improved
demonstrably during the last 30 years (more on this in Section 6),

this may have been due more to advances in public health than

to increased personal expenditures on medical care.



         During the 30-year period from 19I7 to 1977, real
consumption per capita increased by more than 80'° .   As compared

to their counterparts in 1914.7, AmericrnS in 1977 travelled by
                                                             211.




airplane and watched TV vastly more. They replaced pork, lard,
corn meal and fresh vegetables in their diets by beef, poultry,
and processed fruits and vegetables. They made much greater
use of electricity, the telephone, and hospitals, and they spent
much   more on their own homes--which   they heated by gas and oil
rather  than by coal and wood. They bought more toys, sports
equionent, and other recreational goods (but not more admission
tickets), and devoted a good deal more of their budgets to
nurturing their cars.
            During the same period, travel by bus, rail, and subway
diminished greatly; domestic servants nearly disappeared from
the scene; and the basic necessities of life--food, clothing,

and shelter--commanded ever decreasing shares of the consumer

budget.
            One seems forced to the conclusion that the average

level of economic well-being both changed in content and improved

drastically. Virtually everyone shared in economic growth, but
not equally. I turn my attention now to trends in income

inequa lity.




1L.__TresnIncomualj20
           Whereas the level of income was mostly increasing
during    the postwar period, the central stylized fact about
incore inequality has been its constang. Table 9 displays the
basic data that support this fact, and they certainly seem

unequivocal.   According to the Gini ratio, for example, 1957
was the most equal year and 1961 was the most unequal.
Inequality in 1977 was the same as it was in 191.7. If we accept
these data at face value, there clearly is no postwar trend in

income inequality.
           But there are a host of very good reasons n to
accept these data at face value--which is why this section

occupies       pages instead of one sentence. First, the changing

structure of the U.S. population by age, by sex, and by family
composition raise questions about the comparability of the data
over time. Rough "corrections" for these demographic shifts
point to a slight trend toward equality which the raw data mask.

Second, attempts to improve the measurement of income by subtract-

ing taxes, adding transfers in kind, and so on seem to produce

an income concept whose distribution displays greater equalization
over the period than does Census income. Third, and most
speculatively, it has been suggested that the portion of measured

inequality that is simply due to the fact that different people
are at different stages in their life cycles has increased
over the postwar period so that, if we could measure it, the

distribution of lifetime incomes would show a greater trend
toward equality than the distribution of annuJ incomes.
           It turns out, most disagreeably for students of the

subject, that the sensitivity of the distribution of income in
the United States to subtle changes in the recipient population,

the definition of income, or the choice of accounting period is
                                                              26.



extremely large--much greater in fact than any changes we can
find in inequality through time. This, I think, is the most
fundamental    sense in which we can say that inequality has been

relatively constant; but it also explains the urgency of sorting
out these seemingly boring issues of definition.

          Such issues will occupy the bulk of this section. But
before getting buried in the details, I pause briefly to consider

a prior question: Does the (relatively constant) postwar income
distribution, with its Gini ratio in the .1l.O-.1i2 range, represent
a lot of inequality or a little?
                   the Bottle Ha lf Full   or Ha if Empy
          Clearly,   to paraphrase an exceedingly wise folk saying,
where you stand on this question depends on where you sit in
the income distribution. While an "objective" answer is clearly
out of the question, let me attempt several ways of providing
a frame of reference.

Cpa r is ons   Over_Time
          I have   already noted that changes in inequality during
the postwar period have been too small to provide useful inter-

temporal comparisons. According to the Gini measure, 1957 had
the most equal distribution while 1961 had the least equal.

Yet the difference between their Gini ratios is a scant 6%
(see also Figure 1). So if we want to draw useful comparisons
through time, we will have to look back further into U.S.

history. Naturally, the quality of the data tails off rather
quickly as we do this; but some distributions for earlier years
                                                          27.



have been constructed. Budd (1967, Introduction)has compiled
more or less consistent income distributions for several prewar

and several postwar years (See Table 10).21 The conclusion
seems to be that there was substantial equalization during the
years of the Great Depression and World War II, but very little

change since then. The postwar distribution seems noticeably
more equal than the distribution in 1929.


         Instead of comparing the postwar income distribution
of the United States with the U.S. income distribution in earlier

years, we might compare the U.S. with other countries at the

same time. The hazard here is that different countries use
different concepts of income and different definitions of the

recipient unit than the United States and, as just mentioned,

income distributions can be quite sensitive to these choices.
Of the many international comparisons that have been made, two

seem worth reporting here. Some years ago Irving Kravis (1960,
1962) made a careful series of binary comparisons by taking the
income distributions of 10 foreign countries and comparing each
one with a different U.S. distribution selected to be conceptually
alike. His conclusion was that income inequality in the U.S.
was rather less than in several less developed countries, but
somewhere near the middle of a group of modern industrial nations.

More recently, a study by Malcolm Sawyer for the OECD (1976)
attempted to put the distributional statistics of the various

OECD nations on an equal footing so that comparisons could be

made. He found the U.S. and France to have the most income

inequality among OECD       nations.
            The   overall   conclusion, then, seems to be that income

inequality in the U.S. is higher than in many industrialized

nations, but lower than in most less developed countries.

Interoreting      the 1977 _Q)s tr ibut ion
            Another   way to appraise the degree of inequality is
to subject the most recent data on income shares to further

scriitiny along the following lines. (See Table 11.) Data for
1977 tell us that the richest fifth of American families received

8 times as much income as the poorest fifth.22 This 8:1 ratio,
which    is characteristic of the entire postwar period, strikes
me as a very substantial income gap. But           some further facts
make this inequality seem less severe.

            First, it turns out that richer families tend to be
larger.     The richest fifth of       families in 1977 actually included
28'Y0   more persons than the poorest fifth. Adjusting income to
a   per capita basis would bring the 8:1        income ratio down to 6:1.

Second,    it turns out that the richest fifth of families in
1977 contained 29'/° of all the wage earners in the country,
whereas the poorest fifth contained only 9 1/2% . Thus on a
per-earner basis, the income ratio was only 2.6:1. And even
this    ratio can be lowered by considering      work effort. The
richest fifth of families supplied over 30% of the total weeks

worked in the economy during 1977, while the poorest fifth supplied

only 7.7'° .      Thus, on a per-week-of-work basis, the income ratio

between rich and poor was only 2:1. This certainly does not
seem like an unreasonable degree of inequality.23
         Thus we can use the very same data to show that the
income gap between the rich and the poor is anything from 8:1
to 2:1--an ambiguity that will make propagandists (from either

side) happy. Which ratio is "right't" I certainly do not know.
On. the one hand, if differences in family size are voluntary

(richer parents "buy" more children), and decisions over whether
and how much to work are involuntary (due mostly to whether

jobs are available), then none of the corrections are warranted

and the 8:1 ratio seems most meaningful. On the other hand,
if we assume that people voluntarily choose their labor supply

but not their family size, then all the corrections leading to

a 2:1 ratio are appropriate. To state the issue this way is

to demonstrate its irresolvability. Clearly, all of these

choices have voluntary and involuntary aspects.

         I   turn now to the first of our problems in interpreting

the postwar income distribution data, and in accepting the
conclusion that inequality has not changed: demographic
changes.2 This section makes three main points. First,
demographic changes have been substantial.2 Second, measured
income inequality is quite sensitive to the composition of the

underlying population of recipient units. Third, many of the
demographic changes that occurred were of the sort that raise
                                                             30.



measured inequality.

Families_versus Unrelated_Individuals
          A logical place to start is with the division of the

U.S. population between families and unrelated individuals.

As Table 12 shows, this division has changed dramatically over

the   postwar period, and especially over the last decade.     In

this ten-year period, the population of the United States over

the age of 16 increased 19% ,   but   the number of Census families

increased only i1.% , and average family size fell from 3.67

to 3.33 persons. By contrast, the number of unrelated individuals
grew by an astounding % in these same 10 years. These figures
reflect several striking demographic trends, including a growing
propensity for both the young and the old to live apart and an

increasing incidence of broken marriages.

           Table 13 shows why these developments are important
for interpreting income distribution data. Unrelated individuals
have always had much lower and much more unequally distributed

incomes than have families, though there was some convergence
in both respects during the last decade. Thus the demographic
shifts that underlie Table 12, many of which clearly represent

improvements in well-being, lowered average income and increased
income inequality when families and unrelated individuals are

pooled in a single distribution.
           A first step, therefore, is to look separately at
trends in the distributions among families and among unrelated

individuals (Uls). These are summarized in Tables l1i and 1,

but before considering these data one technical point must be

made (with due apologies to the casual reader). Data on

percentile shares for the years 1958 through 1977 were computed
in the obvious way: by ranking consumer units and adding up

their incomes. For the years 1911.7 through 1957, however, the
micro data required to do this were unavailable, so shares were
estimated and interpolated from grouped data. The post-1958
data are thus more trustworthy than the pre-1958 data, and we

must keep this in mind in looking for trends.26
         In the case of families, the data show some trend

toward equality before 1957 though little since then--which
raises the question of whether we are seeing a trend or a

statistical illusion. Between 19)#7 and 1957, there were clear

(if modest) upward trends in the shares of the second, middle,

and fourth fifths. All of these gains came at the expense of

the upper fifth (and especially the top %), whose shares
declined quite markedly. Since 1958, however, there is little
trend of any kind. The only development worth noting is the
climb of the share of the lowest fifth from the 11..5-57O range

to around 5.5 /0 during the years 1961-1966. The host of public
assistance policies introduced or expanded around that time is,

of course, the leading explanation for this improvement in the

lot of poor families.
         Using the Gini ratio to summarize these data, all of

this can be said more concisely by noting that, once cyclical
effects are removed, the Gini ratio exhibits a mild downward
                                                          32.



trend (about -.002 per year) until 1957 and no trend thereafter.27

         The story with unrelated individuals seems to have

been just the reverse: relative stability until 1957, followed
by a marked trend toward equaiity.28

         The share of the lowest fifth fluctuated aimlessly

through 1957, apparently underwent a shift (not shown in Table
15) when the nature of the data changed in 1958, and marched

steadily upward thereafter. The shares of the second and third
fifths did very little until about 1961i., and then also started

to move up strongly. In total, the combined share of the lower
60% of the income distribution increased from 25.Is.7O   to   287°

between 1961s. and 1975--a substantial improvement. The upper

o%, naturally,    were the losers. Beginning around 1960 or
so, the shares of these two quintiles exhibit a noticeable
downward trend.

         All of these conflicting forces:

        *an equalizing trend in the family distribution until
1957 but not after (Table iI.)

        *an equalizing trend in the distribution among UI's
since 1957 but not before (Table 15);

        *a decrease in the portion of the population in families
(Table 12);

        *a widening of the income gap between families in UI's
between 1917 and 1957 and a narrowing of that gap from 1967

to 1977 (Table 13);

component distributions.

         But we do not solve the problem of demographic change
simply by separating families from unrelated individuals (Uls).
For, as we learned in Tables 2 and 3,   both   the composition of

families and the nature of the UI population underwent substantial

demographic change during the postwar period. To keep the
discussion manageable, I limit myself to families in what follows.

But the reader should keep in mind that equally dramatic changes

were occurring in the demography of unrelated individuals, with

corresponding effects on the income distribution.

         Just what were the changes in the structure of the

American family, and how did they affect the distribution of

income? We can answer these questions with the help of Table

2 (On page , which     lists some important demographic changes,
and Table 16, which illustrates the extreme sensitivity of
income inequality to the nature f the recipient unit.29
         Average family size was constant between 191i-7 and

1967, but fell dramatically during the following ten years
due to a sharp decline in the number of children. This means
that family income     çjta grew   more rapidly than mean family

income. The distribution of families by size shows that most
of the statistical "action't came in the two tails. At one
extreme the fraction of families with two members drifted up

slowly from 191.7-1967, and then skyrocketed between 1967 and

1977.30 At the other extreme, the number      of   families with six
or more members also drifted up slowly during the first two
postwar decades, but then took a nosedive between 1967 and
1977. Relative to 1911.7, we now have more childless couples,
fewer families with four children or more, and fewer extended

families. But since Table 16 shows that the greatest degree

of inequality is found among the largest and smallest families,
it is not clear that these very large demographic shifts had
much influence on the trend in inequality.

         The next change in family composition worthy of note
is the increased incidence of female headship. The fraction

of families headed by females, which fluctuated in a range

around 10i° from 191i.7 to 1967, shot up to ll1..11.%by 1977.

Since female-headed families normally have lower incomes than

male-headed families, and since Table 16 shows that they also
typically have more unequally distributed incomes, this factor
tended to retard the growth of income per family and to increase
inequality.

         The farm population dwindled remarkably during the
postwar period. In 1911.7, more than one family in six lived

on a farm. By 1977, this was down to one family in 26. It is
quite likely that this migration from the farm reduced income

inequality because farm incomes are much more unequally distributed

than nonfarm incomes (see Table 16), and because farm incomes
are typically much lower than nonfarm incomes. However, there
is a complication that bears mentioning. Census money income
                                                               35.

excludes   income received in kind, which is probably far more

important on farms than elsewhere. Since Census data therefore
overstate the gap between farm and nonfarrn incomes,they probably

also overstate the equalization caused by the migration from
rural areas.

           The age structure of families (as measured by the

age of the family head) also changed dramatically. Between 19I.7
and 1977, the number of young (under 25) and old (6 and over)
families grew much faster than the number in the prime earning

years (ages 35-6I.). (Table 2.) Given the facts that families
at the extremes of the age distribution always have much lower

incomes than those in the middle, and that the income distribution

among the elderly is quite unequal (Table 16), this development

pushed inequality up.31
           In summary, the changing age-sex composition of family
heads pushed the distribution of income toward greater inequality
while the movement off the farm pushed in the opposite direction.
In addition, there were a host of other demographic changes,

some of which may have had substantial effects on measured

income inequality. Indeed, given the extreme sensitivity of
income inequality to demography that Table 16 documents, it is
somewhat amazing that the distribution of income among families

changed so little during a period when the demographic structure
changed so much.
                                                               36.


           C.   Measured Inequality and

           It has already been mentioned that the concept of

income used by the Census Bureau is far from ideal. Two         obvious
questions follow. First, if we could measure income better,
would inequality appear less than in the official data?

Second, if we could measure income better, would a stronger

trend toward equality emerge? This section answers both of
these questions in the affirmative.32

           Specifically,     this section deals with five potential
improvements in the Census income concept: subtracting personal
taxes, adding in     transfers in kind, adding in other types of

income in kind, including capital gains, and correcting for
underreporting of income. in addition, the influence of cash
transfers on inequality is examined. As in the previous section,
we shall see that changes in the definition of income typically

cause changes in measured inequality that exceed anything we
can find in the time series.

Personal   Taxes
           We can probably make sense of an income distribution

that excludes both public transfer payments and taxes or one
that               both. But Census income is an awkward halfway
house which includes transfers but fails to deduct taxes.

Thus a first step in improving the Census income concept is to

subtract personal taxes.33 In practice, most studies have
deducted only federal taxes, thus leaving state income taxes
                                                          37.



in the alleged "post-tax" income figures.1 The federal income

tax is decidedly progressive. The payroll tax, while regressive
relative   to ea ings, is not quite so regressive relative to
        because low income groups receive a large proportion of
their total income in transfers. Deducting both income and
payroll taxes thus       e    measured inequality noticeably,
as   Table 17 shows.35

           A similar study by Taussig (1973), using 1967 data
and an income concept similar to Census income, reported that

federal personal taxes reduced the Gini coefficient from .376

to .361. It seems unlikely that including state and local income
taxes would change these figures very much, but including sales
and excise taxes might.6 I conclude that the distribution of
post-tax income in any one year is moderately more equal than
the distribution of pre-tax income. The difference, however,
is not dramatic.

          Because personal taxes have grown faster than pre-tax
income (Table ),    it seems obvious that subtracting them from
Census income each year would increase the trend toward equality.
Yet a careful study of the 1950-1970 period by Reynolds and

Smolensky   (1977) contradicts this supposition. They conclude,
instead, that while taxes equalized the distribution of any
one year, taxes had almost no effect on the trend in inequality

of after-tax income.37 Why the discrepancy? Reynolds and

Srnolensky (1977) show that federal personal taxes became less

progressive between 1950 and 1970 for several reasons, the

most important of which were (a) the increasing importance of
the payroll tax relative to the income tax, (b) the decreasing
progressivity of the income tax.
Transfers In Kind

           Recent years have witnessed a sharp controversy, both
in academic journals and in the popular press, over the extent

to which adding transfers in kind to income would change the

portrait of inequality in postwar America. The controversy is
over the nJy dimensions of the effect, not its aual.itative
direction, since no one disputes that (a) transfers in kind
have grown much faster than factor incornes,8 and (b) the
distribution of transfers in kind is much more pro-poor than

the distribution of factor incomes. These undisputed facts

are enough to conclude that more equality in any given year
and a stronger trend toward equality would emerge if the
distribution of income were adjusted to include transfers in
kind. But how much more?
           The reason for the controversy boils down to this.
While   it is   straightforward to estimate the total volume of
in-kind programs such as food stamps, public housing, public
education, and medical services provided under Medicare and
Medicaid, it is not quite so straightforward to distribute these
                                                                39.

totals   among income groups. And it is even more difficult to
decide how to price them out. Treating a dollar spent on a
transfer in-kind as equivalent to a dollar received in cash

seems inappropriate unless the transfer in kind provides
precisely what the consumer would have used the extra cash to

purchase. However, there are two cases in which transfers in
kind are just as good as cash.39 The first is when the government
provides goods that the consumer would otherwise have purchased

anyway, and provides          of them than the consumer would have
bought for himself. In this case, the transfer in kind does
not affect budget allocation decisions and is equivalent to a
cash transfer. Food stamps come close to fitting this pattern;

it is arguable whether Medicare-Medicaid do. However, it seems

clear that public education and public housing are not of this
character. The second case is where the good that is distributed
can be resold with insubstantial transactions costs (e.g., a

transferable ration coupon). It is clear, however, that few,
if any, public programs fit this second model.

          Apart from these exceptional cases, it is conceptually
clear that transfers in kind are worth less to recipients than
what they cost to provide. But how much less? This question
can only be answered by positing some utility function and

assessing the cash equivalent (in utilityterms) of each
transfer in kind. An excellent recent study by Smolensky
         (1977) did   precisely this, and concluded that the cash

equivalent   of l in either food stamps or rent supplements was
                                                                        'V




essentially l, but that l spent on either public housing or
Medicare/Medicaid was worth substantially less than l to
recipients .1

         Table 18 summarizes the results of two conflicting

studies of the effects of transfers in kind on the distribution

of income in 1972, under the (possibly false) assumption that
such transfers should be valued at full cost. The adjustment

adds between 1.8 and 2.3 percentage points to the share of the

poorest fifth of families, depending on whose assumptions about
the volume and distribution of noneducational transfers we use,2

and subtracts a like amount from the share of the richest fifth.

These are substantial changes. However, the increment to the
share of the lowest fifth would be reduced by about 0.5 percentage

point if transfers in kind were valued at 7070   of   cost iristead.1
        We are thus far from agreement over how large the
effect of transfers in kind has been on the postwar trend

toward equality. After a series of papers by Browning (1976,
1979) and Srneeding (1979a, 1979b), airing this and a number of
other issues, it appears (Smeeding, 1979b) that Brownings
adjustments (including one for transfers in kind) raise the share
of the lowest fifth of families in 1972 from . /0 in the raw
data all the way to         Srneeding's corrections, by contrast,
raise it only to 6.510. The difference is hardly inconsequential,
though only part of it traces to their divergent treatments of

Cash Transfers

            This seems an appropriate time to ask how large an
equalizing effect cash      transfers   have had on the distribution
of income. Unlike the other concerns of this section, this
does not constitute a "correction" of Census income, since

Census income already includes cash transfers; but the issue

seems important enough to merit special attention.
            By how much do cash transfers reduce income inequality
in any given year? A number of studies have tried to answer
this question, with relatively good agreement that cash transfers
have decreased the Gini ratio by about 12io in recent years.

Taussig's (1973) study shows that the equalizing impact of cash
transfers is much greater than that of taxes. The study by

Smolensky t i. (1977) enables us to compare the equalizing
effectsof cash and in-kind transfers with the following results:
                        Reduction in the Gini Ratio

                  From cash transfers            -.014.6

                      valued at full cost        -.027
                        valued at cash
                        equivalent               -   .016
Clearly cash transfers are much more important as equalizers,
even if transfers in kind (including educational transfers)

are valued on a dollar for dollar basis. If we adjust for the

estimated lower value of certain transfers in kind, the

predominance    of cash transfers is even clearer.
                                                                 14.2.




            I conclude that cash transfers are a very major source

of income equality--substantially more important than either

personal taxes or transfers in kind. The equalization is
accomplished mainly by raising the incomes of the lowest fifth.
But what of the trend in inequality? As Table 14. showed, transfers
have become an increasingly important source of income since

1957, and especially since 1967. We also know that the lower
income strata receive a disproportionately large share of these
transfers .                         cash transfers pushed the
                 Thus it is clear that
distribution of income in the direction of greater equality
during the postwar period. For example, Danziger and Plotnick
(1977) estimated that transfer payments reduced the Gini
coefficient by .069 (or 114..14.To) in 19714. compared to only .014.8
(or   1110) in 1965.

            While this is a noticeable effect over so short a

period   of time, it   is surprising that the explosive growth of
transfers did not push inequality down even faster. Three
reasons suggest themselves. First, transfer payments may
create disincentives for earning income that disequalize the

distribution of factor income. Second, these transfer payments
may have helped finance the splitting up of family units that

led to increasing inequality. Third, Reynolds and Smolensky
(1978) have suggested that transfers and other government

programs follow a typical life cycle pattern that dulls their
initial redistributive thrust. Specifically, as redistributive

programs    mature and reach a wider clientele, their benefits
                                                             1l3.



become less concentrated o.- the poor. Thus, as the benefits

from these programs grow larger in the aggregate, they simultaneously
start t be distributed in a less pro-poor manner.
Other Income In Kind

             Transfers in kind have already been discussed, but
some factor payments are also made in kind rather than in cash.

Major items here include food and lodging consumed by farmers

and farm workers, fringe benefits that are either partially

or totally subsidized by employers (e.g., medical insurance,
company cars), and the benefits that many self-employed individuals
siphon out of their businesses (unbeknownst to the tax collector).
On balance, it is quite unclear to me whether including this
potpourri of items would increase or decrease measured inequality
in   any given year, though both Schultz (1975) and Henle (1972)
have speculated that they are disequalizing. There are no
studies that shed much light on this issue.6
             Nonetheless, I would still hazard a guess that, were

we able to measure it, the addition of (nontransfer) income
in kind to the CPS data would lead to a more disequalizing

trend. One reason is that food and lodging consumed on farms
(which is distributed in a pro-poor manner) has declined as
a fraction of all income in kind, while fringe benefits (which
are distributed in a more pro-rich pattern) have increased
dramatically. another reason was mentioned earlier: the farm/
nonfarrn income differential is exaggerated by omission of income

in   kind.
                                                             14I..



        L2J.a!.
           It has   often been suggested that the CPS understates

the degree of income inequality because it excludes capital

gains--which accrue almost exclusively to the rich. And the
one scrap of evidence we have on this issue supports this idea.

When Smeeding (1979a) distributed an aggregate of accrued

capital gains constructed by Browning (1976) among families
for the year l972, he found that the share of the highest
fifth increased by l.1.i. percentage points.

           I am dubious about the value of this exercise because

many, indeed most, capital gains are not gains of real purchasing

power, but simply represent maintenance (or rather partial
maintenance)  of principle in an inflationary world. Obviously,
if tl inflation rate is 87°, a 5O stock must increase per
year just to maintain its real value. These      increments, if
they   occur, are not gains in real terms. A careful study by
Eisner (1980) shows that over the 1911.6-1977 period as a whole,

the more than 3 trillion in nominal capital gains that households

received failed (by a very small margin) to provide compensation
for inflation. "Real" capital gains, in a word, were as often
losses as gains.

          Because of the extremely pro-rich pattern by which
capital gains are distributed, it is clear that their inclusion
would      qaize the      income distribution in any. year for

which aggregate real gains are positive (as Smeeding and Browning
found). But it is equally clear that including capital gains
                                                           1.5.


would guaiize the distribution of income in any year for
which aggregate real gains are negative. Since gains were
roughly zero in an "average" postwar year, I conclude that the
omission of capital gains in the CPS data is not misleading on
average, though it does conceal some sizeable variations in
inequality   from year to year.
           What of the trend? Eisner's (1980, Table 3) data
on real capital gains as a fraction of disposable income show
violent fluctuations but absolutely no trend.8 It is thus
highly unlikely that the omission of capital gains distorts

our picture of the postwar trend in income inequality.


           The CPS is plagued by underreporting of all sorts of
income. But the two biggest underreporting problems come at

opposite   ends of the income distribution: transfer payments

(which are received mainly by the poor) and property income

(which is received mainly by the rich). As a consequence,
a correction for underreporting would raise the incomes of

both the poor and the rich relative to the middle class, making
it unclear whether measured inequality would rise or fall.
What a series of such corrections might do to the postwar
trend in inequality is totally obscure.



           Table 19 summarizes this section by bringing together
estimates, many of them admittedly dubious, of the effects on

the distribution of income of all the adjustments discussed

here. The overall conclusion seems to be that patching up
the Census income concept probably would lead to a distribution
                                                           li.6.


of   income with noticeably more equality in any one year, but

only a j1] stronger trend toward equality over the postwar
period as a whole.

          While there is a good deal of guesswork involved, it
is conceivable that all the adjustments together might reduce

the level of the Gini ratio by about .050 in any one year--a
change which exceeds by far the difference between the highest
and lowest Gini ratios recorded in Table 1I..   For the share of

the poorest fifth of families, it is clear that transfers in

kind are the most important adjustment, though personal taxes

and underreporting also matter. For the share of the richest

fifth. of families, transfers in kind, personal taxes, and (in

some years) capital gains, are all quite important.
          Where the trend in inequality is concerned, all the

adjustments together seem likely to lead to more equalization

through time, mainly because of transfers in kind. However,
the effects of improving the income definition seem unlikely to

be as strong as the effects of the demographic changes discussed
in the previous section.

          D. Measured Inqua1i and tAcçout ing_

more equal if income were measured over an accounting period
longer than a year because:

          (b) part of the inequality in any one year's income
distribution is due to the fact that people are at different

stages of their life cycles, and income varies systematically

by age.
          It is not obvious, however, that these considerations

have much bearing on the          in   inequality. The fact that
there are transitory income fluctuations will distort our picture
of the trend only if the variability of income has increased

or decreased systematically over time.      It is far from evident
that this is true. Similarly, the fact that life cycle
influences contributs to measured inequality, will alter the

trend only if these life cycle influences have grown more (or
less) important over time. Here, however, it has been claimed
that this is in fact the case- -that the gap between ann1.
income inequality and lifetime income inequality has increased
over the postwar period. 50 An examination of this controversy

is the major task of this section.

TransitorylncorneFluctua t ions

          The natural approach to correcting for transitory
fluctuations in income is to follow households through time
and average their incomes over multi-year periods. Up until
quite recently, there was a dearth of data with which to do
this. Kravis (1962) had studied a panel of households for

five years between 1914.9 and 19514., finding inequality (as

measured by the Gini ratio) over 5 years to be about l0'° less

than inequality in a single year. He had also examined 12
years of Delaware tax returns (1925-1936), and found the 12-year

Gini ratio to be 8° lower than the average of the 1-year Gini
                                                            4.8.



ratios.
          The availability of several panel studies in the U.S.

in recent years has verified Kravis' findings. Various sets
of panel data have been used by Benus and Morgan (1975),

Kohen, Parnes and Shea (1975), Hoffman and Podder (1976),

David and Menchik (1979) and others to reach the following

general conclusions.
          1. Gini ratios for income over 3 years generally are
about 3-570 lower than Gini ratios for l-year,1 though reductions
as large as 10% have been found.52

          2.   If we stretch the accounting period to 7 years,
the drop in the Gini ratio increases to 97o even if we restrict

attention to families with the same head throughout the period.53

          3. Because of the specific way it weights reductions
in inequality at various points on the Lorenz curve, the Gini

ratio seems to decline less as the accounting period is lengthened

than do other measures of inequa1ity.
If these sound like small adjustments, it should be remembered
that a lO'° decline in the Gini ratio (e.g., from .360 to .3214)
is absolutely collossal compared to anything we can find in the

time series data (see Table i.s.).



          It is clear that inequality over the lifetime is lower

than inequality in any one year, but here the absence of hard
                                                                 14.9.




 data make it necessary to resort to simulation and estimation

 techniques.

             My simulation study (Blinder, 19714.) "guesstimated"
 that    inequality in lifetime income was about 3O'/C lower than
 inequality in a single year if the Gini measure was used, but
 about 1O-5'o lower if the coefficient of variation was used to
measure inequality.55 Lillard (1977) estimated that the Gini
ratio for lifetime earning was about I1.50 less than that for

annual earnings in a very special group of American men. Gordon
 (1976) estimated that for a sample of white male heads of
households between 30 and 55 years of age, the share of the
 lowest fifth in lifetime income was 8.71°, compared to

 6.7'o    in annual income . Without actual    data, it   is hard to
know     how accurate these estimates are.6
             Our best guess is thus that the   difference between
 lifetime inequality and annual inequality is very great. But
is this important for interpreting the postwar trend in inequality?
To answer this, think of a population composed of different
age groups. Inequality can increase if:57
             1.   Inequality within age groups increases.
            2. The distribution of families across age groups

shifts toward groups with greater inequality.

            3. Income differences by age become more pronounced.
            What do the data tell us about each of these factors?
             1.   Data covering l9I7-l9614. reveal only weak downward
trends in age-specific Gini ratios.8 Danziger et al.          (1977)
found that if all age-specific Gini ratios had been constant.
at their 1965 levels, the Gini ratio for 1972 would have been
                                                            50.



(very slightly) lower than it was. Thus it seems that factor
1 was operative, but very weak.

           2. As noted earlier (see page         and Table 2),

changes in the age structure of families were substantial and

disequalizing. Over 1965-1972, Danziger et al. (1977) found
that the shifting age distribution added .011 to the Gini

coefficient (which increased in total by .016). Blinder
and Esaki (1978) created a time series of hypothetical income
distributions covering l914.7-1971- on the counterfactual assumption

that the age distribution did not change. They found that the
effect of the shifting age distribution on quintile shares,
while    disequalizing, was very modest.
            3. The data do show an increased arching in   the age-

income   profile, as Figure 3 illustrates.59 Danziger et a1
(1977)   attributed a    .005 increase in the Gini ratio between
1965 and 1972 to this factor. We lack a study of this factor
over a longer period of time.
            On balance, it seems clear that the shifting age

distribution and the increased curvature of the age-income
profile have caused income inequality to increase during the

postwar period, despite small declines in age-specific inequality.
But the magnitude of the effect seems modest.

            Yet, in a controversial paper, Paglin (1975) claimed
that    the shifting   age distribution counteracted what would

otherwise have been a very strong trend toward greater income

equality among families. Whereas the raw data (see Table iii.)

show rather little downward trend in income inequality between

19L1.7 and 1972 (a 1-.'7°   decline   in the Gini ratio), Gini ratios

that Paglin (197) presented as "corrected" for age factors
exhibit a very strong downward trend (dropping 217°).           It

behooves us to examine Paglin's calculations. Is his method
a valid way to "remove" the influence of the changing age

structure from the data?

           Paglin's technique for decomposing the Gini ratio is

straightforward. Begin by constructing a hypothetical Lorenz
curve on the assumption that all families of the same age (as

defined by the family head) have the same income, and use the
area between this hypothetical Lorenz curve and the actual

Lorenz curve (shaded in Figure ) as a measure of inequality
due to factors other than the life cycle. This simple
decomposition seems appealing at first, but does not survive
                    0
closer examination.

           Pyatt (1976), and before him Bhattacharya and Mahalanobis

(1967),   have   shown that the Gini ratio can be decomposed into
thr    components (not two): (a) a weighted-average of the age-
specific Gini ratios (or of any other desired grouping), (b) a
part dependent on the differences in average incomes across
                                                                            61
age groups, and (c) a part due to the overlapping of the groups.

Paglin is presumably interested in isolating

(a) above; but by subtracting term (b), he is actually left

with parts (a) and (c). Since part (c) has no intuitive

interpretation, the Paglin measure of age-corrected inequality

can exhibit strange behavior, as Danziger, Havernan, and Smolensky
(1977) have shown. In terms of the three age-related factors
enumerated on page       ,   Paglin's   procedure does not   succeed
in isolating factor 1.
         I conclude that while Paglin's basic point--that postwar

changes in life cycle influences on income distribution have
masked some of the trend toward equality--is correct, he has

probably exaggerated its quantitative significance.


         A    related point should be dealt with here. There is
considerable churning within the income distribution from year
to year. The same families do not always populate the bottom
fifth, the top 5/O, etc. If our real        concern (for welfare

purposes) is with income inequality over some lengthy period

oftime, then it is clear that we can get a good degree of
equality in either of two ways:
         1.     Families could occupy essentially the same relative
positions year after year, but the annual distribution (and
hence the multi-year distribution) could be quite equal.
         2. The annual distribution of income could be quite
unequal, but families could move around within the distribution
so much that the multi-year distribution of income was quite
equal.
           In this sense, income equa1iy and income rnoJy
are substitutes for one another.62 In fact, I am certainly not
the first to speculate that mobility occupies a more exalted
                                                                     53.


place in the American constellation of value judgments than

does equality. Americans seem quite willing to tolerate gross
disparities in incomes so laig as there is a reasonable chance

that low-income families in one year can become high-income

families in another year. With very little mobility, on the
other hand, even a Gini ratio of .300      might   be   considered
intolerable.

           The studies cited earlier, and several others as well,
seem to suggest a good deal of mobility in the U.S. income
distribution--especially near the bottom of the distribution6

and among the young.6 To cite just one summary statistic,
Lane   arid Morgan (1975) found that the rank correlation for family
money income between years 1 and 6 of the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics was only .ti?   (or   .61. among families with the same head

in the two years). While ghetto dwellers rarely trade places
with   Rockefellers, ours is not a   stratified society.


__ça_s pc ts of                 Ineguali
          Social scientists and philosophers have long been
intrigued by issues relating to equality in the abstract. Layman
and political figures, by contrast., have shown rather less
interest in equality than in such related (and more concrete)
issues as the plight of the poor, income differentials by
race, and income differentials by sex. Each of these special
aspects of income inequality has been the focus of a major public
policy initiative during the postwar period. For these reasons,
                                                                    514..




each of them merits special attention.


          As just noted, the revealed political preferences of
the American public show much less concern with inequality than
with the plight of the inhabitants of lower tail of the

                poor. As Lampman (1973) has remarked, this
distribution--the
country has never set a target for the Gini ratio. It has,
however, declared war on poverty and set specific targets for
its   reduction. Who is winning the War on Poverty?
DfininaPoverM6
        It turns out, however, not to be so easy      to separate

the   specific problem of poverty from the more general problem
of income inequality. The reason is clear enough. Income is
a continuous variable, whose distribution can be estimated.
Poverty, however, is a dichotomous variable: a family is either
poor or it is nonpoor. To decide who is poor, we must place
a "pove4y line" somewhere in the income aistribution, as

depicted in Figure 5, and count how many families (or people)

fall below it. Unfortunately, there are many ways to place
the line.
            At one extreme, we could base our poverty line on a

                            of poverty: a family is deemed poor

if and only if its income is insufficient to purchase. a prescribed
bundle of goods and services. Since the bundle is fixed, the

poverty line is increased only to adjust for inflation.      This

concept of poverty, which underlies the official poverty counts

of the U.S. government, has been criticized on many grounds.

          1.   It seems to contradict public   notions   of what

constitutes poverty. This point is obvious when we consider
long periods of time: the rich of centuries ago lacked many
of the conveniences that today's poor routinely have. But
Section 3 showed how dramatic changes in the standard of living
have been even over a period as short as 30 years. It would
be surprising indeed if the concept of poverty had not changed
accordingly, and evidence from public opinion polls and elsewhere

suggeststhat it has.66

          2. The bundle of goods and services is inherently

arbitrary. Who knows what items every family must have if it
is not to be deemed "poor?" Answers to this question are
arbitrary at best. Official definitions of poverty in the
United States are essentially obtained by defining a food budget

and tripling
          3.   It   is clear that economic growth will eventually

pull almost everyone above any purely absolute poverty line.
Contrary to the Bible, there would be no meek left to inherit

the earth This definition seems to make the War on Poverty
too easy to win.
          The unexceptionable idea that what constitutes poverty

is culturally, not biologically, determined leads us away from

a purely absolute standard of poverty. But where do we stop?
We could go all the way to a                                and define
the poor as the lowest 2010 of the income distribution. Under

this   definition, the "War on Poverty" would be unwinnable bi
                                                                     56.


definition; and   the Bible would be literally correct: ye have
the poor always with you. Personally, I find this to be not an
unattractive definition of poverty. However, it does require
that we amend the poverty-reduction goal. Counting the poor
will no longer do; instead, it is natural to study trends in
the share of total income received by the lowest 20%. This,
of course, has been done at length in this chapter. By this

definition, the "special" problem of poverty has already been
considered, with the conclusion that poverty has been eroding--but

slowly.

          There are, of course, intermediate grounds between purely
absolute and purely relative standards of poverty. Poverty lines

based on "minimum decency" budgets recognize psychological as
well as physical needs, and are periodically adjusted to reflect
changing norms and mores. Between adjustments, of course, they
function just like fixed budgets, and so are close cousins to

strictly absolute definitions of poverty. They also share the
arbitrariness of the fixed budget standard. 68

          A different intermediate choice comes much closer to

the purely relative concept of poverty: define the poor as
those families with incomes below X%        of   the median. Fuchs
(1967) suggested such a standard with x=50. While this
definition allows the poverty population to shrink or expand

jrincip1e, inractice          it   has amounted to defining the poor
                     69
as the lowest 20%.        Thus no definition of poverty is

unobjectionable.
                                                                    57.




            A related set of points is worth making here. If

we are to enumerate the poor, we must decide what types of

recipient units to count (families? persons?), we must select
a definition of income, and we must pick an accounting period.
This all sounds familiar. The issues and problems are exactly
the same as in our lengthy discussion of income inequality--and

so is the sensitivityof the poverty count to the choices we
make. Official poverty counts, it should be noted, are based
on Census income- -a concept which, we have seen, apparently

hides an upward trend (of uncertain amount) in the share
of the bottom fifth. The demographic shifts studied earlier

are also worth recalling, since many of them have served to
increase the poverty population under official definitions.

Finally there is the accounting period. Official poverty counts
make no attempt to distinguish those who are permanently poor

from those who are temporarily poor (owing, for example, to a

large capital loss).70 Given the amount of mobility that has
been found at    the lower end of   the income distribution, this

may    be an important problem.
Who Are the Poor?
         Having said all this, let us see who the official data
classify as poor. According to the latest data (for 1977),
9.3%of    all   families and 22.6% of all unrelated individuals
fell   below official poverty lines. Persons in families constituted
about 807° of the poor, and almost half of these were in families
                                                                58.

 headed by a female--a female headship ratio far higher than
 that for the population as a whole. The poverty rate was only
 5.5% for male-headed families, but 32% for female-headed
 families. Among poor unrelated individuals, almost two-thirds
 were female.71 Relative to the population as a whole, the

 poor were also more frequently black, less educated, and lived
 in larger families.72

         Alternative definitions of income or concepts of
 poverty give rather different poverty counts, however.    Table 20,
 for example, shows how the fraction of persons classified as

poor changes as we adjust either the income concept or the
definition of poverty. The upper lefthand entry is the official

poverty count for 1976: just under 12 percent of all persons
were considered poor. A relative poverty definition73 raises
the count to l.1Io of the population--a 3O7 increase in the

number of poor people. Altering the definition of income by
deducting direct taxes, adding income in kind, and correcting
for underreporting (which, we know, is very serious for transfer
income) cuts the poverty count drastically--to only 6 1/2/0

         How has the poverty count behaved through time?

Figure 6 plots four different estimates. The official data,
using Census income and an absolute definition of poverty,

show rapid progress against poverty from 1959 (when the data

begin) until about 1969. Thereafter, the fraction of families
who are classified as poor almost levels off (it is 9.7%   in

1969 and 9.310   in   1977), while the fraction of 3ane1ated
individuals   so classified   continues to tumble. The other
two series use persons as the recipient unit, and are

available only since 1965 (and not for every year). There is
no discernible trend in relative poverty based on Census money

income. bsoLute poverty based on income adjusted for taxes,
in-kind income, and underreporting does show a downward trend,
though fluctuations are severe.

         The conclusion, then, seems to run something like
this. The official poverty count declined smartly through the
1960s, but has been stagn'ant since then. This constancy, however,
is due to the dominant position of families in the aggregate;
the incidence of poverty among unrelated individuals continued
to fall. If we fix up some of the pitfalls with Census income,
there appears to have been c.nsiderab1y more progress in the
War on Poverty. But if we adopt a relative poverty concept

rather than the official poverty lines, there has been much
less.

         One final word seems in order. Whether we use official

poverty lines or a relative poverty concept, Table 20 shows
that many fewer people are poor after (cash) transfers than
before transfers. The trends in pre- and post-transfer poverty
are also quite different. By official definitions, the poverty
rate for all persons declined 2t.i-10 between.l965 and 1976.
But, there is alnost no trend in the poverty rate based on

income minus (cash) transfers.7 Transfers, in a word, have
been the chief weapon in the War on Poverty.

           B.     Black-White Income Differentials'6
           It is, of course, well-known that nonwhite individuals
and   families typically have lower incomes than whites.         For
example, the ratio of mean income among nonwhite families and
unrelated individuals (Ulls) to that among whites averaged

.89 (with       standard deviation .057)   for   the postwar period as
a whole.

           However, there was a substantial narrowing of the

differential during the period. Figure 7 charts the behavior
of the nonwhite/white income ratio since l9L1.7, for families

and UI's pooled. The upward trend from .52 in 191VT to .68
in 1975 is clear and unmistakable, though there
has been some slippage since then.           The gains scored by
blacks between 196 and l68 are particularly iinpressive.7

           The economic position of blacks relative to whites is
far from uniform across different demographic groups. In 1977,

for example, the black/white mean income ratio was .63 when
averaged over all families. But for families with a head aged
18-2L., it was .97 while for families headed by a              year
old it was .57. Similarly, the ratio was .76 for male-headed
families versus .6I. for female-headed families.

           Several demographic forces limited the economic gains
achieved by blacks, however. First, there was a substantial
increase in the fraction of families headed by females--which

rose from 28° in 1967 to 37% by 1976.78 Second, the labor
force participation rate of black men declined somewhat--from

85/o    in   1951 to 71% in 1977, with much of the drop accounted
for by the elderly.79 This occurred despite an increase in
black earning rates relative to those of whites.      However,
relative  earnings gains were greater for women than for men.
 Indeed, something close to full parity between the races was
achieved among females working full-time full-year. The black/
white   earnings ratio for such workers rose from .56 in 1955
to .93 in 1977.80

             Thus the improvement in the black/white income ratio
was the net result of a confluence of forces, some of which

were equalizing and some of which were disequalizing. On
balance, however, there can be no question that the relative
economic position of blacks improved substantially during the

postwar years. Equally clear      is the fact that--except in isolated
instances--parity     has not yet been achieved.
             C. Male-Female Income Differentials
             When we come to consider income differentials between
men and women     (or between male- and female-headed families)
a rather     different picture emerges. As Figure 8 shows, the
ratio of female to male incomes dropped from )-i.8% just after

World War II to only tOio by 1960, hovered in a narrow range

between 1.O/o and l4iYo between 1960 and 1969, and rose in
recent years to ju/0

             Part of this huge income differential--which is wider
than that between blacks and whites- - is due to the fact that

more women than men work part time or for only part of each year.

But Figure 8 shows that even women who worked full time for a

full year typically had incomes only about 5U/o     as large as those of
their male counterparts. (Earnings differentials show much
the same pattern. )   Differentials   in incomes between male- and

female-headed families paint an even more pessimistic picture.

Female-headed families averaged 73'°of the income of male-headed

families in 1917, but only 50t70   in 1977. Indeed, as Lampman
(1977) has remarked, the lack of progress in narrowing male-female
differentials is almost unique in a period when black-white,

North-South and other differentials were being reduced. The
sharp increase in female labor force participation rates

suggests itself as the leading explanation of this lack of

progress, although that just raises another question: why did
female participation rates rise so much?81




                                             i_Jfl9,
         This section seeks to remedy some of the omissions

caused by the myopic concentration thus far on income as the
measure of well-being. The discussion is necessarily less
systematic, less quanbitative, and more impressionistic than
the discussion of income.

         A. Leisure Time
         When an economist is asked to go beyond income as a

measure of economic well-being, the first thing he thinks of
is leisure. (Indeed, this is often also the la thing he
                                                                    63.


thinks   of.) It would seem that if two individuals have the

same wage rate82 but earn different incomes because they

voluntarily work different hours, then the best first guess

is that they are equally well off.       Income inequality that

arises from voluntary choices between work and Leisure, then,
is   not to be considered a social ftbad. ,83
•




            Leisure time can be expanded in several ways. The
number of hours worked per week can shrink.8 The number of
(fuiltime equivalent) weeks per year can decline because of

longer vacations and more paid holidays. Or the number of years

of   retirement,   can be increased. As we shall see, each of these

factors has been operative during the postwar period.        I


begin    with hours of work.
Hours of Work Per Week
            It   is, of course, well known that the work week has
shrunk over the long sweep of history. Indeed, the extent of
this shrinkage is often exaggerated. We have probably all
heard stories about how a work week of six or seven 12-hour

days was "typicalT' around the turn of the century. But the

data belie these grisly tales. The average manufacturing worker
at the turn of the century apparently worked about six 10-hour

days per week--an average work week of 9 hours.8 Hours outside
of   manufacturing   were typically shorter yet, so the average
                          •                        86
worker in all industries worked only 53 hours.          From 1900

to 19L7 therewas a steady downward trend in the average work

week among manufacturing workers, which reached           hours by
                                                                   6L.


             It is often claimed that the decline in the typical
work week ended around World War II, and that since then
American workers have taken their increased leisure in the form
of fewer weeks per year. This widely-held view derives from
looking only at hours per week injtianufacturing, which by 1977
accounted     for just 2I° of total employment. Here the decline
inthe work week did indeed halt: it was 1O.3 hours long in
1977. But more than three-quarters of the U.S. labor force
works in other industries; and in these industries the decline
in the average work week has continued throughout the

postwar period (see Table 21).      I conclude that American workers

decreased their average work week by about lOi° during the

postwar period. Manufacturing workers (a shrinking minority)
were a notable exception.
Weeks of Work Per Year

             Data are scarcer for the number of work weeks (or

days) in a year. Lebergott (1976, p. 91) reports that the
percent of nonfarm workers taking vacations increased from nearly
zero in 1930 to 60% in 190 and 8o/° in 1970. He also cites BLS
data that the typical American worker had 7 paid holidays.
While we do not know this for a fact, it is not hard to imagine
that the spreading incidence of vacations and paid holidays
may have reduced the typical work year by 2 weeks (about lo)
or   more.

Incidence of Retirement

         another remarkable development of the postwar period

has been the increasing prevalence of retirement, especially
for men.88 The labor force participation rate for men 6
years of age and older fell from 11.7.8% in 19t1.7 to only 20.1/°

in 1977; for men aged 55_6.1., the decline was from 89.6/° to

71O89 Reimers (1976) compared men who reached age 65 around
1933 with men who reached age 6 around 1963 and concluded
that the younger generation devoted about 2 percent fewer years
of its life to work than did the older generation.

            It takes more than a little chutah to combine this
guesstimate with my seat-of-the-pants estimate that more

vacations decreased the work year by about LI.tY°, and with data

showing a 107° decline in the average work week. But, if we
do all this, we are led to conclude that working time over a

typical career has decreased about 16'/° during the postwar period.

While this is a substantial amount, it probably means that

leisure time expanded more slowly than the consumption of
market goods and services.90 Evidence that leisure time is a

luxury good is lacking.
Housework

         There is, however, one other important aspect of
declining work effort that ought not escape our attention.

Lebergott (1976) has estimated that the typical housewife spent

about 12 hours on housework per day in 1900, but only 5 hours
                                                                66.


in    1966. Stafford arid Duncan (1977) cite data from time   diaries
showing that married women spent about 27 hours per week on
work in the home. How much of this decline in the housewife's
work day took place since World War II is not known. But if

we attribute half of the 8-hour-per-day decline to the postwar

period, then the postwar decline in the work day for housewives
would be about O/o    .   This may be an overestimate,91 but it
does seem that housewives have improved their lot relative to

paid workers in the pcstwar period.92 Family leisure thus
probably increased faster than leisure time of the principal

The Valuation of Leisure
            much is this increasing leisure worth? There
seemto be two basic approaches to the valuation of leisure
time, though each has many variants. The first approach tacitly
or    explicitly posits a utility function that combines both
income (or consumption) and leisure time into a composite measure
of well-being. The major alternative is to convert     leisure
time into money by using the market wage. While

the                  utility-function approach is obviously
conceptually superior, it faces one (insurmountable?) problem:
ho knows what the right     utility function is?
The Distribution of Leisure and_Income
           What of the distribution of leisure time? Morgan and
Smith (1969), using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics,
                                                                  67.


found   a slight negative correlation between leisure and income,
but a slight positive correlation between leisure and the ratio
of income to "needs.t' Sirageldin (1969) constructed a distribution

of economic well-being based on leisure and the ratio of income
to "needs" for data from the Productive Americans Survey. He
found that well-being so defined was distributed more equally

than income. Taussig (1973) valued leisure at the wage, using
data from the Survey of Economic Opportunity, and obtained

very simi]ar results. "Full income" was slightly more equally

distributed than money income. Browning (1976) and Browning
and Johnson (forthcoming) made two different adjustments for

non-working time, and found very substantial equalizing effects.
           The conclusions seem o be, therefore, that
           (a) leisure is distributed somewhat more equally
than income;

           (b)   leisure has a slight negative correlation with
income;
            (c) more comprehensive measures.of economic well-being
that    include both leisure and income are distributed more
equally than income alone.
Involuntary_"Lsure"
           Having said this, we must not ignore the fact that
not all "leisure" time is taken voluntarily. A person who is

disabled or involuntarily unemployed does, not want to "buy"
                                                                68.



all    the leisure he gets at the going wage rate. For him, the
wage clearly overestimates the marginal value of leisure time.
While there is no satisfactory way at present to decompose

unemployment   time into vo1untaryTT and "involuntary" components,
it is at least worth pointing out that the incidence of total
unemployment is highly uneven. The young, the black, and the
female suffer most from unemployment. Involuntary leisure seems
concentrated at the lower end of the income distribution. It
is hard (for me at least) to imagine that this pattern is
entirely the result of free choice.
           B. Wealth
           In purchasing the goods and services from which they
derive satisfaction, people are not restricted to their current
income if they have accumulated wealth on which they can draw.
So, if our real concern is with the distribution of economic
eli-being, data      on the distribution of wealth are a valuable

supplement   to data on the distribution of income.9
Sources of Data

           We know far less about the distribution of wealth in
the United States than about the distribution of income.

Certainly nothing comparable to the annual CPS exists for wealth.
What   meager knowledge   of the wealth distribution we have comes
from   three sources.
           First,   there have been a few surveys of wealthholding,
of   which the Survey of Financial Characteristics   of Consumers

(SFCC) for 1962 (Projector and Weiss, 1966) is undoubtedly the
best. But these surveys have been sporadic, scattered through
                                                               69.




time, and noncomparable; so they tell us little about trends
in wealth inequality. In addition, it is apparently very
hard to elicit accurate data on wealth holding from survey

respondents: even the assiduously planned and executed SFCC
was plagued by underreporting.96 Nonetheless, the SFCC data
on the wealth distribution in 1962 is undoubtedly the best
"snapshot" information we have.

           Second, estimates of the wealth distribution have
been made by the estate multiplier method. Briefly, this
method involves treating individuals who die in a part icu lar
year as a random sample (perhaps after some adjustments) of
those   who were living in that year. Then estate tax records
on the wealth of decedents can be used to infer the distribution

of wealth among the iiving.9 However, since only estates
above a certain amount (which for many years was 6O,OOO'
are required to file tax returns, the estate multiplier method
can yield information only about the extreme upper tail of the
wealth distribution.

          Finally, a clever investigator can piece together scraps
of information from which he can create an estimate of the

distribution of wealth (Lebergott, 1976). While
this                 technique may be promising, it involves
considerable judgment and perhaps some guesswork in piecing
together disparate pieces of information, making time series
comparisons very difficult.
                                                                    70.




             The stylized facts of the wealth distribution in the
postwar United States are allegedly as follows:

              1.   Inequality in the wealth distribution far exceeds
that in the income distribution.

             There is no noticeable trend in wealth inequality.
             2.

         Qualitatively, fact 1 rests on a fairly secure base;
but we remain uncertain of its quantitative dimensionsowing to
the paucity of data. The SFCC found the Gini coefficient for
wealth      to be .76, as compared to a Gini. ratio for income in the

same population of •3•98 Lansing and Sonquist (1969, p. 50)
epofted Gini ratios for       wealth   within   age cohorts in the 1953
and 1962 Surveys of Consumer Finances ranging from .62 to
Feldstein (1976), however, has pointed out that these wealth

data exclude an important source of wealth which is both very

large in the aggregate and very equally distributed: the
discounted present value of future social security benefits.

When   he   added estimates of this "social security wealth" to
the fungible wealth of those consumer units in the SFCC with

heads between 35 and 61s. years    of age, the Gini ratio dropped
from .72 to .51. The top 1'°of wealthholders held 28.Y/°
of fungible wealth, but only 18.9% of total wealth. This
adjustment, as dramatic as it is, does not overturn the

conclusion that wealth is more unequally distributed than income.

              George Stigler (1973) once asked in another context,
"Is this fact in fact a fact?" Our second "fact" may not be.
                                                                     71.




 What we know from estate multiplier estimates by Lampman (1962)
 and   Smith and Franklin (1971s.) is that the share of the very,

 very wealthy fell somewhat between the 1920s and the 191i.Os, and

 has been relatively constant since then. Thus the alleged
 stability of the wealth distribution is based on the experience
 of the tg j2J°     (or   at best the top 1%).    It hardly needs to
 be stated that the lower 99     1/2° might   have had a different

 experience. Furthermore, Feldstein (1976) has pointed out that
 the explosive growth of (very equally distributed) social

 security wealth doubtless imparted some equalizing trend to the
 wealth distribution.



           This look at the wealth distribution was motivated

 by a need to supplement information on income inequality. For
 this purpose, however, we need to know the joint distribution
 of income and wealth across individuals. Only survey data can

 give us this information. The SFCC data show a strong positive

 correlation between income and wealth,10° which can hardly be
 cons idered surprising.

           The most natural way to combine the distributions of
 wealth (a stock) and income (a flow) is to add the annuity
 value of net worth to Census money income, and then subtract

 current property income to avoid double-counting. Weisbrod

 and Hansen (1968) did approximately this in combining the SFCC
 with the 1962 CPS, but were forced to merge the two data sources

 in a very crude way. They found that the Gini ratio of .37

for Census income became .2 when the annuity value of net

worth was added at a k% interest rate and .17 when a io%
                                                                       72.



interest rate was used. Taussig (1973) combined income and
net worth information from the same data source, using a 6/°

interest rate, and found that the Girii ratio was almost unchanged

unless substantial corrections were made for underreporting of

net worth. After those corrections, the Gini ratio rose from
.361 to .393. Taking account of the distribution of wealth
thus seems to increase the degree of inequality.



              Whatever benefits the extended family may have brought
to its members, they came at a cost of increasing household
congestion and loss of privacy. And,apparently, Americans in
the postwar period prized the reduced congestion and increased
privacy more than the benefits of the extended family. Data
on   the rapid growth of      the number of unrelated individuals--

especially      young and old people living alone--were cited
earlier in this chapter (see pages 00-00). Table           22 offers
further   data on this subject.
              The Census Bureau defines a subfarni    as   either a
married couple (with or without children), or a single parent
with one or more unmarried children, living in the same household
as another family to which they are related. The number of
subfamnilies     so   defined thus seems a good indicator of the number

of   extended families, though single grandparents would not be
counted as subfamilies. Part A of Table 22 shows that the
absolute number of subfamilies fell by almost two-thirds between

19LV7   and   1977.101 In l9J7, almost 910 of primary families had

 another related family living with them. By 1977, this fraction
 was down to barely over           •
                                       Furthermore, about three-quarters
 of these subfarnilies in l917 included both parents, whereas by
 1977 less                     than half of all subfamilies had two
 parents. Data in Part B on the number and frequency of married
 couples living in the household of some other family (not
 necessarily a related family) tell a similar story.

         A phenomenon related to living apart from relatives is the
decline in the number of boarders and lodgers in American households

'--living apart from non-relatives. According to data put together
by Lebergott (1976), the percentage of urban households with a
boarder or lodger decreased from 2 ° in 1900 to 1- /0 in 191l and to
only 2'° in 1970. The lodger, in other words, almost disappeared
from the scene during the postwar period.
         Data germane to this phenomenon appear in       Part C of Table 22
The Census defines a "secondary family" as         two or more persons
related    to one another but not related to the primary family. This

category includes guests, lodgers, or resident emoloyees; but since
single individuals are not counted as secondary families, most
lodgers are excluded in this count. Nonetheless, as many as 2              1/2%
of primary families shared their homes with such an unre1aed

secondary family in l97.          Almost none did by 1970.
D.   Health
         it will   not   be considered heretical to assert that, at equal
levels   of consumption and leisure, healthier people are better off.
And it i uite clear that the health of the Anerican pecple has
improved considerably during the postwar period.
      Perhaps the most useful summary statistic representing the
state of health is life expectancy. Table 23 displays data on life
expectancies at birth and at age 20. The increase in life
expectancy at birth was quite dramatic over the three decades, though

progress in this regard for men ceased around 1955. However, as
Part B suggests, a good deal of the improvement for men came in the

reduction of infant and child mortality. The life expectancy of a
man reaching aduicnooa   ir.creaeu   only 2 1/2 years trom 19Z1.0 to 1970
and has been virtually unchanged since 1955. (For women, however,
life expectancies have continued to imorove.)1By contrast, infant
mortality in 1970 was less than half what it was in 190.103
      Mortality and morbundity from many, but not all, serious

diseases has also fallen dramatically in the postwar period, as

Table 2Z. shows.
                                                     -
E. Social Indicators
      Not all indicators of well-being are pointing upward. As
Table 25 shows, the postwar period has witnessed a stunning increase
in the incidence of illegitimate children, a surge in the divorce
rate, and little or no progress against suicide. Furthermore, crime
has been one of our biggest growth industries. There is little cause
for cheer in any of this.



      "Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man health, wealthy,
and wise." This rhyme, I suppose, is meant to be a formula for

happiness. Americans, we have seen, are indeed considerably

wealthier and healthier than they were O years ago. They are
 also better educated.l0 Are they happier?
          This is not the sort of question an economist feels
comfortable      with--and with good reason. Nonetheless, a provocative
paper by Easterlin (l97li) attempted to answer this question by
studying opinion-poll data on people's self-proclaimed happiness.
Easterlin's findings for the United States are easily summarized.

At a given point in time, happiness seems clearly to increase
with economic status. However, as we look over time, there is
little if any upward trend in happiness despite noticeable

improvements in the average standard of living.

           These findings suggest one of two things. Either
"happiness" is a relative concept which depends (only) on each
person's situation relative to his peers, or that, regardless
of how   happy   people really are in an absolute sense, they tend
to   answer a survey question   like this by rating their happiness
relative   to their contemporaries. There is probably no operational
way of distinguishing between these two competing hypotheses,
though they are different. For example, if we compare a family
with income of 18,261. in 1977 and one with p3,5146 in 19Is7
(the means for the two years), the first hypothesis states that

they are equally happy while the second hypothesis states that
the 1977 family is happier on an absolute scale, but no more
happy on a relative scale--and responds to the questioner by

reporting on relative happiness. I personally find the
latter interpretation more appealing.

           We have seen in this essay that, according to the

official data, average incomes generally have been rising
during the postwar period while income inequality has been

relatively               Can we accept these "facts" at face value?

What   welfare   implications, if any, follow from them?



           The data show that per capita income and consumption
increased roughly 80% in real terms between 19!-7 and 1977.        In

addition to consuming mare of most goods and services, Americans

changed their patterns of consumption markedly. For the most
part, these redirections of spending seem recognizable as

improvements in the quality of life.      in addition, longevity
and health improved, leisure time expanded, and privacy increased.
Yet over the same period a number of social indicators (e.g.,

divorce, illegitimacy, crime) signal a deterioration in the

quality of life, and people report themselves no happier than
30 years ago. What are we to make of all this? Must we abandon
the use of income as a measure of well-being?

           My own impression is that we need not. For one thing,
our main use of income as a guage of well-being is cross-

sectional, and it still seems reasonable to view people with

higher incomes as "better off" at any moment in time--despite
                                                                    77.



 some anamolies. Second, even looking across time, my guess
 is that rising average income does indeed improve the human
 lot--though perhaps not by as much as the data suggest. Various

non-incomeaspects of well being, such as leisure time and health,
may not grow as rapidly as material consumption; growth may

produce a variety of well-known disarnenities (pollution,
                                                               congestion,
etc.); and we should not entirely ignore the message that

"happiness"    is perhaps a relativistic concept. While it    would
be   presumptuous   tocDncluc5e that people are 8010 "better off"
now than they were in l9t.7, it seems preposterous to conclude
that they are no better off.

           _ajsi.g.1 iyandEconornicweig
          Things    get quite a bit murkier when we turn our attention
to the trend (or lack thereof) in income inequality. During

the postwar period, a number of strong, and seemingly autonomous,

forces pushed income inequality higher.10 These include:
          *a shifting age distribution that left the 1977 economy
with relatively more old and young (and thus lower-paid)
members than the l9li.7 economy;

          *an increasing incidence of female headship of
families 106

          *changes in living arrangements that produced more
low-income units as extended families broke up, fewer families

took in lodgers and boarders, and more young and old people
formed their own households.
                                                                78.



         In brief, when we look at the U.S. economy from l9i.7

to 1977, we are not looking at a society unchanging in

composition by age, sex, and family structure. And most of
the demographic changes that occurred were the sort that produce

greater inequality, given our measurement procedures. Two
conclusions   follow. First, if we could measure the income
distribution at fixed demography, a trend toward equality would
emerge--a trend that the official data mask. Second, most of
the factors that served to increase inequality during the

postwar period do not signify deteriorations    in economic

well—being. Indeed, the opposite seems more likely. Measured
income inequality thus seems an unreliable indicator of

economic welfare.

         Despite these and other disequalizing factors, the
overall income distribution--as measured--did not become more

unequal. The main reasons seem to have been a variety of

government redistributive activities, including:
         *the rapid growth of cash transfers which, we have

seen, have been the principal weapon in the War   on Poverty;
         *the equally rapid growth of transfers in kind, which
are not included in the official data (another reason why the

official data understate the trend toward equality);
         *other programs such as affirmative action guidelines,

equal opportunity and anti-discrimination laws, and the like.
These programs have not been dealt with in this chapter because
we lack estiroatos of their effects on income inequality.107
                                                               79.



But I would be remiss not to suggest a possible link between

these governmental activities and the observed narrowing of
black/white income differentia is.

         It appears that, on balance, these competing sets of

factors--demography versus government--battled to a standoff.
Income inequality, as measured in the official data, was unchanged

between 1911.7 and 1977. But I would not want to push the analogy
to a tug-of-war too far, because there is reason to suspect
that the two sides were not independent. Specifically, government

programs designed to equalize post-tax post-transfer incomes
may well have helped disequalize pre-tax pre-transfer incomes.
For example:

         *It has often been suggested that redistributive tax
and transaer schemes have disincentive effects that, e.g.,

discourage labor supply among beneficiaries (the poor, the
elderly, etcj.108
         *It is conceivable, though here we know much less,
that transfer programs such as AFDC and social security may
have contributed to some of the changes in family structure and

living arrangements that were just labeled as disequalizing
factors (e.g., increases in female headship, more elderly

people living alone, etc.).

         *It is quite possible that expenditures on public
education (an apparently "equalizing" transfer in kind) were
among the factors leading to the more pronounced age-income

profile- -thus contributing to a growing gap between annual
and lifetime inequality.

No wonder, then, that in the wonderland of inequality:
    • . . it takes all the running you can do,
    to keep in the same place. If you want to
    get somewhere else, you must run at least
    twice as fast as that

Census income, and so these distributions are not directly comparable

 The coefficient of time was -.0022 (with standard error .ooo).).
 The sum of the coefficients of time and the interaction term,

Gini ratio only to keep the volume of data manageable. Inspection
of   the urerlying distributions reveals, fortunately, that there
are hardy any instances of crossing Lorenz curves--the circumstance
that would render the Gini ratio potentially misleading. The few

Lorenz curve crossings that occur are indicated in footnotes to
Table l. The year l96 was selected for this table because it
comes closest to being a TttypicalT postwar year.

there are no one-person families.

            3l will have more to say on the subject of age and the
income dstribution when I      discuss   the accounting period, since
the problems arise largely from measuring income in a particular

year rather than over the lifetime.

          32The section is limited to the family income distribution

both to save space and because most of the literature does the same.

          33Let us be clear about what this simple adjustment does
not do.   If we are interested in income as an indicator of well-beina,
as we are, then a proper "adjustment" for taxes and transfers

really requires resolution of every complex and controversial
issue in tax incidence theory. What portion of the value of any
transfer payment actually accrues to the recipient? What part
of the burden of a sales tax falls on the consumer of the product?

Can the income tax be shifted? It hardly needs saying that questions

like these are well beyond the scope of this chapter, and indeed

probably also beyond the scope of current economic knowledge.
My aim here is much more modest: to get the bookkeeping straight.

Specifically, subtraction of individual income tax oayments and
the employee's share of the payroll tax from Census income (the

employer's share is already excluded), is n meant to imply that
the burden of these taxes falls entirely on those who pay them.

Nor does the absence of any deduction for indirect taxes imply
that they are totally borne by firms.

                  exception is Smeeding (1979a), who also deducts
indirect taxes.

          35This table is drawn from a detailed study of the 1972
distribution using micro data and the OBE income concept. The
findings correspond closely to those reported earlier by Budd
(1967) for    1962. Table 17 shows much less redistribution than

that implied by the data in Browning (1976).

             6on   this,    see Smeeding (1979a). Sales taxes are

usually viewed as regressive, but Browning (1978) argues that
they should be considered as progressive. Smeeding (1979c)

disagrees.

             37Browning (1976) reaches a similar conclusion.

             8According to Browning (1976), transfers in kind

(including public education) increased from 7.2°of Census income
tn 192 to 9/O      in   1962 and 11..6To in 1972.

             39For further discussion, see Smolensky et.al. (1977).

             °Their justification, I presume, is either on some

externality argument or on grounds o paternalism.

             1Smo1ensky etal. (1977) did not try to price out
public education by this method, which is difficult because the

market for private education is so thin and because public and
private education seem to be diffirent products.

                    volume and distribution of educational transfers
are apparently not in dispute.

             See Smeeding (l979a, p. 911).

             Lorenz curves for income before and after cash
transfers do not cross, so the Gini ratio is probably a

satisfactory summary statistic.           Studies alluded to include

Danz iger   and Plotnick (1977), Tauss ig (l97 ),     Smolensky et.a.
                                                                   F-7.

from 1965   to   19711..


            According to Browning and Johnson (forthcoming,
Table 1), in 1976 the lowest fifth of families (ranked by total

income) received 631°      of   its income in the form of transfers.

            6Smeeding (1979a) attempted an adjustment for

employer  pension contributions but, as Browning (1979) pointed
out, was guilty of double-counting since Census income includes
income from pensions. In principle, we might want to include
either pension contributions when made or pension income when
received, but not both.
                distribution assigned 68io of the gains to the
top fifth and 3%to the bottom fifth.
            8Real     capital gains as a percentage of disposable income
varied from +38% in 1958 to _511.% in 1911.6. A regression of this

ratio against time produced a coefficient that was essentially
zero.

declines in several measures of inequality ranging from 13° to

21° when the accounting period is lengthened from one year to
seven years. David and Menchik (1979) find an even stronger
effect: the coefficient of variation declines LY/°when income
over 3 years is used instead of annual income.

          55The coefficient of variation, a common measure of

dispersion, is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.

          65o1tow's (1965) study of the distributional history
of the town of Sarpsborg, Norway from 1928 to 1960 found that
the 33-year Gini ratio was 27% lower than the average of the
1-year Gini ratios. Blomquist (1976) estimated that the Gini
ratio for lifetime income among employed males in Sweden was about
half as large as the Gini ratio for annual income.

              70This is no trivial problem. The CPS each year finds
a number of families with negtive income (and Census income
excludes capital losses). For example, in 1977 the mean income

One wonders how many families with negative income are "poor" in

              73The poor are those below Ii-)4l°of the median income.

              These fluctuations may be due to inconsistencies in
estimation methods over time. See Plotnick and Smeeding (1979),

footnote 16.

          80The same ratio for men was also .6 in 1955,     but
improved only to .69 in 1977. See Thurow (1979).

          8The crucial words in these last two sentences, of

course, are "voluntarily" and "voluntary." Not all interpersonal
differences in hours of work are voluntary. More on this below.

          8Or there can be more leisure tinie on the job. On
this, see Stafford and Duncan (1977).

          8Historical Statistics. The work week comes from
series D-765, p. 168; the work day is reported as 9.89 hours in
Series D-8I7, p. 172.

          86Moore   and   Hedges (1971).

          8e older and       newer hours series are not entirely

comparable, though both display downward trends. The data series
cited in footnote8 ends in 1926, when average weekly hours are
50.3. The newer series used for postwar comparisons records a
value of l.5 for that same year.
                                                                    F-12.



               88Gordon and Blinder (1979) explore reasons for

this phenomenon.

               8Reimers (1976) shows that these data need not imply

that the mean age of retirement

has   decreased     and she estimates that it has been fairly constant
at around 65 years. The reason is that there are fewer and fewer

people who never retire.

               90Real consumption per capita rose about 8O°. The
percentage increase in leisure is the percentage                  in

working time multiplied by the initial ratio of work to leisure.

Ii    that   initial ratio was two, for example,   then leisure time
rose   )2/0.


                     it   is not clear that it is. Most of the work-

saving machinery that has helped the housewife became widespread

only after World War

                    should be noted, however, that housewives were
more overworked in 1900 than were paid workers. Housewives, it
seems, really did work the proverbial six or seven 12-hour days.

               93Yet one more qualification. Women are spending far
more time in the paid work force than they used to. So the

reduction in      housework often may not represent   more   leisure time.
          1Taussig (1973) makes an attempt at this. Browning
(1976) and Browning and Johnson (forthcoming) treat all non-working
time as voluntary leisure.
                                                                 F-13.



             95Were the lifetime used as the interval for

measuring income, there would be little need for separate data
on wealth. The present value of income would differ from (human

plus nonhuman) wealth only to the extent that inheritances differ

(in present value) from bequests.

             6rojector and Weiss (1966,p.61-62); Lebergott (1976,
pp. 217ff.).

             97For a discussion of the method, and examples of its

use, see Lampman (1962) or Smith (1971i.).

             99Since Gini coefficients within these age cohorts

were .70-.71 in the SFCC, the agreement between the two sources
is close.

             100Projector and Weiss (1966), pp. 6-7.

             101The year 1914.0 is included also to show the increase
in living together brought about by the war.

             102The extent to which longevity has increased is often

exaggerated. Life expectancy at age 60 for males increased only
1.1 years over the entire 30-year period, and only 0.2 years from

1955 to 1970. Life expectancy for 60-year-old females, however,
increased by Ii.   years between 1939-14.1 and 1970.
             10320   deaths per 1000 live births in 1970 versus 14.7

in 1914.0.

                  The word "autonomous" needs some explanation. I
do   not mean to imply that these forces were God-given or exogenous

in some ultimate sense, but only that they probably were not
themselves effects of the changing income distribution.

            lO6Among the many factors contributing toward this

development were higher divorce rates, more illegitimate births,

and changing social mores regarding the role of women. For a
u11 discussion, see Ross and Sawhill (1975).

            10They are dealt with in the chapter by Richard Freeman
on the labor market.

                     possible counterweight to this is   that withdrawal
of   labor supply may push up the relative wages of these groups.
