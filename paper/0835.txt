           EXPECTATIONS, LIFE EXPECTANCY AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR
                               ABSTRACT

       Unlike price expectations, which are central to macroeconomic theory

and have been examined extensively using survey data, formation of individ-

uals' horizons, which are central to the theory of life—cycle behavior,

have heen completely neglected. This is especially surprising since life

expectancy of adults has increased especially rapidly in Western countries

in the past ten years. This study presents the results of analyzing

responses by two groups——economists and a random sample——to a questionnaire

designed to elicit subjective expectations and probabilities of survival.

It shows that people do not extrapolate past improvements in longevity when

they determine their subjective horizons, though they are fully aware of

levels of and movements within today's life tables. They skew subjective

survival probabilities in a way that implies the subjective distribution has

greater variance than its actuarial counterpart; and the subjective variance

decreases with age. They also base their subjective horizons disproportion-

ately on their relatives' longevity, and long—lived relatives increase

uncertainty about the distribution of subjective survival probabilities.

       As one example of the many areas of life—cycle behavior to which the

results are applicable, the study examines the consumption—leisure choices

of the optimizing consumer over his lifetime. It finds that shortfalls in

utility in old age because people's ex ante horizons had to be updated as

average longevity increased are relatively small. This implies that large

subsidies to retirees under today's Social Security system cannot be

justified as compensation for an unexpectedly long retirement for which they

failed to save.

 I.   Introduction and Background


        Price expectations are central to modern macroeconomic theory. A

 large amount of empirical work has used survey data to analyze how

 expectations are formed (see Jonung, 1981; Jacobs and Jones, 1980, for

 recent examples), and survey results were used even earlier in analyzing

 inflation (see Turnovsky and Wachter, 1972). Central to the theory of

 the utility—maximizing consumer is the notion of the horizon. Yet there

has been no comparable examination of how individuals form expectations

about the horizons over which they maximize. This study begins to rectify

this deficiency and uses the results to examine one particular issue of

life—cycle behavior.

        Several theoretical models have considered more than a fixed

length of life: Yaari (1965) examined optimal lifetime consumption plans

under the assumption of a known, unchanging vector of survival probabilities;

Levhari and Mirman (1977) considered how consumption is affected by a mean—

preserving change in lifetime uncertainty; and Arthur (1981) has examined

how changing actuarial survival probabilities affect life—cycle maximization.

I use the survey data to discover the shape of the entire distribution of

subjective survival probabilities in order to examine whether empirical

work can rely on current life tables, and whether increases in life

expectancy that may motivate theoretical interest are incorporated in

individuals' expectations.

       Life expectancies of adults in developed Western nations have been


                                    1
                                   2



increasing at a remarkably rapid pace in the last fifty years, though the

maximum attainable age has not increased (Fries, 1980). (Throughout I

use the term "life expectancy" to denote expected age at death.) This

growth has been especially pronounced in the past decade. Consider the

data in Table 1 for whites in the United States.-' (These standard

measures from life tables show life expectancies based on the mortality

rates observed in each year; they do not show the probabilities of survival

facing a particular cohort as it ages.') They present a picture of

relatively rapid increases. For example, life expectancy among adult

whites age 45 increased by nearly two years in the 1970s, the most rapid

gain of any decade since 1910—1920. Similarly rapid increases appear to

have occurred in many other developed countries.-'1

       The data from life tables make it clear that the distribution of

survival probabilities facing the consumer has been changing rapidly.

Whether the typical consumer is aware of these changes and incorporates

them into his subjective survival probabilities can be inferred from the

survey data. This inference and the results on the shape of the subjective

distribution are used in Section IV to examine the extent to which imperfect

foresight about cohort life tables reduces utility. These findings suggest

the appropriate size of the intergenerational transfer required to maintain

consumption of members of a cohort that on average is living longer than

it initially expected.


II. The Consistency of Forecasts of Survival


       I seek to find how well subjective estimates of life expectancies

and survival probabilities meet a particular set of criteria that define

consistency, in the sense that they conform to available evidence and are

internally consistent. I judge people's beliefs about their own distribu-

tion of survival probabilities by the following criteria:

       1) Is the individual's subjective life expectancy internally

consistent with his subjective probabilities of attaining various ages?

       2) Is his subjective survival distribution consistéñt in shape

with actuarial survival distributions, or is it skewed?

       3) Actuarial life expectancy is higher for older people; do we then

find that subjective life expectancies are higher for older people? Still

more important on this issue of 4         C consistency,    is the representa-

tive individual's subjective life expectancy consistent with population

averages?

       4) Are subjective life expectancies expectationally consistent; that

is, do people extrapolate past changes in survival probabilities in forming

their own subjective distributions?

       5) Is the importance people attach to inheritance and personal

characteristics objectively consistent with evidence on their importance?

A. Data
       The information used to analyze these five questions was culled

from questionnaires sent to two groups of respondents.--' The first was a

set of 650 white male academic economists. Some were associates of a

well—known semi—private organization devoted to empirical economics; most

were randomly chosen from the American Economic Association, Biogr8phical

Listing of Members, 1978. 63 percent of those surveyed (411 men) returned

usable responses. The respondents range in age from 26 to 65 and correspond

with a growing population.'

       The economists' sample has the attraction that the respondents are

familiar with questionnaires and understand expectations and probabilities
                                       4


well; but this is a disadvantage insofar as it leads to responses that are

 unrepresentative of what a typical consumer would respond. Accordingly,

 questionnaires were sent to 975 people randomly chosen from the telephone

directory of a medium—sized Midwestern SMSA. Among the 47 percent who

responded, 363 were white males between ages 20 and 70 (who form the basis

from the analysis in this study)--".

         The questionnaire (see the Appendix) provided responses on (x + e),

subjective life expectancy, and on p0 and 8O' subjective probabilities

of survival to ages 60 and 80 respectively.-' Additional questions allowed

the construction of variables used to test for objective consistency.

Included in these are variables reflecting the experience of the consumer's

parents and grandparents, and others reflecting his own actions. In the

former group is a vector of dummy variables indicating the number of parents

and grandparents who died of natural causes before age 60, and another

indicating the numbers of survived to age 80. In the latter group are

three dummy variables indicating if the person: 1) Smokes more than five

cigarettes per day; 2) Engages in vigorous exercise more than once a week;

and 3) Had in the past been diagnosed as having an illness that could be

fatal.

         Table 2 presents sample statistics of the subjective estimates of

life expectancy and survival probabilities, and of the actuarial estimates

based upon the respondent's age. Most noteworthy among all our results

is the excess of (x + e) over (x +
                                           e),   the actuarial life expectancy,

in both samples and in subsamples stratified by age. At the very least

this suggests that subjective life expectancy reflects life expectancy from

today's life tables. That subjective exceed actuarial life expectancies

may   even   imply that the respondents extrapolate past increases in longevity.

              Though subjective exceeds actuarial life expectancy in both younger

and older subsamples, the subjective probability of survival to age 60 is

 less than the actuarial probability in the former subsamples, and In sub—

samples of 40—55 year—olds. This reversal hints there may be some internal

inconsistency in responses about subjective beliefs on survival. Finally,

mean subjective expectations and survival probabilities differ from their

actuarial counterparts by very similar magnitudes in the two samples. For

example, in the economists sample, (x + e8) —                     (x   + e°) =    2.31, while in
the random sample it Is 1.87 years. These two differences are not signi-

ficantly different from each other, and the larger figure for the economists

is consistent with the sparse evidence on differences In longevity by

occupation and educatlon..V

B. Internal Consistency and Skewness

              A test for internal consistency is provided by comparing deviations

of subjective from actuarial survival probabilities ([p0 —                               and
                                                                                   p0J
[pQ —         p])
               0
                      to the deviation of subjective from actuarial life expectancy

([es
      5   —   e]).     Clearly, some people will be optimistic on subjective

probabilities and pessimistic on expectations, and vice—versa; but an

inference that the population's expectations are internally inconsistent

with their subjective probabilities can be made only if there is a pre-

ponderance of optimists about expectancy who are pessimistic about pro-

babilities, or vice—versa. Tests for internal consistency are thus provided

by:


(1)           ZEi P(p <   pe5   >   e°)   —   P(p   >
                                                        pe5   <    e°),   i =    60,80

The statistics ZE1 are distributed binomially.
                                                  6



         Table 3 presents the estimated ZE1 for each sample and for subsamples

of younger and older workers. (Men 56+ are excluded because their

responses on p0 cannot be used.) Among the economists there is fairly

strong evidence of inconsistency between subjective expectations. and each

of the subjective survival probabilities. Moreover, the inconsistency

implies that the respondents' probability distributions are less optimistic

than their subjective responses on life expectancy imply. The results are

not so strong in the random sample, though some evidence for this same

finding exists when the entire sample is used. (Pooling both samples,

ZE6O =   .137,   t =   3.55;       ZE8O =   .064, t = 1.73.)          The results suggest

people think about survival probabilities differently from the way they

envision what we might equate with the "horizon," our measure e

Without knowing whether the complete subjective distribution, or just the

subjective life expectancy, motivates behavior, one cannot say which is

the more appropriate basis for analyzing life—cycle behavior; our results

show, though, that implications for behavior will differ depending on how

one models survival probabilities.

         Skewness in the distribution of subjective survival probabilities

relative to the actuarial distribution can be tested by examining the

statistic:


                                                       —
(2)      Z6080 =
                   P(p0
                               <
                                   p0p0      >
                                                 p0)       P(p0
                                                                  >
                                                                      p0p0 < p0)
Positive (negative) value implies the individual's subjective distributions

have more (less) variance than the actuarial distributions of survival

probabilities. (Alternatively, it implies that the subjective survival

function is flatter (.steeper).)

        Estimates of (2) are presented in the final column of Table 3.

Almost all are positive, and those for the random sample (except for

persons 40—55) are significantly positive. (Pooling both samples, Z6080

.0875, t =   2.22.)   The surveys provide some evidence that subjective

survival distributions have greater variance then does the actuarial

distribution. This result may be unsurprising, in that the subjective

distributions are based on each individual's views, while actuarial

distributions are based on population experience. It suggests, though,

that empirical work involving life—cycle behavior cannot correctly use

actuarial survival probabilities, but should at least skew these around

e0
      so that they have greater variance. Thus studies examining life—cycle

consumption (eg., Skinner, 1981) will go awry using actuarial measures, for

they will overestimate near-term survival and underestimate (compared to

people's subjective distributions) survival from 60 until very old age.

So too, studies that construct measures of lifetime earnings (eg., Irvine,

1981) to be used in empirical work based in the life—cycle model should use

weighted sums of earnings with weights based on actuarial data adjusted

for the skewness we have found.

C. Demographic and Expectational Consistency

        The sample statistics in Table 2 suggested that the respondents'

subjective life expectancy is roughly coincident with today's life tables.-'1

To evaluate the demographic consistency of expectations more formally,

consider the equation:


(3)     x + e5 =      + 1[x + e°]


If subjective expectations are consistent with today's life table,

E(0) = 0, and E(1) = 1; that is, the subjective mean equals the actuarial
                                   8



mean from current data, and men whose actuarial life expectancy is one

year greater respond that their subjective horizon is one year greater.

       Tests of these hypotheses can be made using the estimates in columns

 (1), (2), (5) and (6), in Table 4. The regressions that constrain           0
                                                                       I3,


 (columns (1) and (5)) show quite clearly that l is not significantly

different from one. However, the standard errors of estimate of the

unconstrained equations. (columns (2) and (6) are below those of the

respective constrained equations. (In each case the constant term is

significantly greater than zero at least at the 90 percent level.) This

result, along with the observation that    is withIn two standard errors

of one, but more than two standard errors above zero, suggests that people's

subjective horizons slightly exceed the actuarial horizon, but that demo-

graphic consistency describes differences by age quite well.

       I defined expectational consistency as requiring that subjective

life expectancy reflects the extrapolation of available information. To

formalize this, rewrite (3) as:


(4)    x + e        + 1[x + e ] — 2 e [x + e]


If people extrapolate past improvements in life expectancy (see Table 1) as

continuing at some positive rate into the future, differences in the

subjective horizons among those men who have more years of life remaining
           0
(for whom e is greater) will respond less to differences in actuarial

horizons than will differences in x + e5 among older men. Thus 2 > 0

is equal to the annual rate of increase in life expectancy that the

average person in the sample expects. If 2 < 0, we can only infer that

people do not believe past trends will continue; whether this is because

 they believe that health technology will cease improving, or because of a

 nonzero subjective probability that a catastrophe will occur, cannot be

 distinguished from our results.

        Columns (3), (4), (7) and (8) present estimates of equation (4) for

 each sample, with and without     constrained to zero. The estimates suggest

very clearly that     is non—positive: The upper ends of the 95 percent

 confidence intervals around the    from columns (7) and (8) are + .0016 and

+ .0036 respectively. If the average person (age 43 in each sample)

projected trends of the last 40 years,     would have been .041. Even if

people projected trends from the 1960's, the decade of least rapid improve-

ments in adult white male longevity, 2 would equal .013. Clearly, white

men do not expect past trends in longevity to continue)1 Whether they

are aware of these trends and do not consider them, or whether they are

not aware, the results suggest that today's life tables are good proxies

for people's expectations today. The conclusion that   l =   1 is also

supported by the estimates in columns (4) and (8).

D. Objective Consistency

       To examine whether individual variation in subjective life expectancies

is related to objective characteristics other than life—table data, a vector

Z consisting of the dummy variables discussed in part A was added to equation

(4). Table 5 shows the estimates of the expanded equation for the two

samples. The coefficients on the three dummy variables for old grandparents

suggest that each additional grandparent who survived to age 80 adds to the

respondent's subjective life expectancy. Conversely, the coefficients on

the dummy variables for young grandparents (with the insignificant exception

of the second grandparent in the random sample) imply that each additional

grandparent who died of natural causes before age 60 reduces the subjective

 life expectancy. Similar responses are observed for the variables

 representing early and late decedents among parents, with the latter showing

particularly strong positive effects.

       Despite the pattern of these coefficients, they appear far too

large in absolute value given the results of studies on the relation

between parents' and offspring's longevity. There is some evidence from

twins' studies (see Jarvik et al, 1960) of heritability of a high probability

of early death, but evidence on the heritability of longevity beyond this is

less clear. Whether the proxy variables represent heredity alone or also

reflect omitted environmental factors is unclear. Nonetheless, evidence

from regressions of age at death on parents' age at death (Rose and Bell,

1971) indicates that none of the environmental factors excluded from Z,

but correlated with parents' and grandparents' longevity, has nearly the

effect implied in our estimates. Other things equal, subjective life

expectancy of a person whose parents both survived to 80 is 7.71 years

(6.71 in the random sample) greater than that of someone whose parents died

of natural causes before age 60. This compares to the 2.1—year difference

based on the epidemiological evidence as suggested by Sehnert (1975, p. 132).

       The effects of personal behavior on subjective life expectancy

are somewhat more consistent with the available evidence of their effect

on longevity. Persons in both samples appear aware of the detrimental

effects of smoking: The coefficients on this variable are quite close

to what is suggested by studies of its effects on longevity (see Preston,

1970). Similarly, though the economists attach no importance to exercise,

the random sample shows some recognition of its effects-?1 Finally, the

illness variable, essentially a control for a variety of factors, has the

expected negative effect.-'1
                                         11



       The comparisons of these results to evidence from biological

studies suggest that the respondents overestimate the importance of their

forebears' experience. That they do so is consistent with what Tversky

and Kahneman (1974) have called the "availability heuristic," an over—

reliance on readily available, apparently relevant information in

determining one's subjective beliefs on an issue. Objective consistency

is only partly satisfied. But people's overreliance on parents' experience

in forming their own horizons can enable future research using micro data

to examine life—cycle behavior to proxy individual horizons at least

partly by the respondents' parents' longevity.


III. The Determinants of Uncertainty About the Subjective Distribution


       The discussion in the previous section implicitly dealt with

errors in forecasting by the average respondent. The effects of the

failure to observe internal and expectational consistency may be small,

though, compared to those caused by uncertainty about the subjective

probability distribution. Much of the recent literature (Levhar±

and Mirman, 1977; and Davies, 1981) stresses the role of uncertainty about

the horizon, rather than its expected length, in explaining consumption

profiles and saving behavior. These considerations suggest that it is

worthwhile to try to extract whatever information our sample contains

about the determinants of such uncertainty.

       For each person below age 56 I fitted the Weibull survival

function:


       P(t) =
                exp[_(?)1    ,   t   >   x
                                    12



 where c. and 0. are parameters, to the responses for p0 and p0.--' (This

 is an exact fit: There are two parameters and two observations on each

 person.) The fitted c. and 0. are then used to generate a distribution

 of subjective survival probabilities from which the means,variances, and

 coefficients of variation of the subjective distributions can be

 calculated.

        The coefficient of variation of the implied subjective survival

distribution was regressed against the variables in Z, age, and measures

of the variance among each respondent's forebears' longevity. The best—

fitting forms of the equation are reported in Table 6. In unreported

regressions the variables representing smoking, exercise and illness had

t—statistics below .7; measures of the variance of forebears' longevity

did not fit as well as the longevity variables themselves; and continuous

measures of the number of parents or grandparents dying young or surviving

to age 80 produced lower a than did the vectors of dummy variables

included in Table 6. 288 of the 337 economists under age 56 were used

in this analysis, as were 225 of the 276 white men under age 56 in the

random sainple.1

       The most striking result is the decline in the variance of the

subjective distribution with age; the decrease is observed whether or not

the equation is conditioned on forebears' longevity. This result should

not be surprising: Older people in the subsamples have avoided early

death, a low—probability event that greatly increases the variance of

observed lifetimes. The finding implies that the demand for life insurance

will be greater among younger persons in a risk—averse population. It

also means that one should not, as Davies (1981) has, treat the effects of

aging in a life—cycle model independently of assumptions about uncertainty

 of survival.

        The results in columns (2) and (4) show fairly clearly that men

 with long—lived forebears are more uncertain about their subjective survival

 distribution, though men with forebears who died young are not less

 uncertain. Coupled with the results in Table 5, these findings indicate

 that having early decedents among one's forebears shifts the subjective

 distribution to the left and narrows it (since the variance must decrease

with reduced mean if the coefficient of variation is unaffected); having

late decedents shifts it rightward and widens it. Thus parents' longevity

is partly a proxy for increased uncertainty about survival as well as for a

more distant horizon.


IV. Intergenerational Transfers and Changing Subjective Horizons


       The findings on the horizon and its uncertainty can be used to

analyze a number of specific issues in life—cycle behavior. In this

section I consider two of those: How changes in the subjective distribution

affect paths of consumption and labor supply, and the extent to which a path

based on subjective probabilities such as those implied by our results

differs from one implied by perfect foresight about survival probabilities.

Examination of the first issue enables us to extend previous work on the

effect of differences in the horizon and uncertainty about it on lifetime

consumption (see, eg., Levhari and Mirman, 1977). Consideration of the

second point allows the calculation of the size of intergenerational

subsidies that would be required to maintain utility levels in an older

population that faced unexpected increases in longevity. Since one

justification for subsidies through social insurance is the desire to

avoid having older persons' consumption fall sharply because they could
                                         14


not plan well, the calculations provide estimates of the size of the

subsidy that is justified by this concern.-'

       The simulation model builds on the work of Yaari (1965).        I make

various assumptions about: 1) The degree of perfection in capital markets

(whether there exist actuarially fair annuities); 2) The relative importance

of consumption and leisure in a utility function that is strongly separable

in these arguments; and 3) The elasticity of utility with respect to

increases in consumption or leisure. I assume a generalized isoelastic

utility function:



(5)    U =    C1/l- +       aL1/l—

where C is consumption in any period; L equals one if the person is retired,

zero otherwise; and         and a are parameters indicating the elasticity of

marginal utility to its arguments and the relative weights of consumption

and leisure.-' This simple formulation produces tractable optimal

lifetime consumption and labor supply paths.

       I assume that at each point in time the consumer maximizes:

                rT
(6)    V(t)
                J
                        P(t,T)U(T)e_tT)dT
                    t

where t is his current age; T is the maximum attainable age; and the vector

P(t,T),T t, is his forecast of the probability of survival to age T,        with
P(t,t)=l. The simulations deal with white males; I assume the typical

person is age 20 in 1930 (by assumption, t1) and follow his utility—

maximizing choices of C and Lt from 1930 through 1979. For each set of

assumptions about the triad of parameters               the model is simulated

under four sets of assumptions about the forecasts of survival probabilities:
                                    15


        P1——The typical consumer in this cohort assumes that P(t,T), given

 survival to age t, is what it was at t=l.   P1 thus embodies completely

 rigid forecasts; the consumer neither extrapolates past changes in survival

 probabilities nor updates his forecasts based on recent changes in those

probabilities.

       P2——The consumer forecasts his chances of survival from time t to

time -r based upon the life tables for year t. His forecasts are constantly

updated, but he does not expect continuing improvements in the life table.

This assumption is based on the evidence in Section II of demographic

consistency, and on the finding that people do not extrapolate past

improvements in the life tables.

       P3——The consumer forecasts based on e° from the life tables at
                                            x
time t, but his subjective survival probabilities are inconsistent in shape

with actuarial data, being flattened as I demonstrated in Section II.'

His forecasts are skewed and constantly updated, consistent with all the

evidence in Section II. P3 is a mean—preserving spread of
                                                             P2.
       P4——The consumer has perfect foresight; at any time t he knows with

certainty what P(T, -r+k) will be, for allT> t. Essentially the consumer

knows ex ante what the cohort life table for his cohort will be.-' The

distinction between these assumptions is not trivial: For example, using

survival to age 85 (t=66), P1 (l,66)=.085, but P4(l,66)=.166.

       Since the focus is on retirement, I assume that L0 for t        35; that

L=l for t   56; and that L cannot switch from one to zero.    (These

assumptions reduce computing costs tremendously and correspond fairly

closely to reality.) Annual earnings are assumed exogeneous, and the only

source of income is past savings or current borrowing if L=l. Earnings are

assumed to follow a typical inverted—U path, and that path is assumed to
                                        16


to shift upward over time with the growth in real disposable income per

capita that took place between 1930 and l979.-' The typical consumer is

assumed to be fully aware of the life—cycle pattern of earnings but does

not extrapolate past improvements in real incomes.      (The results do not

differ qualitatively if the consumer extrapolates the past ten years'

rate of change in per capital income.)

       I make two polar assumptions about the nature of capital markets:

1) No borrowing is possible, so that wealth is always nonnegative; and

2) There is a perfect annuities market, so that the expected value of

wealth at T is zero, given a particular matrix P. assumed in the simu1ation.'

Given a vector L, and a particular isoelastic utility function, the optimal

lifetime consumption profile at T> t under the first assumption is:


(7)    C(T) =
                C(t)exp{[(T-t)(r-p)     + J      ds]}

subject to the constraint that:


(8)    W(T) =   W(t)er(T_t)   + fT   [L(s)E(s)C(s)]e"Tds     0, V

where E(s) are earnings in period s. The consumer cannot plan a consumption

profile that would require negative net worth at any future time. Under

the assumption that there is a market in actuarially perfect annuities

(see Yaari, 1965), the optimal consumption profile at T> t, given a

particular path of future L, becomes:


(9)    C(T)     C(t)exp{+[r—p][T--t]}


with the side constraint on probabilistic terminal wealth:



       W(T) =                  -                     - C(T)JdT
(10)
                f {exp[_J[r        ']ds]}[L(T)E(T)                0
                                     17


Under the assumption of no borrowing, incorrect forecasting of survival

probabilities is likely to lead to a greater departure of actual from ex

post (perfect forecasting) utility, for the existence of annuities markets

will enable the consumer to protect himself against the possibility of

unexpectedly long lifetime.

        I simulate the optimal lifetime consumption and retirement paths for

1   t    50, for both assumptions about capital markets, and for various

assumptions about the triad (5,a,p). These parameters are chosen in most

cases so that the optimal retirement age, R, under assumption P1 is such

that 35<R<56. r is set equal to .03 in each simulation. For t>50 C and L

are those projected at t=50. The model is simulated by taking the vector

L(T), -r=t,...T, as given, and solving for optimal consumption according

to (7) or (9) with side constraints (8) or (10). All feasible vectors

L(T) are searched, and the optimal path is that for which the probabilistic

utility function (6) is maximized.

        Tables 7 and 8 present the results of the simulations under both

assumptions about the nature of capital markets, for six combinations of

parameters cS,   a, and p. Two findings stand out immediately from consider-
ation of the optimal retirement age under the differing assumptions about

perceptions of survival probabilities: 1) Moving from P1 to P2 to P4,

there are only tiny changes in R. Apparently, under the assumptions that

condition the utility function, most of the increase in longevity that

occurs is consumed optimally in the form of leisure near the end of the

life cycle. 2) Comparing R under P2 and P3 in Table 7, we see that

introducing a mean—preserving spread into subjective survival probabilities

at each point in the life cycle leads in several cases to substantial

postponement in the age of retirement. However, as can be seen by comparing

the results in Tables 7 and 8, this result depends entirely on the effect

of uncertainty on the assumption that the consumer's net worth be non-

negative. When we assume a perfect market for actuarial annuities, the

retirement age is not affected by an increase in uncertainty of the size

we assume.

       The final four columns in the Tables are based upon a comparison of

utilities under assumptions P1 through P3 to that attained under P4. The

elasticity of utility with respect to consumption in (5) is:


       31nU/1nC =

The numbers are calculated as:

                      N2             N2          N2
         = 100 [1 -        Up.(t)/        Up4(t)]/[ C(t)/Up.()j
                      t=N1           t=N1        N1
where the N. are arbitrary ages. They show the percentage increase in

consumption necessary in each period to equalize the sum of utilities under

assumption P, i=l,2,3, to that under P4. The calculations are presented

separately for the consumption increments required to equate utility

streams during early older years, ages 55—69, then during later older

years, ages 70—101.

       I present results separately with and without weights implied by the

number of persons surviving in the cohort of men age 20 in 1930. The

first set of equalizing increases in consumption implicitly weights all

persons in the cohort equally, while the second set puts a higher weight

on the utility of those who survive longer. Which of these two sets of

results deserves more attention depends on one's purposes: If we are

concerned with the average welfare of the whole cohort, the first set of

results is the important one, for it recognizes that the cohort declines
                                    19


 in size as it ages. If we are more concerned about maintaIning incomes of

 older persons, the second set of estimates should be focussed upon, for it

 gives greater weight to those who survive longer.

        The most striking result in the last four columns is the relatively

 small percentage increase in consumption required to equate the utility

 stream to that obtained with perfect foresight. Only when no borrowing is

 possible and forecasts of the probabilities of survival are completely

 rigid does utility in the later part of the life cycle differ substantially

 from that attainable under maximization with perfect foresight. If people

forecast in ways implied by the results in Section II, the shortfalls in

utility are very small.

       It seems quite fair to conclude, subject to the restrictions of the

assumptions in our maximization problem, that rapid increases in longevity

in the past fifty years did not result in persons who survived longer than

they initially forecast consuming much less in old age than if they had known

cx ante how survival probabilities would change. Though the increases were

swift by historical standards, they were slow enough to allow the typical

consumer who updates forecasts to adjust consumption and saving sufficiently

to come fairly close to an cx post optimum. Munnell (1977) suggests that

in the early 1970s the intergenerational subsidy implicit in Social Security

could have been half of benefits. With replacement rates of 50 percent, this

far exceeds the rates implied by Tables 7 and 8. The results suggest that

the subsidy cannot be justified as compensation to a generation whose

average longevity exceeded its initial expectations.

       The close approximation of utility in old age under
                                                             P2, P3 and P4
suggests that people form their subjective horizons in ways consistent with

optimizing behavior in the presence of information costs. It is quite
                                    20


easy to acquire information on current life tables. I showed in Section II

that people use that information when they form their expectations, and

I demonstrated here that those expectations are nearly sufficient to allow

the attainment of an ex post actuarial lifetime utIlity maximum. People

do not make the more complex calculations necessary to predict changes in

survival probabilities; but their failure to do so does not, as we have

seen here, reduce their lifetime utility much below what it would have been

had they made these calculations.


V. Conclusions and New Directions


       Increases in life expectancy in the U.S. and other Western countries

represent as important a demographic/labor—market change as do the often

studied 1950's baby boom and the increased labor—force participation of

married women. This paper has examined awareness of this demographic

change by individuals as they project their life expectancy, and whether

their projections are internally consistent and based upon determinants

that coincide with the evidence of epidemiological and demographic studies.

I find that they do not extrapolate when they determine their subjective

horizons, though they are aware of levels of and improvements within current

life tables. People skew subjective survival probabilities in a way that

implies the subjective distribution has greater variance than its actuarial

counterpart; and the subjective variance decreases with age. They base

their subjective life expectancies disproportionately on their relatives'

longevity; and long—lived relatives increase uncertainty about the

subjective distribution of survival probabilities.

       The findings on the subjective horizon were used to examine the

consumption/leisure choices of a utility—maximizing consumer over his
                                    21


 lifetime. Shortfalls in utility in old age because of skewed or imperfect

 forecasting of survival probabilities were found to be relatively small.

 This implies that large subsidies to retirees under today's Social Security

 system cannot be justified as compensation for an unexpectedly long

 retirement for which they failed to save.

        In Sections II and III I discussed some uses of the results in

 modifying theoretical and empirical work on life—cycle behavior. A large

 number of other implications arise from these findings. The Implied skewness

 of the subjective survival distribution means that actuarially fair

 insurance and annuity schemes will have nonneutral behavioral effects.    The

 extent of the distortion can be lessened, and sellers of such plans can

undercut their competitors, by offering plans based on skewed survival

distributions that have the same expected value as their actuarial

counterparts. Also, in a world with mandatory or customary retirement at

age 65 or 70, skewed survival probabilities will lead people to invest more

than otherwise in assets whose returns are concentrated during retirement

rather than during the person's working years.

       The existence of demographic consistency and the failure of people

to extrapolate changing life tables supports the use of current life

expectancy in cross—section studies of aggregate savings (see, eg. Feldstein,

1977). In these, though, an average of life expectancies by age weighted

by the age distribution of the population is the appropriate proxy for the

average horizon. Time—series studies of savings and labor supply should

account for increasing life expectancy and its transformation into the

subjective horizon that determines behavior. If the results in Section IV

are correct, and greater longevity Is consumed mostly as leisure, failure

to include the increasing horizon in such studies will bias estimates of
                                    22


 the effects of any other variable containing a trend.

       Changing distributions of subjective survival probabilities must

be modelled in studies of bequest behavior. Unplanned bequests (see David

and Menchik, 1981) will be lower when, as our results show, people fail

to forecast reductions in mortality. Empirical work that examines bequests

in different population cohorts must also consider how they are affected

by changing mortality experience and its relationship to subjective

horizons.

       In any area of economic behavior, where length or uncertainty of

the horizon affects decisions, secular changes in longevity must be

considered. However, modelling those changes cannot be done mechanically;

as I have shown, they are processed into subjective survival decisions

only incompletely, and in ways that appear fairly complex. Empirical

studies that model these sorts of behavior ignore changing life

expectancy and its effects on subjective survival probabilities at the

expense of realism, and with the price of possibly incorrect behavioral

implications. Theoretical studies that treat actuarial data as directly

motivating behavior miss much of the potential richness of their models

if they ignore how those data are transformed into the subjective proba—

bilities that are the proximate determinants of the phenomena under study.

 1. Wall Street Journal, October 25, 1979, P. 1.

 2. The numbers are even more striking for nonwhites. For example, between
     1939—41 and 1980 average years of life remaining at age 2.5 increased by
     7.4 among nonwhite males; for females the analogous figure is 12.8 years.
     (See Vital Statistics of the United States, 1977 Volume II, Section 5,
     and unpublished data for 1980.)

3. A detailed description of the construction of life tables is provided
    in Keyfitz (1977).

4. Comparing data for males age 25, life expectancy was: 1) 70.8 years in
    1960/62, 70.7 years in 1970/72, and 71.5 years in 1976/78 in West Germany;
    2) 70.4 years in 1960—64, 71 years in 1970, and 71.9 years in 1978 in
    France; and 3) 70.8 years in 1960/62, 71.1 years in 1967/69, and 72
    years in 1976/78 in England and Wales. For females the comparable
    figures are: 1) 75.3, 76.1 and 77.4 in West Germany; 2) 76.6, 77.8 and
    79.3 in France, and 3) 76.1, 76.8 and 78.6 in England and Wales. (See
    Statistisches Bundesamt, Statistisches Jahrbuch für die Bundesrepublik
    Deutschland, 1980; INSEE, Annuaire Statistique de la France, 1980; and
    United Kingdom, Statistical Office, Annual Abstract of Statistics, 1981.
    There is nothing inevitable about these increases; age—specific death rates
    rose in the Soviet Union between 1960 and 1975 for all adult age groups
    (U.S. Census Bureau, International Population Reports, Series P—95, No. 74,
    September 1980).

5. Robert Goldfarb and Ernst Stromsdorfer provided helpful advIce in the
    construction of the questionnaire.

6. The age distribution of the respondents was: 26—29, N=29; 30—34, N76;
    35—39, N=75; 40—44, N=68; 45—49, N60; 50—54, N=34; 55—59, N4O; and
    60—65, N=29.

7. The age distribution of these respondents was: 20—24, N=22; 25—29, N50;
    30—34, N=64; 35—39, N=43; 40—44, N=28; 45—49, N=24; 50—54, N43; 55—59,
   N31; 60—64, N=29; 65—70, N=29. The questionnaire was the same as that
    sent to economists except that survival probabilities were elicited with
   questions styled as "how many chances in ten. . . . 7"

8. Where possible in this Section I use notation that has become standard
    among demographers. Thus, for example, what I denote later as p0 is
    the ratio of 160 to   from the life tables for white males in l97.

9. Data on mortality by occupation are collected only infrequently, but
    they support this view clearly. In 1950 in the United States, age
    specific mortality rates of male college professors in ten—year age groups
    between 25 and 64 were roughly half those of all males, and only about 2/3
    of those of all professionals. (U.S. Public Health Service, Vital
    Statistics Special Report, Volume 53, No. 2, p. 82.) In England and Wales
    in 1959—63 the figures for males in age groups between 25 and 64 present
    essentially this same pattern.  (HNSO, Decennial Supplement to the


                                  26

    Registrar General's Report, 1961, Occupational Mortality Tables, p. 97,
    99, 192.) Rosen and Taubman (1979) present results on a recent sample
    of older men showing much lower mortality rates among those with more
    education.

10. The conclusion that subjective expectancies correspond closely to
    actuarial is further strengthened by the sparse evidence from the 63
    white females ages 20—70 who responded to the random survey. For them
    x + eS = 79.40, within two standard errors of the x + e0 = 80.97, and
    significantly above the x + eS   reported   by the white males in the sample.
11. The failure of the respondents to extrapolate past improvements is matched
    by the apparent inability of leading demographers to predict the changes
    that have occurred. For example, in 1945 one expert's most optimistic
    forecast for 1975 was that e would be 71.4 for the entire population; it
    was in fact 72.6. The forecast was sufficiently optimistic for
                                                                    mortality
    up through age 68, but insufficiently optimistic for mortality thereafter.
    (Dublin et al, 1949, pp. 172—174.)
12. That exercise increases longevity is suggested strongly by the studies
    discussed in Paffenberger and Hyde (1980).

13. A number of possible problems in the expanded version of (4) were
    examined. 1) There may be a simultaneity between e and smoking.
    While I cannot disprove this, in logit equations relating smoking to
    x and to all the dummy variables for parents' and grandparents'
    longevity, none of the latter set had a coefficient significantly
    different from zero. Similar logit equations for exercise yielded
    similarly insignificant results. 2) I specified Z so that the response
    to the longevity of male and female forebears is the same. When this
    restriction is relaxed, there is a lesser response to the experience
    of grandfathers than that of grandmothers; there is, though, a greater
    response to father's experience than to mother's. In any case the
    restriction that the responses be equal cannot be rejected statistically.
    3) Finally, none of the conclusions changes when eS and e0 are
    substituted for x + eS and x + e0 in (4).          x
                         x          x
14. Elandt—Johnson and Johnson (1980) discuss the application of this
    distribution by demographers to characterizing survival probabilities
    implicit in life tables.

15. The other observations were dropped because the mean implied by the
    c. and    exceeded 100 years. This occurred for persons whose
   subjective survival probabilities to ages 60 and 80 differed only
   slightly, resulting in absurdly high implied survival probabilities
   beyond age 90. In those cases the Weibull clearly does not describe
   the subjective survival distributions very well.

16. Maintenance of consumption has only recently been dealt with analytically
    as the main goal of social insurance programs by economists interested
    in these programs. See Hamermesh (1982) on unemployment insurance,
    and Kotlikoff and Summers (1981) on retirement benefits.

17. The function in (5) is suggested by that used by Gordon and Blinder
    (1980).

18. P3 (t,T) is calculated for T_te by reducing P2(t,T) by twenty percent
   of a weighted sum of (1—P2(t,T)) and (P2(t,T)—P2(t, t + e)), with
   weights based on the fraction (T—t)/e. For T—t>e' the probabilities
   P3 are increased by the proportion required to equate life expectancy
   under P2 and P3.

19. For P1 through P4 I assume T = 81, i.e., maximum attainable age is 100.
   Under each scheme the probabilities of survival beyond age 85 are derived
   by prorating 185 for the particular year by the ratio 1/1, x>85, for
   1970. Interpolations of 1 within five—year age intervals were made
    for 20    x   85, as were linear interpolations between 1930 and 1940,
   1940 and 1950, etc., through 1970 and 1979. Finally, under P2 through
   P4 forecasts were assumed to be based on the life table for 1979.

20. The life—cycle earnings function is Mincer's (1974, p. 92), for annual
    earnings of nonfarm white males in 1959:

       n Y = +.068X   -   .0009X2 + g(Z)

   where Y are earnings, X is experience, and g(Z) is a vector of other
   variables (schooling and weeks worked). I set X=4 at age 20 (tl) in
   the simulations.

21. I assume initial wealth is zero and ignore any bequest motive; its
    inclusion would make the simulation,which already requires the repeated
    construction of an optimal dynamic program, too costly to be practical.
