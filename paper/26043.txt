                                         ABSTRACT

We engaged randomized control trial to measure the effects of an agricultural health training
intervention among 480 randomly assigned crop farmers from 24 farming communities in
Nigeria. Structured questionnaire, interviews and random farm visit were used for data collection.
The intervention component includes one-time village level agricultural health training and a
three-month farm safety mobile text messaging follow up. We engaged a peer-developed module
covering safe ergonomic practices and safe use of agrochemicals for the training. Findings from
the study revealed that every one day increase in sickness absence decreases farmers' labour
productivity by 3% (p<0.01); the agricultural health intervention reduced sickness absence in the
season by 1.9 out of 6.5 days (29%) with significant improvement in farmers' agricultural health
knowledge and attitude (p<0.01). However, we documented weak evidence on the intervention
effect on farmers' labour productivity. The study concluded that cassava farmers were engaged in
unsafe farm practices exposing them to some health risks which negatively affect their well-
being. Although, evidences from the study supports that the intervention enhanced farm safety
knowledge, attitude and reduced sickness absence in short term, additional research is needed to
establish the long-term intervention effects and explore issues of cost effectiveness of the
intervention.

        1. Introduction

        The quality of labour productivity which refers to the quantity of labour input required to

produce a unit of output is an important measure of a nations' well-being. Though, labour input

is not the only input utilized in the production process. High labour productivity can be an

important signal of the improvement in real incomes (wages of labour). It also has implications

for the conduct of both monetary and fiscal policies of a nation. In many developing economies

like Nigeria with large endowments of labour, enhancing the labour productivity is an important

way boosts the nations' economy (National Bureau of Statistics [NBS], 2017).

        Health is viewed as a tangible asset in production process (capital good). It is not just a

pivot for labour supply but a critical factor for agricultural labour productivity and quality.

Asenso-Okyere, et al (2011), posited Agriculture's role in human livelihood to mean that

agricultural development has strong linkages with other fields of development practice and

research, including health and nutrition. Therefore, the success of agricultural livelihoods

depends on the health of its workforce. At the same time, different agricultural production

systems have different impacts on health, nutrition, and well-being of the people. Households

can use income from agricultural production for improved access to health products and services;

agriculture provides food and nutrients for energy, as well as maintenance of good health. On the

other hand, exposure to agricultural related health risks affect nutrient absorption and people's

nutritional status. Poor health will result in a loss of days worked or in reduced worker capacity,

and is likely to reduce output productivity. Limited access to food may occur in a household if

individual are too ill or overburdened to produce or earn money to buy food (Keverenge-Ettyang

et al., 2010).




                                                                                                 2
         Worldwide, agriculture-related health losses are massive, accounting for up to 25 percent

of all disability-adjusted life years lost (DALYs) and 10 percent of deaths in low-income

countries (Gilbert, Lapar, Unger, & Grace 2010). Furthermore, ILO reported the agricultural

sector as one of the most hazardous to health worldwide (as cited in Loureiro, 2009).

Occupational hazards in agriculture range from simple conditions like heat exhaustion to

complex diseases like respiratory disease, zoonotic disease, and poisoning from agrochemicals

(International Food Policy Research Institute [IFPRI], 2011). It is estimated that 2 to 5 million

people suffer acute poisonings related to pesticides annually, of whom 40,000 die every year;

and there are 170,000 recorded fatal injuries in agriculture annually (Cole, 2006). As reported by

Nuwayhid cited in IFPRI, (2011), in spite of these numbers, occupational health in general, and

in agriculture in particular, remains neglected in most developing countries (as cited in IFPRI,

2011).

         World Bank estimated about 355,000 people yearly die from unintentional chemical

poisoning from exposure to pesticides. Two-thirds of these victims are found in developing

countries (World Bank, 2007). Further estimates by the WHO showed that globally, 30 million

people suffer severe chemical poisoning cases annually and 25 million of these occur among

agricultural workers in developing countries (Duffy, 2007; Kuye, et al., 2008). In addition,

effects of unsafe agrochemicals use have been linked to some non-communicable diseases

(NCDs) such as cancers and respiratory diseases. WHO (2013), indicated that NCDs cause over

36million deaths each year with 80% of this in low and medium income countries. The

occurrence of NCDs and related deaths is expected to grow by 2020 with the largest projected

increase in the African region (Lim et al., 2012). With this projection, without appropriate

interventions, agriculture the largest employer of labour in Africa will suffer.



                                                                                                3
       Access to agricultural health training is generally low among farmers and this has been

linked to increase in pesticide-related diseases (Antle & Pingali 1994 as cited in Asenso-Okyere,

Chiang, Thangata, & Andam, 2011). Lack of such training could lead to unsafe practices among

farmers. This could lead to agricultural injuries and diseases affecting farmer's productivity and

income. Asenso-Okyere et al. (2011) highlighted the effects of ill health on farm households to

include production loss time due to ill health (and eventual death); loss of family time diverted to

caring for the sick; and loss of savings and assets in dealing with disease and its consequences.

The long-term impacts of ill health include loss of farming knowledge, reduction of land under

cultivation, planting of less labour-intensive crops, reduction of variety of crops planted, and

reduction of livestock. The ultimate impact of ill health is a decline in household income and

possibly food insecurity leading to severe deterioration in household livelihood (McNamara,

Ulimwengu & Leonard 2010; Asenso-Okyere et al., 2011).

       Poor work-posture from poor ergonomic practices leads to musculoskeletal disorders

(MSDs). These disorders have consequences including pain at the lower and upper back,

shoulders, ankles, knees, elbows, neck, wrist and hand. Furthermore, chronic musculoskeletal

disorders include back pain, neck pain, tenosynovitis (inflammation of the wrist tendon), bursitis

(inflammation of the shoulder joint fluid sac (bursa) and osteoarthritis of the knee (degeneration

of the knee joint cartilage), identified to be very common among agricultural workers (Erondu &

Anyanwu, 2005; Moreau & Neis, 2009; Myers, 2010; Durborow et al., 2011). Fathalah (2010)

submitted that MSDs are so common among experienced farmers that most of them perceived it

is inevitable consequences of farm labour. These issues are yet to receive the needed attention in

Nigerian Agriculture in terms of research, awareness programmes and agricultural health policy.

The paucity of agricultural health data in Nigeria an agrarian nation is of concern. Unsafe



                                                                                                  4
agricultural practices from poor agricultural health literacy and poor safety management are still

major challenges predisposing farmers to health risks in agricultural workplaces. However, a

clear understanding of the extent of agricultural health risks, effect on farmers' productivity is

necessary in the design of any policy intervention.

       Currently, systematic studies on agricultural related risks that are work related are rare in

Nigeria. Although, the problem is acknowledged, the extent of these problems and its effects

among crop farmers in Nigeria remains largely unclear. The dearth of agricultural health data in

Nigeria has provided no impetus for policy formulation in this regard. This research is an attempt

to bridge this research gap by providing estimates on agricultural related health risks along the

cassava production chain, their effect on farmers' productivity as well as the effectiveness of an

intervention in combating the challenge; and gauging the short-term effects of the intervention

among crop farmers in Nigeria. The inclusive agricultural health policy is expected to cater for

the occupational health of the agricultural workforce. It is specifically expected to address the

health and safety of farmers, farm workers and farm families which at the moment is not in place

in Nigeria.

2.2 Study design and Intervention

This study is a longitudinal study of a randomized control trial approach focused on agricultural

health intervention for cassava farmers in Nigeria. The general objective of the intervention

project is to reduce negative health effects of agricultural health risks especially agrochemical

and ergonomics health risks. The main elements of the intervention consist of educating farmers

via training and reinforcement of the training with farm safety mobile text messaging, sent to

farmers two-times a month for 3months. Farmers were provided a one-time agricultural health

education using focus group discussion at village level with standardized module on safe

chemical use and ergonomics. The training content was developed based on health risks issues of

priority from data collected at baseline. This section was followed up with farm safety mobile
                                                                                               6
text messaging for three month. This was meant to reinforce the physical training to help

farmers' engagement of safe and healthy farm practices. The baseline data collection was carried

out from February 2017 to April 2017 from Kogi and Kwara States, Nigeria.                The post

intervention data collection was between August and November, 2017. However, the endline

labour productivity data collection was collected in May, 2019 to ensure farmers have harvested

their cassava tubers. The two States are in the North central Zones of Nigeria which accounts for

about 30% of the cassava produced in Nigeria. Kogi State is located in the North-Central geo-

political zone of Nigeria. It extends from latitudes 6.33o N to 8.44 o N and from longitudes 5.40 o
            o
E to 7.49       E. The State covers a land area of about 75,000 square kilometers. The current

population figure for Kogi State is 3,278,487 people based on the 2006 population census, which

comprised 1,691,736 males and 1,586,750 females (NPC, 2006; KOSEED, 2006). While lies

between latitudes 7045'N and 9030!N and longitudes 2030'E and 6035'E and has an estimated

population of about 2.37 million people (Kogi ADP, 2003 and Ibitoye, 2006). Both States are

summer rainfall area, with an annual rainfall range of 1000mm to 1500mm. The months of

December and January coincide with the cold and dry harmattan period, while the annual rainfall

pattern across the state extends between the months of April and October. Kwara State has

minimum temperature ranging from 21.10C to 250C and average maximum temperatures varying

between 300.C and 350.C (FOS, 1995).           While Kogi has an annual season daily mean

temperature of 28' C, while in the hot season, the average temperature is about 35'C. High

humidity is also common (Ibitoye, 2006).

2.3 Study Participants

Agriculture is a major livelihood means in Nigeria. Cassava is a major crop grown in the study

area. However, the study engaged cassava farmers that use agricultural chemicals, and the farmer



                                                                                                 7
applies the chemicals and he/she is actively engaged in the manual labour of the farm. The

sample included 240 farmers from each state making a total of 480 participants. The sample size

is estimated using optimal design (OD) software developed by Steve Raudebush was engaged for

power calculation (Raudenbush, et al. 2011). Using lottery design 20 respondents each were

randomly assigned to the study in 24 cassava cropping communities with a power of 80%. The

sample however, is over 5% of the population of cassava farmers from the 24 farming

communities engaged in the study. Agricultural health intervention was randomly assigned to

200 farmers. 172 of the treatment completed the treatment due to attrition. This sample size was

deemed sufficient to give a realistic picture of the situation on agrochemical health risk exposure,

knowledge, attitude and practices among pesticide using cassava farmers based on experience

from similar studies in other parts of the world (Jensen et al., 2011; Oesterlund, et., al 2014). The

selection of farmers was done by random assignment into the study based on the entry criteria.

2.4 Standardized interviews

All participants were interviewed individually using a standardized structured questionnaire,

augmented with focus group discussion and random farm visit at both baseline and post

intervention data collection. The post intervention data collection was collected 6months after

the completion of the treated. The questionnaire with simple questions was developed on the

basis of a questionnaire tested and used in similar studies in Africa.

2.5 Statistical methods

Descriptive statistics, ordinary least square regression, difference-in-difference estimator were

used for analysis. Ordinary Least Square Regression: In estimating determinants of sickness

absence among farmers: ordinary least square regression was modeled. The implicit model is

stated as



                                                                                                   8

Ordinary Least Square Regression: In estimating the effects of exposure to health risks on crop

farmers' productivity: Ordinary least square regression was modeled. The implicit model is

stated as

Y = ß0 + ß1 X1 +ß2 X2 +...............+ß6 X6 +et                                          (2)

Where Y is the average labour productivity of farmer derived from the formula

Cassava Output (tons)/Labour (man days).

                                                                                                  9
Difference in Difference estimator: In estimating the effects of the training intervention on

farmers' production loss days/sickness absence, farm safety knowledge and attitude; and labour

productivity. The Difference in Difference estimator (DID) was adopted with the form:

             =  + 1Treat + 2Post + 3(Treat  Post) +                                         (3)

Yit    is   the   outcome    variable    for   an   individual       i   at    time   t,   

, is the dummy equals 1 if treated                  and          0            if      not         treated,

and is the dummy equals 1 if data collected at post intervention, 0 if at baseline , the

Treat  Post is the interactive effect,                           1, 2 and 3 are the coefficients.

However,  measures the average treatment outcome before the program.

1 measures the difference between treatment and control before the program (selection effect)

      2 measures changes accross time in the outcome varible common to both groups

3 measures the average treatment effect of the program on the outcome variable .



Attrition is the number of respondents lost from both group due to varying reasons. The study

recorded attrition of 14% (28) for the treated group and 16% (45) for the control group. Attrition

among the treated group was mainly due to inability of some of the respondents to receive the six

(6) follow up text messages leading to uncompleted treatment and the control attritees were

largely due to their unavailability during post treatment data collection.

       The World Health Organization (2009), recommended classification of pesticides by

hazard was used to classify pesticides used by farmers. This classification is used to distinguish

the more and less hazardous forms of pesticides from each other based on the acute risk to

human health, ranging from extremely hazardous (class Ia), highly hazardous (class Ib),

moderately hazardous (class II), slightly hazardous (class III) to unlikely to present acute hazards

(class U) (World Health Organization, 2009). This study found that most of the farmers used the

WHO class II and III chemicals for their farms. See table 1. This was in consonance with other

studies in Africa as Oesterlund et al., (2014) earlier reported WHO class II and III pesticides as

mostly reported chemicals by small-scale farmers in Uganda. However, an observational study

conducted concurrently in the same two districts among pesticide dealers and their stock of

pesticides supports the finding that the pesticides used are mainly class II and pesticides of lower

toxicity sold, as no class I pesticides were identified in the shops (Duus, 2011). Also, the study

by Ngowi et al., (2006) in Northern Tanzania, close to the border of Uganda, has shown a low

quantity of class I pesticides; while a study made in Ghana indicates that small-scale farmers

mainly used class II and III pesticides (Ntow, 2001).

       These studies suggest that African small holder farmers were not as exposed to class I

pesticides as Asian and Latin American farmers. Marianela (2010) also reported that found that

95% of acute pesticide poisoning results from WHO class I and II. It should therefore be noted

that class II and III pesticides are still classified as hazardous. They are known to have severe

negative effect on human health and environment. Based on this, other less dangerous

alternatives should still be promoted to farmers and application should be done with the

appropriate safety measures.




                                                                                                 12
       This study also found that about 47% of the farmers do not wash their hands after

handling chemicals either mixing/spraying. About 30% do not change cloths after spraying

chemicals. 87% of the farmers reported non-washing of hands before eating on the farm and 70%

use chemicals for home spraying apart from chemicals used on the farm. 63 % (304) reported

they wash their sprayer after chemical use however 261 of this figure washed it on the field and

21 wash it near water stream and at home respectively. Washing near streams could and at home

could pose the danger of unintentional chemical poisoning to farming households.

       Further findings showed that after chemical use most farmers about 65% throw

containers on the field, this could pose danger to farm kids who may pick container and re-use.

15 % reported they re-use containers after washing for drinking and other domestic ventures.

These are bad safety habits as these may aid chemical ingestion. However, only a handful 20%

buries or burn chemicals to discourage re-use of such containers. Ogunjimi and Farinde (2012),

reported some other unsafe practices by farmers were associated with the use of pesticides by

some sampled rural farmers in Nigeria to include non-use of protective gears like gloves, goggles

and boot, the habit of drinking during the application of chemicals, not washing their

contaminated cloths after use of chemicals, smoking during application, stored their chemicals

in the living room together with foodstuff including bedrooms leading to health problems.

These bad safety habits were in consonance with this present study.

       Finding on chemical container management were in consonance with study by Bassi et

al., (2016) who reported that about 78% of farming respondents disposed empty chemical

containers on the field, 8% re-used the containers for domestic purposes while 2.63% used the

containers as farm tools. It also agrees with the study carried out in Nepal which pointed out

habits related to poor safety practices and re-usage of containers of agrochemicals among



                                                                                              13
farmers. The study reported that 26.31% burnt the empty agrochemicals containers, 6.43%

indicated that they used same for various household purposes (e.g., for food and water storage)

while 14.61% indicated that they buried them and 29.23% indicated that they left the empty

agrochemicals containers in their farms (Govinda, 2014).

       Kuye et al. (2008) also found that 35% of the farmers disposed -off empty pesticide

containers by burning, 55% by burying, and 55% also used other disposal methods. Of those who

reported using other disposal methods, 90% reported dumping them in latrines, 5% dump in old

wells, and 5% reported leaving them at the village seed store. A study carried out among cocoa

farmers in Ondo State, Nigeria strongly agrees with the foregoing. The study reported 10.4%

disposed pesticide container by burying it in the soil, 2.1% by burning, while 25.0%; sold them

to buyers; however, the 35.4% majority washed their pesticide containers for other uses such as

storing palm oil (Tijani, 2006).

       Findings showed that about 70% reported occasional reading of chemical labels while

20% do not read labels at all. Further, probe shows that most farmers read expiration dates and

mixing instructions on labels with neglect for safety precautions and re-entry time for chemicals.

This non-reading habit of may have aided the non-usage of safety gears and non-compliance

with the re-entry period. About 47% (226) do not follow the advice read on the labels while 53

reported they occasionally follow such advices. However, 70% reported they do not understand

the information presented on the labels. This finding is corroborated by Oesterlund et al., (2014)

who earlier reported that (26%) of farmers sampled said they were unable to read and understand

these instructions.

       The primary purpose of this section is to provide information on the balancing of the two

groups under study and to provide the socio-economic environment of the area where the RCT

was implemented. Table 2 documents the socio-economic characteristics of respondents at

baseline. All the farmers were male, with an average age of respondents was found to be 38

years with the oldest being 60years and the youngest being 24years old. On the average

household members consists of 5members; household size varies in the range of 1-10 persons per

household. The average schooling years and farming experience for the population was 13 years.

The farm size was 2.2ha on the average. However, average monthly health expenditure was

N1128.

        Table 3 highlights the chemical and ergonomics    characteristics of farmers in the two

groups. It shows the two group shares similar characteristics, a basis for RCT use in the study.

The average number of times a farmer sprays in 3 months period was found to be 12. This

frequency of spray ranges from 3-30 times in 3months. Daily duration of spray was found to be

6hours with average years of chemical usage of 8years. The daily duration of spray varies from 3

hours to 9hours and years of chemical use varies from 3-10 years. Average re-entry time to spray

field was found to be 15hours, this is below standard recommendation of at least 24hours re-

entry time for liquid herbicides and 48hours for wettable powders. Farmers attributed this bad

safety habit to the belief that sprayed field should be checked few hours later to find out the

chemical effectiveness. The average number of self-reported pesticide poisoning symptoms per

farmer was found to be 4; these symptoms vary from 1- 12 acute pesticide poisoning.

Figure 2: Baseline self-reported chemical symptoms experienced by farmers during

Source: Data Analysis 2018
       A detailed medical examination of sampled farmers was beyond the scope of the study.

Instead of medical examination, this study relied solely on farmers'' self-reported health

effects/symptoms. Farmers were questioned if they experienced any health impairment after

mixing and spraying pesticides recurrently. The study, however revealed that prominent among

the acute pesticide poisoning symptoms self-reported by farmers include back pain 75%, extreme

tiredness 72%, muscular weakness 54%, and excessive sweating 39% among others.

                             Farmers experienced multiple symptoms of 4 symptoms on the average. Similar findings

on acute pesticide poisoning were made by Dasgupta, Meisner and Haq (2005), who reported

that over 49% of farmers experienced at least one symptom, with the most commonly reported as

neurological (headaches: 27%, dizziness: 8%), eye (irritation: 26%), dermal (skin 13%), and

gastrointestinal (vomiting: 9%). The interviews further revealed that 26% of the respondents

experienced multiple health effects, with an average of 3 and a maximum of 5. Upon asking sick

farmers whether they believed that these symptoms were related to pesticide use, 82% believed

this to be true.

        Also it has been pointed out that main pesticide poisoning symptoms reported by farmers

include skin irritation, headache, extreme tiredness, excessive sweating, blurred vision and

dizziness which are consistent with other studies including (Oesterlund et al., 2014; Williamson,

Ball and Pretty 2008; Jors, et al., 2006; Salameh, et al., 2004 and Ngowi et al., 2001). Results

from studies conducted on human health and occupational exposure to pesticides among

smallholder farmers in cotton zones of Cote d'Ivoire and Lesotho respectively showed that

exposure to pesticides and occurrence of ill health symptoms is evident in agricultural

households in cotton growing areas of Cote d'Ivoire and that a greater health risk is present when

a lack of training and education on the use of pesticides (Mokhele, 2011).

        Ogunjimi and Farinde (2012) in a study conducted in Nigeria reported tearing, redness of

the eyes, cough, difficulty breathing, excessive sweating, headache and yellowing skin as

chemical poisoning symptoms. Other complaints by farmers included lack of muscle

coordination, 56% of the sample population have one ailment or the other which might be as a

result of improper use of chemicals which include dermatosis, cancer, and allergies.

Figure 3: Baseline ergonomic exposure experienced by farmers (N=480)
Source: Data analysis, 2018
       Work-related ergonomic disorders have been identified to be prominent among farmers.

Figure 3, shows that 96% had shoulder pain, 85% reported lower back pain, 82% reported upper

back pain, 64% reported neck pain and 53% reported elbow pain. Empirical evidence had also

posited that work-related ergonomic disorders are manifested in form of pain at the lower and

upper back, shoulders, ankles, knees, elbows, neck, wrist and hand. As further highlighted

musculoskeletal disorders, including back pain, neck pain, tenosynovitis (inflammation of the

wrist tendon), bursitis (inflammation of the shoulder joint fluid sac(bursa) and osteoarthritis of

the knee (degeneration of the knee joint cartilage) are common among agricultural workers

(Earle-Richardson, et al., 2005, Erondu & Anyanwu, 2005; Moreau & Neis, 2009; Myers, 2010;

Durborow et al., 2011).

       Fathalah (2010), submitted that MSDs are so common among experienced farmers that

most of them perceived it is inevitable consequences of farm labour. Previous research by the

New York Center for Agricultural Medicine and Health (NYCAMH) suggests that back, neck

and shoulder strain is a common problem among farm workers (Earle-Richardson et al., 2003).


                                                                                               19
Costello, Mirka, and Gustke, (2003) had earlier opined that crop production is often labour

intensive and requires extensive amounts of repetitive bending, stooping, lifting and carrying of

loads weighing as much as fifty pounds across uneven and unstable surfaces which are

considered high-risk job characteristics for work related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD). In

their study they found that farmers reported WMSD most often in conjunction with equipment

(e.g., climbing up/down equipment; equipment coupling; and equipment operation). Farm

workers reported experiencing increased WMSD with: tobacco topping (e.g., shoulder WMSD;

forearm and wrist tendonitis); tobacco leaf harvesting and curing barn work (e.g., neck, shoulder,

back, and lower extremity WMSD); sweet potato harvesting (e.g., neck, shoulder, back, and

lower extremity WMSD; and fingernail tearing); cucumber harvesting (e.g., neck, shoulder,

back, and lower extremity WMSD); and watermelon harvesting (e.g., neck, shoulder, and upper

extremity WMSD).( Costello, Mirka, and Gustke, 2003).

       Oranusi, Dahunsi and Idowu (2014) found in their study that disorders of muscles, bone,

and joints as the most common occupational-health issues. This is similar to the findings of

Morse and Schenck (2011) who observed about 64% of chronic musculoskeletal disorders

among workers. Oduwaiye at al., (2015), who assessed crop farmers health related hazards found

that about 83.8% of the respondents experienced general body pain which forced farmers to take

days off from farm.

       Sickness absence or production loss time/days are number of days a farmer is unable to

attend to his farm work because he was sick. It is also referred to as absenteeism. The mean

sickness loss among respondents was found to be 6.5days/season. Ordinary least regression was

used to estimate the determinants of sickness absence among cassava farmers. The R2 = 16%

which means the variables in the fitted regression was able to explain the determinants of

sickness absence by 16% while 84% was attributed to other variables not accounted for in this

model. The is study revealed farmers' sickness absence is influenced by age, educational level,

daily duration of chemical spray, care time and number of ergonomic exposure. Specifically,

older farmers have higher sickness absence in their work. This may be due to accumulated

exposure to health risks leading to more ill health in old age. Educational qualification has a

negative relationship with sickness absence among farmers. This may be due to the fact that

education could aid health care utilization leading to reduction in ill health frequency. Daily

duration of chemical spray was found to increase sickness absence. This may be linked to unsafe

practices by farmers exposing them to chemical and ergonomic health risks leading to high

sickness absence. Care time which is the number of days a farmer was unable to attend to his

farm work because a member of the family was sick and such farmer had to care for such family

member was found to have positive relationship with sickness absence. See table 4.


                                                                                            21
       Analyzing productivity and attendance of tea estates in western Kenya, Fox et al. (2004)

found that HIV-positive workers plucked between 4.11 and 7.93 kilograms per day less in the

last year and a half before termination. Compared with non-HIV-positive pluckers, HIV-positive

workers used between 9.2 and 11.0 more sick leave days, between 6.4 and 8.3 more annual leave

days, between 11.8 and 19.9 more casual leave days, and spent between 19.2 and 21.8 more days

doing less strenuous tasks in the two years before termination. Tea pluckers who terminated

because of AIDS-related causes earned 16.0 percent less in their second year before termination

and 17.7 percent less in the year before termination.

       For example, in Tanzania, a study of vegetable farmers reported that 68% of farmers who

used pesticides reported having felt sick after routine pesticide application (Ngowi et al. 2007).

In Zimbabwe, it was found that pesticide acute symptoms significantly increased the direct cost

of illness in cotton growers (Maumbe & Swinton, 2003). The time spent recuperating from

illnesses attributed to pesticides average 2 to 4 days during the growing season. In Oyo State,

Nigeria, the estimated average number of workdays lost per year due to malaria was 64 days in

agrarian households. In Leyte province in the Philippines, 45.4 days in a year were lost to

schistosomiasis. In India, the average number of days lost to tuberculosis (TB) was 83 days per

year. One study analyzed the effects of illness on agricultural households in 22 districts in rural

Kenya, a country with one of the highest rates of HIV infection (Yamano &Jayne 2004).

Effect of health risks exposure on farmers' labour productivity

       Farmers' productivity is often a major consideration for food security and poverty

reduction. However, the average labour productivity of a farmer could be impeded by ill health.

This section was analyzed using ordinary least regression (OLS) to find out effects of health

risks exposure on farmers' productivity. See table 5



                                                                                                22

       The labour productivity of a farmer is the production rate per hour of a farmer's working

time on the farm. Table 5 shows that ergonomic exposure; production loss time/sickness absence

and duration of chemical symptoms exposure had a negative relationship with farmers' average

labour productivity. However, only the production loss time/sickness absence had a significant

statistical relationship with labour productivity of a farmer per season (t=4.06). This implies that

the number of days a farmer was unable to go to the farm in a season due to health issues being

referred to as production loss time/sickness absence affects farmer's labour productivity. It

means every unit increase in production loss days leads to 3% reduction in farmers' labour

productivity. This means risks factors such as chemical and ergonomic health risks exposure that

leads to ill health and production loss should be addressed to aid significant increase in labour

productivity.

       The finding of this study agrees with similar study on impact of health on agricultural

technical efficiency in Nigeria by Egbetokun et al., (2012) that reported that one percent

improvement in the health condition of the farmers will increase efficiency by 21 percent.

Similarly, Donald (2006), also reported that health capital is affected by a number of preventable




                                                                                                 23
diseases such as malaria fever, HIV/AIDS, farm injuries, cholera fever, schistosomiasis,

diarrhoea, respiratory diseases and skin disorders.

       Further findings from the study show that the estimated duration of self-reported

chemical symptoms exposure in hours and average number of ergonomic exposure had a

negative relationship with farmers' labour productivity. However, farmers' age, farming

experience and educational level had a positive relationship.

       Ajani and Ugwu (2008) examined the impact of health conditions on farmers'

productivity in north-central Nigeria and found that a one percent improvement in a farmer's

health condition led to a 31 percent increase in efficiency. Studies such as Loureiro (2009),

Ulimwengu (2009), and Badiane and Ulimwengu (2009) employed stochastic frontier regression

techniques to assess the impact of farmers' health status on agricultural productivity in Spain,

Ethiopia, and Uganda respectively. In each case, the authors found a significant and positive

relationship between measures of health and agricultural technical efficiency. As pointed out by

Hawkes and Ruel (2006), in agricultural communities, poor health reduces income and

productivity, further decreasing people's ability to address poor health and inhibiting economic

development.

       Poor health in turn affects agricultural production. Poor health and Illnesses impairs

farmer's ability to innovate, experiment, and implement changes, and to acquire technical

information available through extension activities (Hawkes & Ruel 2006b; Asenso-Okyere, at

al., 2011). On the other hand, agricultural income influences households' ability to purchase

health-related goods and services that determine their overall health status. Healthcare expenses

may also consume resources that otherwise might be used to purchase improved seed, fertilizer,

equipment, or other inputs. Households with sick members are less able to adopt labour-intensive



                                                                                              24
techniques (Hawkes and Ruel 2006a; Asenso-Okyere, at al., 2011). Negative health and

economic impacts of pesticides can be minimized through training and information campaigns

on pesticide use. In Nicaragua, farmers trained in appropriate pesticide use suffered lower

exposure after two years and had higher net returns than those who had not been trained

(Asenso-Okyere, at al., 2011). This evidence has proved beyond reasonable doubt that balancing

the agricultural occupation with health is crucial to agricultural productivity.

Estimating average program effect on farmers' production loss time/sickness absence

       This section provides information on the effect of the intervention on the production loss

time of farmers in the short-term. The Difference-in-Difference estimator was used in analyzing

this effect since there is two point data. The baseline data and the post intervention survey data

taken at 6months after the completion of the intervention trial.

        The study from the reduced DID regression model is shown in table 6. The average

production loss days at the baseline was found to be 6.50. The difference in the outcome variable

between the treatment and non- treatment before the treatment (selection effect) was found to be

0.11 while change across time common to both group was found to be -0.95. However, the

difference overtime attributed to the intervention was found to be significant at 1% with a

negative effect on the outcome variable (t=-3.34). The statistical significance implies there is an

established causal effect on treatment/intervention on the outcome variable. The study shows the


                                                                                                25
intervention is effective, reducing production loss by 1.9days/6.5days (29% production loss

day's reduction) per treated farmer compared to the control group. With this finding, the treated

group is also more likely to adopt safe farm practices an effect bolstered further by 3months

follow up safety text messages. It implies the treatment model could be scaled up at reducing

production loss time suffered by farmers due to health risks exposure.

       The finding of this study shared some similarities with the study by Cole and Fernado

(2016) engaging RCT and mobile phone in dissemination of information to farmers. The study

reported the treated farmers were 5.3 percentage points more likely than the comparison group to

purchase recommended seeds, an effect bolstered further by reminder text messages.            The

researchers also reported an increased the likelihood that farmers purchased recommended

fertilizers. They also found that the group with follow up reminder text messages had about

60Kg/acre or 8.6% higher yield than the control mean at mid line.

       The findings of this study was further corroborated by earlier studies (See Robert 2006;

Liu, Dow, Fu, Akin and Lance 2008; Loureiro, 2009; Badiane and Ulimwengu 2009;

Ulimwengu 2009; McNamara, Ulimwengu and Leonard 2010) who reported that that

inexpensive health interventions can have a very large impact on agricultural labour productivity.

Studies have further revealed that occupational safety initiatives could lead to an average

increase of 71percent in cost-benefits, 66percent in productivity and 44percent in quality as well

as six dollars return for one dollar investment on safety (Safety Compliance Letter 2004;

Maudgalya, Genaidy & Shell 2008).

at 6months after the completion of the intervention trial. The farmers' safety knowledge was

used as the outcome variable. The outcome variable was scored as follows: knowledge of

chemical route of entry 4points (1point for each body parts), container management knowledge

1points for the correct way of management and 0 for incorrect answer, knowledge of label usage

1points for safety knowledge information on label, expiration date, and knowledge of protective

gear is also scored 1point each and 0 for incorrect answer. A total of 8points is allocated for

farm safety knowledge. The higher the number of points scored by a farmer, the better a farmers'

knowledge of safe farm practices.

       As shown in table 7, on the scale of 8 points, at baseline the average knowledge points

were 2.857, this is quite low. The difference in the outcome variable between the treatment and

non- treatment before the treatment (selection effect) was found to be 0.42 while change across

time common to both group was found to be -0.23.However, the intervention treatment effect

was found positively statistically significant at 1% (t=4.974). This shows the intervention was

able to increase farmers' safety knowledge points by 2.446. Though, knowledge increase may

not directly translate to attitudinal change from a bad safety habits to a good safety culture,

knowledge however, increases the chances of moving towards a safer farm practices.

each body parts), totaling 4points, attitudinal change in container disposal, 1points for the correct

way of management and 0 for incorrect answer. A total of 7points is allocated for farmers' safety

attitudinal change. The higher the number of points scored by a farmer, the safer the attitude

towards chemical related health risks.

better health status and enhanced productivity of farmers.

       Findings from table 9 showed that average labour productivity at baseline was 1.10 tons/

man-days among the farmers. The difference in the outcome variable between the treatment and

non- treatment before the treatment (selection effect) was found to be 0.008 while change across

time common to both groups was found to be 0.10. Although a positive relationship was

established with the intervention and labour productivity significant at 10% level. We opined that

it is a weak evidence to establish that the intervention significantly enhanced labour productivity

across the two groups as (t=1.77) for the interaction effect. This suggests that the ability of the

intervention to reduce sickness absence does not necessarily translate to a strong positive

significant effect on the labour productivity of farmers. However, the positive relationship of the

intervention effect on the labour productivity suggests the possibility of finding a positively

strong significant effect of the intervention on labour productivity in the long term.

4.0 Conclusions
       Studies have established a strong link between good health and improved farmers'

welfare. This study assessed the agricultural health risks exposure among randomly assigned

cassava farmers in Nigeria. The study developed a novel agricultural health training intervention

delivered using blended training approach targeted at crop farmers. The study also evaluated the

effects of the agricultural health training intervention on farmers' well-being. We engaged a

                                                                                                29
unique RCT design, using farm level randomized control trial data from the study, and we

concluded cassava farmers are engaged in unsafe farm practices at different stages of cassava

production. We established farmers' exposures to health risks affect their labour productivity.

Using difference-in-difference estimators, we also established that the intervention enhanced

farm safety knowledge, attitude and reduced sickness absence in short term. We however

documented weak evidence on that the intervention effect on labour productivity. This suggest,

we do not have sufficient evidence to clearly state that the intervention significantly enhanced

farmers' labour productivity. The highlighted results in the study showed the necessity of policy

makers to design effective agricultural health interventions for Nigerian crop farmers to enhance

safe and healthy agricultural practices in farm workplaces. Additional research is needed to

establish the long-term effects and explore issues of cost effectiveness of the intervention. Also

additional research is needed to isolate the mobile technology component of the intervention.

With the short-term evidences, similar interventions engaging the a blended training approach

could be engaged in the future to enhance farmers' adoption of safe farm practices and other

relevant technology with focus on long term intervention effects.
