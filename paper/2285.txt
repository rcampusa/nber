                           Why Does Money Affect Output?
                                     A Survey




                                      ABSTRACT


     Why movements in nominal money appear to have strong and lasting effects on real

activity is one of the most difficult questions in macroeconomics. The paper surveys

the state of knowledge on the issue, with a focus on recent developments.

     The paper starts by reviewing the evolution of thought from Keynes' emphasis on

wages to the "wage price mechanism" of the early 1970's, as well as the facts on the

relation between money, prices and output. From this review, it concludes that the

intellectual crisis of the 1970's came not from the inability of the prevailing

theory to explain the facts —which it had mostly right—, but from the weakness of its

theoretical foundations.

     The paper then examines the reconstruction effort. two alternative strategies

have been followed. The first has been to break with previous research and explore

how far models based on perfect competition and imperfect information could go in

explaining the effects of money on activity. This strategy has largely fizzled and

its proponents moved away from the money—output issue. The second has been instead to

explore whether the many insights of previous research could be made more rigorous

and has focused on the potential role of imperfect competition in labor and goods

markets ; substantial progress has been made, but no grand synthesis has emerged, nor

is likely to in the foreseable future.

     Much of the research on economic fluctuations has focused on the effects on

nominal money on output. This is not because money is the major source of movements

in output : it is not. Rather, it is because economic theory does not lead us to

expect such effects. Indeed it holds that, with flexible prices, money should be

approximately neutral, with changes in nominal money being reflected in nominal

prices rather than in output.

     Of course we know that, even with competitive markets, full information and

flexible prices, the neutrality proposition is only an approximation. Any anticipated

change in nominal money must lead to anticipated changes in the price level, and thus

introduce a wedge between the opportunity cost of holding money and the cost of

capital ; in all cases this will affect utility and, in most cases, is likely to

affect capital accumulation as well (see Fischer [1979] and Chapter 8). Even

unanticipated changes, if they are the result of open market operations are likely to

be non neutral : open market transactions will usually involve some but not all

holders of money and have distribution effects (see Rotemberg [1984], Grossman and

Weiss (1983]). But, except for the effects of steady inflation which may be

substantial (especially when the non neutrality of the tax system is taken into

account) ,   these effects are mere intellectual curiosities ; they can account neither
for the size nor for the shape of the effect of money on output which we shall review

below. For that reason, most of the research has taken as a given that prices do not

adjust fully and instantaneously to nominal money and focused on the reasons for and

implications of imperfect price adjustment. This will also be the approach of this

survey.
                                     2

    From Keynes to the mid 1970's, most researchers had shared a common framework,

the so—called neoclassical synthesis. Changes in money led to changes in aggregate

demand. Because nominal wages and prices adjusted slowly to changes in employment and

output, changes in nominal money led to sustained changes in real money and in

output. Within that framework, research had proceeded on each of the components, the

"transmission   mechanism't of money to aggregate demand on the one hand and the "wage
price mechanism" on the other. By the early 70's, research on   the   wage price
mechanism had a strongly empirical and atheoretical bent, which was to lead to a
serious crisis. While the counter revolution of the 1970'.s was partly triggered by

events, its success was due to the weakness of the theoretical foundations of the

dominant approach. A brief description of the evolution of thought from Keynes to the

early 1970's is given in Section I, which then goes on to review the facts, both on

the relation of money and output, and on the joint behavior of prices, wages and

employment. It concludes that the research on the wage price mechanism had its facts

mostly right, and that the crisiswas one of theory, rather than one of empirical

adequacy. The rest of the survey is devoted to the reconstruction effort.

     The initial strategy was to go back to a model with perfect competition, thus

avoiding the theoretical muddle in which previous research had fallen, but to relax

the assumption of perfect information. The initial model built by Lucas showed how,

with imperfect information, nominal money could affect output. Subsequent research

has examined, focusing on intertemporal decisions by firms and households, how money

shocks could have both large and persistent effects on output. This direction of

research is analyzed in Section II. Partly because of its own dynamics, partly

because of mixed empirical success, this research program has moved away from

studying the effects of nominal money and is now focused on the effects of real,

productivity, taste or fiscal shocks.
                                    3

      By contrast, much of the recent research on the real effects of nominal money

has been based on imperfect competition. While it has been labeled Keynesian, it

often bears only a distant resemblance to the earlier models, and certainly does not

yet constitute a unified whole. Recent developments are presented in Sections III and

Iv.

      Section III starts by presenting the models built in the late 70's by Fischer

and Taylor, which showed that one could introduce rational expectations in models

with nominal wage and price setting and still get long lasting effects of nominal

money on output. These models made an important point and have become workhorses in

the field ; nevertheless they begged important questions, indeed the same questions

which had not been answered by earlier research on the "wage price mechanism". Long

lasting effects of money on output in the Taylor model for example require that two

conditions be satisfied. The first is that the elasticity of the desired real wage

with respect to movements in employment be small   we can think of this as "real wage

rigidity". The second is that, in addition, nominal wages be preset for some period

of time ; we can think of that as "nominal wage rigidity". Why both types of rigidity

are present is not answered in the model. Research has examined the two issues in

parallel. The rest of Section III reviews the research on real rigidities, on why

fluctuations in the demand for goods lead to movements in output with little movement

in markups of prices over wages, and why fluctuations in the demand for labor lead to

movements in employment with little movement in real wages.

      Section IV describes research on nominal rigidities. It starts with the "menu

cost" argument, which holds that, under imperfect competition, and in response to a

change in aggregate demand, the private return to each price setter from adjusting

his price is smaller than the social return. The argument is important for two

reasons ; first, it implies that small menu costs may lead to nominal rigidities and
                                   4

large output effects ; second it implies that the welfare effects of nominal

rigidities arising from small menu costs may be large. The argument is however a

static one, looking at the effect of a one time change in aggregate demand, starting

with identical prices. Subsequent research has shown that the argument does not

extend straightforwardly to a dynamic context. Individual price rigidity may or may

not lead to aggregate price rigidity, depending on the specific nature of price rules

and the interaction between price setters. The relation between welfare effects and

menu costs is also much less clear cut than in the static context. The second half of

Section IV reviews the current state of play.

     Section V questions three implicit assumptions of the previous analysis. The

first is that prices are set in nominal terms. The first part of Section V looks at

the scope for indexation or other monetary reforms to automatically decrease or

eliminate the effects of money on output. The second is that more price flexibility

reduces the effect of money on output and the size of undesired output fluctuations.

But, ever since Fisher and Keynes, we have known that more price flexibility may in

fact be destabilizing, through its effect on real interest rates and through the

redistribution of claims in the economy. This is discussed in the second part of the

section. The third is that the economy, left to itself, eventually returns to its

natural level of unemployment. Recent analysis suggests that this may not always be

the case. If that analysis is correct, even short lived nominal rigidities may lead

to permanent effects of nominal money, or of aggregate demand shocks in general, on

output and employment.

     Section VI concludes.

     Section I. From Keynes to the early 1970's



     1. From Keynes to the neoclassical synthesis



     Keynes' explanation in the "General theory" of the effects of nominal money on

output was based on two main assumptions. He accepted the classical principle that

employment could only increase if real wages decreased. But he added the assumption

that, because workers focused mostly about nominal wages, nominal wages were more

rigid, "sticky" (the word appears to be Keynes') than prices. An increase in money

would then lead to an increase in prices, •a reduction in real wages and an increase

in output.

     It will be convenient to use throughout a simple log linear structure to point

out the major differences between models. As the focus is on aggregate supply, I

shall for the most part use a simple —indeed simplistic— representation of aggregate

demand, expressing output demand only as a function of real money balances, without

any dynamics. I shall also ignore unimportant constants so as not to clutter the

notation. The aggregate demand—aggregate supply framework corresponding to the

General Theory can then be expressed as

     (1.1)       y=   a(m—p)     a>0
     (1.2)       y=   b(w—p)     b(0
     (1.3)       w

    wherey is the log of real output, m, p and w the (logarithms of) nominal money,
nominal   prices and nominal wages respectively. If nominal wages are fixed at level

w*, increases in m increase both output and the price level. Aggregate demand

increases with real money balances, and aggregate supply increases with the decrease
                                           6

     in   the real wage1.


           This   model is a familiar one and has made it to the textbooks up to this day. It

     was however discarded by macroeconomists soon after the "General Theory" as it became

     quickly clear that it was in contradiction with the facts. Dunlop [1938] showed that,

     for the UK, real wages were if anything procyclical, an assumption difficult to

     reconcile with decreasing returns to labor and marginal cost pricing2. lie also

     showed, using informal evidence, that unions often cared explicitly about the cost of

     living and suggested that the assumption that workers cared more about nominal than

     real wages may not be appropriate. These findings led most economists, including

     Keynes himself (1939], to conclude that a more drastic departure from classical

     theory was needed and that price setting in particular could only be understood by

     appealing to imperfect competition.

           This task was however not taken up by macroeconomists working within the

     "neoclassical synthesis", the consensus view of macroeconomics which emerged in the

     1950's and 1960's and within which most of the major developments of post war

     macroeconomics took place. The main achievement of the synthesis was to give solid

     theoretical foundations to many of the decisions taken by individuals and firms such

     as consumption or investment. But price and wage decisions were left out and few

     formal attempts were made to link them explicitly to, for example, bargaining models

     in the labor market or imperfect competition in the goods market. The prevailing mode




             There is obviously more to Keynes [as always...) than this
simplistic characterization. We shall return to some other aspects later in
the chapter.
     Tarshis [1939] who is often credited with the same observation, showed
instead that for the US there was a negative correlation between changes in
aanhours and changes in real wages.
                                       7

of thinking about prices and wages was in terms of tatonnement, with prices and wages

adjusting to excess demand or supply in their respective markets, along the lines of

the dynamic process of adjustment studied by Samuelson in his "Foundations" (1948].

     In retrospect there are probably two main reasons why the neoclassical synthesis

did not take up the task. The first is that it was hard, and the marginal return to

other explorations was higher. The second was the providential role played by the

discovery of the "Phillips curve't relation between the rate of changes of nominal

wages and unemployment (Phillips (1958]): the existence of a reliableempirical

relation made less urgent the need for better microeconomic underpinnings of price

adjustments. Because the facts seemed to be clear and progress on the theoretical

front difficult, most of the research on wage and price behavior was, until the early

70's characterized by its strong empirical bent and a rather eclectic use of

microeconomjc justifications.



     2. The wage—price mechanism as of the early 1970's



     By   the   early 70's, there was a wide consensus as to the main empirical

characteristics    of the "wage—price mechanism". This consensus, summarized in a survey
paper by Tobin (1972] (see also the survey by Santomero and Seater [1978]) was
roughly   the following

     Prices were markups over unit costs at standard rates of output and capacity

utilization : they did not seem to respond to demand movements. The response to

changes in input prices was quick, so that prices played a passive role in the

adjustment of the price level to changes in nominal money : they reflected wage

increases quickly and fully.
                                        8


          Wages were explained by the "augmented" Phillips curve. After its

     transplantation in the (IS by Samuelson and Solow (1960], the Phillips curve

     specification, augmented to allow for an effect of price inflation, had had an

     excellent track record in the 1960's. The rate of change of nominal wages was a

     function of the level of unemployment and of current and past price inflation. The

     question of whether the sum of coefficients on past inflation was equal to one was

     treated as an empirical issue, to be settled by the data. By the early 70's the

     consensus was that, while it had increased over time, the coefficient was still less

     than one, although not significantly so (Gordon (1972)). This implied the existence

     of a long term trade—off between inflation and unemployment.



          In terms of our log linear model, the wage—price mechanism summarized by Tobin,

     can be written as

          (1.1)      y       = a(m—p)

          (1.4)      p

          (1.5)      w—w(—1) = b(p(—1)—p(—2)) +   c y ; 0<b<1, c>0

          Equation (1.1) is aggregate demand. Equation (1.4) is the price equation and

     embodies the assumption of quick passthrough of wage costs and no effect of demand.

     Equation (1.5) is the wage equation, giving wage inflation as a function of lagged

    price inflation and output, used as a proxy for unemployment3. This system reduces to

     a second order difference equation in p. It a is positive, the equation is stable,

    possibly with complex roots. An increase in the level of money leads to an increase




        For simplicity, I shall assume throughout the models presented in this
chapter, the existence of a linear relation between the logarithm of output,
the logarithm of employment and the level of unemployment. I shall therefore
use them interchangeably, as I do in equation (1.5).
                                   9

in output ; output returns to normal over time, with or without oscillations. The

model shares with the earlier Keynes' model the fact that aggregate demand determines

output in the short run ; in contrast to the earlier model however, the real wage

remains the same throughout ; this is the result of markup pricing by firms, as

characterized in equation (1.4).



     The wage—price blocks of the large macroeconometric models built in the early

70's were similar in structure to equations (1.4) and (1.5), with the implication

that movements in money led to a slow adjustment of prices and wages, a long lasting

effect on output and little or no movement in the real wage along the way.



     3. The counterrevolution : the theoretical attack



     It was clear even then that while the wage—price mechanism appeared to fit the

facts successfully, its components were at sharp variance with standard neoclassical

theory. In the price equation, whether the lack of effects of demand on the markup of

prices over labor costs was due to flat marginal cost, or to a squeeze in profit

margins as output increased, was not resolved (see Nordhaus [1972] for a critical

analysis of those price equations). In the wage equation, letting the data decide

whether the coefficient on inflation was equal to one was in contrast with, for

example, the sophisticated derivation of the appropriate user cost under inflation in

the investment literature. It was also not clear why unemployment affected the rate

of change of wages independently of their level. While consistent with a tatonnement

assumption that wages moved as a function of excess supply, measured by unemployment,

it was in contradiction with the idea that, at least in the long run, there should be

a relation between the level of the real wage and the level of labor supply.
                                      10

    These problems were clearer to some than to others. Two important contributions

had questioned the possibility of a long run trade off on a priori grounds. Both

Phelps [1967] and Friedman [1968] had argued that there could only be one equilibrium

rate of unemployment, the "natural" rate and that there was no permanent trade off

between unemployment and inflation ; unemployment could only remain below its natural

rate if inflation accelerated. This "accelerationist hypothesis" was further refined

in an influential book by Phelps et al [1970], which explored how models of search in,

the labor and goods markets could or could not explain wage and price behavior as

embodied in the wage—price mechanism.

     The proximate cause of the crisis however was the introduction of rational

expectations. Together with the natural rate hypothesis, it implied that unemployment

could only be associated with unexpected inflation, thus with unexpected demand

movements. Furthermore, it was shown by Lucas in his celebrated critique (1976) that

the natural rate—rational expectations hypothesis could be true while the sum of

coefficients on inflation in the Phillips curve, which had been the subject of so

much attention, was less than one. His argument was the following. Suppose that the

true Phillips curve had the following form

        w—w(—l) = (Ep—p(—1)) +   cy
where E denotes the expectation of the price level based on past information, so that

wage inflation depended on expected price inflation with a coefficient of one. Assume

also that price inflation followed a first order autoregressive process

        p—p(—1) = P (p(—1)—p(—2)) + e

     Then, if workers had rational expectations and formed expectations of inflation

based on past inflation, the observed Phillips curve would be

        w—w(—1) = P (p(—1)—p(—2)) +    cy
                                   11

     As long as P was less than one, the Phillips curve would appear to imply a long

run trade off when in fact there was none. A change in the inflation process, coming

for example from an attempt by the government to lower unemployment would lead to a

change in P and a change in the coefficient on lagged inflation in the Phillips

curve. The trade off would vanish as the government tried to exploit it.

     The critique implied that the theoretical issue of whether there was a long run

trade off could not be settled simply by looking at the sum of coefficients on lagged

inflation. But the influence of the critique went far beyond that. It had in

particular the effect of focusing attention on the underlying microeconomic

underpinnings of the wage—price mechanism, and many found them lacking. What has

happened since the mid 70's is best described as a return to basics (sometimes very

basics), a search for theoretically consistent explanations of the movement of

nominal wages and prices.



     4. The counterrevolution ; the facts



     The above account emphasizes the crisis in theory. Some have emphasized the

empirical failure of the wage—price mechanism. In a polemical article, Lucas and

Sargent [1978] conclude to "an empirical failure on a grand scale". This is a

considerable overstatement. It is true that estimated coefficient on lagged inflation

kept rising with inflation, and that the estimated equations initially failed to

predict the inflationary effects of the oil shocks of 1974—5. But once the

coefficient on lagged inflation was increased, and the price equation was respecified

so as to allow for materials costs, the equations were once again on track and have

performed decently since then (see Englander and Los [1983] for example). This decent

empirical performance should come as no surprise and may be seen as the result of the

rather a—theoretical approach to the data which we described earlier.

     Indeed, while macroeconoinists have been working on rebuilding theoretical

foundations, the wage—price component of empirical macroeconometric models has not

changed much since the early 70's. Major modifications have been the elimination of

the long run trade off, the introduction of exchange rates, affecting both price

behavior in sectors exposed to foreign competition, and introducing a wedge between

producers' prices and consumer prices. Table 1 gives the results of a dynamic

simulation of the 1985 version of the DRI model. An increase in money of 1% increases

GNP for about 3 to 4 years ; it takes many more years for output to return to normal,

and only after long and slightly damped oscillations. The behavior of the real wage

depends very much on which price deflator is used. The real wage in terms of the GNP

deflator varies with output. The real wage in terms of the CPI moves very little,

increasing slightly before it returns to normal.

     That empirical macroeconometric models have not changed suggests that, whether

or not their structural interpretation of the data is appropriate, they capture

accurately the important cross correlations present in those data. In what follows, I

review the empirical evidence on the effects of money on output. That evidence can be

divided into direct reduced form evidence on the relation between money and output,

and evidence on each of the components of the wage—price mechanism.



     Reduced form evidence on money and output



    That money had a strong impact on output was the major theme of Friedman and

Schwartz (1963). Relying on evidence from the period 1867—1960, and in particular on

a study of turning points in money and output, they concluded that there was a strong

and stable relation between money, nominal and real income, with the causality often

running from money to economic activity. Much of the research on reduced form
                                       13

    evidence since then has taken the sane approach, but relied on formal econometric

    methods instead. To see what can be learned from such an approach, suppose that

    output is affected by money and other variables according to the reduced form

    relation

         (1.6)      y = S at y-i ÷ S bi rn-i + S   x-ict   + e

         where y is some measure of output, such as the logarithm of GNP, m a measure of

    nominal money, such as the logarithm of Ml, x a vector of other variables, such as

    fiscal policy or exports, and e is serially uncorrelated. Sums run from 1 to n for y,

    from 0 or 1 to k for m and x.

         When will estimation of this equation by ordinary least squares give unbiased

    estimates of the effects of nominal money on output ? Two conditions are required.

    The first is that all right hand side variables be uncorrelated with the current

    innovation in output, e. The second is that, if current money or x are not included,

    their true coefficients be equal to zero4



         Causality tests were first introduced by Sims [1972] to characterize the dynamic

    interactions between money and output. Bivariate causality tests are based on

    equations such as (1.6), but allowing for no other variables than y and m, and

    excluding current m. When applied to the relation between money and output, they

    typically have found that the estimated at's and bi 's imply a strong dynamic response

    of y torn (The dynamic response of y to m is given by the coefficients of (1—a(L))

    'b(L), where a(L) and b(L) are the lag polynomials in (1.6)). A typical response




     These conditions are regularly rediscovered. They were emphasized in the
discussion of the Saint Louis model, and more recently when economists tried
to understand what could or could not be learned from causality tests (see
[Cooley and LeRoy 1985])

    pattern, from Sargent [1976a] is given in Table 2, column 1. It shows a response of

    unemployment to Ml peaking after 5 quarters and becoming negative after 11 quarters

    Many bivariate causality tests have been run, using different empirical counterparts

    for the quantity variable and for money, different periods and sampling intervals,

    and different treatments of non stationarity in in and y. The effect of money has been

    found to be usually significant, although the level of significance depends on the

    method of detrending (stochastic, or deterministic) (Stock and Watson (1987]).

    Eichenbaum and Singleton [1986], for example, using first differences of log GNP and

    second differences of log Ml, and monthly data from 1949 to 1983, find the effect of

    money on output to be barely significant.

         Given our discussion above, it is clear that the conditions under which this

    estimated dynamic response is the true dynamic response are unlikely to be met.

    First, there are surely other variables than money which affect output and are

    correlated with money. Second, it is quite likely that current money is affected by

    e, innovations in output. It may even be that lagged money is correlated with the

    current innovation in output. This will be the case if the central bank has

    information about future output beyond what can be learned from the history of money

    and output ; in this case lagged money will help predict output even if it does not

    affect it (this is the stochastic extension of the "Post hoc, ergo propter hoc"

    argument made by Tobin [197O]). The simultaneity problem may be less serious for

    some components of money than for others. King and Plosser [1984], using annual data

    from 1953 to 1978 find a weaker and shorter effect of high powered money than of Ml.

    A possible interpretation is that the strong effect of Ml on output found by others

    comes in fact partly from the reaction of inside money to output.




     These problems of economic interpretation of causality tests were pointed
out by Sims ; users of causality tests have not always resisted the temptation
to make unwarranted inferences.
                                     15

     Multivariate causality tests, that is tests in which other variables than y and

a are allowed on the right hand side of (1.6) have also been implemented. Sims (1980]

in particular has found that when short nominal interest rates are added to nominal

money in (1.6), money no longer has a significant effect on output. What it means is

however unclear and open to many interpretations ; McCallum (1983a) has shown that

these results would arise if for example the Federal Reserve used money to peg

interest rates.



     Another line of research has looked at the effects of money while more

explicitly controlling for the presence of other variables, the x variables in (1.5).

The first attempt was made by Andersen and Jordan in the Saint Louis model (1970].

More recently, work by Barro [1977] has spurred a new set of estimates. Barro ran an

equation similar to (1.6) ,   allowing   for the presence of a time trend and a proxy for

exogenous government spending in x. He also decomposed money growth into two

components, one "unanticipated", obtained as the residual from a forecasting equation

including lagged money and other variables, and one "anticipated" and equal to the

forecast value. Using annual data for the period 1946 to 1976, he concluded that the

hypothesis that only the unanticipated component affected output could not be

rejected, and that this unanticipated component affected output for up to three

years. In Barro [1978], this approach was extended to look at the joint response of

output and prices, and in Barro and Rush [1980] the same approach was used on

quarterly data. The data have been reexamined by Mishkin [1983] who, using quarterly

data for 1954—1976 and longer lag structures, concludes that both the unanticipated

and the anticipated components have a long lasting effect on output. The dynamic

response   of output to an "anticipated" and an "unanticipated" permanent change in
money, from Mishkin, is given in table 2, column 2. Both components of money have

                                                                                  1
                                       16

    large and long lasting effects on output. It is clear however that, while this

    approach is more careful about the inclusion of other variables than money in (1.6),

    the interpretation of the dynamic response as structural still depends on the

    maintained assumption of zero correlation between the innovation in output and

    current and lagged money, anticipated or unanticipated'.

         The decomposition of money between anticipated and unanticipated components has

    also been questioned. Sargent [197Gb] has pointed out that, if expectations of money

    were based only on past money, there would be infinitely many ways of decomposing a

    distributed lag of money as the sum of two distributed lags in anticipated and

    unanticipated money. Identification depends on the presence of explanatory variables

     other than money in the equation for money, and may therefore be weak. Fischer (1980]

    has also noted that the data are unlikely to be able to distinguish between Barro's

     specification and a specification in which output depends on anticipated money and

    unanticipated money n periods —rather than one period— ahead. The two specifications

    have however drastically different policy implications.



         Poterba, Rotemberg and Summers [1986) have adopted an indirect approach to

     testing nominal rigidities that avoids this simultaneity problem, by looking not at

     the effects of money but at the effects of shifts between direct and indirect

     taxation. In the absence of nominal rigidities, it should not matter which side of

     the market a tax is collected on. In the presence of nominal rigidities, it may




6    It is interesting to note the qualitative similarity of the dynamic
responses in table 2 to those in table 1, obtained from the DRI model. Reduced
form estimates are however larger that those obtained from simulations of
structural models. This was already noted and discussed in the context of the
Saint Louis model. Potential explanations involve the bias in reduced form
estimation discussed above, or the neglect of some transmission channels in
structural models.
                                   17

however affect the price level and output   if for example, nominal wages are fixed,

the shift from direct taxation to a value added tax will increase the price level and

decrease output. To the extent that changes in taxation are more exogenous than

money, this avoids some of the problems mentioned above. Their analysis of the

empirical evidence leads them to conclude that there are substantial nominal

rigidities, both in the US and the UK.



     Reduced form evidence thus suggests a strong relation between money on output.

Part of it may be due to the effect of output on money. Part of it surely is not. The

event studies provided by the UK and US disinflations of the early So's, in addition

to those described by Friedman and Schwartz, strongly support the view that monetary

policy affects output.



     Evidence on the components of the wage—price mechanism



     It would take us too far afield to review the empirical work on wage and price

behavior in any detail (we shall discuss some of it in relation to specific

theoretical developments later on). But, in the spirit of the general skepticism that

has permeated macroeconometrics since the mid 70's, research has proceeded to see

whether the stylized facts on which the wage—price mechanism was based were actually

present in the data.



     The first stylized fact was the lack of response of the markup of prices on

wages to movements in output or, put another way, the lack of a negative correlation

between real product wages and employment, as would be expected if the economy moved

along a stable demand for labor. Sargent [1978) suggested that the presence of costs
                                   18

of adjustment for employment implied a more complex dynamic relation between real

wages and employment and could be consistent with little contemporaneous negative

correlation between the two. His attempt to explain the data in this way was however

not very successful. Later research along the same lines has confirmed that there is

no clear correlation at any lag between product wages and employment in the US, but

has shown the existence of a negative correlation between lagged real wages and

employment in some other industrialized countries (see Bruno and Sachs [1984], Geary

and Kennan [1982]). Bus [1985], using US panel data on individual workers, concludes

that the real consumption wage is procyclical.

    The other main stylized fact was the Phillips curve, a relation between wage

changes, past price changes and unemployment. Causality tests have consistently shown

that lagged employment does not Granger cause real wages (Sargent [1978), Neftci

[19781). While this has been taken as evidence against the Phillips curve, it does

not look at the same set of correlations ; the Phillips curve is a relation between

nominal wage inflation, lagged inflation and current as well lagged employment, not

necessarily between actual real wages and lagged employment. If the economy had both

a Phillips curve and mark up pricing for example, there would be no relation between

real wages —which are constant— and employment.

     Looking at reduced form evidence on wages, prices and employment, I have asked

whether an econometrician who ignored the existence of the wage—price mechanism

described by Tobin could find it in US data (Blanchard [1986b]). To do so, I wrote

down a structural model, with a wage, a price and an aggregate demand equation, and

then derived and estimated the unconstrained reduced form. I then asked what

structural price, wage and aggregate demand equations were consistent with the

reduced form evidence and concluded that the reduced form evidence was roughly

consistent with the existence of the structural wage price mechanism described by

Tobin.

        5. The reconstruction effort



        To summarize, the crisis of the 70's arose not because the wage—price mechanism

was in contradiction with the facts, but because its explanation of the facts was at

variance with theory. Thus, the reconstruction effort has been largely theoretical.

It is part of a much larger enterprise affecting all of macroeconomics, and it

interacts with it. For example, if we think of contracts under asymmetric information

as being an important factor in labor markets, then the price level is a potential

signal and the study of why nominal wages are not fully indexed should start from

there. Or if we think of imperfect competition as being important in goods markets,

this may explain why, as price may exceed marginal cost most of the time, firms may

be willing to accomodate increases in demand at a given price. We shall touch on

those other developments only to the extent that they are relevant to the issue at

hand.

        Research has taken two radically different directions.

        The first has explored whether the stylized facts could be reconciled with a

more standard neoclassical model. Thus, it has worked under the maintained "as if"

assumption of perfect competition in all markets but relaxed the assumption of full

information. It has focused both on the impact effects of disturbances such as money

and on the channels for persistence. I shall refer to this approach as the "imperfect

information" approach and review it in the next section.

     The second has explored instead whether the many leads and insights of the

earlier literature could be made more rigorous and could form the basis for a

theoretically consistent explanation of the effects of money on output and of the

wage—price mechanism. I shall refer to that approach as the "imperfect competition"

approach and study it in sections III and Iv.
                                       20




         While the two approaches differ in their philosophy, they share two common

    methodological precepts. The first is that any explanation for the effects of money

    on output should hold even under rational expectations. Nearly all of the research

    has indeed assumed rational expectations as a working hypothesis. The second, which

    we shall not focus on, is that fluctuations should be analyzed using the Frisch—

    Slutzky impulse—propagation framework in which fluctuations are thought of as the

    result of stochastic impulses affecting variables through a propagation mechanism1;

    this approach, which is consistent with time series methods, has allowed a better

    integration of macroeconomic theory and econometric methods ; this integration is

    perhaps as important a development as the substantive results described below.




        Because linear stochastic processes are easier to deal with, work on
non linear dynamic systems, which had been popular earlier, has dwindled.
There has however been recently renewed interest in non linear deterministic
systems which can generate rich dynamics or even dynamics similar to those of
stochastic processes (see for example Grandmont [1985]). There are few results
to date using this approach on the issues studied in this chapter.

          Section XI Imperfect information



          Models of search, developed initially by macroeconomists to explain the various

     aspects of the wage price mechanism had shown the importance and the potential of

     relaxing the assumption that markets were cleared by a fully informed auctioneer (see

     the introduction by Phelps to his volume [1970]). This had two main implications.

     First, because of imperfect information on the part of buyers and sellers, whoever

     set a price was likely to have at least transient monopoly or monopsony power.

     Markets could no longer be viewed as competitive. Second, if individuals had limited

     information, there was the potential for aggregate nominal shocks to affect output.

     The reason was sketched by Phelps. Individuals and firms faced both individual and

     aggregate shocks. Because they had limited information, they could not distinguish

     accurately between the two. Even if they had wanted to react only to individual

     shocks, they ended up reacting also to aggregate shocks such as changes in nominal

     money. Nominal money therefore could affect output.

          Developing general equilibrium models with optimal price setting under imperfect

     information proved however difficult and, early on, the choice was made to examine

     the implications of imperfect information while maintaining the assumption of perfect

     competition in all markets. This was an important choice, making for more tractable

     models at the cost of eliminating important issues. The first macroeconomic models

     along those lines were developed by Lucas




     The material in this section is covered more extensively in chapter 21,
from a different angle.
                                   22

     1. The Lucas Model



     Lucas [1972] constructed a macroeconomic model with optimizing agents,

decentralized markets and imperfect information. A streamlin!d version was given in

[1913] and has the following structure



     (2.1)      y =   a(m—p)

     (2.2)      Pt =p+e
     (2.3)      yt = b(pt—Eip)



     No distinction is made between workers and firms. Output is produced by n firms,

indexed by i, each operating as a price taker in its own market. Equation (2.1) is

aggregate demand. Equation (2.2) gives the price facing each firm, pi ; pi differs

from the price level p by a random variable ei ,    which reflects movements in relative

demands across markets. The et are uncorrelated across firms and are white noise. The

supply of each firm is given by equation (2.3) : Eip is the expectation of the price

level by firm i, based on its observation of pi. Firms react only to perceived

relative price changes.

     When firms observe a high value of pi,      this   may reflect either a high value of

m, or a high value of ei, or both. This leads them to revise upwards their

expectation of p, according to Eip =    Em   + k(pi—Em), where Em is the expectation of m

(and p) they held before observing pi. The parameter k depends on the relative

variances of unanticipated money and of the shock et , and is between zero and one.

Replacing in (2.3) gives yj = b(1—k)(i—Em). The higher the nominal price it

observes, the higher its conditional expectation of a relative price shock et ,       the

higher the supply of firm i. Aggregating over firms gives ai aggregate supply curve
                                              23

          (2.4)      y = b(l—k) (p—Em)

          Solving (2.3) and (2.4) gives

                     p = d Em + (1—d)    it            where   d = b(1—k)/(a+b(1—k)) and

          (2.5)      y = ad   (rn—Em)




          Imperfect information leads therefore to an effect of unanticipated money on

     output. This is because firms partly misperceive money shocks for relative price

     shocks. The counterpart is that firms partly misperceive relative price shocks for

     money shocks and thus underreact to those ;          this   however has no macroeconomic

     implications.



          The (1972] and (1973] models showed how, under market clearing and imperfect

     information, unanticipated money could affect output. Neither however showed why

     money could have lasting effects on output9, nor did they try to explain the specific

     behavior of firms versus workers, wages versus prices. Those issues were taken up by
                                                   -

     subsequent research.



          2. Impulse and Propagation mechanisms



          Intertemporal substitution




•
     While the 1973 model includes lagged output in the supply equation,
leading to lasting effects of unanticipated money on output, it is, as Lucas
indicated, an assumption without justification within the model.
                                      24

    The mechanism through which money had a positive effect on output in the Lucas

model raised two questions. The first was asked by Lucas himself        how could

misperceptions about money have such large effects on supply ? The second was raised

most explicitly by Friedman [1978)         why was it that suppliers rather than buyers

were the ones who misperceived prices ? If the information structure was such that

suppliers observed prices accurately, but that buyers were misled in thinking that a

high price meant in part a high relative price, wouldn't this lead to a decrease in

demand and anoutput contraction instead ?

     The answer to the first question had already been suggested by Lucas and Rapping

[19691 who had focused on workers and labor supply. Perceived permanent changes in

the real wage were unlikely to lead to large supply responses, because of conflicting

income and substitution effects. Perceived temporary changes however had mainly

substitution effects and could lead to large responses. }lore generally and more

formally, the relevant intertemporal relative price to a supplier i was

(Pi/P)/(1+re) (p1t/p0) ,   the ratio of his perceived relative price (the real wage for
workers) to his expected relative price discounted by the expected real interest

rate. If when suppliers observed an increase in their price, they infered that it was

partly due to a favorable shift in demand, and if they did not expect these shifts in

demand to be permanent, they would then respond to nominal shocks by increasing

supply.

     The issues raised by the second question were analyzed by Sarro who, in a series

of papers, constructed models allowing for intertemporal substitution and

misperceptions on both the supply and the demand side. A general equilibrium model

where money is the only asset so that the real interest rate is the negative of the

rate of inflation and the relevant relative price is simply j/1je was developed in

Barro [1976) ; It was extended in Barro [1981) to allow for other assets than money
                                   25

and to deal with the endogeneity of the real interest rate. These models show how

intertemporal substitution and specific information structures can deliver positive

effects of money on output ; they do not however make a convincing case for the

specific information structure and set of structural coefficients which deliver such

positive effects.



     Persistence

     The second issue was how the initial misperception could have long lasting

effects on output and employment. Two types of channels were later identified

     First? if the initial misperception led firms or workers to change a state

variable, a variable which affected their decisions in subsequent periods, the

initial impulse would have lasting effects. Lucas [1979] emphasized the role of

capital in creating persistence. If misperceptions led firms to both sell and invest

more, the higher capital stock would later on lead to a higher profit maximizing

level of output. Output would be higher until firms decreased their capital back to

equilibrium. While capital accumulation appears to be an unlikely channel for

cyclical persistence, similar effects, but working through inventories or through

employment in the presence of costs of adjustment were characterized by Blinder and

Fischer [1981] and Sargent (1979] respectively. Howitt [1986] has recently shown that

persistence also emerges from an explicit search model of the labor market, where

persistence arises from costs of changing employment.

    Another channel for persistence was identified by Taylor (1975] and Lucas (1975]

  if direct information about nominal shocks was not available even ex post, large

permanent changes in money could be misperceived for relative price changes for a

long time, during which they would have an effect on output.
                                   26

     Those extensions still imply that only unanticipated changes in nominal money

matter, but their effects on output can now be long lasting. There is however an

obvious tension between the factors needed to get large impulses and those needed to

get persistence. Strong intertemporal substitution, for example, leads to a strong

response of labor supply to misperceptions, but through the accumulation of wealth,

also leads to lower labor supply later, to negative serial correlation of output in

response to shocks. Costs of adjustment on the other hand lead to more persistence,

but to smaller initial effects of shocks.



     Policy Implications

     Most of the models above share the same policy implications. These were first

pointed out by Lucas [1973), Sargent (1973] and Sargent and Wallace [1975)

Anticipated money had no effect. Unanticipated money could in general affect output

but, if the monetary authority had no more information than the public, this effect

was unlikely to improve welfare   if the policy maker had no more information than

the public, unanticipated monetary movements would be uncorrelated with other shocks,

increasing noise and making signal extraction more difficult for individuals and

firms, decreasing the allocative efficiency of the price system. If the policy maker

had more information, money could then obviously be used to offset other shocks and

improve welfare but an equally efficient way of achieving the same outcome would then

be simply to make information, available to the public. These conclusions have been

slightly qualified later. Weiss [1980] and King [1982] have shown that policy rules

based on public information can sometimes affect the outcome by changing the

information content of observable prices. Other examples have been constructed of

economies with other distortions in which additional noise can be welfare improving.

These qualifications not withstanding, the role for monetary policy is drastically

reduced from the role it can play under the standard wage price inechanim.

     3. Empirical Evidence



     Reduced form evidence   money1 output and the price level



     The most striking implication of imperfect information models, and the most at

variance with previous beliefs is that anticipated money does not matter. The

evidence on the relation between money and output has been reexamined by Barro in a

series of articles (1977, 1978, 1980] which we have already briefly described.

Dividing money into two components, unanticipated and anticipated money, Barro

concluded that he could not reject the hypothesis that anticipated money did not

affect output. Further work by J4ishkin [1983] has shown however that anticipated

money also affects output, although by less than unanticipated money. These results

were shown in table 2.

     While money stock figures are published with little delay, they are subsequently

revised. A literal interpretation of imperfect information models suggests that only

the unperceived component of money, that is the difference between the final revision

and the initial announcement, should affect economic activity. This was tested by

Barro and Hercowitz (1980] and Boschen and Grossman (1982] and decisively rejected

this is however a rejection only of an extreme and absurd version of imperfect

information models.

     An other implication of most —although not all— imperfect information models is

that money affects output through price level surprises. An equation relating output

movements to unanticipated price level movements was first run by Sargent (1976a] who

found only weak evidence in favor of such an effect. Fair (1979] found instead, by

extending the sample period to include the 1970's, a positive correlation between
                                           28

     unemployment and price level innovations      These results have been challenged by Gray

     and Spencer [1984] who argue that whether the correlation between price level and

     output innovations are positive or negative depends on whether supply or demand

     shocks dominate the sample. Specifying unemployment as a function of price level

     surprises, energy price surprises and proxies for frictional unemployment, they find

     that price level surprises have a significant effect on unemployment. Using annual

     data, they find the following relation between unemployment and unanticipated price

     level movements

          u = —.4 (p—E(pI—1))—l.4(p—E(p—2))—.8(p—E(pI—3)) +     (supply   factors)

     where u is the unemployment rate, and E(p—i) is the expectation of the (logarithm of

     the) price level at time t based on information available at time t—i'°. Note that

     this relation can be rewritten as a price—price Phillips curve, namely as

     p = —.4 u +   (.1   E(ph-1)+.6 E(p—2) + .3 E(pI—3)) + (supply factors)

          What Gray and Spencer have thus shown is that the set of correlations

     traditionally summarized by the Phillips curve can also be given an alternative

     interpretation, an interpretation more consistent with the imperfect information

     approach'1. }lore generally, one may conclude from a reading of the research on

     reduced form evidence that the comovements of output, prices and money are consistent

     with the view that unanticipated money has weaker effects on the price level and

     stronger effects on output than anticipated money'2.




10    The presence of lagged expectations is easier to justify in a contract
model, such as those studied in the next section than in an imperfect
information model. Gray and Spencer derive their specification from such a
contract model.
Li    The presence of lagged expectations is however easier to justify in the
context of models with nominal rigidities reviewed in the next section.

anticipated money in the previous section.

          Intertemporal substitution, the real wage, labor supply and consumption



          While most imperfect information models share the same reduced form implications

     for output and prices, they differ in their implications as to the relation between

    real wages and employment, which depends crucially on the source of disturbances and

    the information structure. If firms perceive prices and wages accurately, money

    shocks must lead to movements along the labor demand of firms and are likely to imply

    a negative correlation of real wages and employment. But if instead workers perceive

    wages and prices accurately, movements take place along labor supply, with a likely

    positive correlation between real wages and employment. In all cases however,

    intertemporal substitution by workers in response to correctly or incorrectly

    perceived opportunities must be an essential part of the model. Thus, intertemporal

    substitution has been subject to exhaustive econometric examination

          If variations in individual wages largely exceed aggregate variations,

    misperception of current real wages because of incorrect perceptions of the price

    level, while essential to explain aggregate fluctuations, may be a minor issue for

    individual workers'3. Thus, even if aggregate fluctuations are due to imperfect

    information, panel data on real wages and employment can still be used to estimate

    the elasticity o substitution. If individuals are formalized as intertemporal

    utility maximizers with additively separable utility in consumption and leisure,

    there are two ways in which the elasticity of substitution can be estimated. The

    first is to look at the effects of changes in wages on hours worked, controlling for




      The fact that business cycle fluctuations are small compared to
fluctuations in individual fortunes was stressed by Lucas (1977)
                                          30

     total wealth. The other is to estimate the static first order condition, which gives

     a relation between consumption, leisure and the real wage. Empirical evidence using

     both approaches is reviewed by Ashenfelter (1984] (see also Altonji (1986]). Most of

     the evidence points to a small positive elasticity, surely insufficient to explain

     the fluctuations in aggregate employment.

           Mankiw, Rotemberg and Summers [1985] have examined the joint behavior of

     aggregate consumption, employment and real wages, to see whether consumption and

     employment could be explained as the result of optimal intertemporal choice by a

     "representative" individual. This approach implicitly assumes that workers can

     observe actual real wages and have common expectations about the future. They show

     that the joint behavior of aggregate employment, consumption and real wages is

     inconsistent with such assumptions. The reason why is a simple and important one

     business cycles are characterized by conovements in consumption and employment, or

     equivalently by opposite movements in consumption and leisure. If utility is

     additively separable in time, this can only be explained by large procyclical

     movements in the aggregate real wage (this point is further developed by Barro and

     Ring [1984]) ,   which however are not present in the data. Attempts to reconcile the

     behavior of the real wage, consumption and leisure by allowing for non time

     separability in utility have not been successful (Eichenbaum, Hansen and Singleton

     [1987]). There appears to be only two ways to reconcile the data with large

     intertemporal substitution effects : the first is that business cycle fluctuations

     are largely the result of taste shocks, taste shifts between consumption and leisure.     -



     The other is that the real wage is not equal to the marginal rate of substitution

     between leisure and consumption      this would be the case if labor contracts provided

     insurance through real wages'4. In this latter case, the marginal rate of




14    We describe briefly the implications of such contracts in the next
section.
                                      31

substitution should still be equal to the marginal product of labor ; thus,

intertemporal substitution may still be testable.



      Current developments

      Research on macroeconomic models with imperfect information has dwindled in the

1980's. Many of its proponents have moved on to develop real business cycles models,

models in which money and misperceptions play little or no role and where shocks come

instead from either government spending (Barro [1986]), or tastes and technology (see

for example Prescott [1986]). In those models, the correlation between money and

output is explained by reverse causality ; money may precede movements in output if,

for example, it is an input in production and production takes time (King and Plosser

[1984] ,   Eichenbaum and Singleton [1986]) . There are probably two reasons for this

shift in focus

     The first is that, as the emphasis has shifted more and more to intertemporal

choice, it has proven convenient to work with explicit representative agent models,

in which cycles are formalized as the result of equilibrium with intertempora].ly

maximizing identical firms and identical individuals. These models have complex

dynamics even in the absence of money and imperfect information. The focus on real

business cycles may then be justified as a tractable and necessary firststep.

     The other reason arises from the mixed empirical success of the imperfect

information—money shocks approach. Focusing on other types of shocks may help

reconcile the behavior of quantities and prices. Allowing for taste shocks for

example may help explain the opposite movements in consumption and leisure in the

face of little movement in real wages. It is too early to tell whether this approach

will be more successful (see Summers [1981] for a negative forecast). But it surely

falls outside the scope of this chapter and is covered at length in Chapter 21.

         Section III Imperfect Competition



         For those who believed that the wage—price mechanism was generally sound despite

     its weak theoretical foundations, the immediate task was to explore how it could

     accomodate rational expectations. Two important papers, by Fischer [1977a] and by

     Taylor [1980], developed models which embodied nominal rigidities and rational

     expectations, and which implied a role for policy in general and for monetary policy

     in particular. The section starts with them. While these models answered the

     immediate challenge, they did not however dispose of most of the earlier theoretical

     objections to the wage—price mechanism. Much of the research since has attempted to

     put price and wage determination on more solid foundations. This is reviewed in this

     and the next section.



          1. Price and wage setting, and the effects of money on output



          The Fischer model



          Fischer (1977a] introduced the following model '

          (3.1)      y = (m—p) + u

          (3.2)      y = —(w—p)




15    A closely related model was presented at the same time by Phelps and
Taylor [1977]. It is interesting to note that Phelps, in presenting his model,
thought of it as a natural extension of the work presented in the Phelps
volume, in particular of the work on the implications of imperfect information
on price setting. In that sense, both the imperfect information and imperfect
competition approaches trace back to the same origin.
                                              33

              (3.3)         w = E(pI—l)

              Equation (3.1) is aggregate demand, with, for convenience, unit elasticity of

         output with respect to money balances. u is a non policy demand disturbance. Equation

         (3.2) is output supply, obtained from profit maximization, with again for

         convenience, the assumption of unit elasticity of output supply with respect to the

         wage16. The important equation is (3.3), which says that nominal wages are preset at

         the beginning of the period, on the basis of available information so as to achieve,

         in expectation, a constant teal wage and constant employment. The information

         available when the nominal wage is set includes lagged but not current values of m

         and u.

              Solving for w under rational expectations and replacing gives'7

                            y = (1/2)((m—E(m—1)) + (u—E(uI—1)))

              Thus, demand and money shocks affect output only to the extent that they are

         unanticipated ; the reduced form relation is very similar to that of the Lucas model.

         But the channel is the same as in Keynes : as prices are flexible but nominal wages

         fixed within the period, demand shocks increase prices, decrease real wages and

         increase output.

              In this first model, if policy makers cannot act more often and do not have more

         information than wage setters, there is no role for policy to stabilize output. But

         this is no longer true when nominal wages are set for periods of time longer than the

         time between policy decisions. This is shown in the second model presented by




    16      Fischer   introduces also a supply disturbance v ; in the presence of
-   such a disturbance, workers cannot in general choose nominal wages so as to
    achieve both constant expected real wages and constant expected employment. I
    do not want to deal with those issues here and put v equal to 0. I return to
    those issues when I study indexation below.
    17    For the mechanics of solving linear models with rational expectations,
    see Taylor (1986b)

Fischer. In that model, at the beginning of each period, half of the labor force now

presets its nominal wages for two periods, the current and the next. Each nominal

wage is again set so as to achieve a constant expected real wage in each of the two

periods. The model becomes

     (3.1)      y = (m—p)+u

     (3.2')     y = —(1/2)[(w—p)+(w(—1)—p)]

     (3.3)      w =   E(pI-l)        w(—l) = E(p—2)
     Equation (3.2') gives the wage relevant to firms. It is a weighted average of

the nominal wages currently in existence. The first, which applies to half of the

labor force, is the wage chosen for this period at the beginning of this period ; the

second is that chosen for this period at the beginning of the previous period. They

are denoted w and w(—l) respectively. Equation (3.3) states that each of these two

nominal wages is in turn equal to the expectation of the current price level based on

information available as of the time the wage was set       wages are set so as to

achieve, in expected value, a constant real wage. Solving for output under rational

expectations gives

                y = (l/2)[(1/3)(m—E(mI—1)+(2/3)(m—E(m—2)] +

                      (1/2)N1/3)(u—E(u—1)+(2/3)(u—E(ul—2)]
    Output movements still depend only on unanticipated money and demand shocks. But

unanticipated money is now equal to money minus a weighted average of money

anticipated as of this and the previous period. This has two implications. The first

is that the effects of money on output last for two periods. The second is that

monetary policy based only on information available at the beginning of the period

can decrease output fluctuations. To see this, assume for example that u follows a

random walk, say u = u(—1) +    v,   where v iswhite. Then, if money was constant, output

would follow
                                           35

                y   (1/2)[v+(2/3)v(—1)]

          If instead, monetary policy follows the rule m = —(2/3)v(—1), output follows y =

     (l/2)v    and has smaller variance. The reason for why money works is simple : in

     response to unexpected demand disturbances this period, nominal wage setters would

     like to readjust their nominal wages for next period. Half of them cannot but the

     monetary authority can, by adjusting money for next period, cancel the effect of the

     unexpected demand disturbance on next period's price level.

          An implication of this result is that if an optimal feedack rule is used for

     money, the variance of output does not increase with the number of periods during

     which nominal wages is fixed. Thus, activist monetary policy can offset the effects

     of multiperiod predetermination of wages. The model makes a strong case for activist

     policy.



          The Taylor model



          Following an earlier paper by Akerlof (1969], John Taylor (1980] introduced a

     model similar in most respects to the two period staggered wage setting model of

     Fischer but with one important difference      wages were not only predetermined but

     fixed for two periods, that is set at the same nominal level for those two periods'8.

     A simpler version was presented by Taylor (1979] and has the following structure




18    the two other differences are unimportant. In Fischer, firms operate
under decreasing returns and workers desire a constant real wage. In Taylor,
firms operate under constant teturns to scale and workers desired real wage is
an increasing function of employment. Thus, in Fischer, output appears in the
price equation, but not in the wage equation. In Taylor, output appears in the
wage equation, but not in the price equation. As long as labor supply and
labor demand are not both infinitely elastic with respect to the wage, whether
output appears in one or in the other or in both equations does not affect the
qualitative effects of money on output. It does affect however the qualitative
effects of money on real wages. In Taylor, real wages are constant ; in
Fischer, they are countercyclical.
                                             36




          (3.4)      y = (m-p)

          (3.5)      p =   (1/2) (w   + w(—1))

          (3.6)      w =   (l/2)[p+E(p(+1H-l]     +(1/2)a[E(yl—l)+E(y(+1H-1)J



          Equation (3.4) gives aggregate demand. We do not allow here for shocks other

     than nominal money.

          Each period, half of the labor force chooses a nominal wage for the current and

     the next period ; this wage is denoted w. Thus in the current period, halt of the

     labor force is paid w, and half is paid w(—1). Equation (3.5) gives the price level

     as a weighted average of these two wages. The markup of prices over wages is assumed

     not to depend on the level of output.

          Equation (3.6) gives w, the wage chosen this period for the current and the next

     period. If workers could choose their nominal wage each period, it would be an

     increasing function of the price level, with unit elasticity, and of output

     (employment), with elasticity a. As they preset their nominal wage for two periods,

     the nominal wage w depends on the price level and on output this period and expected

     for the next. Money is assumed to be known only after wages have been set and is

     therefore not in the information set when w is chosen.

          Replacing p and E(p(1fl—l) from (3.5) in (3.6) and reorganizing

          (3.7)      w = (1/2)[w(—l)+E(w(+1H—1J + a [E(yl—1)+E(y(+1fl—1)]

          This suggests an alternative interpretation of wage behavior. Workers care about

     relative wages, thus about w(—1) and E(w(+1) I—i) ,   the wages paid to the other half of
     the labor force this period and next. This is the interpretation given byTaylor'9.




      It is sometimes argued that the Taylor model depends on the assumption
that workers care directly about their wages in comparison to other wages, an
assumption which is thought by some to be unattractive. As the first
presentation of the model in the text should make clear, this is not the case.
                                        37

          To solve this model under rational expectations, it is easier to specify a

     process for m. If in follows for example a random walk, the solution is given by

          w = k w(—1) + (1—k)m(—1)

          p =   (1/2)   (w+w(—1))
                         -

          y=(m-p)
          where k = (l—va)f(1+va) < 1

          Consider the dynamic effects of an unanticipated increase in money. Because

     wages are set before money is observed, money has no effect on wages or prices in the

     current period and thus has a full effect on output. Over time however, nominal wages

     adjust and so does the price level. Output returns to equilibrium over time at an

     exponential rate. The smaller the parameter a, which measures the effect of labor

     market conditions on wages, the closer is k to one and the longer lasting the real

     effects of money.

          These results differ from those of Fischer in one important way   the effects of

     money last for much longer than the time during which each nominal wage is fixed. The

     intuition behind this result is that, as shown in (3.7), staggering implies that

     workers care indirectly about relative wages. If the effect of labor market

     conditions is weak, workers choose a new nominal wage w close to the existing wage

     w(—1) ; nominal wages and thus the price level adjust slowly to equilibrium20



         The issues




20
      Although we do not show it here, this wage setting structure also
implies that anticipated money affects output.
                                        38

         While the models of Fischer and Taylor showed that rational expectations could

     be introduced in the "wage—price mechanism", could generate long lasting effects of

     nominal money and leave a role for policy, they left many issues unanswered. Taking

     the Taylor model as an example, that model raises for example two sets of issues

          Long lasting real effects of money require k to be close to unity. This in turn

     requires a, the elasticity of the (target) real wage with respect to employment to be

     small. Taylor assumes that the markup is insensitive to movements in output but, if

     we were to relax this assumption and allow the markup to be a function of demand, say

     with elasticity equal to b, a parallel condition would emerge   long lasting real

     effects of nominal money would require b to be small as well.

          More generally, a necessary condition for persistent real effects of money is

     the presence of real rigidities. Put another way, which is more intuitive but

     slightly misleading, long lasting effects of money require flat supply curves for

     goods and labor21. The issue is then to reconcile such required small values of a and

     b with the presumption that, ruling out strong intertemporal substitution effects,

     the elasticity of labor supply with respect to wages is likely to be small and with

     the presumption that, if capital is fixed in the short run, marginal cost is upward

     sloping. I discuss this first set of issues in the next subsection.



          Real rigidities are a necessary but not a sufficient condition for persistence

     if wages and prices adjusted continuously, money would still be neutral,




21    The way in which this is misleading is that if, for example, when a
price is set by monopolist, or a wage determined as a result of bargaining
between a firm and a union, there is no such thing as a supply curve. There is
however a relation between prices and output, or wages and employment, which
is traced out by shifting demand, which can be thought of an implicit supply
curve.
                                        39

     independently of the values of a and b. In the Taylor model, the two elements, the

     nominal rigidities, which imply non neutrality of money are presetting of nominal

     wages, and staggering of wage decisions. But this raises a second set of issues. If

     the reason why wages are set only at discrete intervals of time is the presence of

     costs of changing wages, can such costs, which are likely to be small, explain the

     fluctuations in output we actually observe ? If wage setters are tree to choose the

     timing of their decisions, is staggering an equilibrium ? If nominal wage setting and

     staggering are the result of optimal wage setting by individuals or firms, doesn't

     this imply that fluctuations in output are optimal, when account is taken of the

     costs of adjusting wages ? I discuss those issues in the following section.



          2. Real rigidities



          I review here research on the behavior of the goods and labor markets from a

     narrow angle, namely by asking   Can models of the goods market explain why, in

     response to shifts in demand, the adjustment falls mostly on quantities and not on

     prices, given wages ? Can models of the labor market similarly explain why shifts in

     the demand for labor fall mostly on employment and not on wages, given prices ?22



          The goods market




22    I have made no attempt to give a complete bibliography of the work
presented in this subsection. Many of the references are themselves surveys
and serve that function.
                                       40

     Research on the goods market has focused on the implications of imperfect

competition. Imperfect competition per se does not imply price rigidity : it is well

known that the price rule followed by a monopolist in response to multiplicative

shifts in isoelastic demand is the same, up to a constant reflecting monopoly power,

as the supply curve which would follow from competitive behavior with the same

technology. But if technologies differ under perfect and imperfect competition, or if

the degree of monopoly power varies with the level of demand, imperfect competition

may then lead to more price rigidity

     If imperfect competition leads firms to have more capital at a given level of

demand than would be the case under perfect competition, marginal cost may be flat

over a larger range of output : this may arise if entry leads firms with monopoly

power to dissipate profit (Hall [1986)) through excess capacity, or if excess

capacity serves as a barrier to entry (Fudenberg and Tirole [1983]) Is marginal cost

flat at normal levels of production ? This is doubtful. While labor productivity is

procyclical, the proportion of overtime labor, of labor paid time and a half, is

strongly procyclical. If firms had cheper means of increasing production, they would

not use overtime. Bils (1985], pursuing this line of reasoning, concludes that

marginal cost is upward sloping in most industries, so that this does not appear to

be the explanation for real price rigidity.

     The monopolist example above assumes that the degree of monopoly power, which in

that example is only a function of the elasticity of demand, is constant. But, if

monopoly power is countercyclical, an increase in demand will lead to lower markups

of prices over marginal costs, thus to less movement in the markup than in marginal

cost. This may be the case if the elasticity of demand increases with the level of

demand, so that monopoly power is lower in booms (see Stiglitz [1984] for a review of

such cases) .   It   can also be the case if the sustainable degree of collusion is lower

when demand is high (Rotemberg and Saloner [1986a]).
                                      41

        Many stories do not however make a theory of price rigidity. They also suggest

that price rigidity should vary across markets, in particular as a function of market

structure. The evidence is however mixed, with some evidence that markups are more

cyclical in concentrated industries (Doaowitz, Hubbard and Petersen [1986]). A more

radical departure from standard price setting has been developed by Okun [1981] who

suggests that, in all customer markets, customers develop a notion of fairness. If

price changes are perceived as unfair, a firm may actually lose profit by increasing

prices in response to increases in demand. While there is evidence that fairness

plays an important role in goods markets (Kahneman et al [1986]), the issue becomes

that of what in turn determines fairness.



        The labor market



        If we believe that intertemporal substitution in labor supply is not of major

relevance for macroeconomic fluctuations, and that the elasticity of labor supply

with respect to permanent changes in the real wage is small, the fact that shifts in

demand for labor appear to fall mostly on employment rather than on wages is

puzzling. It also suggests that a radical departure from perfect competition is

needed. Research on real wage rigidity has explored three different directions

        The first has been the implication of the presence of unions. Again, the

presence of a union does not necessarily imply more real wage rigidity than in a

competitive labor market (see the surveys by Oswald [1985] and Farber [1986]). But it

may     McDonald and Solow, (1981) concentrating on the case of bilateral monopoly

between a firm and a union, have shown that, if in response to shifts in demand, both

sides   decide to share gains from trade "fairly", the outcome will usually be one of
large employment fluctuations and small real wage fluctuations.
                                   42

     Large parts of the labor market are neither unionized, nor under threat of

unionization. Another direction of research has explored the scope and the

implications of implicit contracts between workers and firms. Initially, the

implications of insurance by risk neutral firms to risk averse workers were seen as

providing a potential explanation for real wage rigidities and large employment

fluctuations. It was soon realized however that while this could explain real wage

rigidity, it implied, absent income effects from insurance, exactly the same

employment pattern than under perfect competition and thus could not, if individual

labor supply was inelastic, explain large employment fluctuations (see Azariadis

[1979)). The theory of implicit contracts was then extended to allow for asymmetric

information between workers and firms. The employment characteristics of optimal

contracts under asymmetric information depend very much on the relative degrees of

risk aversion of firms and workers and on the information structure. There does not,

at this stage, appear to be good reasons to think that they will, in general, lead to

larger employment fluctuations than full information contracts (see the survey by

Stiglitz [1986)). Hart and Holmstrom [1986] discuss also the potential role of such

contracts in explaining macroeconomic fluctuations.

     The last direction of research has focused on "efficiency wage" models, models

in which the wagfe may directly affect the marginal product of labor. One possible

reason, emphasized by Akerlof (1982], and closely related to the customer market

argument of Okun discussed above, is simply that workers form wage norms and sharply

decrease their effort if wages go below the norm. As in the case of fairness, the

issue is again here that of what determines those norms, given that they clearly

evolve over time, increasing for example as productivity increases. Other models

which do not rely on interpersonal comparisons of utility have also been developped

(see the surveys by Yellen (1984] and Katz [1986] of the theoretical and empirical
                                          43

evidence). If, for example, effort can only be imperfectly monitored, it may be

optimal for a firm to pay a wage above the market : it is then costly for a worker to

be caught shirking and fired, and workers may then choose the optimal amount of

effort.

     To see what efficiency wage theories may imply for the issue at hand, consider

the following example from Solow [1979]. Suppose that profit for a firm is given by
aF(e(If)L) — WL,    where L is the number of workers and e is the effort per worker.

Effort is assumed to be an increasing function of the real wage W. The firm chooses 1

and W so that the first order conditions are

     (3.8)         e'(W)W/e(W)    = 1

     (3.9)         e(W)aF'(e(V)L) =   W



     The real wage chosen by the firm is given by (3.8) and is such the elasticity of

effort with respect to the wage is equal to one. Equation (3.9) in turn determines

employment.

     In this example, there is complete real wage rigidity. A shift in a, which can

be interpreted as a shift in the relative price facing the firm, has no effect on the

real wage paid by the firm and falls fully on employment. The model however assumes

that effort depends only on the absolute level of the real wage. Suppose that effort

depends instead positively on the wage paid by the firm relative to the aggregate

wage, and positively on unemployment, as is the case in the shirking model. In that

case, the condition corresponding to (3.7) then gives the relative wage as a function

of unemployment. In equilibrium, all wages must be the same ; this in turn determines

a relation between the real wage and unemployment. In the model of Shapiro and

Stiglitz [1984], workers have a reservation wage below which they do not work and

above which they supply one unit of labor, so that, absent efficiency wage

considerations, aggregate labor supply has an inverted I. shape. With efficiency
                                   44

wages, this labor supply locus is replaced by a smooth increasing equilibrium

relation between wages and employment. Thus, an economy which, absent efficiency

wages, operated at full employment with shifts in demand translating only into

changes in wages, will, with efficiency wages, experience movements in both wages and

employment. Employment fluctuations will be larger, and wage fluctuations smaller,

under efficiency wages than under perfect competition.

     Section IV   Imperfect competition (continued)



     1. Nominal rigidities   the static case



     An old but vague Keynesian theme, starting with Keynes' own explanation of

nominal wage rigidity, is that of coordination problems. The argument is the

following   to be neutral, a decrease in money requires a proportional decrease in

all nominal prices, leaving all relative prices the same. But if price setters do not

want to change relative prices, none of them will want to decrease his price first.

The outcome will be nominal rigidity, or at best slow adjustment of nominal prices.

     The argument is clearly right in the extreme case in which price setters want to

keep relative prices constant, in the case of complete real price rigidities. A

change in nominal money, at given prices, changes real balances, output and

employment but does not lead any price setter to change his price given others. The

analogy with Daylight Saving Time in the US, introduced by Friedman [1953) to make

the case for flexible exchange rates, is revealing. While it may be socially

desirable to change the hours during which stores are open in winter, this will not

happen without explicit coordination of decisions, as each store wants to keep the

same hours as other stores. A change in the clock achieves the result without need

for coordination. Woglom (1982] develops an economic model with the same structure.

The economy is composed of monopolists who face kinked demand curves. This leads

them not to want to change their relative price in response to changes in demand

this in turn leads to nominal rigidities and non neutrality of money.

    But the argument, at least in this simple form, does not hold when the relative

price chosen by each price setter is an increasing function of the output he

    produces. In this case, an increase in nominal money, which increases demand and

    output, leads all price setters to attempt to increase their relative price ; as this

    is impossible, all nominal prices increase until real money balances are back to

    equilibrium. The initial argument holds however in slightly modified form ;   its
    structure has recently been clarified and I now present it.



         Nominal rigidities, pecuniary externalities and menu costs



         The argument requires some deviation from perfect competition and its specific

    form depends on the specific deviation. I present it here in a simple general

    equilibrium model with monopolistic competition, which follows Mankiw [1985],

    Kiyotaki [1985] , Ng   [1986] and is extended in Blanchard and Kiyotaki [1986]. Akerlof

    and Yellen [1985] have developed a closely related argument, but in a model with

    efficiency wages in the labor market and imperfect competition in the goods market.



         The economy is composed of n workers—producers, i1,..,n, selling differentiated

    products, but otherwise identical. The demand facing producer i is a decreasing

    function of his relative price (n/F) and an increasing function of aggregate real

    money balances (M/P). Each producer also faces an upward sloping marginal cost

    function, which reflects increasing marginal disutility of work and/or decreasing

    returns to scale in production. Marginal cost, demand and marginal revenue functions

    facing producer i are drawn in figure 1. Demand and marginal revenue are drawn for an

    arbitrary level of aggregate real money balances.

         The profit maximizing level of output for producer i is given by the
•

    intersection of marginal cost and marginal revenue, with the associated price being

    given by the demand curve, point A. In symmetric equilibrium, all prices must be the
                                        47

     same, so that N/P = 1. This in turn determines the equilibrium level of real money

     balances and the price level.

          If each producer acted competitively instead, the equilibrium would be at the

     intersection of marginal cost and demand. In symmetric equilibrium, Pt/P would still

     be equal to one, so that the equilibrium would be at point B instead. This in turn

     implies that, as the demand curve must go through B, the equilibrium real money

     balances would be higher under perfect competition, the price level lower. Note that,

     as all producers have the same degree of monopoly power, monopoly power has no effect

     on the relative price of produced goods. Monopolistic competition affects instead the

     relative price of goods in terms of money, the price level, which is higher than

     under competition. Welfare, measured by consumer and producer surplus23, is higher

     under perfect competition.



          The informal argument can now be formalized and proceeds in two steps.

          (1) Associated with the manopolistically competitive equilibrium is a pecuniary

     externality

          A decrease in an individual producer's nominal price has two effects. First it

     increases the demand for that producer's good ; second, by decreasing (slightly) the

     price level, it increases real money balances, increasing demand and output of all

     other producers. In equilibrium, prices are such that the first effect on profit is

     equal to zero to a first order   each producer has no incentive to change his price.

     But, because output is initially below its socially optimal level under monopolistic

     competition, the second effect leads to an increase on welfare.




23
      In Blanchard and Kiyotaki, marginal utility of income is constant and
the sum of consumer and producer surplus for a representative market is indeed
the appropriate measure of welfare.
                                   48

     Put another way —which will be convenient below— a small proportional decrease

in all nominal prices, a decrease in the price level, would increase output and have

a first order positive effect on welfare. But, no individual producer has an

incentive to decrease his own price given other prices, as he would experience a

second order loss in profit.



     (2) In the presence of small costs of changing prices, "menu costs", the

pecuniary externality implies nominal price rigidity.

     Instead of a small decrease in the price level given nominal money, consider a

small increase in nominal money given the price level. Output and welfare increase to

a first order ; but each producer has a second order incentive to increase his price.

Absent menu costs, the economy would return to the initial level of output with

higher prices. Small menu costs, that is second order costs but larger than the loss

in profit associated with not changing the price, will however prevent this

adjustment. If they do, nominal prices will not adjust and the change in nominal

money will affect output and have first order effects on welfare.



     To summarize, imperfect competition implies that, in response to an increase in

nominal money, the incentive to adjust relative prices may be weak. Small costs of

changing prices will prevent adjustment of relative prices, thus of nominal prices,

leading to an increase in aggregate demand. Because price initially exceeds marginal

cost, firms will willingly increase output even if they do not adjust prices. Output

will go up and so will welfare.



     Extensions : the role of structural parameters ; multiple equilibria
                                   49




    Two more sets of results can be derived from this simple framework.



     (1) The first relates the size of menu costs needed to prevent adjustment of

prices to the parameters of demand and cost. Second order nenu costs are sufficient

to imply real effects of small changes in nominal money. But, with respect to larger

changes in nominal money, the size of the menu costs required to prevent adjustment

depends on the the characteristics of technology and market structure.

     If marginal cost was constant, a condition which implicitly requires both

constant marginal disutility of work and constant returns in production, no price

setter would want to change his relative price and nominal prices would remain

unchanged even in the absence of menu costs. By continuity, as long as marginal cost

is fairly flat, small menu costs can prevent adjustment of prices. But, if the

disutility of work is a strongly increasing function of the level of work —an

assumption which would imply an inelastic labor supply in a competitive labor market—

the menu costs required to prevent price adjustment become implausibly large. This

shows the limits of the menu cost argument and the need to construct models which

combine menu costs with real rigidities. This has been for example the approach

followed by Akerlof and Yellen (1985] who develop a model with efficiency wages in

the labor market, and monopolistic competition and menu costs in the goods markets.

Their version of efficiency wages, which is the same as that in equations (3.8) and

(3.9) delivers movements in employment with no change in the real wage. As long as

there is unemployment, this implies that the labor market behaves as if labor supply

was infinitely elastic at the prevailing wage. Thus, as long as firms operate under

close to constant returns to scale, monopolistic competition and menu costs in price

setting easily deliver nominal rigidity of both prices and wages, and real effects of

nominal money.
                                        50

         The other main parameter in the model above is the elasticity of substitution

     between goods, which determines the elasticity of demand with respect to relative

     prices. The higher this elasticity, the higher the opportunity cost of not adjusting

     relative prices and thus the higher the menu costs required to prevent adjustment of

     prices. Rotemberg and Saloner [198Gb] use this argument to explain why prices appear

     to be more rigid under monopoly than under duopoly in which each firm perceives a

     more elastic demand curve.



          (2) what has been shown above was that if menu costs were large enough, there

     was an equilibrium with unchanged nominal prices. What has not been shown is that

     this was the only equilibrium. Whether or not it is depends on the interactions

     between prices. The argument has been formalized by Ball and Romer [1987b] and

     Rotemberg [1987] and has the following structure

          A change in the price level has two effects on the nominal price that an

     individual price setter wants to set. Other things equal, an increase in the price

     level leads to a proportional increase in the desired nominal individual price. But,

     at the same time, an increase in the price level decreases real money balances,

     shifting inwards the demand curve faced by the price setter, and leading him to

     decrease his desired relative price. The net effect is in general ambiguous,

     depending on the strength of the effect of real money on aggregate demand and on the

     degree of substitution between goods. In the —more likely— case where the

     substitution effect dominates, an increase in the price level increases the desired

     individual nominal price ; following Cooper and John, this case can be called the

     case of "strategic complementarity"24




24
      Cooper and John (1985) have looked at the characteristics of equilibria
in games such as this one where the action of one player depends positively on
the actions of other players,. a condition they call "strategic
complementarity". They show that many "Keynesian" models exhibit such a
characteristic and that those games exhibit "multiplier effects" and may have
multiple equilibria.
                                    51

     Assuming strategic complementarity and the presence of menu costs, consider the

effects of an increase in nominal money. The incentive for a given price setter to

adjust his price is clearly stronger the larger the proportion of other price setters

who adjust theirs. This suggests that for some values of the menu costs, there may be

two equilibria, one in which all price setters adjust, making it optimal for each

price setter to adjust, and one in which no one adjusts, making it optimal for each

price setter not to adjust. The papers by Ball and Romer and by Rotemberg show that

this is indeed the case. This potential multiplicity of equilibria is more than a

curiosum. It appears in some guise in many of the dynamic extensions of the static

model which we describe below.



     From statics to dynamics    the issues



     The menu cost argument points to an important externality in price setting.

Before it can be used to conclude that macroeconomic fluctuations are in part the

result of such an externality, two sets of questions must however be answered

     (1) The menu cost argument as we have presented it assumes that all prices are

initially equal and set optimally. In a dynamic economy and in the presence of menu

costs, such a degenerate price dis tribution is unlikely to prevail. But if prices are

initially not all equal or optimal to start with, it is no longer obvious that even a

small change in nominal money will leave all prices unaffected. It is no longer

obvious that money will have large effects on output.

     (2) Even if nominal money has large effects on output, it must be the case that

money is sometimes unanticipatedly high, sometimes unanticipatedly low. When money is

high, output increases and so does welfare to a first order. When money is low,

output decreases and so does welfare, again to a first order. These welfare effects
                                        52

     would appear to cancel out to a first order. It is therefore no longer obvious that,

     even if menu costs lead to large output fluctuations, the welfare loss of those

     fluctuations largely exceeds the menu costs which generate them. This point is

     developed by Ball and Romer [1987a] in the context of the static model above, but

     assuming money to be a random variable.



          I now review what we know about the answers to those two questions in dynamic

     models. It turns out that the answers depend very much on the specific form of

     nominal rigidities, on the specific price rules used by price setters. I start by

     reviewing what we know about the effects of money if price setters use either time

     dependent or state dependent rules. I end the section by discussing what rules are

     likely to be chosen, and the nature of actual price and wage rules.



          2. Time dependent rules and the effects of money on output



          The simplest tine dependent rules are rules in which the time between price

     decisions is fixed25. As the Fischer and Taylor models show, time dependent rules do

     generate non neutrality. As the difference between the two models also shows, an

     important issue, if prices are fixed —rather than predetermined— between price

     decisions, is whether those decisions are synchronized or staggered. Staggering leads

     to longer lasting effects of nominal money on output. Research has thus proceeded in

     two directions. The first has studied the determination of the time structure of

     price decisions. The second has studied the implications of alternative staggering




25
      This however is not necessary. An example of a time rule with random
time between price decisions is given below.
                                   53

structures, taking staggering as given. While the first logically precedes the

second, it is only recently that research has focused on the first.



     Implications of alternative staggering structures



     Research on the implications of wage staggering has focused on the implications

of staggering for monetary policy, in particular for disinflationary policies. Phelps

(1979] had shown that if wage setting was characterized by staggering and rational

expectations, there was in principle, and in sharp contrast to the implications of

the standard Phillips curve, a path of disinflation consistent with no output loss.

Taylor (1983] has extended this analysis by computing the actual path of disinflation

consistent with no recession given the actual staggering structure of wage setting in

the US. The path needed to decrease inflation from 10% to 3% at no output loss has

interesting characteristics   inflation goes from 10% to 9.9% in the first year, from

9.9% to 8.7% in the second, and from 8.7% to 3.6% in the third. The very slow initial

decrease is needed because past wage decisions which were taken before the change in

money growth have to be accomodated. But this slow initial decrease raises obvious

issues of credibility, as little happens in the first two years after the change in

policy. These issues have been studied by Fischer (1985] and are analyzed at more

length in chapter 23. Fischer (1984] has extended the analysis to the open economy to

study the implications of the change in real exchange rates implied by monetary

contraction. While the analyses of Taylor and Fischer are based on the assumption

that staggering is unaffected by changes in monetary policy, and are thus subject to

the Lucas critique, empirical studies of the 1979—1982 Us disinflation suggest that

there was indeed little change in aggregate wage behavior during the period

(Englander and Los (1983]).
                                   54



     I have studied the implications of staggering of price decisions. While most

prices change more often than wages, I have shown (Blanchard [1983]) that if output

is produced through a chain of production, with price decisions being taken at

different times at different production steps, there can be substantial price level

inertia even if each price setter takes price decisions very often. US empirical

evidence (Blanchard (1987)) shows this effect to be important   I find that, while

prices adjust fast to input prices and wages at the disaggregated level, interaction

between price decisions implies substantial aggregate price inertia. I conclude that

price level inertia in the US comes as much from staggering of price decisions than

from staggering of wage decisions. I have also studied (Blanchard (1986a]) the

implications of wage and price staggering, showing that, even under rational

expectations, such staggering generates a wage price spiral, as well as cost push and

demand pull inflation, ideas which had been emphasized in earlier work on inflation.

     All staggering structures have in common that, after an increase in nominal

money which increases demand, price and wage setters attempt to increase or at least

to maintain relative prices and wages. Along the path of adjustment, there are

oscillations but no systematic movement in relative prices and real wages.

Implications of staggering for the variability of relative prices have been drawn and

examined by Taylor [1981] in particular.



    All the above papers assume that price decisions are taken for fixed periods of

time and that the cost of changing prices is independent of the size of the change.

Two alternative formalizations have also been explored. Calvo (1982] has built a

model with a continuum of price setters, and in which the probability for a given

price setter to change his price at any point in time is constant. Together, these
                                        55

     two assumptions imply that a constant proportion of prices changes at any point in

     tine, and give a very convenient continuous time specification of aggregate price

     dynamics. Rotemberg [1982] has developed and estimated a model of monopolistic

     competition with quadratic costs of adjustment of nominal prices, so that the cost

     varies with the size of the change26. Most of the above papers focus on the effects

     of price setting rather than on the relation between money and aggregate demand.

     Svensson [1986] attempts to integrate the two strands of recent research on money

     demand on the one hand and on price setting by monopolistic competitors on the other.



          Determination of the time structure of decisions



          The research reviewed above takes the structure of staggering as given. The

     other direction of research has been to see whether such a structure can indeed arise

     as an equilibrium if each price setter is free to choose both the length of time

     between price changes and the timing of his decisions in relation to others.



          The question has been studied by Parkin [1986] ,   Ball   [1986a] and Ball and Router

     (1986] in models similar to the model of monopolistic competition sketched above.

     Their argument has the following structure27




26    Julio Rotemberg has pointed out to me that, despite their different
motivations, his and Calvo's model have the same dynamics. This can be seen as
& justification for using the quadratic cost formalization as a convenient "as
if' approach.
27     The three models differ in various ways. The first two assume that
prices are predetermined between price decisions (a la Fischer) . The third
assumes that prices are fixed between price decisions (a la Taylor) . Parkin
assumes that money follows a feedback rule while the other two papers take
money as exogenous.
                                        56

          Suppose that nominal money follows a given stochastic process and that each

     price setter takes price decisions at fixed intervals of time, say -by defining the

     period appropriately— every two periods. Each producer still has the choice between

     taking decisions at the same time as the others, say at even times, or at a different

     time, at odd times. It is clear that symmetric staggering is an equilibrium : if

     exactly half of the price setters take decisions at odd times and half at even times,

     the stochastic environment faced by a price setter is the same whether he takes

     decisions at even or odd times and he is therefore indifferent to timing28. But one

     can ask whether this staggered equilibrium is stable, whether for example, if the

     economy is characterized initially by asymmetric staggering and if individual price

     setters are allowed to change their timing, the economy will converge to the

     staggered equilibrium.

          The answer turns out to depend on whether the strategic complementarity

     condition described earlier is satisfied or not, whether an increase in the price

     level increases or decreases the nominal price that an individual price setter wants

     to set. In the more likely case where an increase in the price level increases

     desired individual prices, staggering cannot be stable. The intuition for this result

     is simple. Suppose that initially a larger proportion of price setters changes prices

     at even than at odd times, so that the price level moves more on average at even than

     at odd times. A price setter who was initially taking decisions at odd times has an

     incentive to move so as to take decisions with the majority of price setters. The

     stable equilibrium is one in which all price decisions are taken at even times. In




28
       This assumes that the price setter is small compared to the economy, so
that in considering whether to change his price at even or odd times, he takes
the stochastic process folloed by the price level as given. Fethke and
Policano [1984] have studied the properties of the equilibrium when the number
of price setters is small.
                                             57

     the less likely case where an increase in the price level decreases individual

     nominal prices, staggering can be stable but this hardly provides a convincing

     explanation for the general presence of staggering in the economy.

          The introduction of stochastic idiosyncratic shocks does not make staggering

     more likely. With respect to idiosyncratic shocks, choosing odd or even timing is

     irrelevant, so that, if strategic complementarity holds, price setters still have an

     incentive to move with others and staggering is not a stable equilibrium. If

     idiosyncratic shocks have however a deterministic, "seasonal" component, if for

     example some firms experience shocks mostly at odd times, some mostly at even times,

     staggering can then be an equilibrium, with each firm choosing its natural timing

     habitat29. This will be the case if idiosyncratic shocks are large, or if the

     strategic complementarity effect is weak. This is explored by Ball and Romer [1986]

     who also analyze the welfare properties of the equilibrium. The empirical importance

     of such shocks seems however limited, and insufficient to provide a general

     explanation of staggering.

          Two other ideas have been explored. The first, pursued by Ball and Cechetti

     £1987] is that, in the presence of imperfect information, price decisions carry some

     information and it may be optimal for a price setter to wait for the information

     before deciding on his own price. The question is however of whether an equilibrium

     will exist in such a context. If each price setter prefers to take decisions just

     after the others, it is not clear that an equilibrium exists, at least not an

     equilibrium with fixed timing of price decisions. The second, explored by }laskin and

     Tirole [1986] ,   is   that staggering may change the nature of the game played by price




29    An example may be that of grocery stores which change prices with new
deliveries. Prices will then change as the delivery truck goes from store to
store, leading to staggering.
                                      58

setters and allow price setters to achieve a more collusive sustainable outcome. Both

of these approaches have implications which go f at beyond staggering. Imperfect

information reintroduces some of the channels studied in Section II. Naskin and

Tirole show that games with staggered decisions may generate outcomes which resemble

for example those obtained with kinked demand curves. This last example shows that

further progress requires a better integration of the theories of real and nominal

rigidities.



     It may well be that trying to generate staggering given fixed timing of

individual price changes is the wrong strategy. After all, it is plausible that if

price setters experience different histories of shocks, they will naturally change

prices at different times. This however points to state rather than time dependent

rules, rules in which the decision to change prices is a function of the state. I now

examine the aggregate implications of such rules.



     3. State dependent rules and the effects of money on output



     The simplest state dependent rules are Ss rules, which in our context, imply

that the nominal price is readjusted whenever the difference between the actual price

and a target price exceeds some fixed threshold value. Ss rules are optimal only

under restrictive assumptions ; because they are analytically convenient,research

has usually proceeded under those restrictive assumptions, or simply assumed the use

of Ss rules as convenient if suboptimal rules.

     The optimal Ss rule for a monopolist facing random walk fluctuations in demand

was characterized by Barro [19721 under the assumption of no inflation. Sheshinski

and Weiss [1977] ,   (1983] derived instead optimal Ss rules in the presence of
                                              59

    deterministic or stochastic inflation and no demand uncertainty30. Benabou [1986a]

    has extended their analysis to the case where goods are storable, showing that, even

    in the absence of uncertainty, firms may resort to randomized strategies to avoid

    price speculation in anticipation of price changes.

           The important question, for our purposes, is that of the aggregate implications

    of Ss rules. These rules, with their implication that the length of time between

    individual price changes is random, seem to have the potential to explain staggering

    and thus price level inertia. Rotemberg [1983] and Caplin and spulber [1985] have

    shown however that this is not necessarily the case. In their paper, Caplin and

     Spulber derive the aggregate behavior of prices and output in response to changes in

    nominal money when individual price setters follow Ss rules. A simplified version of

     their argument is the following3'

               Suppose that there are n price setters. The (log of the) nominal price p*j that

     each price setter would choose in the absence of costs of changing prices is only a

     function of nominal money and an idiosyncratic shock. Furthermore, pj* is assumed to

    be a non decreasing function of time (i.e there is enough average money growth that

     even if there is an adverse idiosyncratic shock, pi does not decrease).

               There are fixed costs of changing prices, which lead each price setter to adjust

     the actual nominal price pt according to the following Ss rule       when the deviation

     p*j—pj exceeds a threshold value 5, pi is readjusted so that the deviation is equal

     to   s.
               Caplin   and Spulber then show that

      (1) For a given price setter, the deviation (p*j—pj) is uniformly distributed
between S and s. That is, if we observe (p*j-pj) at a point in time, we are as likely

to observe any value of the deviation between S and s. Furthermore, as long as the

idiosyncratic shocks are not perfectly correlated, the distribution of deviations

(p*i —p1)   across   price setters is alsojoint uniform :   (p* —p1) and (p*j —pj )   are
uncorrelated for all        and j ; together, these propositions imply that price

decisions will be, on average, uniformly staggered. While this would appear to

provide foundations for slow adjustment of the price level to changes in nominal

money, the next proposition shows just the opposite to be true.

      (2) Chahges in nominal money lead on average to proportional increases in the

price level. Figure 2 provides the intuition for this result. Assuming that there are

4 prices in the economy and that the distribution of deviations is uniform between

[s=—l, S=+2], the initial distribution is characterized in the first column of Figure

2. An increase in nominal money of 1 increases all target prices by 1, one price is

adjusted and the new distribution is given in the second column, which is obviously

identical to the first. Although only one price has increased, it has increased by

four times as much as it would have, absent costs of adjustment. Thus, the price

level increases by as much as nominal money.



     This result shows that menu costs do not necessarily imply non neutrality of

money. All which is needed for it to obtain is that the distribution of deviations be

uniformly staggered. It applies for example if desired prices depend for example on

the price level, real money balances and relative demand shocks. Benabou [198Gb]

constructs a general equilibrium model where consumers search optimally given the

dispersion of prices implied by Ss pricing by firms and in which Ss rules are optimal

given the search behavior of consumers. In his model as well, money is neutral.
                                      61




        The neutrality result in the above example follows from the tact that while only

one out of four prices is readjusted, it adjusts by four times the size of the change

in nominal money. Nore formally, the size of the price adjustment is equal to the

support of the distribution of deviations. This is not however a characteristic of

all Ss rules and thus not all Ss rules imply neutrality.

        An example will show why. In Caplin and Spulber, the desired nominal price

increases through time. The firm just needs one threshold value, such that when the

actual price is too low, it is readjusted upwards. Suppose instead that the average

inflation rate is zero so that the desired nominal price increases or decreases

through time, with equal probabilit. The firm then needs a rule with both an upper

and a lower threshold (such as in Barro (1972]). Under such a rule, the price is

readjusted whenever it becomes too low or too high. Aggregation of such rules is

difficult and no general result is available ; changes in money do not however lead

in general to contemporaneous proportional adjustment in the price level. An example

is given in Figure 3. Assume that there are four prices, which are readjusted to

equal the target price whenever the deviation between actual and target price exceeds

1 in absolute value. Under such a rule, price deviations are more likely to be at the

return point, 0, than at —1 and +1 (see for example Barro (1972]), so that in Figure

3 two price deviations are assumed initially equal to zero, one to —1 and one to +1.

An increase in nominal money of 1, assumed to increase all target prices by 1, leads

to the readjustment of one price by 2, and to an increase in the price level of 1/2

only.

        Whether aggregation of such Ss rules can explain long lasting effects of money

remains to be seen. An interesting implication of this line of research is that, the

higher the average rate of inflation, the closer Ss rules will be to the one sided
                                        62

    rules assumed by Caplin and Spulber, the more neutral money will be32.



          4. Time or state dependent rules ?



         To summarize, the static menu cost argument is an important insight. It does not

    however extend straightforwardly to the dynamic case. With time dependent rules, menu

    costs generate real effects of nominal money ; a complete analysis of the relation of

    welfare effects to menu costs remains however to be done. With state dependent rules,

    money may still be neutral. This raises two further issues.

         The first is that of the type of rule price setters are likely to adopt. Why

    would price and wage setters ever use time rather than state dependent rules ? One

     simple possibility is that the state is costly to observe or verify ; in that case,

    it may be optimal to collect information and revise the price at fixed intervals,

    with the interval determined by the characteristics of the process determining the

    underlying target price. This may explain why labor contracts, in which agreement on

     the state may be costly are negotiated at fixed intervals of time. In general, the

    optimal rule is likely to be both state and time dependent. What the implications of

    such rules will be remains to be seen. Non neutrality of money is likely but little

    else can be said.

         The other issue is empirical. What type of rule do price and wage setters

    actually use ? The answer is far from clear. Labor contracts are signed for fixed




      This is true however only under the maintained assumption of fixed
values for S and s. For general stochastic processes for money, fixed Ss rules
are dominated by rules in which S and s are also functions of the state.
Tsiddon [1986] has shown that under such more general rules, a decrease in
money growth, rather than being neutral, would instead be initially
contractionary.
                                      63

periods of time, and while nominal wages are not fixed for the duration of contracts,

cost of living adjustments are usually both state and time dependent. Many more

prices are changed in January in the US than would be expected from a uniform

distribution33, which suggests some time dependence. Evidence on individual prices

suggests that prices are adjusted faster in periods of higher inflation (Cechetti

[1986] on newspapers) ; this is however consistent with time dependent rules, where

the length of time between price decisions is a function of the underlying parameters

of the economy and thus changes over time. Evidence on individual price setting

within manufacturing is also provided by Carlton [1986] who reexamines the Kindahl

and Stigler data base. This reexamination does not lead to a simple characterization

of price changes or of price rules.



     Finally, I have reviewed in this section only the research dealing specifically

with foundations of price setting ; in that research, the dynamics of output in

response to shocks arise mainly or exclusively from price and wage setting. This is

in sharp contrast to the research summarized in Section II and to the channels for

persistence emphasized there, such as costs of adjustment in employment, inventory

and capital accumulation. The contrast is much too sharp. Price and wage setting

equations such as those in Taylor have been integrated in larger models with richer

dynamics, and used to look at many macroeconomic issues. Taylor [1986a], for example,

has constructed a medium size multi—country model with staggering of wage decisions.

He uses the model to analyze the effects of monetary policy on the US and the rest of

the world and contrasts his results with those of traditional models. Reviewing those

applications would however take us too far afield.




I owe this fact to Julio Rotemberg

     Section V. Indention and other issues



     In this section, I study three issues. The first is that of indexation and

monetary reforms designed to make prices more flexible. The second is the

possibility, raised by Keynes in the context of the effects of deflation, that price

flexibility far from being stabilizing, may in fact exacerbate output fluctuations.

The third is the possibility that changes in nominal money may not be neutral even in

the long run.



     1. Indexation and Monetary Reforms



     The analysis of the previous sections suggests that changes in the price setting

process, which allowed prices to adjust more quickly to other prices would be

desirable. One such change is indention which, at least in principle, makes prices

or wages adjust quickly to changes in the price level.



     Wage indexation



     The debate about the effectsof wage indexation on fluctuations was formalized

in papers by Fischer [1977b] and Gray [1976]. Gray's model has a structure similar to

that of the early Keynesian model

     (5.1)      y =    (m—p)

     (5.2)      y = —(w—p) — u

     (5.3)      w =    k p + (1—k) Ep
                                           65

          Equation (5.1) gives aggregate demand. Equation (5.2) gives labor •emand under

     perfect competition, and allows for a supply or productivity shock, u, with expected

     value Eu=Q. Equation (5.3) gives the wage setting rule, with the degree of indexation

     being equal to k, which is between zero (no indexation) and one (full indexation).

     The solution to those equations is, under rational expectations

          (5.4)      y = ((1—a)I(2—kfl (rn—Em) — (1/(2—k)) u

          With no indexation, both nominal and real shocks affect output. Real shocks

     however, as they increase the price level, lead to a lower real wage, partly

     attenuating the effect of the shock on output. Full indexation protects the economy

     from nominal shocks but exacerbates the effects of real shocks as the real wage is

     fixed. Thus, Fischer and Gray argued, full indexation is not optimal in an economy

     with both real and nominal shocks34        Gray proceeded to derive the socially optimal

     degree of indexation as a function of the variances of both sources of shocks.



          The Fischer—Gray analysis has been extended in two main directions. The first

     has allowed for more sources of shocks, such as external shocks for an open economy

     the second has looked at the properties of alternative indexation schemes, such as

     whether wages should be indexed to the CPI or to the GNP deflator, or to nominal

     income (see for example Aizenman and Frenkel [1985])



          The simple Fischer—Gray model implies that full indexation leads to complete

     nominal and price flexibility. But actual indexation clauses index the nominal wage

     not to the current price level but rather to the lagged price level. As a result,




      The relevant distinction is between demand and supply shocks. Here, the
only demand shocks are nominal shocks.
                                       66

    they do not remove all nominal rigidities. The implications of actual indexation

    formulas were sketched in Fischer [1917b] and have been studied by Simonsen (1983]

    his conclusion is that actual indexation may in fact make disinflation harder and

    more costly in terms of output loss. The model above also assumes that the only

    source of nominal rigidities is wage setting. If price rigidities are important, as I

    have argued earlier, eliminating wage rigidities may still leave large real effects

    of nominal money. For both of those reasons, economies with different degrees of

    indention are likely to have, at least at a given average rate of inflation, more

    similar behavior than is implied by the simple Gray—Fischer model3.



          Just as in the case of nominal price setting and staggering, we must ask      Is

    the form of indention rules and the degree of indexation which arise from individual

    decisions socially optimal ? I examined the question in Blanchard (1979] under the

    assumption of competitive goods markets. I assumed that each contract faced a fixed

    cost to indexing on the price level, and a further fixed cost to indexing in addition

    to the real shock. I then asked whether if private contracts decided to index only on

    the price level, this decision and the degree of indexation they chose were socially

    optimal. The answer was that they were. This assumes however that the costs of

    collecting information and designing indexation rules are private costs. It part of

    those costs can however be shared by firms and is therefore a public good, it may

    then be that indexation to more than just the price level, although not an

    equilibrium, would be socially optimal. Ball (1986b] has extended the analysis to

    monopolistically competitive goods markets.




      Note the use of Itat an average given rate of inflation". It may well be
that wage indexation, because it changes the tradeoffs faced by policy makers,
leads to higher inflation. This is discussed in Chapter 23.
                                   67




     Generalized indexation and monetary reforms



     If wage indexation decreases the real effects of nominal money, why not

introduce general indexation ? Various such schemes, which we can equivalently think

of as monetary reforms, have been suggested and I briefly review the issues involved.

     General indexation presents a conceptual problem that wage indexation does not.

One can think of general indexation as a change in the numeraire, with all prices

being set in terms of the price level instead of in dollars ; but if all prices are

freely set in terms of the price level, only by coincidence will the average of those

prices be in turn equal to the price level. Thus, general indexation schemes have

considered the use of either one good or a small basket of goods as numeraire.

     To see what such indexation may achieve, the analogy with Daylight Saving Time

is again useful. Suppose that all stores, instead of announcing opening hours with

reference to the clock, use a Sears and Roebuck standard, announcing for example they

will open at the same hours than Sears and Roebuck. It is clear that this solves the

coordination problem discussed in Section III. If it is desirable to change opening

hours in winter, all which is needed is for Sears and Roebuck to change its opening

hours in winter and it will do so as it knows that other firms will change hours

simultaneously. In the same way, general indexation allows for changes in the price

level without changes in relative prices.

     The argument raises however further questions   Why is it better for the

economy to have one price setter setting the price level given money than for the

monetary authority to set money given the price level ? Or, in the context of the

Sears and Roebuck example, what is it that Searsnd Roebuck can do that the state

could not do before by changing the clock in winter ? Is it because the set of
                                         68

     incentives facing the price setter are different from those facing the monetary

     authority ? Those questions must be answered before we understand the gains of

     monetary reform over more active monetary policy in the present system.



          2. Destabilizing price flexibility



         Another line of work has questioned whether price flexibility is indeed

     stabilizing. It is true that under complete and instantaneous adjustment of prices,

     money has no effect on output36. It has been argued however that the relation between

     price flexibility and real effects of money is in fact not monotone and that, given

     the existing degree of flexibility, more flexibility may increase rather than

     decrease output fluctuations. This is because aggregate demand, instead of depending

     only on real money balances as we have assumed until now, depends also on the rate of

     inflation.

          The argument dates back at least to Irving Fisher and is part of Keynes'

     argument for why, even if nominal wages were flexible, this would not be enough to

     maintain full employment. Keynes was mostly concerned with the effects of deflation

     in response to unemployment. While deflation led to a lower price level, increasing

     real money balances and lowering nominal interest rates, its direct —price change—

     effect was however contractionary. It increased the real interest rate given the

     nominal rate (an effect now known as the Mundell effect) and led to transfers of

     wealth from debtors to creditors, increasing bankruptcies and disrupting credit

     markets. Both Fisher and Keynes thought that those direct effects might well offset

     the indirect effect through the lower price level and Keynes saw this as a strong




36
      Except   for the channels mentioned in the introduction
                                              69

     argument in favor of relying on expansionary monetary policy rather than deflation to

     avoid recessions. This argument was formalized by Tobin [1975) who concluded that it

     could indeed be that deflation led to increases in the real rate and could lead to

     more rather than less unemployment.

          The issue has been recently reexamined under rational expectations by Driskill

     and Sheffrin [1986), DeLong and Summers [1986] and Chadha [1986]         ,   using   the Taylor

     model but expanding the specification of aggregate demand to allow for price change

     as well as price level effects (See also Xccallum [1983b]). Their aggregate demand

     specification is the reduced form of an ISLX specification, with the real interest

     rate in the IS equation and the nominal rate in the LX equation and has the form

          (5.5) y =   b(E(p(+lflQ)—p)   +   c(m—p),          b,c > 0

          DeLong and Summers then characterize the dynamic effects of money on output when

     money follows the first order process m =        r   m(—1) + e37. They compute the steady

     state variance of output as a function of both the elasticity of desired real wages

     to output (the coefficient a in equation (3.5)) and the length of time during which

     each wage is set. They conclude that, in most cases and for most plausible

     parameters, increased price flexibility —defined as an increase in a, or a decrease

     in contract length— is likely to increase the steady state variance. Their result is

     however quite different from the earlier Tobin result. In all cases, they find the

     steady state variance to be finite ; equivalently, in no case do they find that

     increased price flexibility may actually lead to an explosive path for output. The

     increase in output variance comes from an increased short run reaction to nominal

     shocks : in response to an increase in money, increased price flexibility has more




      They actually look at the effects of IS shocks, assuming that the
nominal money supply responds to the nominal interest rate. Their equation can
however be reinterpreted as in the text.
                                          70

     effect on expected inflation than on the current price level, leading to a sharper

     initial decline in the real interest rate.

          Del.ong and Summers also show that although increased flexibility ultimately

     leads to smaller real effects, this happens at degrees of flexibility far in excess

     of those we observe. The conclusion one should draw is probably that of Keynes,

     namely that price flexibility may not be a very good substitute for activist monetary

     policy.



          3. Hysteresis and long run neutrality



          All the models we have seen impose long run neutrality of money as a maintained

     assumption. This is very much a matter of faith, based on theoretical considerations

     rather than on empirical evidence.

          Summers and I, [1986) examining the evidence from both the current prolonged

     European recession and the prewar US and UK depressions were led to question this

     maintained assumption. We found that, in all three cases, high unemployment had,

     after a while, little or no effect on disinflation. Put another way, it appeared that

     equilibrium unemployment had eventually adjusted to actual unemployment. This has led

     us to explore the possibility that equilibrium unemployment may be affected for long

     periods of time by the history of actual unemployment.

          We have explored in particular the implications of membership considerations in

     the determination of wages. To see what they imply, we can again start with a

     Fischer—like model, assuming that a union sets the nominal wage before money is

     realized36 and that employment is chosen by firms after the realization of money.




      In Blanchard and Summers [1986] we use a model with monopolistic
competition and many unions. This difference is unimportant for the issues
discussed in the text.
                                            71

     Assuming that the union chooses the nominal wage so as to achieve, in expected value,

     employment of its members and solving the model gives a relation between employment

     n, membership n, and nominal money of the form:

          (5.6)      n =   n   +   a(m—E(m—1))

          where a is a coefficient which depends on the parameters in the aggregate demand

     and labor demand equations3. Employment deviates from membership to the extent that

     unanticipated money differs from zero. The crucial issue is that of what determines

     membership in the union. If n is fixed over time, then the dynamics of the model are

     similar to those of the one—period Fischer model. But, if n* depends on the past

     history of employment, if for example unions tend to represent mostly the currently

     employed, the dynamics are very different. If, to take an extreme case, the union

     represents only the currently employed, n*=n(_l) so that employment follows

          (5.7)      n = n(—1) +     (1/2)(m—E(w—jj)
          In that case, unanticipated changes in nominal money have permanent effects on

     employment. The reason is a simple one      after a negative surprise for example, the

     workers who are fired are no longer represented and there is no tendency for

     employment to go back to its previous value.



         The model generates hysteresis : the steady state of the economy depends on its

     path, and unemployment does not return to any fixed equilibrium value. But its

     conclusions are too strong : unemployed workers must always exert some direct or

     indirect influence on wage setting, so that over time unemployment returns to an

     equilibrium value. What the model points out is that, because of the dynamics of




      The derivation is as in section 3, with two minor differences. The
equation gives employment rather than output, and n, which was constant and
thus put in the constant term in section 3, is now treated explicitly.

labor supply, the adjustment may be very slow. In that case, the real effects of

money do not come from prolonged price and wage rigidity .   In   the above model nominal

wage ridigidy lasts only for one period but the effects of money last forever.

     Conclusion




     Considerable progress has been made in the last ten years on why money affects

output. Some of it has come from clarifying old and fuzzy ideas, such as that of

coordination problems, in clarifying the respective roles of expectations, of nominal

and real rigidities. A lot of it has come from running into dead ends, such as the

failure to explain the joint price and output responses to money in "as if"

competitive models, or the failure of individual nominal rigidities to generate

aggregate price inertia under simple Ss rules.



     Where should research go from here ? I believe that research on real rigidities

is the most urgent. It is a general feature of goods markets that fluctuations in

demand lead mostly to movements in output rather than in markups, and of labor

markets that fluctuations in the demand for labor lead mostly to movements in

employment rather than in real wages. Given these features, a very small amount of

nominal rigidity will lead to long lasting effects of nominal money on output.

Indeed, as was shown in section IV, if all suppliers were happy to supply more at the

same relative price, there would be no need for nominal rigidities   as no price

setter desired to change his relative price, nominal prices would not move in

response to changes in nominal money. While many reasons have been given (and

reviewed in Section III) for why we observe such real rigidities, the sheer number of

unrelated explanations is distressing. One cannot help but think that there might be

some general explanation. While "fairness" and "norms" pretend to give such a general

explanation, they remain at this stage vague and untestable ideas.
                                   74

    Work on nominal rigidities is also important. But in couhterpoint to the

previous paragraph, the amount of nominal rigidities may well have been

overemphasized. In recent empirical work (Blanchard [1987]), I have found that in the

post war US, the adjustment of nominal wages, and of prices to wages is more than 2/3

over within a year. Such lags may not be very difficult to explain, as a result of

short lengths of time between changes in individual wages and prices, together with

staggering. Work on time and state dependent rules and on the equilibrium time

structure of price decisions is just beginning and is important and exciting.
