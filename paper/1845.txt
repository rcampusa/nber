     Recent empirical work has found that both aggregate and micro data reject the rational expec-

a new possible explanation for the rejections: the treatment of seasonal fluctuations. There are
substantial seasonal fluctuations in consumption purchases, but no previous paper has determined
whether these fluctuations are consistent with the Life Cycle-Permanent Income model. The results
in this paper show that when the seasonal fluctuations in consumption purchases are included in
an analysis of the Life Cycle-Permanent Income model there is no evidence in the aggregate data
against the model. The estimates of the parameters of agents' utility functions obtained here are
plausible, and the data do not reject the overidentifying restrictions on the model.

1. Introduction
     The Life Cycle-Permanent Income model of consumption behavior has been the standard
framework for analyzing consumption since the seminal work by Modigliani and Friedman.' Re-
cently, however, the ability of the model to fit the data has been called into question. A sequence
of papers, beginning with that by Hall (1978), has found that both aggregate and micro time series
data reject certain implications of the rational expectations version of the model.2 This rejection
applies both to the joint behavior of consumption and income and to the joint behavior of consump-
tion and asset returns.3 It is independent of whether labor supply is included in the model, and it
is robust with respect to choice of utility function, data frequency, and consumption category.4
     Two main explanations have been proposed for these rejections.5 The most prominent is that
some economic agents are liquidity constrained so that they cannot adjust their consumption over
time in the way implied by the model. The other main line of argument is that the observed
rejections are rejections of the functional forms assumed for preferences in existing work but not
necessarily rejections of the Life Cycle-Permanent Income model. Both explanations have received
some support from the data. Several studies of micro data show that the consumption behavior
of low wealth consumers generally does not satisfy the model while that of high wealth consumers
does.6 Browning (1983) shows that a non-parametric test of the Life Cycle-Permanent Income
model on British data does not reject it for substantial sections of the post war period.
     Neither explanation for the recent rejections of the model is entirely satisfactory, however.
The proponents of the 'liquidity constraints' hypothesis have not presented a model of behavior
under liquidity constraints that rationalizes the particular types of rejections found in the data.
Further, low wealth consumers account for too small a portion of total consumption purchases for
their consumption behavior to explain the rejection of the model at the aggregate level. The non-
parameteric approach is unsatisfactory because the periods for which it breaks down are precisely
those for which one would like to have a good model (1974, 1979). Also, the utility functions
implied by the non-parametric approach may be very complicated. Unless a relatively tractable
parameterization of the Life Cycle-Permanent Income model is consistent with the data, the model
is not particularly useful even if correct in some complicated way.
     This paper examines a new possible explanation for the recent rejections of the Life Cycle-
Permanent Income model: the treatment of seasonal fluctuations. There are substantial seasonal
fluctuations in aggregate consumption purchases, but no previous paper has determined whether
these fluctuations are consistent with the Life Cycle-Permanent Income model.7 Seasonal fiuctua-

      are non-separable in consumption and leisure. Flavin (1981) uses quarterly data while Hansen and Singleton
      (1983) use monthly data; Flavin (1981) uses quadratic utility while Hansen and Singleton (1983) employ
      constant relative risk aversion. Bernanke (1984) and Mankiw (1982,1983) examine durable goods as well as
      non-durables and services.

      seasonally adjusted monthly data; Hall (1982) and Mankiw (1982,1983) use fourth quarter only seasonally
      adjusted data; and Hayashi (1982) uses annual data. A partial exception to this statement is Sargent (1978),

tions, however, are likely to be well described by a rational expectations, equilibrium model because
they are predictable. This means that a substantial part of consumption behavior may fit the Life
Cycle-Permanent Income model even if the conclusions in previous work about the business cycle
fluctuations are correct. Further, the seasonal adjustment procedures currently in use introduce
measurement errors that will tend to produce rejections of the model even when it accurately de-
scribes the data. 8 Thus previous papers may have reached biased conclusions about the business
cycle fluctuations in consumption due to the exclusion of seasonal fluctuations.
     The results in this paper show that when the seasonal fluctuations are included in an analysis
of the Life Cycle-Permanent Income model there is no evidence in the aggregate data against the
model.° The estimates of the parameters of agents' utility functions obtained here are plausible, and
the data do not reject the overidentifying restrictions on the model as they have in previous papers.
The results provide no evidence of liquidity constraints at seasonal or non-seasonal frequencies.
They do provide a tightly parameterized model of preferences.
     The paper is organized as follows. It begins in Section 2 by examining stylized facts about
the seasonal fluctuations in aggregate consumption purchases. These facts show that the seasonal
fluctuations are large and that therefore including them in an analysis of the Life Cycle-Permanent
Income model may alter assessment of it substantially. Section 3 presents a rational expectations,
Life Cycle-Permanent Income model of intertemporal consumption behavior that is capable of
explaining both the seasonal and non-seasonal fluctuations in consumption purchases. This model
implies the existence of an equilibrium pricing function that relates the seasonally unadjusted values
of consumption and real asset returns to seasonal shocks to preferences and technology. Section 4
reports estimates and tests of the model. Section 5 concludes the paper by discussing implications
of the results for the study of equilibrium models of the business cycle.

2. Stylized Facts About the Seasonality of Aggregate Consumption Purchases
     This section examines stylized facts about the seasonal fluctuations in aggregate consumption
purchases. The main purpose is to show that these fluctuations are large and that therefore includ-
ing them can have a significant impact on estimation results. In addition, the section establishes
facts about the seasonally unadjusted data on consumption purchases that a coherent model should
be able to explain.
     An appendix describes the construction of the data. The Department of Commerce does not
publish seasonally unadjusted data on real consumption purchases, but it is possible to construct
such data by deflating seasonally unadjusted series on nominal purchases by seasonally unadjusted
components of the Consumer Price Index.'0 This procedure is analagous to the one used by the
Department of Commerce to construct seasonally adjusted data.

      who uses seasonally unadjusted U.S. data. He does not, however, examine the seasonal coefficients that he
      estimates. Similarly, Davidson and Hendry (1981), Davidson, Hendry, Srba and Yeo (1978), and Hendry
      and Von Ungern-Sternberg (1980) use seasonally unadjusted U.K. data, but they do not study the economic
      significance of the seasonal coefficients they estimate. Heien (1983) analyzes the seasonality of aggregate
      consumption data but in a static framework. Hayashi (1984) uses seasonally unadjusted panel data to study
      the Permanent Income Hypothesis for Japanese data. All panel data studies for the U.S. have used annual
      data.
  8
      Appendix B of my Ph.D. thesis (Miron (1984)) shows this explicitly. The reason is that the Census X-
      11 seasonal adjustment procedure makes the adjusted data a two sided filter of the unadjusted series. This
      practice guarantees that the key orthogonality condition implied by the model will be violated by the seasonally
      adjusted data. Data adjusted by the seasonal dummy technique will also tend to reject the model if it contains
      fundamental non-linearities.
      By "inclusion of seasonal fluctuations," I mean using seasonally unadjusted data aiul allowing for seasonals in
      preferences and technology.

      Sargent (1978) use this procedure to compute seasonally unadjusted real values of consumption and GNP.

                                                          2
     For the purpose of presenting stylized facts I assume that the data on consumption purchases
are approximately described by the following model:1'

                                                  Yt=STz                                                        (1)
                                                S = exp(a'd2)                                                   (2)
                                               T = exp(bt + Ct2)                                                (3)
where
    Y is an economic time series,
    S is the seasonal component of the series,
    T is the trend component of the series,
    Z is the business cycle component of the series,
    d is a vector of seasonal dummies, and
    a' is a coefficient vector.
Equations (1)—(3) imply that
                                        lnYt—a'dj+bt+ct2+lnZt                                                   (4)
It follows from (4) that if a is the coefficient on the ith seasonal dummy, then Y is on average a2
percent higher in season i than during the rest of the year.
      Table 1 presents estimates of the seasonal factors in thirteen categories of real consumption
purchases. The amount of seasonal variation in many of the components is striking. For example,
the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in purchases of Motor Vehicles and Parts is more than 16%,
while that in purchases of Clothing and Shoes is over 41%. The table also shows the R2's from the
regressions that were used to estimate the seasonal factors. The series were detrended before the
seasonal patterns were estimated, so these R2's are estimates of the percentage of the non-trend
variation due to seasonality. For most of these series the percentage exceeds 40% and for several it
exceeds 70%. Thus seasonal fluctuations account for a quantitatively important part of the total
variation in consumption purchases.
      The results indicate that, if these seasonal fluctuations are to be the outcome of an equilib-
rium process, then there must be seasonal shocks to preferences and/or technology that imply
seasonal shocks to the equilibrium pricing function relating aggregate consumption quantities to
intertemporal prices. The model presented below allows for seasonal shocks to both preferences
and technology, and the estimation results provide a means of characterizing how much of the
seasonality documented in Table 1 is due to each of these sources. In the remainder of this section,
 I discuss at an intuitive level some additional aspects of the results in Table 1.
      There are large increases during the fourth quarter of purchases of Clothing and Shoes, Other
 Durables (which includes durable toys such as bicycles), and Other Non-durables (which includes
 non-durable toys). These increases are probably due to Christmas, which is plausibly interpreted
 as a shock to preferences.
      The results in the table suggest that the weather is an important source of seasonal shocks to
the economy. Purchases of Fuel Oil and Coal and Electricity and Gas increase in the first quarter
(winter) and decrease in the third quarter (summer), probably as the result of the quarterly changes
in temperature. Purchases of Transportation Services and Gasoline and Oil, on the other hand,
decrease in winter and increase in summer, which probably indicates that good weather makes it

    I have also computed seasonal factors under the assumption that the first difference of the log of consumption
    purchases equals a seasonal plus a stationary series. The estimates of seasonal factors obtained from that model
    were qualitatively similar to those presented here. See Nelson and Plosser (1982) for a discussion of trends
    versus random walks in aggregate data.

more desirable to travel. Weather may affect economic activity either through tastes or technology,
but the data in the table seem more suggestive of preferences shocks as the reasons for the particular
seasonal patterns shown in the table. The fact that the weather appears to affect seasonal economic
activity is interesting because the weather can have unanticiapted effects as well as seasonal ones.
     The results also show that purchases of durable components of consumption display much larger
seasonal fluctuations than non-durable components.12 For example, the amplitude of the cycle in
Durables is 22.07% while that in Services is only 1.29%. There are several possible explanations.
One is that consumers are more willing to tolerate fluctuations in their consumption of durables
than in their consumption of services. Alternatively, there may be larger seasonals in preferences
for durable goods than for non-durable goods.
     These possibilities, of course, could just as easily explain different seasonal patterns in different
non-durable goods as the differences between durables and non-durables. An explanation that
focusses explicitly on the durability of durables is that in order to change the stock of a durable
good by a given percentage it is necessary to make a larger percentage purchase of the durable
good. Therefore purchases of durables should be more seasonal than those of non-durables even if
preferences for these goods are identical.13
     The stylized facts presented above establish that seasonal fluctuations account for a substantial
part of the total variation in consumption purchases. This means that inclusion of the seasonal
fluctuations can have a significant impact on analyses of the Life Cycle-Permanent Income model.
The facts also show additional aspects of the seasonal patterns in consumption that it is important
for a model to be able to explain. These are that there are probably substantial seasonal shocks
to preferences, that the weather appears to cause some of these shocks, and that the seasonal
fluctuations in durables are greater than those in non-durables.
3. A Model of Intertemporal Consumption Choice
    This section presents a rational expectations, Life Cycle-Permanent Income model of consump-
tion that can explain both the seasonal and non-seasonal fluctuations in aggregate consumption
purchases. The model is a representative consumer model that generates an equilibrium pricing
function relating consumption purchases to real asset returns.'4 The particular model proposed
here generalizes those in previous papers by allowing for seasonal shocks to preferences and technol-
ogy. In the discussion below, I first derive the implications of the model for an individual consumer
and interpret the model in that context. I then discuss under what conditions the model implies a
well defined aggregate relation between consumption and asset returns. The interpretation of this
relation turns out to be an equilibrium pricing function of the kind derived by Lucas (1978).
     A. The Individual Consumer
     The representative consumer chooses the time path for consumption that solves

                                          max D >/3U(Ct+5)                                                   (5)

C is the flow of consumption services the consumer receives in period t, U(.) is the period utility
function, j9 is a subjective discount factor, and E denotes the rational expectation based on infor-
mation available at time t. The utility function assumed in (5) is additively separable over time

 '
 12 am including Clothing and Shoes as a durable good.
    Mankiw (1983) has proposed this explanation for the volatility of durables purchases over the business cycle.
    Mishkin (1976) argues that it is due to the illiquidity of durables as assets.
    See Eichenbaum and Hansen (1983) for an analysis of aggregate consumption that does not employ the repre—
    sentative consumer paradigm.

                                                       5
and implicitly additively separable in consumption and leisure. Both separability assumptions are
maintained in most empirical work because they simplify estimation considerably.'5
     The flow of consumption services received in each period depends on the stock of consumption
goods owned by the consumer and on a set of exogenous variables:

                                                     = F(K,X)                                                   (6)

K is a Q x 1 vector of the stocks of consumption goods and X is an S x 1 vector of variables
that affects the flow of consumption services obtained from any level of K. The function F(.)
can be thought of as the production function consumers use to transform consumption goods into
consumption services, as in Lancaster (1966) and Becker and Stigler (1977), or as part of preferences.
The Xt variables are then interpreted as shocks to consumers' production functions/preferences.
The consumer does not control X.
    The consumer does control the stock of existing consumption goods by making purchases of
new consumption goods. The stock of existing goods is related to the flow of new purchases, I, by

                                             K=(1—d)Kt_,+I                                                      (7)

where I is a Q x 1 vector of the purchases of new consumption goods, '1' is the Q x Q identity
matrix, and d is a Q x Q diagonal matrix in which the qth diagonal element is the depreciation
rate of the qth good. For non-durable goods, dq 1 so    =                I.
      The first order conditions for the consumer's optimal consumption plan consist of stochastic
Euler equations.'6 There are many different types of Euler equations for the problem specified in
(5)—(7); this paper examines two types that can be written in relatively intuitive forms. These
first-order conditions follow from the assumption that the consumer has access to a capital market
in which he can freely trade various financial assets. The first-order conditions derived and tested
below must hold with respect to all such assets; the deriviations, however, are carried out only for
a single asset for simplicity of presentation.'7
      The first type of first-order condition says that the marginal utility of increasing purchases of
a non-durable good must be the same as the expected marginal utility of investing the cost of that
unit and then purchasing the good next period with the investment plus accrued return:

In (8), 1 denotes purchases of a non-durable good, p is the nominal price of that good, and it+,is
the nominal return on any financial asset between t and t + 1. The quantity (1 + r+,) is therefore
the real return measured in terms of the qth good, i.e., the rate at which the consumer can trade
non-durable consumption this period for non-durable consumption next period.
  '    The papers by Mankiw, Rotemberg and Summers (1984) and Eichenbaum, Hansen and Singleton (1984) indicate
       that relaxation of these two assumptions does not qualitatively change the result that the seasonally adjusted
       data reject the Life Cycle-Permanent Income Model.
  16   There are also non-stochastic Euler equations. This paper does not examine those equations.

      The second type of first order condition says that the marginal utility of increasing purchases
 of a durable good must be the same as the expected marginal utility of investing the cost of the
 durable, using part of the return to replenish the stock of the durable good next period (so that
 the stock is unchanged in all future periods) and spending the rest on a non-durable good:

 Ij denotes purchases of a durable good andpurchases of a non-durable. The quantity (1+r1)
 is the rate at which the consumer can carry out in the marketplace the trade described above.
      The two first-order conditions determine the rate at which an individual consumer will purchase
non-durables and adjust the level of stocks of durables. The consumer alters the desired rate of
growth and levels of these variables in response to movements in asset returns. We can see this
more clearly by imposing at this point the assumptions about functional forms that will be made
in order to parameterize the model for estimation.
     The period utility function, U(.), is additively separable in the utility from the Q different
consumption services, and the qth sub-utility function is of the constant intertemporal elasticity of
substitution form:
                                                       Q
                                            U(C) = >Uq(Cj)                                            (12)

In  (13), 'lq is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption of the qth consumption
service. The assumption embodied in (13), that utility of consumption is additively separable in the
utility from Q different consumption services, is restrictive but simplifies estimation considerably.
    The household production function is a vector of Cobb-Douglas functions. That is, the qth
consumption service is a Cobb-Douglas function of the stock of the qth consumption good and the
shocks to preferences:

F is the elasticity of the qth consumption service with respect to K', and  is the elasticity of
the qth consumption service with respect to the sth exogenous variable.
     Imposing these assumptions about functional forms and the assumption of rational expecta-
tions implies that (8) and (10) simplify to

The variables Cj and Vt are uncorrelated with all variables dated time t or earlier by the
assumption of rational expectations. The first order condition for purchases of a non-durable good
determines the rate at which purchases of that good must grow relative to the growth rates of
the exogenous variables and relative to real asset returns; the first order condition for durables
determines the level of the stock of a durable relative to purchases of any non-durable and relative
to the exogenous variables and real asset returns.
     Equations (15) and (16) therefore say that, for an individual consumer, the time series proper-
ties of the variables r, r and X determine those of I and KI, up to serially uncorrelated error
terms. The seasonality in an individual consumer's desired values of I' and K can be the result
of seasonality in preferences or seasonality in real asset returns.
     Two additional comments about the model are in order. The seasonality of an individual
consumer's income does not affect the seasonality of that consumer's consumption demands. To
begin with, the seasonality of income is determined endogenously as the result of the consumer's
optimal plan, since leisure may be one of the Q consumption goods. In addition, even if labor
income were exogenous, as it is in many treatments of the Life Cycle-Permanent Income model,18
the seasonality in this variable should have no effect on the optimal consumption plan. This is
because the consumer takes account of all expected changes in future periods' income and achieves
a consumption path that smooths them out by borrowing and lending. Changes in income produce
changes in consumption only when there are revisions in the consumer's forecast of all future
periods' income. These revisions errors should not be seasonal, however, by the very fact that they
are revision errors.
     The model is consistent with the stylized fact that there is more seasonal variation in purchases
of durables than in purchases of non-durables and services. To see this, consider the special case
where the preferences for services from the two types of goods are the same and there are no
seasonals in preferences for either good. Then (16) reduces to

                                        1=                (1   + r1) + Vj                                        (17)


Even if there were no seasonality in r, an individual consumer would still desire some in K if
there is any in I (induced by a seasonal in rfl. Specifically, if desired is x% higher in a given
season, then desired K must be so also. But this means that desired purchases of the durable
good must rise by more than x%. Thus the presence of liquidity constraints is not necessary to
explain the 'excess' seasonality of durables purchases.'9
      B. Aggregation
     The existing empirical work on consumption, and the results to be presented below, estimate
equations like (15) and (16) using aggregate per capita data. This procedure is appropriate under
certain sets of conditions, the simplest of which is that all consumers are identical with respect to
preferences and endowments so that (15) and (16) apply to every consumer and therefore trivially
also to the aggregate per capita data. This set of conditions is not strictly necessary (see Rubinstein
(1974)), but any set of conditions justifying the validity of (15) or (16) for the aggregate data involves
strong assumptions. The reason for attempting to fit such a model, despite the clear violation of
the necessary assumptions, is that if such a model were a reasonable approximation of the world
it would be extremely useful because of its simpliticy. In the empirical work below, therefore, I

  '   For example, Flavin (1981) and Bernanke (1985).
      Mishkin (1976) proposes an explantion for the 'excess' volatility of durables based on the existence of liquidity
      constraints.

                                                          8
assume that the necessary conditions presented in Rubinstein (1974) hold, so that (15) and (16)
can be interpreted as applying to the aggregate per capita data.
     The interpretations of the equations (15) and (16) given above for an individual consumer,
however, do not follow when we think of them as applying to the aggregate data. In that case, there
is no causal relation running from asset returns to consumption decisions; rather, the equilibrium
values of both consumption and asset returns are determined simultaneously. The appropriate
interpretation of (15) and (16) is then that they are equilibrium pricing functions of the type
analyzed by Lucas (1978). These functions relate aggregate equilibrium consumption purchases and
equilibrium expected asset returns to shocks to preferences and technology. The pricing functions
impose restrictions on the joint distribution of consumption and asset returns but they do not
restrict the process for consumption by itself.
     In particular, therefore, the statement made above that, for an individual consumer, the season-
ality of asset returns and preferences shocks determines the seasonality of consumption purchases,
does not follow for the aggregate data. Rather, the appropriate interpretation of the seasonality in
consumption is that the seasonality of shocks to the economy determines the seasonality of the joint
process for consumption and asset returns. It is appropriate to ask what the seasonal pattern in
consumption or asset returns would be if there were a different seasonal in preferences or technology,
but not to say that the seasonality of asset returns causes the seasonality of consumption.
4. Estimation and Results
     In this section I present estimates of the model described above for six non-durable goods
and one durable good. The non-durable goods studied are Food, Fuel Oil and Coal, Gasoline
and Oil, Housing Services, Electricity and Gas, and Transportation Services. The durable good is
Motor Vehicles and Parts. These categories were selected because there are CPI components whose
coverage matches closely that of the consumption category.2° The estimation was carried out on
quarterly data. The sample period is 1948:1 to 1982:4, except for Fuel Oil and Coal and Electricity
and Gas; for these goods the sample period is 1960:1 to 1982:4.
    A. Details of the Estimation Procedure
    The variables included in X were a constant, time, time-squared, and seasonal dummies for
quarters two, three and four. Specifically,
                                          xt'=l
                                          X = exp(dfl          s = 2,3,4
                                          X = exp(t)
                                          X° = exp(t2)
These assumptions about X imply that equations (15) and (16) simplify to

       i=   i (.i) '((si) exp(G(d:+i_ dfl±2Gt))                                     (1 + r+i) + Cj            (18)


               1 = 2 exp       ( qd + t + 6t2) (±!)                 C +)1       (1 + r1) + +1                 (19)
                            3=2                                     (.K)
 20   I have not included any estimates for Clothing and Shoes, even though there is a suitable deflator, for two
      reasons. First, it seems unreasonable to treat Clothing and Shoes as a non-durable. Second, no data on the
      stock of Clothing and Shoes exist. Therefore, the only way to estimate an equation for Clothing and Shoes is
      to create a stock series from the quarterly flow numbers. I have tried this but have been unable to obtain any
      sensible results.

                                                         9
The parameter 9 is a nonlinear function of /3 and G5. Neither of these parameters is separately
identified by the model. The parameters 02 and , s = 2,.. . ,6, are nonlinear functions of /3, j'q,
-y3., and G,, s = 2,... ,6. Only y, and are identified.
     Equations (18) and (19) were estimated by two-stage nonlinear least squares21 with a constant,
three seasonal dummies, time, time-squared and lagged values of the included variables used as
instruments. Any variable dated time t or earlier serves as a valid instrument since an implication
of the model is that all such variables are uncorrelated with the error in the equation (Hansen
(1982), Hansen and Singleton (1982)).22 There are cross equation restrictions on the system of
equations (18) and (19), so the system can in principle be estimated more efficiently by a full
information technique. In the estimation below I use single equation methods, however. This
procedure has the advantage that misspecification in one equation will not affect the estimation of
the other equation.
    B. Results
    Tables 2 and 3 present the main results. Table 2 displays estimates of equation (18) while
Table 3 shows estimates of equation (19). There are six different specifications in each table, with
each specification corresponding to a different non-durable.
      The point estimates shown in Tables 2 and 3 are sensible and in most cases precise. The
estimated values of the intertemporal elasticities of substitution have the theoretically correct sign
in eleven out of twelve cases for non-durables and in all six cases for durables. In those cases where
it is postive, the estimated value ranges from .015 to 1.706 for non-durables and from .474 to 1.357
for durables. The estimates therefore imply utility functions between linear and logarithmic in
most cases. These values are in the range found in previous papers, although they are at the low
end of that range.23
      The coefficients on the seasonal dummies enter statistically significantly in most cases: a test of
the hypothesis that the coefficients G2, G3, and G4 are jointly equal to zero rejects that hypothesis
for all goods except Electricity and Gas. In addition, the signs and magnitudes of the estimates are
usually plausible. For example, the estimates for Fuel Oil and Coal indicate that a given size real
purchase is more productive in the winter than in the summer, as one would expect. The estimates
for Gasoline and Oil imply that purchases of this good are more productive in the summer than in
the winter. This is plausible since bad weather makes driving a car undesirable in the winter in many
parts of the country. The fact that the seasonal preference shocks are significantly different from
zero means that inclusion of these shocks is necessary in order to explain the seasonal fluctuations
in consumption and asset returns; these fluctuations are not entirely due to seasonal technology
shocks.
     Tables 3 and 4 also report results of tests of the overidentifying restriction on the model that
any variable dated time t or earlier should be uncorrelated with the error term.24 This is the
restriction that previous papers have rejected. The tables show that the data never reject the
 21 See
          Hansen (1982) and Hansen and Singleton (1982). One can also estimate linearized versions of (15) and
      (16), as in Hansen and Singleton (1983) and Mankiw (1983). I have chosen to estimate the nonlinear equations
      because in this model the linearized equations are still nonlinear in the parameters and so relatively little
      simplification is gained by employing the linearization.
 22 See King and Garber (1983) for a critique of this approach.
 23
      Mankiw, Rotemberg, and Summers (1984) and Eichenbaum, Hansen and Singleton (1983) report values of
    between 0 and 1; Hansen and Singleton (1983) report values between 0 and 2; Mankiw (1983) reports values
    between 2 and 4; and Hall (1982) reports values around 15.
 24 The
         test statistic is Hansen's (1982) J-statistic. The test being carried out is whether the residual is correlated
    with the instruments; according to the model, the correlations should all be zero. Computationally, Runkle
    (1983) shows that under conditional homoskedasticity the J-statistic is identical to T x R2, where T is the
    number of observations and R2 is the R2 from a regression of the residual series on the instruments. The
    3-statistic is distributed as 2(q), where q is the number of overidentifying restrictions.

overidentifying restrictions at the 99% level and oniy twice reject them at the 95% level. This
is an unusual and encouraging result. It shows that in addition to providing plausible parameter
estimates, the seasonally unadjusted data do not reject the model.
      To check that the lack of rejection is due to the use of seasonally unadjusted data I have
estimated equations of the form (18) and (19) using seasonally adjusted data, with the seasonal
dummies excluded. The results of this estimation are reported in Tables 4 and 5. The estimates
of 'i are negative more often with adjusted data than with unadjusted data. Moreover, the data
reject the overidentifying restrictions on the adjusted data in eight out of twelve cases at the 99%
level and in nine out of twelve cases at the 95% level.
     The results presented in Tables 4 and 5, combined with those in Tables 2 and 3, demonstrate
forcefully that the inclusion of seasonal fluctuations in the analysis above is the reason for the
superior performance of the model presented here relative to previous results. The estimation
strategy used in Tables 2—3 and 4—5 is identical, other than the treatment of seasonal fluctuations.
Thus, the difference between the results is due to the treatment of seasonality and not to any other
aspect of the model or estimation strategy employed. Although the estimation strategy employed
in this paper involves many strong assumptions, such as the additively separability assumptions
about preferences, all of these assumptions are also imposed in the estimations reported in Tables
4 and 5 using adjusted data. Comparison of the two sets of tables shows that the exclusion of
seasonal fluctuations from analyses of the Life Cycle-Permanent Income model has been the key
reason for the negative assessment of the model.
     C. The Effects of the Weather
     The results above show that there are quantitatively important shocks to preferences, but
they do not provide any economic explanation for these shocks. In the remainder of this section I
examine the hypothesis that the weather causes the seasonal preference shocks. To do this, I use
two measures of the weather, in place of seasonal dummies, to re-estimate equation (18).25 Table
6 reports the results. The coefficient G7 is the coefficient on a temperature variable and G8 is that
on a precipitation variable.
     The results are generally good. The estimates of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution
have the correct sign in five out of six cases. The temperature variable enters significantly in
almost half the cases, and with a plausible sign, although the precipitation variable never enters
significantly. The tests of the overidentifying restrictions do not reject the model in four out of six
cases. To determine if the weather representation of the seasonal shocks is better than the seasonal
dummy representation, I have estimated equation (18) including both the seasonal dummies and
the weather variables and then tested the hypothesis that the coefficients on the weather variables
are zero. The only good for which the data reject the null hypothesis is Electricity and Gas.
    The conclusion to be drawn, then, is that the data are consistent with the hypothesis that
seasonal shocks to preferences are caused by the weather; they do not, however, strongly suggest
this hypothesis. It seems clear that the hypothesis deserves further consideration: since there is
serial correlation in the weather it may have non-seasonal as well as seasonal affects, and since such
 2 The weather data were constructed as follows. I obtained monthly data on temperature and precipitation
    for four U.S. cities: Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Atlanta. The temperature data give the mean
    temperature during the month, while the precipitation data are total precipitation over the month. The data
    were converted to a quarterly frequency by averaging the temperature data and summing the precipitation
    data. The quarterly series for the four cities were then averaged to obtain a national measure of temperature
    and precipitation. As a preliminary step, I regressed each of these variables on a constant, three seasonal
    dummies, and its own lagged values. The results showed, not suprisingly, that the weather is highly seasonal:
    most of the dummies enter significantly and with large coefficients. For example, the temperature variable is
    on average 31 degrees higher in summer than in winter. The results also show that there are non-seasonal
    movements in the weather variables since the first autoregressive parameter enters significantly in both cases.
    This is important to have if the use of weather variables is to improve on the use of seasonal dummies.

shocks are real, they are consistent with real business cycle models. It also seems clear, however,
that it will be difficult to separate the effects of the weather from other seasonal effects using
aggregate data.26

5. Seasonal Fluctuations and Equilibrium Models of Consumption
     The results presented above show that the fluctuations in aggregate consumption are consistent
with an equilibrium model of consumption behavior. This result is the opposite of that obtained
in previous papers, and as discussed above, it is due to the inclusion of seasonal fluctuations in the
analysis. The fact that including seasonal fluctuations gives a more optimistic view of equilibrium
models is not suprising; since seasonal fluctuations are predictable, it is likely that agents anticipate
them and adjust their behavior accordingly, even if they cannot do the same with business cycle
fluctuations. Yet most economic analysis of equilibrium models has been carried out with seasonally
adjusted or annual data and therefore includes a bias towards rejecting the equilibrium view. It is
therefore important to the assessment of equilibrium models that economic analyses consider the
seasonal fluctuations in other aspects of the economy.

    Construction of Seasonally Unadjusted Data on Real Consumption Purchases

     The Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce (BEA) constructs and
publishes the data in the National Income and Product Accounts on consumption purchases. The
BEA does not provide any seasonally unadjusted data on real consumption purchases, however, so
in order to obtain such data it is necessary to construct them. This can be done as follows.
     The BEA does construct seasonally unadjusted data on the nominal value of consumption
purchases. These data are published on a quarterly basis in the Survey of Current Business. The
categories of consumption for which these data are available are listed in Table Al, along with
the dates of availability and the share of each category in total consumption. There are thirteen
categories, which includes three different categories of durable goods, five of non-durables, and five
of services. Most of the series are available starting in 1946:1, although a few begin only in 1959:1.
     The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes seasonally unadjusted data on the detailed compo-
nents of the Consumer Price Index in the Monthly Labor Review. Table Al also shows the CPI
components that match most closely the thirteen categories of consumption purchases. In some
cases the link between the definition of the consumption category and the CPI component is close
(e.g. Food, Gasoline and Oil, and Fuel Oil and Coal) but for others it is rather poor (Furniture
and Appliances, Other Durables, Other Non-Durables).
     Seasonally unadjusted data on real consumption purchases can be constructed by dividing
the seasonally unadjusted data on nominal consumption purchases by the seasonally unadjusted
components of the CPI. This procedure is analagous to the one used by BEA to create seasonally
adjusted data on consumption purchases, since BEA's practice is to divide seasonally adjusted data
on nominal purchases by a seasonally adjusted component of the CPI. The validity of the procedure
(with adjusted or unadjusted data) depends on how well the categories for which CPI components
exist match up with the categories for which the data on nominal consumption purchases exist.
     I have used the data for the CPI components shown in Table Al to deflate the data on the
thirteen categories of nominal consumption purchases shown in the table. These are the data used
above to construct stylized facts and to estimate the model of consumption behavior.
