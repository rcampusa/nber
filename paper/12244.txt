                                           ABSTRACT

In the 1990s the US hospital industry consolidated. This paper estimates the impact of the wave of
hospital mergers on welfare focusing on the impact on consumer surplus for the under-65 population.
For the purposes of quantifying the price impact of consolidations, hospitals are modeled as an input
to the production of health insurance for the under-65 population. The estimates indicate that the
aggregate magnitude of the impact of hospital mergers is modest but not trivial. In 2001, average
HMO premiums are estimated to be 3.2% higher than they would have been absent any hospital
merger activity during the 1990s. In 2003, we estimate that because of hospital mergers private
insurance rolls declined by approximately .3 percentage points or approximately 695,000 lives with
the vast majority of those who lost private insurance joining the ranks of the uninsured. Our
estimates imply that hospital mergers resulted in a cumulative consumer surplus loss of over $42.2
billion between 1990 and 2001. It is estimated that all but a modest $95.4 million of the loss in
consumer surplus is transferred from consumers to providers.

I. Introduction

        In the 1990s the US hospital industry consolidated. Figure 1 displays the mean

population-weighted hospital Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and the number of

horizontal mergers, acquisitions and hospital system expansions for Metropolitan

Statistical Areas (MSAs). The average HHI increased from .1888 in 1990 to .2772 in

2003, with the vast majority of the increase due to hospital consolidation. On average

there were 58 hospital mergers within MSAs in any given year with the peak of the wave

occurring in 1996 when there were 108 consolidations. 1

        This paper estimates the impact of hospital consolidation on welfare. For the

purposes of quantifying the price impact of consolidations on the under-65 population,

hospitals are modeled as an input to the production of health insurance. In order to better

understand the roles of upstream and downstream market structures in determining the

impact of upstream horizontal mergers, we also make a modest contribution to the theory

of mergers in industries that are inputs to the final consumption good.

        We examine hospital consolidations for several reasons. First, over the decade of

the 1990s a wave of consolidation occurred but this wave was not uniform across hospital

markets. In approximately 45% of the MSAs there was no change in market structure due

to consolidation. Furthermore, in those markets in which a consolidation took place there

is substantial variation in the change in market structure. Thus, the hospital industry

provides a nice case study of the impact of horizontal mergers because we observe many

markets with varying amounts of consolidation.

 We use the term “consolidation” to refer to all combinations of previously independent organizations, e.g.
mergers, acquisitions, consolidations and hospital system expansions. For stylistic reasons we sometimes
use the term “merger” to refer to the same set of combinations.


                                                     1
           Second, understanding competition in the hospital industry is important in its own

right. Inpatient hospital care comprises 31% of total US health care expenditures (Smith

et al., 2005). Furthermore, hospitals are the second largest 3-digit North American

Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry in the US with over $509 billion in

annual revenue in 2002 or 4.9% of Gross Domestic Product (NAICS Code 622, US

Census Bureau, 2004). 2 Thus, merger activity in the hospital industry not only provides

an opportunity to test theory, but also may exert a substantial impact on aggregate

economic activity.

           Our model predicts that horizontal mergers in upstream markets will have larger

consequences for consumer prices, hence welfare, the more competitive the downstream

market. That is, the fewer competitors downstream the more an upstream merger simply

transfers monopoly rents from the downstream firms to the upstream firms.

           The hypothesis that the welfare consequences of upstream mergers are a function

of downstream competition is supported by our empirical analysis. Hospital mergers led

to an increase in HMO premiums for those HMOs that operated in the most competitive

markets. However, on average, we find no effects of hospital mergers on premiums for

HMOs that operate in markets with few competitors. Our estimates indicate that the

aggregate impact of hospital mergers is modest but not trivial. In 2001, average HMO

premiums are estimated to be 3.2% higher than they would have been absent any hospital

merger activity during the 1990s. In relatively competitive HMO markets, premiums are

5.3% higher than they would have been with no merger activity.

           Our most important finding is that these premium increases have consequences

for the quantity and source of health insurance acquired by the under-65 year old
2
    The largest 3-digit industry is ‘motor vehicles parts and dealers’ with $804 billion in revenues.

population. We match MSA-level merger information to the Current Population Survey

(CPS) from 1990 to 2003 to analyze the impact of hospital mergers on insurance status.

We find that hospital mergers in MSAs with relatively competitive HMO markets led to

decreases in private health insurance and increases in the population without health

insurance. However, in markets with weak HMO competition, hospital mergers did not

appear to affect the amount of private health insurance coverage or the number of the

uninsured. Hospital mergers in such markets appear to transfer rents from HMOs to

hospitals.

         The estimated impacts of hospital mergers on private health insurance take-up and

the uninsured population are also modest but not trivial. In 2003, we estimate that

because of hospital mergers the likelihood of having private insurance declined by

approximately .46 percentage points, reducing private health insurance rolls by 695,000

lives. From 1990 to 2003, we estimate that hospital mergers resulted in a decline in

private health insurance of 5.8 million life years.

         Our estimates indicate that the vast majority of those who exited private insurance

joined the ranks of the uninsured. In our sample of CPS data, in 2003 the rate of

uninsurance among 22 to 62 years olds was .178. We estimate that hospital mergers since

1990 led to an increase in the 2003 uninsurance rate of approximately .43 percentage

points. This translates into an extra 650,000 individuals lacking health insurance because

of hospital consolidations that occurred over the previous 14 years. From 1990 to 2003,

we estimate that hospital mergers increased the uninsured population by 5.5 million life-

years.




                                              3
        We use our estimates of changes in premiums and insurance take-up to calculate

rough estimates of consumer surplus loss for adults due to hospital mergers. Between

1990 and 2001, our estimates imply that hospital mergers resulted in a loss of consumer

surplus of over $42.2 billion. In 2001, consumers lost over $7.3 billion surplus or

approximately $50 per capita. While the loss of consumer surplus is substantial, the total

welfare loss due to hospital consolidation over this period is estimated to be a modest

$95.4 million. The reason for the much smaller dead weight loss is that, consistent with

the previous literature, our estimates imply that the demand for health insurance is

inelastic, the premium increase is modest and the “revenue base” for the premium

increase (i.e. the size of the population with health insurance) is quite large.

        To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few papers that have estimated the

welfare consequences of horizontal mergers for consumers. There is a modest literature

examining the effects of consummated mergers on prices, but few papers have

documented quantity (or quality) consequences of mergers which are necessary to assess

welfare effects. Antitrust laws have existed for over 110 years, yet there is surprisingly

little empirical evidence on the consequences of mergers that can be used to hone

competition policy. 3

        The next section briefly summarizes the theoretical and empirical literatures on

mergers. Section III presents a very simple model of the consequence of upstream

mergers. Section IV discusses the empirical framework and Section V describes the data.

Section VI presents estimation results and Section VII concludes.

 As Gurrea and Owen (2003) state: “The sad truth is that despite endless calls for empirical study of the
effects of mergers and of antitrust enforcement of section 7, there is very little empirical evidence
demonstrating the effects of mergers (or enjoining mergers) on consumer welfare.”

II. Literature

A. Theoretical Literature

       At least since the passage of the Sherman Act in 1890, many economists and

public policy makers have suspected that market power can have deleterious effects on

markets and that mergers are one mechanism by which firms can achieve market power.

Marshall (1920) provided an early formalized basis for this belief. However, Stigler

(1950) noted that while mergers may increase market power, the incentives for firms to

consolidate are mitigated by the presence of an externality. In a symmetric equilibrium,

all non-merging firms in the market gain more from a merger than the merging parties. In

a paper that has significantly impacted antitrust thought, Williamson (1968) showed that

mergers that generate efficiencies, even if they create substantial market power, can be

welfare enhancing.

       In more recent analysis, Salant, Switzer and Reynolds (1983) formalize the ideas

of Stigler and show in a simple Cournot model that unless there are efficiencies or that

firms achieve duopoly market power, a merger will not be privately profitable. McAfee

and Williams (1992) Deneckere and Davidson (1985) Perry and Porter (1985) and Farrell

and Sharpiro (1990) all model the welfare consequences of privately profitable mergers

in a static framework. A synthesis of the results from these papers is that privately

profitable mergers can either decrease or increase welfare. Gowrisankaran (1999) models

endogenous mergers in a dynamic framework with firm entry and exit, and he shows that

antitrust enforcement can enhance welfare. That is, the result that mergers can reduce

welfare is robust to dynamic considerations.




                                               5
B. Empirical Literature

       While the theoretical literature is relatively rich and there is a very large empirical

literature measuring the relationship between market concentration and prices, there are

relatively few studies of the realized consequences of actual mergers on prices and

quantities. This literature focuses primarily, but not exclusively, on three industries:

airlines, banking, and hospitals. Borenstein (1990); Werden, Joskow, and Johnson (1991)

and Kim and Singal (1993) all find that airline mergers in the 1980s led to price

increases. Prager and Hannan (1998) find that the deposit rates offered by banks

operating in markets in which substantial horizontal consolidation occurred fell less than

for banks operating in markets in which consolidation did not occur. Berger, et al. (1998)

estimates that bank mergers led to a decline in small business lending by the merging

institutions, which was offset as competing banks increasing their lending over time.

Focarelli and Panetta (2003) find that Italian bank mergers initially caused consumer

welfare to decline but over time the merging firms were able to achieve efficiencies that

led to a long run increase in welfare. Using structural methods, Pesendorfer (2003)

estimates the welfare impact of the wave of mergers in the paper industry during the mid-

1980s. He finds these mergers led to both static and dynamic efficiencies that yielded

significant consumer and producer surplus gains.

       In sum, the empirical literature estimating the impact of mergers on prices and

quantities from non-hospital industries suggests that they often lead to price increases.

However, the works of Focarelli and Panetta (2003) and Pessendorfer (2003) are an

important caveat to this conclusion—mergers can lead to efficiencies that benefit both

consumers and producers. This work highlights (and expands) the empirical relevance of




                                             6
the theoretical point Williamson (1968) made 35 years earlier. Next, we turn our attention

to the hospital competition literature.

       Since the 1980s a large literature has evolved devoted to the impact of hospital

competition on inpatient prices paid by insurers. Several papers have examined the

impact of mergers on prices while a larger literature uses the cross sectional variation in

market structure to identify the impact of competition on prices. More recently,

researchers have estimated structural models and simulated the impact of hospital

mergers on price. We briefly review this literature below.

       Several papers have used a pre/post research design to assess the impact of

hospital mergers on hospital costs and the price of inpatient care paid by insurers. The

typical finding is that mergers appear to reduce costs. Using data from 1986 to 1994,

Connor, et al. (1997) find that hospital mergers decrease expenditures and revenues per

admission by 4%. They interpret their results as implying that hospital mergers achieve

significant efficiencies. Consistent with this result, Dranove and Lindrooth (2004) find

that mergers where hospitals combine financial statements result in significant cost

reductions. Using a very limited sample of hospital mergers, Capps and Dranove (2003)

find that hospital consolidations led to increases in hospital prices that are greater than the

median increase in hospital prices. Vita and Sacher (2001) analyze the impact of the

Dominican Santa Cruz Hospital’s acquisition of its sole competitor in Santa Cruz, CA,

AMI-Community Hospital and find that the merger led to price increases of roughly 15%.

More recently, in an analysis that corrects for the endogeneity of mergers, Dafny (2005)

finds that hospitals that are located within 7 miles of a merging rival raise prices by 40%

post-merger. Finally, relying on interviews of health care executives and policymakers,




                                              7
Devers et al. (2003) argue that hospital negotiating leverage with health insurers

increased substantially from 1996 to 2000 and that hospital consolidation was a prime

contributor to the increase in hospital bargaining power.

       Two papers employ structural approaches to estimate the impact of hospital

mergers on price. Using different estimating strategies, Gaynor and Vogt (2003) and

Capps, Dranove and Satterthwaite (2003) find that hospital mergers in an urban setting

can lead to significant price increases. Gaynor and Vogt (2003) simulate a merger in San

Louis Obispo County that would create a monopoly and estimate that such a transaction

would increase price by 53%. Capps, Dranove and Satterthwaite (2003) simulated a

merger between two hospitals in La Jolla, CA and predicted that it would lead to a 6%

price increase.

       Research on the relationship between hospital concentration and prices generally

finds that an increase in hospital concentration is correlated with higher prices for

inpatient care, and many interpret this correlation as a causal relationship. This literature

primarily relies on cross-sectional variation in hospital concentration to identify the

relationship between concentration and the price paid by insurers. The source of

identification in this approach has been criticized, but nevertheless this body of work

provides much of the evidence on the impact of hospital competition. Comprehensive

reviews of this literature can be found in Dranove and Satterthwaite (2000) and Gaynor

and Vogt (2000). According to Gaynor and Vogt (2000), the estimates from this literature

imply that an increase in the HHI from .20 to .28 will lead to price changes that range

between -3% and 17% with the average (unweighted) price increase across the estimates

of roughly 4%.




                                             8
         In sum, the empirical literature suggests that hospital mergers in concentrated

markets can lead to price increases for inpatient care. However, the estimated magnitudes

of these price increases vary considerably. To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has

been made to measure the impact of hospital mergers on the welfare of the final

consumer. 4



III. A Simple Theory of the Effect of Upstream Mergers

         The literature studying the impact of non-vertical, upstream mergers on

downstream markets is sparse. 5 Given the lack of analytical results to draw upon, the

purpose of this section is to build some theoretical guidance for our empirical

specification. We posit the simplest model that can highlight the relationships between

market structures and prices in two linked markets. We make many assumptions

forsaking realism for simplicity. Specifically, we do not model that HMOs often

selectively contract with hospitals and that HMOs and hospitals engage in bargaining

relationships. 6 We assume that the demand for HMO coverage is linear and the

production technology for an HMO uses two inputs in fixed proportions (that is, in order

to sell a policy an HMO must use both physician and hospital inputs in fixed

proportions); and we assume both hospital services and HMO coverage are homogeneous

goods.

         We assume that there are N downstream HMOs and M upstream hospitals. The

market for physician services is treated as perfectly competitive and thus price is set at

marginal cost. Both HMOs and hospitals are Cournot competitors, choosing output while

taking the output choices of their competitors as given.

       The market demand for HMO services is given by PHMO = A − bQHMO where PHMO

is the price of HMO services and QHMO is the market quantity of HMO services

                                                            ⎛w f⎞
purchased. The cost function for a given HMO is C(qi ) = qi ⎜ + ⎟ where w is the
                                                            ⎝α β⎠

price of a hospital day (which is endogenous in our model), f is the price of a physician

visit, and α , β are production function parameters. The HMO takes the prices of hospital

and physician services as given. That is, there is no bargaining between the upstream and

downstream firms.

       The HMO objective function is simply:

(1)            M ax qi P (Q ) qi − C ( qi )

The first order conditions are:
                          ⎛w f ⎞
(2)        A − bQ − bqi = ⎜ + ⎟
                          ⎝α β ⎠
Assuming HMOs are identical and a symmetric equilibrium implies that a HMO’s supply

function and the aggregate supply function are given by:

                          1     ⎛   w f ⎞
(3)            qi =             ⎜ A− − ⎟
                      b( N + 1) ⎝   α β⎠

and
                          N ⎛       w f       ⎞
(4)            Qi =             ⎜ A− −        ⎟.
                      b( N + 1) ⎝   α β       ⎠

The equilibrium HMO price is then:

                                N ⎛       w f ⎞
(5)             PHMO = A −            ⎜ A− − ⎟
                             ( N + 1) ⎝   α β⎠




                                                   10
From the equilibrium HMO supply function we can derive the aggregate derived demand

for hospital days, H, as:

                           N      ⎛   w f ⎞
(6)             H=                ⎜ A− − ⎟ .
                      α b( N + 1) ⎝   α β⎠

The inverse demand for hospital days is simply:

                     ⎛    α b( N + 1)    f          ⎞
(7)             w =α ⎜ A−             H−            ⎟.
                     ⎝         N         β          ⎠

       Turning to the upstream market, hospitals take the derived demand (7) as the

market demand for their output. The hospital’s objective function is:

(8)             M ax hi w( H ) hi − C (hi )

The first-order conditions, after substituting in the derived demand, are:

                  ⎛      α b( N + 1)          f ⎞ α 2b( N + 1)
                α ⎜ A−                 H−          −           hi = mch .
                                              β ⎟⎠
(9)
                  ⎝          N                         N

Assuming a symmetric Nash equilibrium gives the individual and market supply curves

for hospital services:


                     ⎛         N          ⎞⎛     mch f ⎞
(10)            hi = ⎜                    ⎟⎜ A −    − ⎟
                     ⎝ ( M + α )( N + 1)b ⎠ ⎝     α  β⎠

and

                   ⎛       NM           ⎞⎛     mch f ⎞
(11)            H =⎜                    ⎟⎜ A −    − ⎟
                   ⎝ ( M + α )( N + 1)b ⎠ ⎝     α  β⎠



Substitution into market derived demand yields:

                      ⎛      ⎛ M ⎛           mc f ⎞ ⎞ f ⎞
                w = α ⎜ A −α ⎜          ⎜ A−   −    ⎟− ⎟
                                             α β ⎟⎠ ⎠ β ⎟⎠
(12)
                      ⎜
                      ⎝      ⎝ (M + α ) ⎝


                                                    11
Substituting back into the HMO inverse demand gives the HMO price as a function of the

HMO and hospital market structure:

                                   N ⎛ αM ⎛               mc f        ⎞⎞
(13)              PHMO = A −             ⎜           ⎜ A−   −         ⎟⎟
                                ( N + 1) ⎝ ( M + α ) ⎝    α β         ⎠⎠

         The downstream equilibrium price is a function of the product of the upstream

and downstream market structures. In this framework, the impact of a hospital merger on

HMO prices and thus welfare depends not only on the hospital market structure but on

the HMO market structure as well. Specifically,

                   ΔPHMO               N ⎛⎛               α2            ⎞⎛     mc f       ⎞⎞
(14)                              =          ⎜⎜ ⎜                       ⎟⎜ A −   −        ⎟ ⎟⎟ .
                    ΔM     ΔM =−1   ( N + 1) ⎝ ⎝ ( M + α )( M − 1 + α ) ⎠ ⎝    α β        ⎠⎠

Given our assumptions, as the HMO market becomes more competitive, the impact of a

given hospital consolidation on HMO prices increases. 7 That is, while total welfare will

be lower when the HMO market is more consolidated (there is double marginalization),

the change in welfare from the marginal merger will be lower when the HMO market is

more concentrated. This is the key insight from this highly stylized theory that we use to

guide the data analysis. The impact of hospital mergers on welfare is a function of the

interaction of HMO and hospital market structure.



IV. Empirical Framework

         We are interested in estimating the impact of hospital mergers on HMO premiums

and the quantity of health insurance purchased. We use two units of analysis. First, the



7
  This result is sensitive to the assumptions about the functional form of demand. In a constant elasticity of
demand framework, as the HMO market becomes more competitive, the impact of a given hospital
consolidation on HMO prices decreases. However, as we discuss below, the implication of the model using
a linear demand framework is the one that turns out to be empirically relevant.


                                                     12
impact of hospital mergers on HMO premiums is examined with the HMO as the unit of

analysis. Second, the impact of hospital mergers on health insurance purchase is

examined with the Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area (PMSA) or Metropolitan

Statistical Area (MSA) as the unit of analysis. 8 The primary data source for hospital

consolidations is the American Hospital Association (AHA). Information on

consolidations is merged with HMO level data for the first analysis and the Current

Population Survey (CPS) data at the MSA level for the second analysis.

A. HMO Premiums

          To investigate the impact of hospital consolidations on HMO premiums we

estimate parameters from the following HMO-level regression:

                                                                                2001
(15)       log p jt = μ j + α1 log MergerHHI jt + α 2 log NHMO jt + β X jt +    ∑ φ year + ε
                                                                               t =1991
                                                                                         t   t   jt




where pij is the average premium charged by HMO j across all of the markets it

participates in period t, MergerHHI jt is the enrollment-weighted average hospital

“merger” Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. We discuss the “merger” component of the

construction of this variable below. NHMOij is the population-weighted average number

of HMOs operating in the Health Services Area (HSA) over all the counties served by the

HMO, Xjt are variables that measure the characteristics of the HMO that may impact its

costs and product quality and average characteristics of the markets it serves that may

impact its costs and/or the market demand. The variable yeart is an annual dummy

variable—our HMO data span the period 1990 to 2001. The HMO-specific error term,

μ j may be correlated with the right hand side variables and in particular MergerHHI jt


8
    We refer to PMSA and MSAs generically as MSAs.


                                                 13
and NHMOij . Since some unobserved characteristics of HMO pricing behavior may be

correlated with their propensity to experience hospital mergers or the amount of direct

competition they face, we estimate the parameters of (15) using a standard fixed-effects

estimator. To calculate consistent standard errors in the presence of auto-correlated

residuals we bootstrap the estimates.

       We use HMOs as the downstream seller of health insurance and the number of

HMOs as the measure of health insurance market structure; however, there are a number

of possible measures of health insurance and of market structure, so our choices deserve

justification. We focus on HMOs as opposed to all possible forms of health insurance

because information on HMOs is available at the MSA level while information on the

number of other types of insurers is available only at the state level. The lack of data on

other forms of health insurers should not affect our results. Through the use of selective

contracting HMOs are the health insurance organizational form that generates the greatest

hospital price sensitivity — the rise of HMOs is credited with introducing price

competition into the market for hospital services (Gaynor and Vogt, 2000). Thus, the

number of HMOs (or some other indicator of HMO market structure) is likely a better

measure of the degree of price competition hospitals face than the total number of health

insurers.

       We measure HMO market structure using the number of independent

organizations as opposed to a HHI index as we can count this with little error. Calculating




                                            14
a HHI requires assumptions regarding the distribution of enrollees over a HMO’s service

area and likely can only be measured with non-trivial error. 9

        The theory outlined above suggests that the impact of a change in the number of

hospitals on HMO prices will be a function of HMO market structure. To capture this

possibility we split the data in three different samples based on the 1995 mean value

of NHMOij . The cut-offs are chosen so that they roughly correspond to thirds of the CPS

data sample. The samples are zero to six HMOs, seven to nine HMOs, and ten or greater

HMOs. The theory of the previous section suggests that in the most competitive HMO

markets, the coefficient on MergerHHI jt should be positive—an increase in hospital

market concentration should increase HMO premiums in those markets.

B. Health Insurance

        We estimate the impact of mergers on the probability than an individual will have

private and any health insurance a using a linear probability model. Letting Iimt denote the

insurance status indicator for individual i in MSA m in period t we estimate parameters

from the following equation:

                                                                        2003
(16)        I imt = λm + φ1MergerHHI mt + φ2 ln NHMOmt + δ Wimt +       ∑γ
                                                                       t =1991
                                                                                 t   yeart + ν imt ,


where λ m is an MSA fixed effect, NHMOmt is the number of HMOs operating in the

MSA, Wimt is a vector that includes a rich set of individual demographic controls and

MSA-level characteristics and vmt is the residual. The parameter φ1 measures the impact

of hospital mergers on the likelihood of insurance take-up and is the parameter of primary

interest.

9
 To test the robustness of our results to different specifications, we included an HMO HHI Index in the
premium regression. The results of this estimation are qualitatively identical to those we present here.


                                                  15
        As in the HMO premium analysis, we follow the theory by estimating the

parameters of (16) separately for three different samples, split roughly by thirds of the

population-weighted number of HMOs in 1995. 10 The samples are zero to six HMOs,

seven to nine HMOs, and ten or greater HMOs.

C. Hospital Market Structure and Mergers

        Our main right-hand-side variable of interest in both empirical specifications

is MergerHHI mt which measures the accumulated change in hospital bed-based

concentration solely due to consolidation. The advantage of using this measure over the

more common HHI is that the standard HHI is more prone to endogeneity even

controlling for location fixed effects. For example, hospital exits and changes in the

distribution of beds are likely correlated with changes in hospital demand and those

changes, in turn, may be related to shocks in insurance coverage. Of course, changes in

MergerHHI mt could be correlated with unobserved insurance shocks, but, as we discuss

below, the evidence we can bring to bear suggests changes in MergerHHI jt are

exogenous.

        At the market level, MergerHHI is calculated by taking the market shares of

hospital physical plants in 1990 and then assigning those hospitals to the organization to

which they belong in year t. Letting sm,1990 denote the market share based on the staffed

bed size of organization m in 1990,

                            M
(12)    MergerHHI mt = ∑ sm1990 (Omt ) 2
                           m =1




10
  We explored using different years to define the three different samples. The qualitative results are
unaffected by the choice of years used to define the samples.


                                                 16
where Omt is the ownership/system structure of hospitals in period t. While MergerHHI mt

is highly correlated with the traditional HHI, the change in MergerHHI mt over time is

solely due to changes in ownership and hospital system structure. This measure treats

exiting hospitals as remaining in the market and does not include new entrants in the

measure of concentration. The vast majority of the change in the standard HHI in our data

is due to mergers. Thus, while we think it useful to separate changes in the HHI due to

consolidation, our results are robust to using a standard HHI measure. 11

D. Identification

        The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission were not passive

observers of the hospital merger wave in the 1990s. Both agencies brought several suits

attempting to enjoin hospital mergers and in each case the courts sided with the hospitals.

The courts’ rulings effectively implied that hospital were to be held to a more lenient

antitrust standard than other industries (Greaney, 2002). 12 In fact, the antitrust agencies’

failure in court may have precipitated the merger wave. Because of the reduced antitrust

scrutiny hospital mergers enjoyed over this period, our sample of hospital mergers is not

a selected sample of transactions that would typically need to pass traditional antitrust

scrutiny. That is, the hospital industry over this period serves as an experiment of the

welfare consequences of significantly reduced antitrust oversight.

           Our key identifying assumption is that ε jt and υimt are uncorrelated with

MergerHHI in the HMO premium and health insurance analysis, respectively. It is


11
   We considered using Merge rHHI as an instrument for the standard HHI measure in an instrumental
variables regression and our qualitative conclusions are robust to this specification.
12
   This string of losses was recently reversed in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission. In FTC v.
Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Corporation (2005) (File No. 011 0234, Docket No. 9315) the Court
ruled in favor of the FTC and ordered previously consolidated hospitals to de-merge. This case is currently
under appeal.


                                                    17
reasonable to ask under what other scenarios the shocks to HMO premiums, ε jt , and the

shocks to health insurance status, υimt , are correlated with MergerHHI jt and how likely

are those scenarios?

       In the HMO analysis, positive HMO demand shocks mean the potential rents a

hospital can extract via merger have increased and may overcome any transaction costs.

However, hospital mergers are very complex transactions taking years to initiate,

negotiate and complete and inherently embody significant uncertainty over the time to

completion. It would be very difficult for these organizations to forecast demand shocks

and time their merger to take advantage of those shocks. However, if these shocks are not

independent over time, then it plausible they could be correlated with MergerHHI jt . If

this were the case, we should expect MergerHHI jt to be correlated with other, more easily

observed, demand and cost side variables. Also, if the shocks are foreseeable and unless

hospitals can accurately time the consummation of their transaction, then leads and lags

of MergerHHI jt should be correlated with HMO premium. This logic suggests that

another indirect test of our specification is to estimate the model with leading and lagged

values of MergerHHI jt .

       We estimated a fixed-effects regression of HMO-level demand (average HMO

penetration, average logarithm of population, average size distribution of firms, number

of physicians, percent Medicare, percent Medicaid, and nurses’ wages) on MergerHHI jt .

The results are consistent with the hypothesis that hospital consolidations are

uncorrelated with HMO demand and cost shifts. None of the coefficients on demand and

cost variables were significant at traditional levels of confidence. That is, MergerHHI jt is



                                             18
uncorrelated with the observable measures of demand and costs. This provides some

indirect evidence that MergerHHI jt is exogenous.

       In addition, we estimated the coefficients in (15) including leading and lagged

values of MergerHHI jt to test whether there are premium shocks that are autocorrelated

with MergerHHI jt but are unrelated to hospital merger activity. In all specifications the

coefficients on the leading and lagged values of MergerHHI jt are insignificant. This

suggests that any endogeneity that would confound our findings must be

contemporaneous with the merger activity and that strikes us as unlikely.

       Likewise in the insurance take-up analysis, identification of the impact of hospital

mergers comes from within-MSA variation in hospital merger activity. While we control

for time-invariant, unobserved differences across MSAs and we include a rich set of

demographic and geographic controls, it is nevertheless reasonable to ask

if MergerHHI mt is correlated with shocks to health insurance status. For example, a

possible source of endogeneity is that markets that experience other disruptions that

affect insurance status also experience more merger activity.

       While such endogeneity is plausible, we found little indirect evidence for it. For

example, observable demand proxies do not appear to be correlated with MergerHHI mt .

Town, et al. (2005) found little correlation between the level of hospital merger activity

and any inpatient demand variable. Interestingly, the level of merger activity is uniformly

distributed across the major geographic regions. Importantly, they did not find an

association between HMO penetration and hospital merger activity.




                                            19
         As in the premium analysis, we can test for the presence of factors that are

autocorrelated with MSA merger activity by adding leads and lags of MergerHHI mt to the

regression. 13 As long as these unobservable shocks are not coincident with MergerHHI mt ,

a prospect we believe is unlikely, the indirect tests of exogeneity of MergerHHI mt are

consistent with that hypothesis.

         Finally, our theory predicts that hospital merger activity should impact

unconcentrated HMO markets more than concentrated ones, and part of our identification

strategy is to compare the impact of hospital mergers in concentrated HMO markets with

unconcentrated markets. For endogeneity to impact our conclusions the error terms in the

analysis would have to be correlated with MergerHHI mt only in some markets but not in

other markets.

         Given that we believe that MergerHHI mt is exogenous in our analysis, it is an open

question of why some areas experienced significantly more hospital merger activity than

other areas. The literature has found that the role and influence of business consultants,

which differ significantly across hospitals, is associated with consolidation strategies

(APM/University Health System Consortium (1995); Burns and Pauly (2002); Bazzoli,

LoSasso, Arnould, and Shalowitz (2002); Burns, L.R., Bazzoli, G.J., Dynan, L. and

Wholey, D.R. (1997)). If the use of consultants is driven by management styles and those

styles are unrelated to other supply or demand shocks, it provides an account of the

variation in merger activity that is exogenous in our empirical specifications.


13
  One possibility is that a decline in the percentage of the population that has private health insurance leads
to a decline in hospital demand and that provides an incentive for future hospital mergers in response to the
decline in demand. From conception to completion, hospital mergers take a significant amount of time (a
minimum of 2 years), thus unless hospitals can forecast these demand declines and organize a consolidation
response to them, hospital consolidation would occur in response to a contemporaneous shift in demand.


                                                     20
V. Data

        Our data come from three primary sources: The American Hospital Association

(AHA) Annual Survey, InterStudy, and the Current Population Survey. These data are

supplemented with information on location characteristics that are available from the

Census Bureau and the Area Resource File.

A. American Hospital Association Data

         The AHA collects information on location, characteristics and ownership of over

95% of hospitals with 300 or more beds. We use annual data from 1990 to 2003, from

which we define a sample of private (i.e. non-government), short-term, acute care,

general medical and/or surgical hospitals. Psychiatric and rehabilitation hospitals are

excluded from the analysis. Of particular interest is the AHA’s list of hospital mergers

which we use, along with the information on system change, to formulate our measures

of ownership structure. The AHA tracks hospital system affiliation and records

consolidation between hospitals if one hospital joins the system in which the other

hospital is a member. A consolidation can also occur if a hospital is deleted from the

AHA data and is listed as merging with another hospital. We use a “corrected” AHA

system ID constructed by Kristin Madison which has been updated by researchers at

Carnegie Mellon University. 14

B. InterStudy Data

        The population of HMOs is specified using data from the InterStudy Census

(InterStudy, 1985-1987; InterStudy, 1988-2001) and the Group Health Association of


14

(2004) for more information on this data.


                                                21
America (GHAA) HMO Directories. InterStudy and GHAA also are the sources for HMO

location, founding year, model type, not-for-profit status, federal qualification, national

affiliation, counties where the HMO operates, and enrollment information. The financial

data used to measure commercial premiums come from annual reports filed with state

regulators that have been collected by different organizations.

       Into the HMO data we merged county-level market measures from the Area

Resource File (ARF) compiled by the Bureau of Health Professions of the U.S.

Department of Health and Human Services. State-level wage data came from the Bureau

of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor. We obtained these reports and

surveys and linked them together. The method of aggregating data to the HMO level is

described in Town, Wholey and Feldman (2004).

       Premiums are calculated as total premium revenue divided by total member

months for commercial products. The market boundaries used to calculate

MergerHHI jt are Health Services Areas (HSAs) (Makuc et al., 1991). A HSA is defined

as one or more counties that are relatively self-contained with respect to the provision of

routine hospital care. We then formulate the HMO level value of MergerHHI jt for each

HMO in each period by taking a weighted average of the estimated HMO enrollment (as

defined below) over the HSAs where it operates.

       In the HMO premium regressions we include a broad set of variables formulated

from the InterStudy/GHAA/ARF data. These variables control for HMO and market-

level characteristics that may be correlated with premiums and MergerHHI jt . The list of

control variables is provided in Table A1.




                                             22
        Table 1 presents summary statistics for many of the variables used in the premium

analysis. Premiums rose modestly over the decade from an average $123 per member per

month in 1990 to $145 in 2000. Concordantly, the MergerHHI jt rose substantially from

.1686 in 1990 to .1886 in 2000, while there was little net change in average number of

HMO competitors. 15 There was also a significant change in the distribution of HMO

organizational forms over the decade. Network HMOs, Independent Practice

Organizations (IPAs) and group HMOs declined, while “Mixed” forms increased

substantially. 16 There was also a decrease in the percentage of not-for-profit HMOs from

70% in 1990 to 66% in 2000. 17 The percentage of enrollees from the Medicare and

Medicaid programs grew substantially over the decade. By 2000, on average, they

accounted for 6.7 and 9.6 percent of HMO enrollees, respectively. 18

C. Current Population Survey Data

        To study the impact of hospital mergers on insurance take-up, we analyze data

from the March Supplement of the CPS from 1990 to 2003. The CPS is a large,

nationally representative survey of households. We limit our analysis to civilian adults

between the ages of 22 and 62 because the inclusion of the younger population introduces

the possibility that the Medicaid expansions may confound our estimates. 19 The CPS

provides information on whether an individual had health insurance from any source,

whether an individual had health insurance from a non-government source, age, race,


15
   Over this period there was significant HMO entry. However, HMO consolidation apparently had an off-
setting impact on HMO concentration.
16
   These shifts suggest that premium trends may be associated with the organizational forms. In the analysis
of HMO premiums we control for this possibility using organizational form-specific time trends as well as
for-profit status time trends.
17
   Town, Wholey and Feldman (2004) find that HMO for-profit status conversions had little effect on
premiums.
18
   We do not have data for the number of Medicare and Medicaid enrollees by HMO for 1990.
19
   Of course, many adults in our sample may qualify for Medicaid coverage.


                                                    23
ethnicity, education, family size, household income, employment status, and the

employer size.

         In 2000, the Census Bureau implemented significant changes in the CPS. The

most important for our purposes is a change in the health insurance questions. Prior to

2000, the Census Bureau used a “residual” approach to classify health insurance coverage

(Davern et al., 2003). The surveyors asked several yes/no questions about the types of

health insurance coverage held by the respondent. If the respondent answered “no” to all

the questions they were assumed not to have health insurance. In 2000, the survey was

modified to verify whether the person who answered “no” to all questions, in fact, did not

have health insurance. Approximately 8.1 percent of the 2001 respondents who did not

answer “yes” to the standard health insurance questions reported actually being insured

when asked. We recoded the 2000-2003 data so that it is consistent with earlier surveys. 20

         We treat the relevant market for hospital services as the Metropolitan Statistical

Area (MSA) because this is the smallest geographic unit in the CPS that we can merge

with the hospital consolidation data. We used the MSA code to match the individual

information to information on hospital and MergerHHI mt from the AHA and InterStudy

data. All AHA and InterStudy data are aggregated to the MSA level.

         The MSA is not the ideal geographic market definition for the CPS analysis

because the geo-political boundaries of MSAs are not necessarily related to hospital

market boundaries. To address this problem we limit our sample to MSAs between

100,000 and 4,500,000 in 1990 population. The lower bound on the size of the MSA was

chosen because small MSAs may be too narrow to define hospital markets. Practically

20
  This correction affects the magnitudes and precision of our estimates but not the qualitative conclusions.
See www.shadac.org for an algorithm to implement this correction.


                                                     24
speaking, we also found few CPS observations from MSAs less than 100,000 in

population. An upper bound was selected because in large cities the MSA likely

overstates the boundary of the hospital market potentially introducing significant

measurement error in MergerHHI mt . 21 Observations that were not in an MSA were not

used to estimate the coefficients but are used in assessing the impact of hospital mergers

on welfare.

           Instead of treating MSAs as markets, we would like to define the geographic

market boundaries using patient hospital choice information as in Kessler and McClellan

(2000). However, that exercise would require more detailed information on the location

of a household than is available in the CPS. Kessler and McClellan (2000) compared

their data-driven Herfindahl measures to Herfindahl indexes derived using a fixed circle

about the hospital to define markets and found conclusions regarding the impact of

competition were sensitive to how the concentration measures were formed. Because our

market definition is significantly different from the definition Kessler and McClellan

used to formulate their comparison HHI measure, the specific implication of their

findings for our results is unclear. But, we have attempted to assess the impact of

measurement error by estimating a model interacting MergerHHI mt with market size. The

idea is that if there is measurement error it is likely correlated with market size. Our

conclusions are robust to this specification. Nevertheless, the Kessler and McClellan

research results point out a limitation of our work – the possibility of measurement error

in market boundaries that translates into measurement error in the calculation

MergerHHI mt over time.


21
     Again, our results are robust to a number of different thresholds and the exclusion of any thresholds.


                                                        25
       A list of control variables used in the analysis of insurance take-up is provided in

Table A1. Table 2 presents summary statistics of the CPS sample. The percentage of

individuals with private health insurance declined by two percentage points over the

decade and the percentage of individuals with any health insurance declined by three

percentage points. As in the HMO data, hospital concentration increased substantially

due to mergers. Over the decade the average MergerHHI mt increased to .2783 from an

initial level of .1909. Except for Hispanic status (which increased 10 percentage points),

most of the demographic variables were relatively constant over the sample period.



VI. Results

A. Impact of Hospital Mergers on HMO Premiums

       Table 3 presents the fixed-effects regression coefficients of the logarithm of

average HMO premiums on the logarithms of average MergerHHI jt and the average

number of HMOs. In the full sample, the coefficients on both MergerHHI jt and

logarithm of NHMO are small and not significantly different from zero at traditional

levels of confidence.

       The second column of Table 3 presents the estimates from the sample of HMOs

whose average NHMO is greater than or equal to ten. The coefficient on MergerHHI jt is

positive and significant (t-statistic = 2.83). For the other two HMO samples the estimated

coefficients on MergerHHI jt are small in magnitude and insignificant at traditional levels

of confidence. These results suggest that in less competitive HMO markets hospital

mergers redistribute market power rents between hospitals and HMOs and may not have

any impact of social welfare.


                                            26
       For HMOs that, on average, appear to face substantial competition, the coefficient

estimates imply an HMO premium elasticity of MergerHHI mt of .085. This estimate

implies that an increase in the average MergerHHI mt from .20 to .28 (this is the “standard

hospital merger” in Gaynor and Vogt (2000)) will increase average premiums by

approximately 2.9%. We can translate this premium increase into an implied increase in

the price of inpatient care. Hospital expenditures comprise about 30% of HMO

expenditures and if we assume a fixed-proportions technology and a 100% premium

pass-through, our estimate suggests that an increase in the average MergerHHI mt from .20

to .28 raised the average price of inpatient hospital services by approximately 10%. This

estimate is in the heart of the distribution of estimated price increases from the literature

on hospital competition discussed in Section II.

B. Impact of Hospital Mergers on Health Insurance Consumers

       If hospital mergers raise the price of inpatient care, then they should affect the

quantity of health insurance consumed by consumers. We explore that possibility in this

section. As discussed above, we divide the merged CPS data into samples roughly

corresponding to thirds of the population-weighted, 1995 number of HMOs in an MSA.

Again, those samples are zero to six, seven to nine, and ten or greater HMOs.

       Table 4 presents fixed-effects estimates of the likelihood of civilian adults having

private health insurance by degree of HMO competition. The first column of Table 4

presents the results from the entire sample. The coefficient of MergerHHI mt is negative,

small in magnitude and insignificant and the coefficient of the logarithm of the number of

HMOs is positive but not significant at traditional levels of confidence.




                                             27
       Column (2) of Table 4 presents the estimate of the impact of hospital mergers on

the probability of having private health insurance for adults living in MSAs in the most

competitive HMO markets. The coefficient of MergerHHI mt is negative, large in

magnitude and significant at the 5% level of confidence (absolute value of t-statistic =

3.27). That is, hospital mergers in these MSAs are estimated to reduce the amount of

health insurance purchased from private sources. The coefficient estimates imply that a

hospital merger that an increase in MergerHHI mt from .20 to .28 reduces the likelihood of

having private insurance by .013. Using the estimates of the premium impacts from

hospital mergers presented above in combination with these estimates implies a private

insurance semi-elasticity (                           ) of -.45, which is in the middle of the
                                  %Δ Premium

range of estimates from the literature. For example, at the high end of the spectrum

Gruber and Poterba (1994) estimate a semi-elasticity of demand for health insurance for

the self-employed of -1.8. At the low end Chernew, Cutler and Keenan (2005) estimate

the insurance semi-elasticity for private insurance to be -.10.

       Table 5 presents the fixed-effects estimates of the likelihood of civilian adults

having health insurance from any source by the degree of HMO competition. The

patterns of coefficient estimates are similar to those presented in Table 4. In column (2)

of Table 5 the coefficient of MergerHHI mt for MSAs with ten or more HMOs in 1995 is -

.15 and is precisely estimated (absolute value of t-statistic = 2.54). Interestingly, this

coefficient is similar to the corresponding coefficient in Table 4. This result, along with

the results in Table 4, suggests that the vast majority individuals who drop private




                                               28
insurance because of a premium increase become uninsured. The coefficient estimates of

MergerHHI mt for the other MSA samples are small and insignificant.

       The results of Table 3, 4 and 5 suggest that hospital mergers lead to increases in

health insurance premiums in competitive HMO markets, and the increases in HMO

premiums lead to a decline in private health insurance take-up and an increase in the

uninsurance rate. If hospital mergers cause health insurance premiums to increase, for a

number of reasons we should expect poorer individuals to be more sensitive to premium

increases and thus more affected by hospital mergers in competitive HMO markets. To

test this hypothesis, we formulate two samples from the CPS based on household income

and estimate the impact of hospital mergers on the likelihood that those living in MSAs

with competitive HMO markets possess private health insurance or any health insurance

at all. The first group comprises individuals with household income under $60,000, and

the second group is individuals with household income above $60,000.

       Table 6 presents the results of this exercise. The coefficient estimates indicate that

hospital mergers reduced the likelihood of acquiring private insurance for the low-income

group. In column (1), the coefficient on MergerHHI mt is -.22 and significant at the 5%

level. For the upper-income sample (column (2)) hospital mergers did not significantly

affect the likelihood of private insurance take-up. This pattern also holds when the

dependent variable is the presence of any insurance. The coefficient on MergerHHI mt is -

.20 and the absolute value of the t-statistic is 2.53. The results in Table 6 are consistent

with hospital mergers leading to higher health insurance premiums in unconcentrated

HMO markets, with the impact of the premium increases on insurance take-up limited to

the poorer half of the income distribution.



                                              29
C. Robustness

         Table 7 presents the most important of many robustness checks we performed on

these analyses. The most obvious concern is that MergerHHI mt is endogenous. That is,

unobserved shocks to insurance may drive hospital mergers. To test this possibility we

included two-year leads and lags of MergerHHI mt as additional right-hand side variables.

The logic underlying this test is that unobserved trends in insurance may be correlated

with hospital mergers but this correlation is unlikely to be contemporaneous. So

if MergerHHI mt is endogenous, a marker would be correlation between the leading or

lagged values and insurance take-up. In addition, if hospital consolidation ultimately

leads to efficiencies that are passed on in the form of lower prices but those efficiencies

take some time to realize then coefficients of the lagged values of MergerHHI mt should

be positive.

        The first column in Table 7 presents the results with inclusion of the two-year

leading and lagged values of MergerHHI mt . In this specification, MergerHHI mt is

negative and significant at the 1% level while the coefficients of both the lead and lag

values MergerHHI mt are small in magnitude and insignificant. 22 These results suggest that

endogeneity is not an issue. Furthermore, the results do not indicate that hospitals are able

to achieve efficiencies through merger over time and pass them on to consumers in the

form of lower health insurance premiums.




22
 In a regression of health insurance status on contemporaneous, one and two-year lagged values of
MergerHHI mt , the coefficients on the lagged values of MergerHHI mt are small and insignificant while the
coefficient on contemporaneous MergerHHI mt is large. This suggests that our results are robust to potential
measurement differences in the reported time of insurance status and hospital consolidation.


                                                    30
       Columns (2) – (5) of Table 7 present the results using different HMO

concentration cut-off values to define the most competitive HMO markets. Consistent

with our theory, the coefficient on MergerHHI mt declines as the threshold on the number

of HMOs decreases. Above eight HMOs the coefficient becomes insignificant in the

private health insurance take-up regression, while the coefficient becomes insignificant

above nine HMOs in the regression for any health insurance.

       We re-estimated the coefficients on the sample that excluded the years 1990-

1992, 1994-1996, and 1998-2000. The coefficient estimates and standard errors were not

meaningfully different than those presented in Tables 3 and 4. We also dropped MSAs

with very large and very small changes in the private health insurance rate to see if our

estimates are sensitive to outliers. Again, the coefficients and standard error estimates

from this analysis are in line with results present above.

       We estimated the model using different definitions of the hospital organizational

boundary. Specifically, we define an organization as one that generates one financial

report in the AHA data. Dranove and Lindrooth (2004) found that hospital mergers where

the newly formed organization consolidated its financial reports generated significant

cost reductions. These results are reported in Table A2 in the Appendix. Consistent with

the results of Dranove and Lindrooth (2004), changes in hospital concentration using this

definition of the hospital organization did not impact health insurance take-up.

D. The Welfare Impact of Hospital Mergers 1990 -2003

       Table 8 shows the effect of an implied increase in HMO premiums due to hospital

consolidations from 1990 onwards. Premium increases as a consequence of hospital

consolidation were very modest until the late 1990s but by 2001, the last year for which



                                             31
we have premium data, our estimates imply that HMO premiums were 3.2% higher than

they would have been absent horizontal hospital consolidation.

        Table 9 examines the impact of hospital consolidation on health insurance take-up

rates. By the late 1990s, hospital mergers had a modest but non-trivial impact on health

insurance take-up. In 2003, the rate of private insurance is estimated to be .0046 lower

because of hospital consolidation, while the uninsurance rate is estimated to be .0043

higher. This translates into approximately 695,000 (.5%) fewer covered lives in private

health insurance with most of these (650,000) joining the ranks of the uninsured. Over the

entire 14 years of our sample, we estimate that private insurance decreased by 5.9 million

covered life-years and uninsurance increased by 5.5 million covered life-years.

        Using the estimates from Tables 8 and 9 we can calculate rough, back-of-the-

envelope estimates of the welfare loss (and the decomposition of that loss) from hospital

consolidations during our study time period. We estimate the change in consumer surplus

and the dead weight loss in the simplest possible way – we assume a linear demand

function and constant marginal cost. There are numerous limitations associated with this

exercise. We do not account for heterogeneity in preferences and in health insurance plan

structures. We also assume that the premium increases due to hospital mergers we

estimate for HMOs apply to all forms of private health insurance. We do not account for

the possibility that hospital mergers may result in efficiencies that can increase hospital

profits. 23 We also are not taking into account the impact of hospital mergers on the use of

inpatient services by either the insured or uninsured or the structure of insurers hospital




23
   Dranove and Lindrooth (2004) estimate that hospital mergers in which the hospitals consolidate their
financial statements result in cost reductions of approximately 14%.


                                                    32
networks. 24 Finally, we consider only the net decline in insurance coverage – those

people who lost private coverage but gained public coverage are not considered to have

lost any consumer surplus.

         Table 10 presents these calculations. Recall that our sample is civilian adults

between ages 22 and 62. By 2001, hospital consolidations reduced consumer surplus for

this sample by $7.4 billion (about 2.8% of total private insurance revenues) or $49.82 per

capita. From 1990 to 2001, total consumer surplus was reduced by $42.2 billion. Total

welfare loss was quite modest, however. By 2001, net welfare loss from horizontal

hospital consolidations was a mere $19.7 million and the total net welfare loss from 1990

to 2001 was $95.7 million. That is, it appears that the primary impact of hospital mergers

was to transfer consumer surplus to hospitals.



VII. Conclusion

         The hospital industry enjoyed reduced antitrust scrutiny while it consolidated in

the 1990s. Our work suggests that hospital consolidation resulted in non-trivial

consequences for health insurance consumers. Hospital consolidation caused private

insurance rolls to decrease and the number of US residents without health insurance to

increase. Thus, if the goal of antitrust policy is to prevent consolidations that reduce

consumer surplus independent of the impact on profits, then during the 1990s the courts’

rulings on hospital mergers ran counter to this goal. Currently, the Federal Trade

24
   It is possible that insurers react to increased hospital prices by increasing inpatient co-pays and that, in
turn, would impact enrollee welfare. We are not in possession of the data to explore this possibility.
However, our results suggest that the majority of the changes in hospital prices are passed along in the form
of premium increases in competitive HMO markets. Ho (2006) has analyzed the impact of restricted
hospital network choice on health insurance beneficiaries and finds that selective contracting leads to $1
billion in societal welfare loss across 43 metropolitan areas. Estimating the impact of hospital mergers on
HMO network structure is a formidable task and beyond the scope of this paper. Ho (2005) has made some
progress on this problem.

Commission is reviewing and in some cases challenging consummated hospital

consolidations. Our work suggests that such challenges may be justified. However, if the

purpose of antitrust policy is to prohibit only those mergers that reduce total welfare, a

view with which many economists concur, then our results suggest that the courts were

correct in their assessment of the impact of hospital mergers. There was very little

welfare loss from hospital consolidations during the 1990s.

       Our work also makes a modest contribution to merger analysis when the merging

firms are upstream from the final product. The important point we make there is that the

impact of an upstream merger on the final consumers is a function of the downstream

market structure.
