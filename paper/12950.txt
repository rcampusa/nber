         This paper shows that the result of Ju and Krishna (2002, 2005), i.e., the non-monotonicity

      in the comparative statics across regimes, disappears, if exporters di¤er in their productivities,

      which provides very di¤erent predictions about the results of policy changes.

1    Introduction

Trade and domestic policies are often conditional: certain conditions must be met to obtain certain

bene…ts. Content protection schemes in developing countries are one example. They require …rms

in an industry to use at least some level of domestic inputs. Free Trade Area preferences for

members are another example. Producers in the FTA become eligible for zero tari¤s on their

exports to a partner if the product meets Rules of Origin (ROOs) or special constraints that must

be met in order to obtain origin. Otherwise, they pay the going tari¤. Our paper argues that …rm

homogeneity plays a key role in the analyses of such policies. By using a particular policy, the level

of ROOs in the FTA, for illustrative purposes, we show that a key result of these analyses vanishes

when …rm heterogeneity is allowed. This provides a cautionary note in interpreting such results.

      Ju and Krishna (2002, 2005) show that even when …rms are homogeneous, assuming they all

make the same choices is not correct. Ex ante identical …rms can behave di¤erently in equilibrium

if they are indi¤erent between their alternatives. They show that there are two possible regimes:

in the homogeneous regime all …rms choose the unique most pro…table option. In their example,

content protection requires greater use (than dictated by cost minimization considerations alone)

of the domestic input, labor. When all …rms want to meet this requirement, a stricter restriction

shifts the demand for labor, raising its price. In the other regime, the heterogeneous one, some

…rms choose one option while others choose the other. Indi¤erence between these options must be

maintained as the restriction becomes stricter. At given wages, stricter ROOs make pro…ts from

meeting the requirement fall below those from not doing so. To keep pro…ts equal, input prices must

fall! As a result, the comparative statics for input prices, and through them for other variables, are

exact opposites in the two regimes. Previous work, they argued, was thus incomplete, as it only

dealt with the homogeneous regime, and misleading, as it had very di¤erent comparative statics

properties from the heterogeneous one.

      In this paper, we show that this is not the entire story either. Introducing di¤erences in …rm

productivity, which is also more consistent with the empirical evidence1 , leads to another margin

of adjustment, namely, the identity of the marginal …rm, eliminating the non-monotonicity in the

comparative statics which is the key result in Ju and Krishna (2002, 2005). In fact, the comparative

statics properties are always like those associated with Ju and Krishna’s heterogeneous regime

rather than those of the standard homogeneous regime! In the presence of …rm heterogeneity,

stricter requirements change the composition of …rms. These changes produce the same monotonic

adjustments in endogenous variables in both regimes.

          We model ROOs similarly to Demidova, Kee and Krishna (2006), allowing ROOs to a¤ect both

the …xed and marginal costs of exporting and introduce …rm heterogeneity as in Melitz (2003).



2          The Model

Consider a small country with L consumers, each of which supplies one unit of labor. Preferences

over a continuum of domestically produced goods indexed by v and imported good z are given by


                                                          Z              1=
                                            U=      z +        q(v) dv        ; 0<   < 1;
                                                          v2



                                                                                                                      1
where              is the set of available domestic varieties; q(v) is the consumption of variety v; and      =   1

is the elasticity of substitution between varieties. The demand functions are q (v) = RP                    1 p (v)


and z = RP                 1p        ; where R is the aggregate expenditure, and P is the price index, P 1            =
                                z

               R
p1z        +       v2   p(v)1       dv: We normalize the price of the imported variety pz to 1.

          There is a continuum of monopolistically competitive heterogenous …rms of a …xed mass M .2

                                                                                                 1
The productivity distribution is Pareto with cumulative function G (') = 1                       '    ;   > : A …rm

with productivity level ' has                 '   per-unit labor requirement.

          The …rm may also choose to export. The foreign demand3 for domestic variety v is Bpx (v)                        ,

i.e., we are dealing with a small open economy that has no impact on the rest of the world. Each

exporter pays a per-unit tari¤                    > 1 and a …xed cost fx . In addition, it can pay a documentation

…xed cost d and invoke the preferences it has been given. However, to access these preferences, it

has to meet some ROOs; which allow the …rm to escape paying                          < 1 share of tari¤ ; but involve

      2
     We assume that M is …xed to follow the assumptions in Ju and Krishna (2002, 2005) as closely as possible since
their analysis deals with the medium run, where …rms can choose what to do but where their mass is given.

     Note that we model the foreign demand for domestic variety similarly to Demidova and Rodriguez-Clare (2006).


                                                                  3
an additional per-unit cost                > 1; since now the product has to satisfy origin requirements. The

cost functions4 of producing q units for domestic and foreign markets are, respectively,


                             w                w                                                        w ( )
          Cd ('; q) =          q, Cx ('; q) =   q + wfx ;                        Cx;ROO ('; q) =             q + wfx + wd;
                             '                '                                                          '

where w is the wage. As a result, the prices set in each case are, respectively, pd (') =                                                ';

px (') =    ';    and px;ROO (') =                ' :       For simplicity we assume there are no …xed costs of producing

for the domestic market. Thus, all …rms in the economy use this option. Moreover, the revenues

Only …rms with ' > 'x export, and …rms with ' > 'x;ROO invoke ROOs while exporting. Note

     The subscript denotes the option used by a …rm, i.e., "d" denotes domestic production, "x" denotes exporting
without ROOs, and "x,ROO" denotes exporting with ROOs:
   5
     An Appendix with detailed proofs and derivations is available upon request.
   6
     Similarly, we can de…ne rx;r (') = rx;ROO (') rx (') as additional revenues from invoking ROOs:




                                                                         4
that if      > 1; then no …rm will invoke ROOs: We assume that                                < 1: From (1) and (2),


                                                                                                              1
                                                                             d            1                       1
                            'x;ROO = AROO 'x ; where AROO                                                             ;                    (3)
                                                                             fx (    )1               1


i.e., if AROO > 1, 'x;ROO > 'x . Thus, we need to consider two cases. First, if ROOs are relatively

strict and documentation costs are large, then AROO > 1 and only the most productive exporters

meet ROOs. This is analogous to the heterogenous regime in Ju and Krishna (2002, 2005), where

the restriction is strict enough so that …rms are not strictly better o¤ meeting it. Second, if ROOs

are lax and documentation costs are small, then AROO                          1 and all exporting …rms meet ROOs.

This is analogous to the homogeneous regime in Ju and Krishna (2002, 2005).

      The Heterogenous Regime. If AROO > 1; then 'x;ROO > 'x ; i.e., only some share of

exporters invoke ROOs: As depicted in Figure 1(a), the pro…ts of exporters are linear in '                                                  1:


Moreover, the line corresponding to                    x (')    is ‡atter than the line corresponding to                          x;ROO   ('),

since      < 1; and has a higher intercept. The intersection of these lines gives the productivity cuto¤

'x;ROO ; so that …rms with ' > 'x;ROO export with invoking ROOs and getting tari¤ preferences

as additional pro…ts from doing so cover the documentation cost d. Firms with ' 2 ['x ; 'x;ROO )

export without meeting ROOs; while …rms with ' < 'x do not export at all. Aggregate income in

the economy is given by the sum of wages and rents7 : R = wL +                                d   +       x   +       x;r ;   where

   The only variable in (7) is 'x;ROO : Stricter ROOs increase AROO ; which raises the right hand

side of (7), and as a result, 'x;ROO must rise. Thus, stricter ROOs raise 'x;ROO :


Proposition 1 When not all …rms export by invoking preferences, stricter ROOs reduce the wage

     while reducing the export cuto¤ and raising the cuto¤ for those invoking ROOs:


   The intuition behind these results is the following. First, assume that wage does not change as

ROOs become stricter. Then, the pro…ts of exporters, who do not invoke ROOs; remain unchanged.

But the productivity cuto¤ of exporters who meet ROOs rises, while their mass falls. Thus, the

aggregate pro…ts from exporting,   x+    x;r ;   as well as consumers’income, fall, reducing the demand


                                                        7
for each domestic variety and the demand for labor. The equilibrium in the labor market cannot

be restored through the exit of …rms, thus, wage must fall, making exporting without ROOs more

attractive so that the productivity cuto¤ for exporters 'x falls.

     The Homogeneous Regime. The analysis is very similar to that above. When AROOs                                                    1,

all exporters invoke ROOs: As depicted in Figure 1(b), the intersection of two lines lies below the

horizontal axis. Thus, there is only one productivity cuto¤ in the equilibrium, 'x;ROO ; de…ned as

     Thus, if ROOs become stricter, i.e., if d; ; or                   rises, then w must fall. Moreover, from (9),

(fx + d) 'x;ROO            must fall, i.e., 'x;ROO must rise. The intuition in this case is the same as

before: at a given w, stricter ROOs raise the productivity cuto¤ of exporters all of whom invoke

ROOs; reducing their number, aggregate income and the labor demand, so that wage has to fall.

     Finally, note that whether or not all exporters meet ROOs; stricter ROOs always reduce wages

and raise the productivity of those who meet ROOs. Thus, even in the “homogeneous case”changes

in the extensive margin prevent wages from rising in response to stricter ROOs:

3    Conclusion

What should we take away from this simple exercise? We see our results as not being merely a

comment on the generality of an existing paper but as having a broader message. If, as seems empir-

ically indisputable, …rms di¤er in their productivities, making the traditional assumption that …rms

are identical and behave identically will give the opposite result from allowing for heterogeneity.

Why? Because the adjustment on the extensive margin is large and overwhelms the response on the

intensive margin. As ROOs become tighter, …rms that continue to meet ROOs demand more labor,

raising wages. This e¤ect operates via the intensive margin. But …rms who stop meeting ROOs

demand less labor, pushing wages down. This extensive margin adjustment dominates! Models

which only allow for the intensive margin to operate may, thus, give very misleading results.
