                                         ABSTRACT

This project studies the impact of education mismatch on labor outcomes. Across our sample of
OECD countries, there is evidence of mismatch in education choices and labor markets. Labor
market outcomes are not independent of education mismatch. Our framework for analysis is a
dynamic choice model, focusing on decisions on education and training. From the estimation of
model parameters, the main factor explaining education mismatch is a shock to the perceived
value of education. In Germany, imperfect information about ability at the time of the education
decision creates mismatch as well. From simulations of lifecycle dynamics and counterfactual
experiments, among four key countries, education undermatch in Japan is sustained through labor
market mechanisms while in Germany, Italy and the US, education undermatch is resolved.
Training plays a key role in these dynamics.

          This project studies the impact of education mismatch on labor outcomes. Across our sample of
      OECD countries, there is evidence of mismatch in education choices and labor markets. Labor market
      outcomes are not independent of education mismatch. Our framework for analysis is a dynamic choice
      model, focusing on decisions on education and training. From the estimation of model parameters, the
      main factor explaining education mismatch is a shock to the perceived value of education. In Germany,
      imperfect information about ability at the time of the education decision creates mismatch as well. From
      simulations of lifecycle dynamics and counterfactual experiments, among four key countries, education
      undermatch in Japan is sustained through labor market mechanisms while in Germany, Italy and the
      US, education undermatch is resolved. Training plays a key role in these dynamics.



1     Motivation
Productive efficiency requires the matching of high ability individuals to appropriate education levels and
eventually to jobs commensurate with their ability and training. Inefficiencies can arise in the form of
education mismatch, job mismatch or both. The output loss from mismatch can be substantial. Mitigating
mismatch has been a policy goal for individual countries and international organizations, such as the OECD
and the International Labor Organization.1 Absent an understanding of the sources of mismatch and their
interaction, designing policy remedies is quite difficult. While there is a large and insightful literature on
education and job mismatch in isolation, the point of this paper is to study their joint determination with
a particular emphasis on isolating the effects of education mismatch on labor market outcomes.
    Throughout, education mismatch refers to the lack of assortative matching between education and ability:
that is, it occurs when high ability agents are not always the most educated while some low ability agents
have high educational attainment. Imperfect capital markets, different tastes for education and information
frictions about education opportunities and individuals' ability are possible sources of (measured) education
mismatch. Job (labor market) mismatch refers to the efficiency loss relative to assortative matching be-
tween skills and types of occupation. It can arise from frictions in labor market reallocation like imperfect
information, discrimination, training decisions and labor market regulations.

    Earlier work, such as Pellizzari and Fichen (2013), McGowan and Andrews (2015), Dillon and Smith
(2017) and Cooper and Liu (2019), study these forms of mismatch in isolation. Education mismatch might
imply labor market misallocations since the information value of a degree could be reduced and distorted.
In this sense, education mismatch can create further information frictions in the allocation of individuals
to jobs. The causality could run the other way. The extent to which the labor market is able to efficiently
allocate skills into occupations, for example, affects the return to the acquisition of those skills through
education. Thus, labor market mismatch might impact education decisions.
    Our main goal is to evaluate the extent that labor market institutions offset or perpetuate education
mismatch. Focusing specifically on those undermatched in education, what are their labor market outcomes?
We find that indeed labor market institutions do overcome this mismatch in Germany, Italy and the US.
This is not the case in Japan. The mechanism for these labor market transitions, highlighted by the paper,
is informal training.
    The first part of the paper, Section 2, provides evidence of both forms of mismatch using data from the
OECD Program of International Assessment of Adult Competences (hereafter PIAAC). Individuals' jobs are
divided into two categories: (i) skilled and (ii) unskilled occupations. For educational attainment, we define
a dichotomous variable indicating two levels: (i) below college and (ii) college and above. PIAAC scores are
used as noisy measures of ability.
    The distributions of PIAAC scores conditional on educational attainment overlap: there are individuals
with a low level of education but a higher PIAAC score than those with high education. A similar pattern
is observed for the distributions conditional on types of occupation: there are individuals in an unskilled
occupation but with a higher PIAAC score than those with a skilled one. Our methodology for characterizing
labor market mismatch is not a statement about job satisfaction but rather the assignment of workers to
skilled jobs based upon their ability.2
    Our initial empirical analysis brings together evidence on the labor market implications of education
outcomes. A first exercise adds the measures of education mismatch to standard Mincer wage regressions,
building on Hanushek, Schwerdt, Wiederhold, and Woessmann (2015). Pooled regressions find positive and
significant wage coefficients for individuals undermatched in education and negative for those who were
overmatched in education. This means that an individual overmatched (undermatched) in education have
a lower (higher) return to education. But at the individual country level these effects are not statistically
significant though our dynamic simulations uncover these differences in compensation, particularly for the
education undermatched group.
    A second exercise looks at job flows, drawing upon the PIAAC data, to analyze the effect of educa-
tion mismatch on job assignment in early employment. In our pooled sample, around 39% (37%) of the
individuals that were overmatched (undermatched) in education, are also overmatched (undermatched) in
the job. Similarly, around 39% (33%) of the individuals undermatched (overmatched) in the job, were also
undermatched (overmatched) in education. This is part of the evidence that labor market outcomes are
impacted by education mismatch.
    The last section of the empirical analysis studies assignment to informal training for early workers.3
Offering training to high-ability individuals, initially undermatched in education, would allow them to acquire
the necessary skills and then efficiently use them in the labor market. The key issue is selection into training.
We find that the type of occupation in early employment is an important determinant in the assignment
  2 Similarities and differences with the approach of McGowan and Andrews (2015) are discussed below.
  3 We   discuss our measure of training in some detail below.




                                                            2
                                                                                                        1   MOTIVATION


to informal training, with college and specially our proxy for ability, playing a minor role. Specifically,
individuals with skilled jobs in our sample in early employment are more likely to receive informal training
than individuals with unskilled jobs.
    To understand the sources of education and job mismatch, their interaction and dynamic implications, we
construct a model economy, presented in Section 3, combining heterogeneous individuals, differing in ability,
and jobs with different skill requirements. Individuals make education and labor market decisions. Education
choices are influenced by tastes for education, capital market frictions and the labor market institutions that
will ultimately determine the return to college. A strong negative taste for education may induce, for
example, high ability agents to choose not to go to college.4 This case would indicate mismatch but the
allocation may still be efficient, though not output maximizing. In a setting with imperfect capital markets,
relatively high ability agents may choose a low level of education simply because of a binding borrowing
constraint. So both variations in tastes and binding borrowing constraints can induce education mismatch.
As in Cooper and Liu (2019), there is another source of education mismatch in the model associated with
ability being measured instead of observed: individuals make education decisions based upon their true
ability but PIAAC score are imperfect signals of ability.
    The allocation of workers in the labor market is based, in part, on the education choice: educated workers
are more likely to be assigned to skilled jobs and workers with no education are more likely to be allocated
to unskilled jobs. However, the flows into skilled and unskilled jobs observed in the data indicate that
educational attainment is not the only factor determining job. Thus, the assignment of individuals to jobs
will be indirectly influenced also by individuals' ability. To do so, the model allows for informal training
during an early work phase of life. As with education, training increases individuals skills at the cost of
devoting less time to productive activities. Further, training and education will impact both productivity
and individuals job assignment in the late work phase of life.
    Country specific parameters of the model are estimated using simulated method of moments captur-
ing mismatch in both education and labor allocation and their interconnection. A main outcome of the
estimation, presented in Section 4, is a quantitative assessment of the sources of education mismatch and
the consequences for labor market outcomes. The analysis addresses these points through the choice of
appropriate moments and counterfactual exercises.
    From the estimation, a main cause of educational mismatch are taste shocks.5 For Germany, this is
supplemented with noise about ability at the time of the education decision, consistent with the discussion
of early sorting into education.6
    The estimated model is used in Section 6 to generate dynamics that are not directly seen in the PIAAC
data, as it is a single cross section. This allows us to determine, for example, the probability an agent is
mismatched in the job, both early and late, given, say, education undermatch. This is an important thought
experiment as it makes clear the extent to which labor market flows compensate for education mismatch.
    From the perspective of resolving education undermatch, there are marked differences across countries.
At one extreme is Japan where undermatch in education is sustained through job assignments and training.
Specifically, almost 80% of individuals undermatched in education are assigned low skilled jobs and none of
them choose to train. As a consequence they remain trapped in these jobs through their working lifetimes.
In contrast, in Germany, Italy and the US, the undermatched in education fare better, in part because they
   4 As developed below, there are a number of interpretations for this taste shock, both in terms of its representation in the

model and potential sources.
   5 This result differs from that of Cooper and Liu (2019). The source of these differences in results are discussed in detail

below.

are assigned a high skill job with higher probability than in Japan. Moreover, those assigned a low skill job
are very likely to train and are subsequently placed in a high skill job. In the US, for example, about 70%
of undermatched individuals are eventually placed in high skilled jobs. And, in these three countries, the
compensation to the undermatched in education is considerably higher than the average paid to the well
matched, in education, with no college.
    As for the education overmatched, in Italy almost none of these individuals remain in skilled jobs through
their working lives. In the US, more than 80% of overmatched in education individuals are assigned skilled
jobs late in their careers. This rate is slightly lower in Germany and Japan.
    The estimation is supplemented by a counterfactual exercise that considers alternative labor market
institutions. Specifically, we make two important modifications. First, all individuals with college are
assigned to skilled jobs and cannot be reassigned to unskilled ones. Second, non-college education individuals
are assigned to unskilled jobs and can only be reassigned to skilled jobs in late employment through training.
We find, as in the baseline analysis, that, for these alternative institutions, training continues to correct for
education undermatch in Germany, Italy and the US.
    A final discussion, Section 7, provides a country perspective. That is, instead of looking at the model
and its predictions from the viewpoint of sources and consequences of mismatch, the outcomes by country
are discussed. This facilitates an understanding of how education and labor market institutions that differ
across countries might impact mismatch.


Related Literature
This project is obviously related to the vast literature on the sources and consequences of education mismatch
and labor market misallocations: including Dillon and Smith (2017), Abbott, Gallipoli, Meghir, and Violante
(2019), McGowan and Andrews (2015), Pellizzari and Fichen (2013), Cooper and Liu (2019) and Garibaldi,
Gomes, and Sopraseuth (2020).
    We contribute to this literature in three important ways. First, our theoretical model allows both sources
of mismatch allowing us to evaluate the effects of education mismatch on labor market allocations. Studies
of education mismatch generally focus on its effects on the economy production capacity and ignore the
presence of other labor market frictions. At the same time, studies of labor market mismatch focus only on
frictions happening in the labor market and do not take into account distortions to the education choice.
Second, we add to the literature related to labor market inefficiencies from training decisions by evaluating
the role of training in overcoming education undermatch. Third, the use of PIAAC data, allows us to
conduct a cross-country comparison of the interconnection of both types of mismatch and discuss aspects of
institutional structures that underlie the observed relationship.
    Flinn and Mullins (2015) also look at the interaction of education choices and labor market outcomes.
Their emphasis is on the role of labor market frictions and worker bargaining power on education choices.
There is no education mismatch in their model. Our emphasis, in contrast, in on the effects of education
frictions, leading to mismatch, on labor market outcomes without the presence of additional labor market
frictions. From their analysis, it is clear how labor market frictions impact education rates without creating
education mismatch.
    Our paper also adds to the literature on the importance of pre-labor market conditions for lifetime
earnings. Huggett, Ventura, and Yaron (2011) find that, as of age 23, differences in ability to learn, human
capital, and wealth account for more of the variation in lifetime earnings, lifetime wealth, and lifetime utility
than do differences in shocks received over the working lifetime. Our paper also assumes that difference in

human capital are crucial in determining the life cycle position in the labor market although the focus and
methodology are very different.
    There are numerous papers that focus on training, both selection into training and its effects on future
earnings and job assignment. Our contribution is to stress the role of training in overcoming education mis-
match. The existing literature stresses the role of the hold-up problem as a disincentive for the accumulation
of human capital, including training. In a setting with education and labor frictions, Flinn, Gemici, and
Laufer (2017) study the determinants into training. But education is exogenous and there is no education
mismatch. Thus the interaction between mismatch and training is not studied.
    Given the interest in lifelong learning, it is not surprising that the PIAAC data has been used as a
source of information on training and its consequences. A few of those studies relate directly to our goal of
understanding the interaction between mismatch and training.
    Martin (2018) provides a general assessment of the use of the PIAAC data, with some emphasis on both
skill mismatch and lifelong learning. Martin (2018) notes that "In all countries, those workers with the most
education and skills participate far more in learning opportunities than their peers with less education and
skills."
    Brunello and Rocco (2015) study the Adult Education and Training (AET) in the PIAAC data. In
terms of selection into training, they discuss evidence that training is more likely for individuals with higher
educational attainment and more likely for younger individuals. As for the effects of training on labor
market outcomes, they argue that training leads to both higher wages and present limited evidence that
skills improve.
    Cabrales, Dolado, and Mora (2017) study training in Spain and in other PIAAC countries. Their focus is
on the interaction of job protection measures and training. They emphasize the interaction between training
and the type of employment contract, temporary vs. permanent. Some of their findings for Spain are relevant
for our model and its implications. They find a positive association between training and the accumulation
of skills, measured by the PIAAC tests. On job assignment, they find that higher test scores are positively
related to permanent jobs. And, perhaps most importantly, they argue that workers with temporary jobs
are less likely to receive training.
    The result that the type of contract is linked to training is most intriguing for us as it indicates another
potential channel for the resolution of mismatch. However, using data for our 4 countries, there is no evidence
that mismatch in education is related to the assignment of permanent versus temporary contracts.7
    Another related study is Gauly and Lechner (2019) which focuses on selection bias and the evaluation of
training outcomes. Like studies of the return to formal education, determining the effects of training requires
some control for selection. Gauly and Lechner (2019) study this for Germany, supplementing the PIAAC
data for Germany with a follow-up longitudinal study specifically for Germany. Combining these data sets
allows them to distinguish selection effects from the impact of training on skills. They conclude that the
selection effects are quite strong and essentially accounts for the positive correlation of training and skills.
    There is another related literature, such as Kawaguchi and Murao (2014) for OECD countries, that
focuses on the effects of aggregate conditions at the top of an individual's first job on labor market outcomes
later in life.8 The discussion there points to the effects of differences in labor market institutions on the
persistent effects of initial conditions. While our study is not about aggregate conditions, the same persistent
effect of initial conditions such as education mismatch may depend on labor market institutions. We return
   7 This was also largely the case in Spain as well, the focus of Cabrales, Dolado, and Mora (2017), though overmatched

individuals had a slightly higher rate of permanent attachment.

to this point below specifically in the case of Japan.
    Finally, to be clear on language, throughout we refer to education mismatch as reflecting the misallocation
of individuals with respect to educational outcomes. And we refer to labor mismatch as denoting the
misallocation of individuals with respect to job assignment. Some of the literature uses the terms education
mismatch to denote the misallocation of workers, based upon their education, to jobs. And, some of the
literature studies the co-existence of vacancies and unemployed workers as mismatch.


2     Facts
This section provides initial evidence on education and labor market mismatch and their interaction. It also
includes evidence on the selection to training. These facts are used in part to motivate our analysis and also
to provide a basis for the structural estimation that follows.
    The main data source for this analysis is the Survey of Adult Skills from PIAAC. The use of PIAAC data
is crucial to conduct a cross-country comparison of the relationship between ability, educational attainment
and labor market allocations. The survey assesses the proficiency of adults aged 16-65 in three domains:
literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environments.
    Before the skill assessment, all participants responded to a background questionnaire that provides infor-
mation in four main areas: (i) basic demographic characteristics of respondents, (ii) education attainment
and participation in learning activities, (iii) labor force status and employment and (iv) the use of skills
at work and in daily life. Our analysis includes participants aged 25 to 54, excludes self-employed individ-
uals and uses data from 21 participating countries from the first round of the survey: Austria, Belgium,
Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, England, Estonia, Finland, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Ko-
rea, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden and the United States (US).9 We report
results for pooled sample and for 4 individual countries: Germany, Italy, Japan and the US.10
    To study the relationship between ability and educational choices, we use the PIAAC numeracy score
as a signal of cognitive ability. For the analysis relating skills and types of occupation, we add individuals'
proficiency in literacy and problem solving. Thus, we use the average of the three dimensions as signal of
individuals' skills in the labor market.
    There are standard concerns with the use of PIAAC scores as measures of ability. First, as with all
tests, scores signal ability with noise. Second, and more importantly for the education mismatch analysis,
the exam is not taken prior to education but is given during working years, so that the test results might
also reflect education, and training and work experience. These concerns are dealt with in the quantitative
analysis by adding noise to test scores, disciplined by model moments, and by a treatment allowing reverse
causality.
    For educational attainment we rely on the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED).
We define a dichotomous variable indicating two levels: (i) below college (ISCED 1 through 4) and (ii) college
and beyond ( ISCED 5 and above). For individual's occupations we rely on the International Standard
Classification of Occupations from 2008 (ISCO 08) and define two types of jobs: (i) unskilled (first to third
ISCO skill levels) and (ii) skilled jobs (fourth ISCO skill level).
    Figure 1 illustrates, for Germany and Italy, the two measures of mismatch that we develop in this paper.
   9 The data collection for the first round took place from August 2011 to November 2012. Individuals aged 25-54 are supposed

to had made their education decisions before 2006, so the Great Recession cannot affect their educational choices.
  10 These countries were selected for the detailed study in part because of their differences in both education mismatch, training

and labor market institutions. Some of these facts are established for the broader set of countries in Appendix subsection 9.1.

for those with college degrees (skilled occupations) is a rightward shift of the scores for the low education
group (workers in low skilled occupations). These differences in means are clear from Tables 1 and 2 and
are statistically significant. Second, for every country, we observe significant dispersion of PIAAC scores
for each of the educational attainment levels and types of occupation. Third, and most importantly for the
purposes of our study, there is considerable overlap in these distributions. This is indicative of mismatch:
there are individuals that didn't go to college but whose scores are higher than those with a college degree
and there are individuals in low-skilled jobs but whose scores are higher than those in high-skilled ones.

2.1       Measuring Mismatch
Figure 1 suggests the presence of important amounts of the two types of mismatch across OECD countries.
We now conduct a more formal analysis to measure mismatch and to classify individuals into under, well and
overmatched both in education and in the labor market. To do this, we estimate probabilities of (i) obtaining
higher education and (ii) getting a skilled job conditional on PIAAC scores. Based on these estimates, an
agent is undermatched (overmatched) in education if she didn't (did) complete college but the predicted
probability of doing so is sufficiently high (low). Similarly, we say an agent is undermatched (overmatched)
in her job if she doesn't (does) have a skilled job but the predicted probability of doing so is sufficiently high
(low). The residuals are the well matched.

2.1.1     Education Mismatch

In this section we generate empirical measures of education mismatch. Specifically, consider the following
logistic model of educational choice:

                                                                     exp0 +1 ai
                                            Pr (ei = 1|ai ) =                                                            (1)
                                                                   1 + exp0 +1 ai
where ai is the PIAAC numeracy score, considered as a proxy for individual i's ability.12 Here ei = 0 signifies
that individual i has no college degree and ei = 1 signifies college attainment and beyond. The regressions
are run at the individual level by country. In order to better compare the results, we normalize the test score
within each country to have a mean zero and a standard deviation of unity.
    Predicted values from these logistic regressions are used to classify individuals into under- and over-
matched. An individual is overmatched in education if ei =1 but the model's predicted probability of ei =1 is
 12 The  PIAAC data report 10 plausible values for the numeracy score for each individual. We use the mean of these plausible
values as a proxy for ability.


                                                               8

lower than the 20th percentile of all predicted values. Similarly, an individual is undermatched in education
if ei =0 but the model's predicted probability of ei =1 is higher than the 80th percentile of all predicted
values.13 The choice of these specific upper and lower bounds to identify mismatched individuals are clearly
arbitrary. The inference of the model comes from using these same cut-offs in the structural estimation.

                                              Table 3: Education Mismatch

    Results for this exercise are presented in Table 3 for Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and the pooled
sample. The estimated coefficients from columns 1-5 are used as moments in the structural estimation.14
    College attainment, under- and overmatch rates for every country are reported in the first three columns.
Here, the undermatch (overmatch) rate represents the proportion of individuals that didn't (did) choose
college and are mismatched. The fourth and fifth columns show the estimates of the coefficients from
the logistic model while column six represents the average marginal effect of the numeracy score on the
probability of college attendance.
    From the pooled sample, there is evidence of both forms of mismatch. For this large sample, the marginal
effect of the numeracy score on education is about 0.22.
    There is important variation across countries. Although college attainment rates are relatively high
for these 4 advanced economies, they are considerably lower in Germany and in Italy compared to Japan.
Mismatch rates are lowest in the US. The undermatch rate is highest in Italy, where the college attainment
is lowest. The overmatch rate is highest is Japan, where the college attainment is higher. In general, this
pattern is observed for the whole sample of 21 countries: countries with higher education rates tend to have
lower undermatch rates and higher overmatch rates.

2.1.2     Labor Mismatch

We follow the same methodology to generate empirical measures of labor market mismatch.15 In particular,
we now consider the following logistic model:
   13 Appendix sub-section 9.2.1 considers an alternative measure in which these percentiles are calculated within the appropriate

reference group by education rather than the entire population.
   14 The sample and thus estimates are a bit different than those reported in Cooper and Liu (2019) since the age group here

is 25-54 year old, and we excluded self-employed. In particular, the average college rate is a bit lower.
   15 Other empirical approaches use job satisfaction to measure mismatch as discussed in McGowan and Andrews (2015).

                                                                1 + exp0 +1 a^i

where a ^i is the PIAAC average score of the three dimensions, considered as a proxy for individual i's skills,
oi = 0 signifies that individual i has an unskilled occupation and oi = 1 signifies skilled occupation. As in
(1), ability is measured as the average of all reported plausible values of the three dimensions. This allows
for education and previous job experience to impact, say, the problem solving component of the test score
and thus measured ability.16
    McGowan and Andrews (2015) identify individuals, by occupation, who are well-matched in terms of
their self-assessment of their own skills relative to those required to perform their job. From this group, they
obtain critical test scores for, say, the 5th and 95th percentiles. All workers in the occupation are evaluated
relative to these cutoffs. As with our measure, mismatch is identified as being outside of these values.
    For this analysis, we defined two phases of the working life. Individuals aged 25-34 are classified as early
workers while individuals aged 35-54 are considered late workers. Regressions are run at the individual level
by country and employment phase. As with education mismatch, the average score is normalized within
each country and employment group to have a mean zero and a standard deviation of unity.
    Predicted values from these logistic regressions are used to classify individuals into under- and over-
matched in the labor market. An individual is overmatched in the labor market if oi =1 but the model's
predicted probability of oi =1 is lower than the 20th percentile of all predicted values. Similarly, we say
an individual is undermatched in the labor market if oi =0 but the model's predicted probability of oi =1 is
higher than the 80th percentile of all predicted values.
    Table 4 shows the labor market mismatch rates by employment phase for Germany, Italy, Japan, the US
and the pooled sample. These rates are calculated as the ratio of the number of agents in a type of job that
are mismatched divided by the number of agents in that type of job.
    The pooled sample exhibits a number of important characteristics. There is substantial job mismatch
in the early work phase, with the undermatch rate exceeding the overmatch rate. Further, these mismatch
rates are slightly lower for older compared to younger workers.
    Measures of labor market mismatch also vary significantly across countries. Undermatch rates are higher
than overmatch rates for all of them. Similarly, important differences in terms of mismatch rates are observed
between the two age groups. In every country, the labor market undermatch rate is significantly higher for
the subsample of individuals in early employment, except for Japan in which there is almost no difference.
Overmatch rates are higher for late workers in Japan, Germany and the pooled sample, and lower in the US
and Italy.
    Lower mismatch rates for late workers might be indicative of the presence of labor market mechanisms
like training that help in the reallocation of under-matched workers into jobs. Higher mismatch rates, on the
other hand, might reflect some failure for the labor market to correct the initial misallocation of workers.
However, there is a word of caution in interpreting these differences. The PIAAC data is cross-sectional,
not panel. Thus, we cannot distinguish between the cohort effect and the age effect when analyzing the
two groups. The differences in overmatch rates, for example, might be indicative of different labor market
agreements for that cohort that make it more difficult to separate overmatch individuals from their skilled
jobs. Our estimated model will help in uncovering those dynamics.
  16 As suggested to us by Huacong Liu, this timing and choice of test might also allow for the current job to impact the

score since we do not know how long the individual was in the current job. We return to this below in a robustness exercise,
sub-section 9.2.2.

2.2     Empirical Effects of Education Mismatch on Labor market outcomes
The evidence indicates both education and job mismatch. A key motivation of this paper is understanding
their interaction. Leaving aside the issue of causality, is there evidence that education and labor market
outcomes, in terms of mismatch, are correlated? Further, how do these patterns evolve? One intriguing
hypothesis is that education undermatch initially leads to labor market undermatch but over time, through
training and/or reallocation across jobs, the effects of the initial education undermatch disappear.
    A simple correlation analysis, in Table 28, shows positive and significant correlations for all countries
between (i) being mismatched -either under or over- in education and in the job, (2) being overmatched in
education and overmatched in the job and (3) being overmatched in education and overmatched in the job.
The next steps go beyond those correlations by analyzing the impact of education mismatch on compensation,
job assignment and selection into training.

2.2.1    Mincer Regressions: The Wage Effects of Education Mismatch

This section analyzes the wage effects of education mismatch. To do so, we add the obtained measures
of education mismatch for each individual by country to a standard Mincer wage regressions. Hanushek,
Schwerdt, Wiederhold, and Woessmann (2015) use also the PIAAC scores as a measure of cognitive skills
in these type of regressions. It is clear from their analysis that both the PIAAC numeracy score as well as
education are positively correlated with labor market earnings.
    We use the gross hourly earnings of wage and salary workers as the labor income measure.17 We follow
Hanushek, Schwerdt, Wiederhold, and Woessmann (2015) for some sample selection criteria that further
restrict our sample. First, in each country, we trim the bottom and top one percent of the wage distribution
to limit the influence of outliers. Second, to avoid other influences such as family demands or health
limitations that might affect labor-force attachment, we limit the estimation sample to full-time workers,
defined as those working at least 30 hours per week.
    Some interesting relations are clear from Table 5, both for the individual country and pooled regressions.
First, earnings depend positively on PIAAC numeracy scores indicating they are not just noise. Second, all
regressions show an obvious college premium. Third, the positive coefficient on late employment signals a
seniority effect. These results are in line with findings in Hanushek, Schwerdt, Wiederhold, and Woessmann
(2015).
    Fourth, and more importantly for the purpose of our study, education mismatch appears to have a statis-
tically significant effect on predicting wages for the pooled sample. In particular, the positive coefficient on
education undermatch means that those who were undermatched in education get compensated compared
  17 In the Public Use File, earnings data for Austria, Canada, Germany, Sweden, and the United States are reported only in

deciles. We thank Marco Paccagnella for running these regressions for us.

The depend variables for all of them is log hourly earnings. Standard errors are reported in parenthesis. The numeracy score
is normalized within each country to have zero mean and standard deviation of unity. The variable gender takes the value 1 if
the individual is female, and 0 otherwise. The variable late emp takes the value 0 if the individual is an early employee (25-34
years old) and 1 otherwise. A */** next to the coefficient indicates significance at the 10/5% level. Table 31 includes Mincer

to the well-matched without college. In a similar manner, the negative coefficient for education overmatch
implies that those who were overmatched in education get a pay cut relative to the well-matched college
graduates. This could represent a way in which education mismatch impacts labor market outcomes. How-
ever, at the individual country level, these effects are absent. This is also true for majority of the 21 countries
in our sample.18

   While there is no evidence of wage effects of educational mismatch at the country level, there is evidence
that job assignment is impacted. Table 6 looks at the correlations of education and job mismatch for the four
countries.19 The first column reports the correlation between being mismatched in education and in the job.
  18 Coefficients from these regressions for all countries are shown in Table 31 in the appendix. Just a few countries show

statistically significant coefficients for our measures of education mismatch.

      Note: This table shows the distribution between different labor market and education outcomes in terms
      of mismatch. The first three columns represents the distribution across labor market outcomes conditional
      on the education one (row interpretation). The last three columns condition the distribution on the labor
      market match (column interpretation.)

                     Table 7: Distribution of Education and Early Labor Market Outcomes


The second column reports correlations between being undermatched in education and undermatched in the
job. The third column shows the correlation between being overmatched in education and overmatched in
the job. Clearly mismatch in education is positively correlated with mismatch in jobs.
    Table 7 goes further and displays the cross sectional distribution of education and job mismatch, by
country, for early employment. Beyond compensation, another dimension of labor market outcomes is the
assignment to jobs. In particular, does the labor market assignment overcome or reinforce mismatch in
education?
    The first three columns of Table 7 show the distribution across labor market outcomes, in terms of
job mismatch, conditional on education mismatch for the pooled sample, Germany, Italy, Japan and the
US. In the pooled sample, almost 40% (37%) of the individuals that were overmatched (undermatched) in
education are also overmatched (undermatched) in the job. Similarly, around 39% (33%) of the individ-
uals undermatched (overmatched) in the job were also undermatched (overmatched) in education. These
proportions vary across countries.
    Notice that there are no individuals in our sample undermatched (overmatched) in education but over-
match (undermatch) in the labor market. Our methodology requires agents to have relatively high test scores
to be considered undermatched and relatively low scores to be considered overmatched. This mechanism,
together with the high correlation between our measures of ability and labor market skills, implies a zero
probability of opposite types of mismatch in education and the labor market for the same individual.
    The moments indicating job outcome conditional on education will be used in the estimation. As the
PIAAC is not a panel, the dynamic of job assignment is not well captured. Hence our focus on early

 educated) individual obtains a skilled job in the designated employment phase.

assignment in Table 7 and in the estimation.
    Another dimension of labor market outcomes is job assignment by skill. Table 8 indicates these flows in
early and late employment. From the top panel, for all countries, 0 < cs < 1 in early emplloment so that
having a college education does not guarantee the attainment of a skilled job. Likewise, 0 < ns < 1 in all
countries as well so that some individuals can obtain a skilled job even without a college degree. The latter
effect thus provides a path for undermatched individuals to be selected into a skilled job.
    The late employment flows have a similar pattern where a college degree increases the chances of a skilled
job but does not guarantee one. Except for Germany, cs is larger in the late employment period consistent
with a better sorting of individuals over time.20 And likewise ns is lower in the late employment period.
    But this interpretation must be taken with caution. As the PIAAC is a single cross section, the dynamics
from early to late employment can not be taken directly from the data. Thus for much of the estimation we
rely on (cs , ns ) for early employment as calculated from the data. But we estimate and/or otherwise set
the flows for late employment, conditional on training outcomes, as explained below.

2.2.3    Training

The goal of our analysis is to understand not only the interaction between education and labor market
mismatch but also how this interaction evolves over time. If education mismatch matters for labor market
allocations, does its effect last over time? What are the mechanism at play? In principle, training allows
high-ability individuals initially undermatched in education to acquire skills and then efficiently use them
in the labor market. In this way, we consider training as a possible mechanism for overcoming education
undermatch.
     The PIAAC data report different measures of training. Formal training refers to any formal education,
job related, received by the employee in the last 12 months before the interview.21 In contrast, informal
training refers to participation in one of the following activities: (i) courses conducted through open or
distance education, (ii) organized sessions for on-the-job training or training by supervisors or co-workers,
(iii) seminars or workshop and (iv) courses or private lessons. Since PIAAC data does not report the
level/type of formal education followed by the respondent, it is difficult to separate the education variable
from the formal training one. Thus, the main measure used in our analysis corresponds to informal training,
although formal training is also considered as an alternative.
  20 Again, as this is not a panel, we are unable to determine the fraction, for example, of college educated individuals assigned

to skilled jobs early retain those jobs in the late employment period.
  21 Specifically, the background questionnaire defines formal education as the one "provided in schools, colleges, universities or

other educational institutions and leads to a certification that is taken up in the national educational classification".

      characteristics.

                                              Table 9: Training assignment


    Our main interest is selection into training. Table 9 reports the results from a logistic regression of the
probability of receiving non formal training in early employment, conditional on individuals' and some firm
characteristics. Since training is received in less than 12 months prior to the interview we assume that the
type of occupation, at the moment of the interview, is not a consequence of training but rather the type of
job they held while being trained.
    It is clear from the table that the type of occupation appears to be a strong determinant in participation
into informal training with educational attainment and our proxy of ability playing a less important role.
In particular, early workers with skilled jobs have a higher probability of receiving non formal training than
the ones with unskilled jobs. Note too that college is significant in only Italy and Japan: for these countries
education is positively correlated with training. In all countries, there is a positive correlation with numeracy,
though this is not statistically significant in Japan and the US.22
    It is difficult to directly interpret these estimates since both education attainment and job assignment
are endogenous. We return to disentangling these effects after the estimation of the model.
    The estimation focuses on training means by type of occupation as shown in Table 10. These means
are used as moments in the structural estimation. The training rates are about one-third for unskilled and
two-thirds for workers in skilled jobs. The rates are relatively low in Italy.

    Since the PIAAC is a single cross-section, as mentioned before, it's not possible to look at the consequences
of training dynamically as we do not know which late workers got training in early employment. Thus, we
use the estimated model to get at the implications.
 22 Choi   (2019) focuses on the impact of permanent vs temporary work status on training. Our model lacks this distinction.

3       Model
There are three phases of the life cycle emphasized in the model that accord with the structure of the data
analysis. The first stage allows the individual to obtain formal education. The second and third stages are
employment periods. They differ, in part, because of the opportunity for training in the middle period that
impacts productivity, earnings and job assignment in the final period.
   Figure 3 shows these three periods. These are discussed in turn, starting from employment and working
backwards to the education choice.

3.1     Employment Phases
This section summarizes the outcomes and decisions in the employment phases. The key (and only) decision
explored here is training, undertaken in the early work period. This highlights a potential path to a skilled
job through human capital accumulation, particularly for those who were undermatched in education. Of
course, the strength of this will depend on the selection into training and its effects on human capital.

3.1.1    Late Work
                                                                                                j
In the late work period, the worker is assigned to either a skilled or unskilled job. Let 2       (e, , tr) be the
probability that a type (e, ) agent is assigned a high skilled job in late work conditional on training (tr).
Here j  {s, u} denotes the job assignment for early employment. This function is taken as given in
determining the training choice. These probabilities depend not only on the worker type and the training
decision but also on the type of job in early work. This is a general specification and we return below to its
implementation in the quantitative analysis.
    As for compensation, workers are paid their marginal product.23 Compensation depends solely on their
human capital, which reflects their innate ability, education and training. By assumption, this is independent
of their early work job assignment.24
    Specifically, the productivity of a worker in a skilled job is given by H (e, , tr) = h(e) (e)tr where
h(e) captures the effects of education,  is innate ability, tr  {0, 1} indicates if the worker has successfully
trained while  (e) parameterizes the effect of training on worker human capital. The specification allows the
effects of training to depend on the level of education, e. Here both e and tr are dichotomous reflecting the
discrete choices over college and training. Compensation per period in late work for workers in a skilled job
is 2 H (e, , tr) where 2 is the base wage for late employment.
    If a worker is assigned to an unskilled job, then H (e, , tr)  1 regardless of education, ability or training.
With this specification, the returns to education and training are dependent on job assignment. In this case,
the late worker employed in an unskilled job is paid 2 each period.
  23 In contrast to Garibaldi, Gomes, and Sopraseuth (2020) model of labor market mismatch, there is no effect from co-workers

to the productivity of a given worker.
  24 Alternatively, assume that ability is not directly observed but rather is signaled by a job test of the worker, described below.

In this case, it is as if ex ante the worker is paid expected compensation in the event the firm observes an unbiased signal of
true ability.


                                                                 16

    Compensation over the entire late work period is summarized by Y2j (e, , tr) where j  {s, u} denotes if
the worker is in a skilled or unskilled job. This is the sum of the wages earned in each period, discounted
back to the start of the early employment period.25 Here j refers to the type of job in late employment
    These income measures as well as the uncertainty over late job assignment can be combined to create a
measure of expected income, discounted to the start of early employment, over the late period for a type
(e, ) worker given by:

                      ¯ k (e, , tr) and  k (e, , tr) refers to the early job assignment.

3.1.2    Early Work

Workers are hired by firms at the end of period T s . At the time a worker is hired, the firm observes each
worker's education and ability.
    Based upon these two pieces of information, the worker is assigned to either a low or a high skill job.26
Regardless of the job assignment, as in the late work, the worker is assumed to be paid its marginal product,
H (e, )1 . There is no effect of training on productivity in early work so that H (e, ) = h(e) if the worker
with education e and ability  is in a skilled job. Otherwise H (0, ) = 1 for all  so that productivity and
the wage for unskilled workers is 1 regardless of education and ability.
    Compensation in early work is summarized by Y1j (e, ) where j  {s, u} denotes if the worker is in a
skilled or unskilled job. This is the sum of wages per period over the early work period, discounted to the
start of early work. Denote the probability of assignment to a skilled job in the early period by 1 (e, ).

3.1.3    Training

During the early employment phase, agents have an option to receive training. The cost of training is a
fraction of time, 0  e ¯t  1, that must be allocated to the acquisition of skills in place of early work. Further
there is a direct payment of pt for formal training.
    The benefit of training is the expected gain in human capital in late employment: H (e, , tr) = h(e) (e)tr .
Recall that this gain is realized iff the worker obtains a skilled job. Thus there may be uncertainty over the
returns to training due to randomness in the job assignment.27
    Formally, the expected income gain to training for a type (e, ) early worker in job of skill j  {s, u} is
given by:


                              ¯ j (e, , 1) - Y
                     j (e, )  Y              ¯ j (e, , 0)
                               2              2
                                   j                                 j
                                 = 2 (e, , 1)(Y2s (e, , 1) - Y2u ) - 2 (e, , 0)(Y2s (e, , 0) - Y2u ).                        (4)
                                                l    e                   l     e
                                                ~ T /RT and Y u = 2 R
  25 To be clear, Y s (e, , tr ) =  H (e, , tr )R

                   2                                             2
Rx-1 )/Rx-1 where R is the real interest rate and x is the length of the period of the flow that is being discounted.
  26 In our quantitative analysis this is restricted so that assignment in early employment is based only on the education level.
  27 An alternative formulation would allow for a stochastic element to the training outcome as well, with (or without) random-

ness in the job assignment. Since agents are effectively risk neutral, this uncertainty is fully captured by  (e). So this should
not be interpreted solely as human capital accumulation but rather the compound lottery associated with training. For ease
of exposition, throughout we refer to  (·) as parameterizing the human capital accumulation from training. Relatedly, Flinn,
Gemici, and Laufer (2017) acknowledge measurement error associated with training and its outcomes.




                                                               17
3.1    Employment Phases                                                                              3   MODEL


Here the expected income given training, discounted back to the start of the early work period, was taken
from (3). From this expression there are two effects of training. The first comes from the dependence of
                                                          j             j
the probability of being in a skilled job on training: 2    (e, , 1) = 2  (e, , 0). The second effect comes from
                                 s             s
productivity in a skilled job: Y2 (e, , 1) > Y2 (e, , 0). This gain is characterized by  (e).
   A type (e, ) agent currently in a skilled job will train iff:

                                                         ~ T e + pt  s (e, ).
                                                      ¯t R
                                                1 h(e)e                                                        (5)

The left side includes the opportunity cost of training, discounted to the start of the early work period, while
the right side is the expected gain from training. The condition for training of an agent in an unskilled job
is:

                                                        ~ T e + pt  u (e, ).
                                                     ¯t R
                                                   1 e                                                         (6)

    Let j (e, )  {0, 1} be the training choice for a type (e, ) worker in job type j in early employment.28
At the individual level this is a discrete choice with j (e, ) = 1 indicating a choice to train. With the
specification H (e, , tr) = h(e) (e)tr , if  (¯
                                              e) >  (0) the training choice will be increasing in both education
and ability. In addition, the cost of training is increasing in both ability and education if the agent is assigned
a skilled job.
    To see these incentive effects more clearly, consider an agent in a skilled job early. Suppose that the
agent will remain in the skilled job in the late work period regardless of the training decision. Then (5) can
be written as:

                                              ~ T e  2 h(e)( (e) - 1) R
                                           ¯t R
                                     1 h(e)e                          ~ T l /RT e .                            (7)

In this case, the informal training choice is independent of h(e) since the agents retains a skilled job
regardless.
    But if the agent is currently in an unskilled job, assuming that the only way to obtain a late skilled job
is through training, the condition for informal training is:

                                              ~ T e  2 (h(e) (e) - 1) R
                                           ¯t R
                                         1 e                          ~ T l /RT e .                            (8)

In this case, the incentives to train are clearly increasing in both ability and education. This will provide a
way for undermatched individuals, assigned to unskilled jobs early, to climb up to skilled jobs.
    The choice, k (e, ) can be used to obtain measures of discounted (to the start of the early work phase)
expected income that incorporate the optimal training decision. For late income,

                       ¯2k (e, ) = 2
                       Y           k

                                                                             k
                                                                               (e, , k (e, )))Y2u              (9)

where k  {s, u} denotes the early assignment. From this, and given the randomness in early work assign-
ment, unconditional expected late income is given by:

                                    ¯2 (e, ) = 1 (e, )Y
                                    Y                 ¯2s (e, ) + (1 - 1 (e, ))Y
                                                                               ¯2u (e, ).                     (10)

      Using the optimal training decision to incorporate training costs, the expected income from early work

3.2      College Choice
Given these labor market flows and the dependence of compensation on ability, education and training, each
agent makes an education choice. Here that choice is restricted to no college or college: e  {0, e        ¯} where
0e   ¯  1 is the fraction of time in school.
    There are three direct influences that impact the education choice: ability, taste and borrowing con-
straints. As ability and education are, by assumption, complements in productivity in skilled jobs, individ-
uals, all else the same, will sort into education based on ability. That is, all agents above a critical ability
will choose college.
    But there are other factors at play. Agents may differ in their valuation of college, either the experience
itself, or the prestige of a degree, etc. This effect is captured by "tastes". In addition, there is an opportunity
cost of going to college and tuition must be paid. If agents are unable to borrow against their future income,
so that borrowing constraints matter, then the education choice will be impacted.
    It is useful to relate the education choice directly to mismatch. In this model, mismatch will arise either
from the presence of taste shocks or binding borrowing constraints. In both cases undermatch may occur,
high ability individuals may not choose the college option, either because they do not directly value the
experience or because of the cost due to limited borrowing possibilities. Further, overmatch can arise from
taste shocks that induce a relatively low individual to choose the college path.
    Finally, another possibility is that no education mismatch occurs despite its measurement in the data.
This would reflect noisy test scores. While individuals sort efficiently based on ability, the test results are
noisy enough to produce the levels of mismatch found in the data. As discussed below, this result is not
trivial since there is discipline in the estimation on the informativeness of the test score in wage regressions.
    Importantly, the assignment of agents to jobs in the early work phase will have an independent impact
on the education choice. For example, if either low education agents can be assigned high skilled jobs or high
education agents are assigned to low skilled job, then the return to education falls relative to no education.
While this impacts the education rate, it does not create education mismatch.
    More formally, knowing ability and labor market prospects, an individual at the start of the education
phase chooses an education level.29 Under the no college option, the individual goes to work immediately
and earns 1 in an unskilled job. As long as 1 (0, ) > 0 this individual will have an opportunity to work in
a skilled job after the education phase and even train in that period.
    If the agent chooses college, then a fraction of time, denoted e      ¯, is spent at school. Earnings during
the school phase are then 1  (1 - e       ¯). In addition, there is a direct tuition cost denoted p. The gain to
education, of course, comes in the early and later work phase where high ability agents are compensated for
their education as long as they are in skilled jobs.

with both Y¯2 (e, ) defined in (10) and Y
                                        ¯1 (e, ) defined in (11) including the costs and benefits of training for
a type (e, ) individual. The first term is income, net of tuition, during the education phase:

                                                             0 (1 - e) - pe
                                                  Y0 (e) =                                                                  (13)
                                                                  ~T s

with e  {0, e ¯}.30
    If capital markets are perfect so that there are no borrowing constraints, agents are able to completely
insure themselves over income fluctuations coming from transitions between skilled and unskilled jobs, post
education.31 Thus their consumption each period is proportional to the sum of the discounted present value
of their expected income, Y (e, ), as given in (14)

                                                                 Y (e, )
                                                      c(e, ) =           .                                                  (14)
                                                                   R~T
   If household utility over consumption is given by u(c), then lifetime utility for an agent of ability 
choosing education e is given by:
                                      V (e, ) = u(c(e, ))~T + (e)                                     (15)

Here (e) is a "taste shock" associated with each choice of education, e  {0, e  ¯}.32 As specified, the taste
shock is directly associated with the education choice. It is possible to include additional taste shocks in
the model, say for training and for high skilled jobs. The difficulty though is in distinguishing these taste
variations. Thus a more generous interpretation of (e) to include other sources of variation is certainty
consistent with the analysis.


3.3     Efficiency
The idea that mismatch is inefficient is certainly present in the ongoing policy discussions. This short section
describes efficient allocations for our environment. Sub-section 6.6 provides estimates of output loss due to
mismatch.
    Assuming that risk sharing can be achieved through type specific transfers, the key to efficiency is a
mapping from agent type (, ) to education, job assignment outcomes and training outcomes.33 For this
economy, ability influences productivity only for agents who are assigned skilled jobs. Also, assume that
the number of skilled (unskilled) jobs is totally elastic rather than predetermined so there are no congestion
effects.
    In this case, an efficient outcome has the following characteristics:

   1. there exists a function  ((e)) such that e = e    ¯ iff  >  ((e)). The function  ((e)) comes from an
      indifference condition with respect to the education decision given that training and job assignments
      are efficient, as detailed next. If there are no taste shocks, then there is a single  .

   2. all agents with e = e
                          ¯ get skilled jobs. Otherwise, their education is useless.
   30 As above, R~ x = (1 + R + R2 + ... + Rx-1 )/Rx-1 where R is the real interest rate and x is the length of the period of the
flow that is being discounted.
   31 Borrowing constraints during the employment phase are considered in section 5. Our main interest is in the interaction

of education and job mismatch and the incompleteness of markets post-education, while potentially influencing the education
rate, is not key.
   32 In (15) ~T = 1 +  +  2 + ... T -1 .
   33 As we shall see, the estimation does not uncover any role for borrowing constraints so that assuming all agents are risk

neutral is consistent with the results.

    3. agents with e = 0 get unskilled jobs for  <  where H (0,  ) = 1 and those with e = 0 get skilled
       jobs for    .

    4. given the training technology, the efficient solution is the same as the individual choice expressed in
       (5) and (6).

    5. all agents who train are assigned skilled jobs.


4     Quantitative Analysis
This section of the paper brings the model to the data through a simulated method of moments approach.
The moments include those that summarize: (i) education choices, (ii) education mismatch, (iii) wages, (iv)
job assignment and (v) training. These moments are topical in that they motivate our analysis and, as
verified below, are informative about our parameters.


4.1       Approach and Functional Forms
The estimation finds the parameter vector  that solves:

                                       £  min (M d - M s ())W (M d - M s ()) .                                                (16)

In this expression, the data moments are given by M d , the simulated moments, that depend on the parameters
are given by M s (). W is the conforming identity matrix.
    The model plays a prominent role in the analysis since it provides the mapping from the parameters 
to the moments. This mapping comes from: (i) the policy functions at the individual level characterizing
education and training decisions given , (ii) creating a panel by drawing shocks from the estimated processes
and simulating the resulting choices and (iii) calculating moments from the simulated data.
    For the estimation, the parameter vector is defined by

                                (, ¯, e , h(¯
                                            e), w2 , j ,  (0),  (¯   ¯t , css , nsu , nbp, bbar).
                                                                 e), e                                                        (17)

All parameters from the model are summarized in Table 11.
    Here  is the shape parameter for the Pareto distribution of ability,      ¯ parameterizes the taste shocks, e
parameterizes the noise in the education test, h(¯   e) is the human capital accumulated from college, w2 is the
wage in the late period of employment, j parameterizes the noise in the job test.34
    The parameters ( (0),  (¯     ¯t ) relate directly to training:  (0),  (¯
                              e), e                                         e) are the (expected) human capital
accumulation parameters if training occurs, distinguished by education level, e. The opportunity cost of
            ¯t .35 Under this specification, there is a component of the training choice that is education
training is e
dependent,  (e), and a component that depends on the job assignment in early employment through the
opportunity cost e ¯t .
    The model allowed a rich specification of flows between skilled and unskilled jobs over time. The estima-
tion places restrictions on those flows to highlight the effects of training on job flows. With that in mind,
the parameters (css , nsu ) control the flows from skilled jobs in early employment to job assignment in the

late working phase if training is not chosen, dependent on education outcome.36 Further, the likelihood
                                                                                    u
a worker in an unskilled early job is promoted to a skilled job is equal to zero: 2   (e, , 0) = 0 for all . In
this way, we focus on the role of training to obtain a promotion to a skilled position.37
    Flows into early employment, 1 (¯  e, ) = cs and 1 (0, ) = ns , are taken directly from the data, as in
the top panel of Table 8. Thus, the dependence of these flows on ability is not considered.
    In the cases with capital market imperfections, nbp is the fraction of agents unable to borrow and bbar
is a borrowing limit. Our adoption of this formulation of a borrowing constraint is explained below.
    The model assumes that agents know their ability and use this for education, employment and training
decisions. As researchers, we do not observe ability directly. Instead, through the PIAAC data set, we have
test scores. These scores have already been used to create moments such as the regression coefficients in (1),
which used the numeracy score as an input, and the regression coefficients in (2), which used an average of
scores, in order to measure labor market mismatch.
    For the estimation, it is necessary to create versions of these test scores in the model. There are two
noisy test scores, one for education and the other for the job. The score in test k for agent i, denoted tsik ,
is a noisy signal of worker ability:
                                               tsik = i + k  ik .                                          (18)

Here k for k  {e, j } parameterizes the noise in test k , denoted  ik , and these are elements of , where e
denotes the education test score and j is the job test score. The shocks in these test scores are assumed to
be uncorrelated.
   There are some functional form assumptions, as in Cooper and Liu (2019), that underlie . First, ability
has a Pareto distribution, with a shape parameter denoted . So the CDF of ability, , is given by 1 - -
                  
with a mean of -   1 , decreasing in . Taste shocks are assumed to be uniformly distributed in the interval
[-¯, ¯] and independent of ability in the baseline model.
   Throughout the estimation, the fraction of time at school is fixed at e¯ = 0.75, for all countries. But the
out of pocket cost is country specific. Relative to the US, the cost in Germany is 0, is 26.06% in Italy and
92.91% in Japan.38 Finally, 1 = 1 is a normalization.


4.2    Moments
For the estimation, there are three types of moments. They are chosen with a couple of criteria in mind.
First and foremost, they are informative about underlying structural parameters in . Second, since the
PIAAC is a single cross section, the moments do not reflect any dynamics between individuals of different
ages. All moments are summarized in Table 12.39
    The first five moments in Table 13 summarize educational outcomes. These include, in order, the college
rate, the undermatch rate and the overmatch rate. The coefficients (0 , 1 ) are from the logistic regression
in (1) that relates the educational decision to a constant and the education test score. For the data, this
regression uses the PIAAC numeracy score. In creating the simulated data, this test score comes from (18)
for k = e, parameterized by e . This is used as a regressor in (1) and the mismatch rates are calculated as
in the data.
    The labor market outcomes include wage patterns and the assignment of workers to job types. The
 36 Relative                                            s (¯
            to the earlier more general notation, css = 2  e, , 0) and nsu = (1 - 2 s (0, , 0)) for all  .
 37 Recallthat we only have a cross section and thus cannot directly follow the dynamic effects of training in our data.
 38 These come from Cooper and Liu (2019).
 39 Moments for all countries are in Table 31.

coefficients for the wage regressions are taken from Table 5. The moments are the estimated coefficients on
the test score (numeracy), education attainment, period of employment (early,late) and dummy variables
indicating either undermatch or overmatch in education. Here the inclusion of the period of employment
helps to pin down the second period wage, w2 .
    As for job assignment, the moments are the distribution across labor market outcomes, in terms of under-
and overmatch, conditional on education outcomes, again in terms of under- and overmatch. These flows
are displayed in Table 7. In addition, the early work phase mismatch rates, from Table 4, are included as
well.40 For the simulated data, the test score for the job mismatch rates comes from (18) for k = j , thus
parameterized by j , and used as an input into (2) to calculate job mismatch rates.
    The training outcomes are captured by the frequency of informal training by early workers. These
moments reflect our emphasis on training as a source of upward mobility. The robustness section includes
estimates with formal training.


4.3     Estimation Results
This section presents the baseline estimation results. There are a couple of main findings. First, education
mismatch is largely due to taste shocks. Second, there is no evidence of capital market imperfections.
   To be clear, this section of the paper is intended to report the results. The economic interpretation and
implications are brought out in section 6.
  40 Mismatch in late employment is not included, consistent with the view of minimizing moments that enforce a steady state

on the data.

    The moments are reported in Table 13 and parameter estimates in Table 14. For the baseline model,
there are 18 moments and 11 parameters, so the model is overidentified.
    From Table 13, the baseline model matches quite well the education moments, including the differences
across countries in education rates. The model captures the low education and high undermatch rate in
Italy as well as the relatively high education and high overmatch rates in Japan. The logistic coefficients,
including the sign switch for 0 in Japan are picked up as well.
    In terms of the Mincer regressions, the model generates positive wage responses to the test score as well
as to education and seniority.41 But the responses to both the score and education are muted compared to
the data. These results reflect, in part, the inclusion of under and overmatch in education as regressors.42
    Looking at the moments summarizing labor flows, the estimated model matches very well the interactions
between education and job mismatch, with the exception of Italy. So, for example, the "uu" rate of 0.393 of
Germany in the simulated data comes from the 9.5% of individuals who are undermatched in education who
are assigned unskilled jobs. These individuals test well in those jobs and are thus viewed as undermatched
in employment. This predicted rate is quite close to that of 0.377 found in the actual data.
    The model does not capture that the frequency of early labor undermatch and overmatch, denoted ue, oe
respectively. In particular, the labor overmatch rates are considerably higher in the model than in the
data. This is not because the model creates an excessive amount of overmatch in education. Rather this is
produced through the labor markets, i.e. (cs , ns ).
    The moments that summarize the training rates are well matched. The estimated model captures the
 41 Inboth actual and simulated data, the test here is the education not the job score.
 42 The  estimated model in Cooper and Liu (2019) included the coefficient on the test score in a Mincer regression with and
without education and did not include education under and overmatch. For that estimation, the coefficients on the test score
were well matched.

differences in training rates across countries as well as the fact that training is more likely for those in high
skilled jobs. As discussed later, this is a key element in the contribution of training to offsetting education
mismatch.
    There are a couple of noteworthy features of the parameter estimates in Table 14. First, the returns
to education and seniority are present with estimates of h(¯     e) and 2 above unity. Second, the noise in
the education test, e , is much smaller than the job test noise, j . Third, these appears to be substantial
variation in taste through a large estimate of  ¯, made clear below by the restricted re-estimation as discussed
below.
    As for the training process, for Germany and Italy the human capital accumulation is lower for college
educated than for the non-college group. The opposite is the case in Japan and the US. Also, for each of the
countries either  (0) or  (¯e) lie below one.43 This does not imply though that workers will not train. Recall
from (9) that training not only increases human capital but also impacts job assignment. These forces are
reflected in training decisions conditional on education and thus the simulated average training rates.
    As for the flows associated with job transitions conditional on not training, (css , nsu ) vary considerably
across the countries. These probabilities have direct effects on the training decision by job assignment,
thus distinct from  (e), since they apply if the agent chooses not to train. Indirectly they also impact the
education decision. The estimate of css is low in Germany and Italy. The estimate of nsu is very high in
Germany and relatively low in Italy. Thus individuals without college degrees who initially are assigned a
skilled job are unlikely to retain that job, particularly in Germany.
    For Japan and the US, (css , nsu ) were not identified by the variation in the PIAAC data. That is, at
the baseline parameter estimates, variations in these parameters did not impact the moments.44 For the
baseline moments and parameter estimates, as well as the analysis that follows, the lack of identification is
remedied in two distinct ways.
    In Japan, we set (css = 1, nsu = 0) so that workers who do not train do not lose their position in
a skilled job. This can be viewed as extreme job protection of workers in skilled jobs, a characteristic of
labor markets in Japan.. In this way, there is no additional randomization in job assignment. To be clear,
the setting of these two parameters is inconsequential for the analysis of Japan except for the dynamics of
employment flows studied in section 6.3.
    For the US, we turned to the NLSY97, a panel data set, to study the skill assignment over time of workers
conditional on training. Following the procedures presented in Appendix sub-section 9.3, these flows were
calculated as css = 0.423, nsu = 0.576.
    The next experiments study the sources of education mismatch. By eliminating one shock at a time,
the results provide some intuition on identification. Here we find one of our main results: the taste shock is
critical for generating education mismatch and thus matching data moments.
    The panel labeled "No Taste Shock" shows the re-estimated model with the restriction that        ¯ == 0, thus
eliminating taste shocks. Clearly the fit of the model deteriorates for all countries, most noticeably in Italy.
Note that in this case, the model produces mismatch as a consequence of noisy test scores: the e . This is
seen in the parameter estimates, Table 14, where the noise in the education test score is much higher than
the baseline for all the countries, particularly Japan and the US. Further the estimated noise in the job test
increases as well, particularly for Italy. From this experiment, there is a tradeoff between noise in the tests
  43 Recall that these are the expected productivity gains to training, incorporating the likelihood training succeeds as well as

job assignment to take advantage of the increased human capital. If we re-estimate the model imposing  (e)  1, the fit worsens
a bit in all countries.
  44 At the baseline estimates, individuals without a college degree in Japan and in unskilled jobs do not train, regardless of the

size of nsu .


                                                                25

and taste shocks. The baseline results indicate that the presence of the taste shocks is more effective in
matching moments.
    The fit worsens largely because of the model's inability to match the flows between education and job
mismatch. For example, in Japan, the undermatch rate in education is 7.5% but none of these individuals
are undermatched in the job. This occurs because the education and job mismatch are largely driven by
uncorrelated noise in the test scores. Eliminating the taste shock improves the fit of the Mincer regression,
particularly the education regressor since, in the absence of taste shocks, education is more closely correlated
with ability. The coefficient on the test score is relatively low reflecting the added noise in the education
test.
    The importance of the taste shock is further reinforced by the case which eliminates noise in the education
score, denoted "No Noise in Ed Test". The fit of the model does deteriorate without the noise, but not by
very much. Interestingly, the job mismatch flows do not collapse to zero without noise in the education score
indicating that the job mismatch is driven by both the education mismatch and the assignment of workers
to jobs by skill. From Table 14, eliminating the noise in the education test has a small positive effect on the
estimated variability of taste shocks.

capital market imperfections. Some of these extensions are continued in our study of the implications of the
estimated models for explaining education mismatch and the implications for labor market outcomes.
     As we shall see, the extension of the model to include imperfect information about ability leads to a better
fit for Germany, though not for other countries. This is of interest since among the countries Germany is
known for its early tracking system, consistent with the findings reported below.


5.1     Imperfect Capital Markets
The estimation was extended to include two models of borrowing constraints. In the first case, all agents
are subject to an upper bound, bbar, on the amount they can borrow during the education phase. If
this constraint binds, then, due to the assumed concavity of utility, the cost of education is increased and
undermatch can occur. The economic significance of this constraint depends on the outside resources of
young agents. For this case, the estimation includes a parameter for the maximal level of borrowing during
the education phase.
    In the second case, a fraction of agents, nbp, are unable to borrow at all, while the remainder face no
constraint. In a more general setting, the probability of borrowing might depend on a range of individual
characteristics, including parental education, income and wealth. But those covariates are not available in
the PIAAC data.

    The identification of capital market imperfects comes largely from its asymmetric effects on mismatch.
In particular, a binding borrowing constraint can produce undermatch in education but not overmatch. This
differs from the symmetric, by assumption, effects of tastes shocks.
    There was no evidence of either form of borrowing constraint. Though out of pocket tuition is thought
to be relatively low in these countries, there remains an opportunity cost of college through foregone income
during the education phase. Thus, in principle, borrowing constraints might have mattered. They did not.

             Note: This table reports data and simulated moments for the estimated models. See Table 12 for a full list

                                  Table 15: Moments: Imperfect Information and Reverse Causality

    This section explores a variant of the model which introduces imperfect information at the stage of the
education choice.46 In the baseline model, individuals make education choices based on observed ability. In
this extension, individuals choose college having only a signal of their ability: si = i + ed i .47 In this
specification, the parameter ed controls the impact of the noise, i on the agent's perceived ability, si .
    To be clear, the signal is only used for the education choice: compensation and training decisions are
made using actual ability. So this specification introduces an information friction at the time of the education
decision to produce mismatch but then removes the friction at the time of training. Depending on selection,
training may overcome the education mismatch.
    The panel labeled "Noisy Ability" in Tables 15 and 16 report the parameter estimates and moments for
this case. The moments to be matched are the same as in the baseline with ed as an additional parameter.
    Comparing Table 15 with Table 13, the fit of the model with imperfect information is better for Germany,
but not for the other countries. From Table 16, the estimated noise in Germany is 0.506 which means that
individuals are very uncertain about their ability, much more than the noise created from the education
test score alone. Further, compared to the baseline, the variability in the taste shock, a competing source
of mismatch, is lower. There is also a large reduction in the estimate of j relative to the baseline. This
uncertainty in ability is either zero or close to zero in the other countries.
 46 This     extension as well as the reverse causality case builds on Cooper and Liu (2019).
 47 Here      i is a mean zero, uniform random variable in the [-0.5, 0.5] interval.

5.3   Reverse Causality: Dependence of Test Score on Education 5                    EXTENSIONS AND ROBUSTNESS


    Further, from Table 15 this good fit remains after eliminating the taste shocks and/or the noise in the
test score. As before, there is no evidence of the effects of imperfect capital markets. Evidently, imperfect
information about ability is key to understanding mismatch and its labor market implications in Germany.
    It is interesting that the imperfect information matters in Germany. As discussed in Dustmann, Puhani,
and Sch¨  onberg (2017) and Brunello and Checchi (2007), among other studies, Germany has more earlier
tracking compared to other countries such as the US and Italy. Early tracking is a natural sources of
imperfect information about ability.


5.3      Reverse Causality: Dependence of Test Score on Education
The test score has been assumed to reflect the ability of the individual agent but not education. This
assumption is easy to question in the PIAAC data as the test is taken after educational achievement. To the
extent that the test score reflects some of the effects of schooling, there is the potential for reverse causality.
   Our choice of the numeracy score as indicative of ability was made with this concern in mind. This
extension of the model goes further and allows the test score to depend on education. In particular, for the
model assume the education test score is given by,

                                                 tsi = i + ed ei + ed  ie .                                              (19)

    Here ed parameterizes the dependence of the test score on education. As in the baseline model, the test
score does not impact the education decision. But, building on the previous section, the education decision
is made using a noisy signal of ability. Among other things, this guarantees that education and ability are
not perfectly correlated.48 The parameter ed is included in the set of structural parameters for this case.
    It is not possible to create a data counterpart to (19) since ability is not observed. Thus to obtain some
measure of the correlation between the test score and education, (20) is run on the PIAAC data and the
coefficient ^ et , estimated by OLS, is used as an additional moment.

                                                      tsi = ^ et ei +  ie .                                              (20)

    To be clear, there is no reason to believe that ed =        ^ et , as the latter is obtained from a regression
without ability as a regressor, so that there is omitted variable bias by construction. The argument here is
that by including   ^ et as a moment, it will be informative about the structural parameter ed .
    The panel labeled "Reverse Causality" in Tables 15 and 16 report the parameter estimates and moments
for this case. Note that here ed is in the set of parameters and        ^ et is an additional moment.
    Looking first at the moments, the estimates of   ^ et range from around 0.78 to 1.06, indicating the positive
correlation between education and test score. Of course this is not causal since education depends on ability
which is not observed. For the "Reverse Causality" block, this moment is obtained by an OLS regression on
the simulated data to obtain the model produced counterpart of           ^ et . In this manner, the omitted variable
bias is present in the regression from simulated data as well.
    The structural estimate, ed indicates the estimated impact of education on the test score. As indicated
in Table 16, these estimates are near zero for all of the countries.
    As in the baseline results, the mismatch seems to be driven largely by taste shocks: eliminating them
reduces the fit considerably. And, once again, borrowing constraints have negligible impact.49
 48 This   could otherwise occur, for example, if there are no taste shocks.
 49 As   this alternative model does not dominate the baseline, these other experiments are not reported in the table.

             Note: This table reports data and simulated moments for the estimated models with alternative job flows.

                                                             Table 17: Moments: Alternative Flows

    The baseline model put some restrictions on job flows. First, from Table 8, the estimation imposed the
flows from education into skilled and unskilled early jobs in a data consistent manner. Second, the estimated
parameters css and nsu determined the probability of flows in late employment by education if there was
no training.
    In this sub-section we study two cases with alternatives restrictions. For the first, we set cs = 1 and
ns = 0 so that an individual is assigned to a skilled job iff they went to college. Thus there is no initial job
randomization. In the second case, we impose css = 1 and nsu = 0 so that the only gain from training is
through human capital accumulation, not job retention.
    From Table 17, imposing cs = 1 and ns = 0 leads to an improvement in fit for Germany and Italy but a
deterioration for Japan and the US. This is perhaps not so surprising for Japan since in the data cs = 0.471,

                                                                                       30

much lower than the other countries. This stochastic job assignment was creating some early job mismatch
that is removed when cs = 1. From the parameter estimates in Table 18, for Japan, this restriction leads
to a large increase in the noise of the job test score. For the US, the training rate for skilled workers climbs
to 100%, far over the data moment. As with Germany and Italy, the "ue,oe" flows are much closer to the
data than the baseline. This is not an improvement over the baseline estimates since the estimation takes
cs and ns from the data.
    For the second case of css = 1 and nsu = 0, the fit deteriorated in Germany and Italy. In Germany and
Italy, once the incentive to train brought about by job loss is removed, the training rates of skilled workers
go to zero. Interestingly, the return to training by low education workers is higher compared to the baseline,
particularly in Italy, in order to maintain incentives. But this supports training by unskilled workers.
    For the US, the fit did not change. For Japan, the baseline estimation already set css = 1 and nsu = 0.
This is again indicative of the lack of identification of these two parameters for these countries.

5.5     Training: Formal
The analysis of training focuses on informal training in order to have a clear distinction between formal
education and training. The model was re-estimated to match the rates of formal rather than informal
training. Those training rates are shown in Table 10 and used as the last two moments in the estimation.
Note that these rates of formal training are much lower in all countries but do retain the pattern that workers
in skilled jobs are more likely to be trained.
    The moments are reported in the bottom panel of Tables 13. The model fit for this case is not as good
as the baseline. The decline in fit is coming from two sources: (i) the coefficients on mismatch in the Mincer
regression and (ii) the training rates. The latter are either inconsistent with the pattern of larger training
rates for skilled workers (Germany, Japan) or, as in the US, have very large training rates.
    For this estimation the direct cost of training is added along with the opportunity cost, reported in Table
14. The formal cost of formal training is relative to the cost of US tuition. The cost is very large for most

countries other than the US, consistent with the high training rates in the US. The estimated time cost is
also considerable. As with the baseline, the estimated model has almost no noise in the test score.

      Table 19: Distribution of Education and Labor Market Outcomes, conditional on Parents' Education


   Given the significance of taste variations as a source of mismatch, it is worth exploring further potential
sources of these differences in the valuation of a college degree. Table 19 provides some initial evidence on
the relationship between parents education and both education and job mismatch. By country, the rows
indicate the educational attainment of parents. The blocks report the education and early labor outcomes.
   For the pooled sample, parent's educational attainment does not have a large impact on education
undermatch. For Italy and to a lesser extent in Japan, the undermatch rate is higher for those with low
parental education. Overmatch in education is higher in both Italy and Japan for those whose parents have
higher educational attainment. Interestingly, the job outcome effects are much larger. In all four countries,
parental educational attainment is positively associated with higher levels of early job undermatch. Whether
these are direct effects or arising through education choices will be clearer from the estimated model.
   Building upon the evidence in Table 19, this section reports the estimated model extended to include
the influence of parental education. To do so, we introduce parental education into the analysis in two
ways. First, the regression used to predict the education outcome, (1), is supplemented to include parental
education, pei :

                                                                     exp0 +1 ai +2 pei
                                         Pr (ei = 1|ai , pei ) =                         .                                  (21)
                                                                   1 + exp0 +1 ai +2 pei
    The regression coefficient on this additional variable, denoted 2 , appears in the moments given in Table
20.50 Note that this parameter is positive for all the countries and about the same magnitude as the effects
of the test score, 1 .51 Compared to the baseline model, the estimated 1 is a bit lower due to the inclusion
of parental education.
  50 Other   moments are left untouched, and thus we match the baseline moments.
  51 This   points to a positive correlation between parents' education and test scores.



                                                                   32

   Second, the effects of parental education must be included in the model. To do so, the individual taste
shock is assumed to be a proxy for parental education. In this way, we are allowing parental education to
have a maximal impact on the education choice but not to directly impact mismatch in the labor market.

             Note: This table reports data and simulated moments for the estimated models with parents education
             influencing the test score.

                                                   Table 20: Moments: Parents Education

     The model is re-estimated with this added moment, captured by 2 . As indicated by the moments in Table
20, the fit is significantly worse than the baseline (shown as well), reflecting, of course, the added moment.
The estimated model continues to match well all of the education moments, including the dependence of the
education choice on parents education through the associated taste shock. The estimated model does not
match very well the moments summarizing the flow between education mismatch and job mismatch. For all
countries, the flows from undermatch in education to undermatch in early employment are much lower than
in the data and in the baseline model.
     This deterioration in the fit is linked to the parameter estimates. Using the taste shock to proxy for
parental influence leads to a large reduction in the variability of the taste shock,     ¯, relative to the baseline
estimate. While this reduction in noise helps to match the 2 parameter in the education choice regression,
it is coupled with a large increase, relative to the baseline, in noise in the test score, e . The large amount of
noise in the test score reduces the link between education and job mismatch, as evidenced by the deterioration
in those moments.

    From this exercise, it is clear that parental education matters for mismatch, both in education and in labor
market outcomes. The model studied here can incorporate the effects of parental education on education
alone but this does not carry over to labor market outcomes.
    Clearly, from Table 19, the effects of parental education could also impact job outcomes directly. That
is outside of the scope of this analysis as it pertains to labor market mismatch that is not a consequence of
education mismatch.


6     Interpretation and Implications
This sections uses the estimated models to study the determinants and implications of mismatch.52 It returns
to one of the central theme of the paper: the effects of education mismatch on labor market outcomes.
    To do so, we first isolate the source(s) of education mismatch. We then trace mismatch to labor market
outcomes: (i) wages, (ii) job assignment and (iii) training.
    A key contribution is using the model to generate dynamics. As mentioned numerous times, the data has
no dynamic component. But once the model is estimated, we are able to simulate and study the dynamics
of mismatch. Thus this section relies entirely on simulation of these dynamics using the estimated model.
    Tables 22 provides a summary of results. It highlights the wage, job assignment and training experiences
of both under- and overmatched in education individuals by country. It is explained in detail in the sub-
sections that follow.

6.1     Sources of Education Mismatch
The starting point of the analysis is the determination of the source of education mismatch. If, for example,
the main source of education mismatch is noise in the test score, then this is likely to have a minimal impact
on labor market outcomes. This is because the education test score has no direct impact on the allocation
 52 It uses the baseline parameter estimates for Italy, Japan and the US from Table 14 and the parameter estimated from the

model with imperfect information about ability for Germany from Table 16.

of individuals across schooling and jobs. And, with sufficient noise in the test score, it will not be very
correlated with the job test and thus measured labor market mismatch. But, if education mismatch reflects
either taste shocks, borrowing constraints or noise about ability, then there can be implications for labor
market outcomes.
    As argued, education mismatch, joint with other moments, is best explained through taste shocks for
Italy, Japan and the US. The fit of the baseline model is essentially maintained when there is no noise in the
education test score and allowing capital market imperfections does not improve the fit either. For Germany,
the introduction of noisy ability at the time of the education decision improved the model fit relative to the
baseline.
    As indicated in Table 22, the baseline model generates mismatch in education and captures the patterns
across the countries. Note the asymmetry in Italy where undermatch dominates as well as the opposite for
Japan where overmatch in education is larger than undermatch.


6.2    Wages
From the Mincer regressions reported in Table 5, the coefficients on both under- and overmatch in education
were not significantly different from zero and their point estimates were all small. Thus, there was no direct
offset in wages for education mismatch. Put differently, there was no correction in wages for education
mismatch.
    This is brought out further in Table 22. The columns labeled wre and wrl report the average wage of an
individual mismatched in education relative to a well matched individual with the same education in early
and late employment. The idea is to summarize the effects of education mismatch on wages conditional on
education. So, for example, in the early work period, an undermatched individual in Germany receives about
7% less than an average well-matched individual who also did not go to college. But in late employment,
the under-matched individuals obtain nearly a 25% bonus.
    This seems to be a general pattern. The wage ratio for undermatched individuals is either below or very
close to 1 in the early period. The ratio exceeds one in the late period, except for Japan. And the wage
ratio is considerably below one for overmatched in education individuals. Thus the model does predict some
wage correction, but mostly in the late period. These corrections are much smaller in Japan and the US
compared to Italy.
    Note that the wages income in both periods also reflects training. In the early period, the time cost of
training reduces labor income while the benefits of training appear in the late employment income.
    Overall, education mismatch matters for subsequent labor compensation. This is made clear by these
wage ratios. The next task is to uncover the contribution of labor market dynamics and training for this
connection.


6.3    Labor Market Mismatch
One way to overcome education undermatch is to assign high (low) ability workers to skilled (unskilled) jobs,
regardless of their education. But the actual early job assignment process taken from the data, recall Table
8, allocates some individuals with college degrees to unskilled jobs and some without college to skilled jobs.
Afterwards, there is the potential for reallocation of workers across job types joint with training.
    Our focus here is on the job mismatch created by education mismatch. For that purpose we follow
individuals both under and overmatched in education, through the two work phases.


                                                     35
6.3   Labor Market Mismatch                                         6   INTERPRETATION AND IMPLICATIONS


    Recall that the return to training, summarized by  (·), incorporates both the human capital associated
with training as well as the likelihood of assignment to a skilled job. For the estimation and the theory
model it is based upon, decomposing this compound lottery was not needed.
    But to determine the likelihood an individual transits, say, from an unskilled to a skilled job does require
this information. The bottom panel of Table 8 provides data moments summarizing late job assignment
by education attainment. Taking these as given along with the training probabilities from the model and
the estimates of (css , nsu ), it is possible to calculate the probability an individual is assigned a skilled job
conditional on training.53
    Using these flows, the last two columns of Table 22 shows the transitions in terms of job assignment by
education mismatch. So, for example, an undermatched individual in Germany is assigned a skilled job with
probability 0.229. That individual trains with probability 0.882 and remains in a skilled job with probability
0.545. This latter probability reflects not just the training decision but also the likelihood of being assigned
a skilled job conditional on training which is about 0.60 for those without college in Germany.
    For all countries, those undermatched in education are less likely to obtain a skilled job in the early work
phase compared to those who are overmatched. But in all the countries except Japan, there are forces to
overcome this by late employment. In particular, for Germany, Italy and the US, the undermatched assigned
to unskilled jobs early choose to train (the rate is 100% in Italy and the US). These individuals are likely
to obtain late skilled jobs. For the undermatched initially assigned skilled jobs, in Italy, they choose not to
train and thus risk their skilled job assignment as training is most costly for them. This reduces the fraction
of undermatched in education individuals who ultimately have skilled jobs.
    In Japan this correction of undermatch through labor flows does not happen. The education under-
matched assigned to an unskilled job do not train and so have no avenue for promotion to a skilled job.54
The 11.7% of the undermatched in education assigned to skilled jobs do retain those jobs in the late work
phase.
    Looking in more detail at these transitions, Table 23 focuses specifically on the dynamics of job mismatch
given education mismatch. It builds on the "uu" and "oo" moments used in the estimation to study the
implications for job mismatch in the later period. This is not the same as, but is consistent with, the job
assignment studied in Table 22. The columns labeled "ueuj late" and "oeoj late", represent the fraction of
individuals mismatched both in education and in the labor market in early employment that continue to be
mismatched in the late period. That is, these are conditional probabilities to highlight the flows given
early mismatch.
    To be clear about the forces at work, consider an individual who is undermatched in early employment.
By definition, this is someone assigned to an unskilled job with a relatively high job test score. This person
might have been undermatched in education and thus did not attend college despite having a high education
test score. This individual was then assigned an unskilled job according to their country specific value of
nu . Alternatively, this individual could be well matched in education, obtaining a college degree. But,
with cs < 1 and a high correlation between the education and job test, the individual would be deemed
undermatched in early employment. As mentioned before, our focus here is on the first case i.e. the job
mismatch created by education mismatch.
    From this table, the model predicts that education mismatch, both under and over, is largely resolved
in Germany and Italy. For those two countries, the "ueuj late" rates are about a third and the "oeoj late"
 53 These  calculations are used in Tables 22 and 23. Derivations are shown in Appendix sub-section 9.4.
 54 Here is where setting (css = 1, nsu = 0) could matter. But in Japan, unskilled workers do not train, so the finding that
pr(skl|ske) = 0 is independent of nsu .

rates are almost zero. In Japan none of the education undermismatch is corrected: all the individuals that
are undermatched in education and the labor market in early employment, are also undermatched in the late
job. Further over half of the overmatch in early by individuals overmatched in education remain. Finally,
in the US, education mismatch is partly. Individuals undermatched in education and in the early job, are
very likely not to remain undermatched in late employment. Thes flows are similar to those in Germany and
Italy. But, as in Japan, individuals overmatched in education and in the early job keep their skilled jobs
thus continue to be overmatched in late employment. Note that the training rates in the US are 1 for both
skilled and unskilled workers. But these efforts are muted by the fact that not all individuals who train are
placed in skilled jobs.55

6.4      Training: Selection and Effects
Underlying these job transitions is training. Here again the emphasis is on the role of informal training, both
through selection into training and its effects on job assignment and compensation.
    The moments used in the baseline estimation were the training rates. These were matched well. Table 22
shows the training rates, conditional on early job assignment, for the under- and overmatched in education
group. The group of individuals well-matched in education is not shown. Except for Germany, the training
rates are extreme, either all agents in a group train or none train. This highlights the incentives to train but
also indicates that the model does not include a choice specific shock associated with the training choices.

6.4.1      Selection

The selection into training depends, in part, on the return which itself has two components. First, there is
human capital accumulation captured by  (e). By construction, this part of the return depends on education.
This return surely provides a way for undermatched individuals to climb the job ladder. Second, there is job
assignment which depends on the likelihood an individual who does not train can remain in a skilled job.
This is controlled by the estimated parameters (css , nsu ).
    The model has some clear predictions about selection into training. First, all else the same, higher
education individuals have a bigger return to training and thus are more likely to train. Second, all else the
same, the return to training also increases in ability and thus in the test score.
    Table 24 adds to the training rates from Table 22 individuals well-matched in education. Recall that,
by definition, individuals undermatched in education do not have a college education while the overmatched
do. Some of the well-matched have a college degree and others do not.
 55 As  indicated in Table 36, only about 80% (69%) of individuals with (without) a college degree who trained are assigned a
late skilled job in the US.

                                            Table 24: Selection into training


    Selection into training varies across the four countries. In Japan, for example, it depends solely on the
level of education: all individuals with college train, while none of the individuals without college do. This
can be explained by differences in the estimated return to training  (·) for the two groups, reported in Table
14.56 It is consistent with the evidence in Table 9 that the likelihood of training in Japan did not depend
on the numeracy score, given education and job assignment.
    In Germany, Italy and the US, the education level impacts the training decision as well. Except for the
group assigned to early unskilled jobs in Italy, a higher proportion of educated individuals receive training
compared to the non educated ones with the same occupation and ability group. In Germany, 97% of the
well matched who went to college with unskilled jobs train, while 90% of those undermatched with unskilled
jobs receive training.
    Similar to Japan, all individuals with college in the US train as a result of a relatively high  (¯
                                                                                                      e). However,
high ability individuals with no college who are placed at unskilled jobs choose to train as well. Thus,
education is not the only determinant in participation into informal training.
    For Germany, Italy, and the US, there are other factors at play. For instance, conditional on early job
assignment and the level of education, in those three countries training is more frequent for the group whose
individuals have on average higher ability. The undermatched (overmatched) train more (less) than the well
matched who also didn't (did) go to college and are assigned to the same occupation. So, for example,
around 88% of the individuals undermatched in education in Germany, who are assigned to unskilled jobs
in early employment, receive training. In contrast, only 23% of the well matched group with the same level
of education and type of occupation, train. This is due to the fact that, if allocated to skilled jobs, the gain
  56 This points to another issue of identification for Japan since any lower level of  (0) will generate the same moments given

that no one without a college degree trains. This has no bearing on any of our findings.


                                                              38

from training is increasing on ability and thus is higher for the undermatched.
   Finally, conditional on the education outcome, training is more frequent across the group assigned to
unskilled jobs. This is true in all countries.

6.4.2     Implications

These training outcomes are key to understanding wages and labor market flows. Look first at undermatched
in education individuals. If these individuals are placed in low skill jobs, they decide to train in all countries
except for Japan. This training leads to a proportion of them to obtain high skill jobs in late employment,
thus offsetting their education mismatch.57 This is consistent with the high wage ratio for the undermatched
in late employment, as the well matched with no college train much less. Moreover, it explains the mechanism
through which the "ueuj late" rates are about a third in Germany, Italy and the US.
    In Japan, in contrast, the undermatched do not train and thus do not progress to skilled jobs. Conse-
quently, they receive no wage premium in late employment and the labor market cannot offset their education
mismatch. These results are consistent with the "ueuj late" rate of unity reported in Table 23 for Japan.
    As for the overmatched in education, they receive training if their initial job assignment is unskilled in
all countries except Italy (in Germany the rate is 71%). All of them receive training as well if assigned to
an early skilled job in early in Japan and the US, while in Germany only about 50% receive training. Since
training leads to the possibility of assignment to skilled jobs in the late period of work, part of the education
overmatch is reinforced by training in all countries except for Italy.
    As mentioned before, these high training rates for overmatched individuals reflects the estimated return
to training for college educated individuals,  (¯e). From Table 14,  (¯   e) >  (0) for Japan and the US while
for Italy and Germany the opposite is true. Recall that  (·) captures the return to the compound lottery
associated with training and job assignment and is not just a narrow measure of human capital accumulation.
So, college graduates in the US and Japan might have a much higher probability of a skilled job assignment
and take advantage of this compared to individuals with no college education.
    For Italy, the overmatched do not receive training and thus do not transit to skilled jobs from unskilled
jobs. In fact, the overmatched in Italy, while initially placed in skilled jobs, do not retain those jobs. From
Table 14, the estimate of css is near zero in Italy so that those who do not train lose their skilled job. These
results are consistent with the "oeoj late" rate equal to zero for Italy.


6.5      Counterfactual
Some of the initial job mismatch reflects the feature, taken from the data, that cs < 1, ns > 0. Thus some
individuals well matched in education can be mismatched in their early employment. This randomness in
job assignment becomes both a source of job mismatch and impacts education decision.
    Here we consider a counterfactual that eliminates this initial job mismatch while keeping education
decisions intact. Thus, this counterfactual highlights the role of the two economic decisions: education and
training.
    To conduct this experiment, assume that cs = 1, ns = 0. Further, for late job assignment, the counter-
factual assumes that skilled workers do not lose their job assignment even if they do not train. Thus this
source of job mismatch, as well as their incentive to train, are removed. To be more clear, with this labor
market structure all undermatched individuals are placed at unskilled jobs in early employment and training
 57 As   indicated before, these proportions are reported in Table 36.



                                                               39
6.6    Earnings Loss from MisMatch                                  6   INTERPRETATION AND IMPLICATIONS


is the only path to skilled jobs. In contrast, all overmatched individuals are placed at skilled jobs in both
periods so training is only chosen if the return  (¯
                                                   e) is high enough. This is a simulation exercise, in contrast
to sub-section 5.4 which involved re-estimation of model parameters.
    Table 25 shows the transitions through the employment phases conditional on education mismatch. The
counterfactual exercise eliminates the possibility for an individual undermatched (overmatched) in education
to be assigned to a skilled (unskilled) job. Thus "uu early" and "oo early" rates are now substantially higher
compared to the baseline. However, they are lower than one since the education and job test are not perfectly
correlated due to different noises. Thus some individuals might appear to be undermatched (overmatched)
in education but not in the labor market.
    Looking at individuals undermatched in education, in Germany, Italy and the US, the labor market
corrects for the education undermatch. There is no correction in Japan. This is similar to the baseline
findings. It indicates that the propagation of undermatch in education is not driven by initial job assignments.

6.6      Earnings Loss from MisMatch
Using the baseline estimates, Table 26 computes earnings over the three phases of the lifecycle.58 These
calculations are for the baseline model and another treatment, called "Maximal Output".59 Given baseline
parameters, this latter allocation was obtained by removing two key sources of mismatch:(i) taste shocks
and (ii) the randomness in the allocation to early jobs, i.e. (cs = 1, ns = 0). This is the allocation that
generates the most earnings, and hence output, in the early and late work phases.
    The first three entries are mean earnings over each of the three phases. Note that these earnings are net
of lost income and tuition due to schooling and training. Hence, for example, as the education rate changes
across treatments, so do mean earnings in the education phase. Thus low earnings in the education phase
indicate high college rates. The last entry is total income from the three phases. All of these measures are
discounted to the start of the education phase.
    Compared to the maximal output allocation, the earning in the education phase are higher in the baseline
model. This reflects the lower returns to education when there is randomness in the early job assignment.
  58 Garibaldi, Gomes, and Sopraseuth (2020) also calculates output loss from labor market mismatch. Their formulation allows

an interaction between over and undermatched workers, through the production function, that is absent in our model.
  59 For purposes of comparison, this is the baseline taken from Table 14 for all countries.

These low returns translate into a lower college rate than in the maximal output calculation. This is
particularly true for Japan: in the maximal output allocation the education rate is over 70%.
    The output cost of education mismatch is seen by comparing between the baseline and the maximal
output allocation, for each country, the mean earnings in early and late work. For Japan, this difference
is substantial, over 12%, indicating the loss associated with undermatch in both education and jobs. This
loss is most pronounced in the early work period. For the other countries, these differences in earnings are
present but are smaller. In fact, for Italy, the mean earnings in late work are higher than in the maximal
output allocation and the total is only slight lower. For Italy, the education mismatch rate is high, as is the
value of ns in late employment.

7     Cross-Country Perspective
Countries differ in both educational and labor market institutions. As discussed already, Germany is known
for its early sorting into education. As discussed in evaluating labor market outcomes in the PIAAC data,
Hanushek, Schwerdt, Wiederhold, and Woessmann (2015) point to various differences in labor market insti-
tutions across countries.
    Here we interpret our results from a country perspective, rather than emphasizing the channels linking
education to job mismatch. This perspective allows us to introduce institutional features that differ across
countries.


7.1    Germany
There are a couple of features of the German education and labor markets that stand out. First, as noted
earlier, higher education decisions in Germany are made earlier and thus with limited information about
individual ability. This was confirmed in our estimation. Second, there are the effects on education and
labor market outcomes of parents education noted by Dustmann (2004) and others. This in part motivated
our analysis linking parental education to tastes. These features underlie our account of education and labor
market outcomes in Germany.
    In Germany, there is considerable education mismatch, partly due to noise about ability at
the time of the education decision. Undermatched in education individuals receive training

                                                          41
7.2   Italy                                                                   7   CROSS-COUNTRY PERSPECTIVE


and about half succeed in being placed in skilled jobs. Part of the overmatch in education is
solved by other labor market reallocation mechanisms.
    In particular, around 90% of the individuals undermatched in education in Germany decide to train
and many are placed at skilled jobs in late employment. This is true for undermatched individuals in both
types of jobs in early employment. As a results, flows from education to job undermatch decreases in late
employment. In this sense, training helps overcome education undermatch.
    The decision to train comes from three main factors. First the estimated return to training for the
undermatched in education,  (0), is a bit lower but close to one. Second, the relatively high ability of
undermatched individuals implies a relatively large gain from training when assigned to skilled jobs. Third
nsu close to one implies that not only training is source of upward mobility across jobs but also is the only
way for undermatched individuals in skilled jobs to remain there.
    In the case of education overmatched individuals, training rates are lower due to lower estimated return
to training i.e  (¯e) <  (0), and lower gains from training due to relatively low ability. Around 50% of
overmatched individuals with skilled jobs in early employment, and around 70% of those with unskilled jobs,
decide to train.60 In this sense, training might also help to further create/reinforce the flows from education
to job overmatch. However, css is almost zero. Thus, the other half of overmatched individuals loose their
skilled jobs and are reallocated to unskilled ones in late employment, through other labor market reallocation
mechanisms.


7.2     Italy
In Italy, the college education rate is relatively low. There is considerable education under-
match which largely reflects taste shocks. There is no evidence of capital market imperfections.
Labor market mechanisms in Italy create a path for the undermatched in education and real-
locate overmatched to unskilled jobs in late employment.
    The transition from school to work in Italy is close to the pooled average, with about 68% of individuals
with a college degree obtaining a skilled job and only about 17% of those without college are in a comparable
job. Those who are overmatched in education are paid less than average in both early and late employment,
while the undermatched are paid considerably more.
    Looking specifically at the path of the undermatched. About 83% of them are initially placed in unskilled
jobs. All of them decide to train. As a result, around 68% are reassigned to skilled jobs in late employment.
In this sense, training helps solving the initial misallocation of undermatched individuals. In contrast, none
of those allocated to skilled jobs in early employment choose to train. However the estimated value of nsu
implies that almost 70% of them keep anyways their skill jobs.
    As Table 22 shows, none of the individuals overmatched in education receive training. In addition, css is
almost zero. Thus, overmatched individuals assigned to skilled jobs in early are reallocated to unskilled jobs
in late employment. In this way, the labor market solves the education overmatch. As a result, flows from
education to job mismatch decrease substantially in late employment for both types of mismatch. As with
Germany, differences in training decisions between over- and undermatched individuals come from differences
in the estimated return to training ( (¯ e) <  (0)) and the relatively low ability of overmatch individuals.
    In a comparison of OECD countries, Kawaguchi and Murao (2014) study how a cohort specific scarring
effect, which itself depends on labor market conditions at the time of labor market entry, influences unem-
  60 The higher training rate for individuals with unskilled jobs, compared to those with skilled ones, might be explained by a

lower opportunity cost.



                                                              42
7.3   Japan                                                                    7   CROSS-COUNTRY PERSPECTIVE


ployment rates in later years. From that study, Italy stands out as one of the OECD countries, along with
Portugal and Spain, with the highest employment protection index. In contrast, the US is the lowest. The
argument in Kawaguchi and Murao (2014) is that high employment protection is positively associated with
larger scarring effects.
    The results for Italy reported in Table 22 are, in some ways, in conflict with this view. Individuals
undermatched in education are not likely to get skilled jobs. Those that do get obtain skilled jobs, do not
train. Evidently the estimate of nsu = 0.315 implies that the penalty for not training is not large. Also,
overmatched individuals do not train despite the estimate values of css = 0.001. From this perspective,
there is not much mobility in Italy. But, this misses an important element: the training of the undermatched
in unskilled jobs. These individuals train at a very high rate and succeed in obtaining skilled jobs in late
employment. So, for Italy, unlike Japan, the undermatched are not trapped in unskilled jobs.


7.3     Japan
In Japan, the education rate is very high and there is more education overmatch than under-
match. As with the other countries, education mismatch reflects taste shocks. Labor market
mechanisms in Japan perpetuate the effects of education undermatch throughout the lifetime
employment.
    Specifically, and in stark contrast to Italy, none of the undermatched in education individuals train,
regardless of their job assignment in early employment. The point estimate of  (0) = 0.693 for Japan makes
clear that those without education do not have an incentive to train.61 Thus these agents are trapped. From
Table 4, the fraction of late workers undermatched in employment is high in Japan, compared to the pooled
sample, reflecting the limited incentives to train.
    The opposite is true for the education overmatched. They train, regardless of initial job assignment.
This is driven mainly by the estimated return to training of  (1) = 1.165.
    Recall that these estimates of the return to training incorporates the human capital accumulated through
training as well as job assignment to take advantage of the increased human capital. Thus, the estimates
for Japan implies that those likelihoods are much higher for college graduates than for the non-educated
individuals.
    This persistence of initial effects is perhaps not surprising given the nature of labor market institutions
in Japan.62 Kondo (2007) uses micro data to study the effects of first jobs on future labor market outcomes,
including training. The paper concludes that the probability of regular full time employment is adversely
impacted by initial job placement.63 Given the estimated value of ns = 0.12, those who are undermatched
in education in our model are unlikely to obtain a skilled job and thus find the path to training and a future
skilled job difficult at best.
    Genda, Kondo, and Ohta (2010) specifically compares US and Japan and find that the conditions at
graduation have a more persistent effect in Japan than in the US. They highlight two key features in the
Japanese system. The first is the role played by high schools in the process of matching graduates with
jobs. Evidently, colleges pay a role as well but to a lesser degree. The second are job protection measures
that severely limit flexibility in terms of firing full time regular workers. They argue that these features
are central to the persistent effects of unemployment rate when the individual entered the labor market
  61 Though lower values of  (0) in Japan do not change these moments, if  (0) is high enough, then individuals without

education will train and the fit will worsen.
  62 We are grateful to Masao Ogaki for suggesting this link to the literature on persistent effects of labor market conditions.
  63 In Kondo (2007), a distinction is made between permanent and temporary attachments.

on subsequent earnings. These effects of the initial unemployment rate are more pronounced in Japan and
larger for less-educated individuals.


7.4    US
In the US, like Italy and Japan, education mismatch is attributed to taste shocks. The training
serves as a device so that agents undermatched in education are unlikely to be trapped in a
low skilled job. Overmatched individuals also train and by doing so protect their job status.
    Specifically, for the US, there is no evidence of imperfect capital markets creating undermatch in educa-
tion. The undermatch reflects taste shocks.
    Training rates are high for all mismatched individuals in the US. The training pays off. The undermatched
individuals placed at unskilled jobs in early employment all train, and almost 70% of them are reassigned to
skilled jobs in late employment. The undermatched allocated to skilled jobs in early employment also choose
to train and about 70% retain skilled jobs.
    As for the overmatched, because of the particularly high estimated value of the expected return to
training,  (¯e), all of them decide to train regardless of their job assignment in early employment. As a
result, a large fraction of overmatched individuals are placed at skilled jobs in late employment. Thus, flows
from education to job overmatched persist during late employment.
    Returning to Kawaguchi and Murao (2014), the US is often viewed as a country with a minimal level
of employment protection. The three measures of labor market rigidity reported by the authors - EPL,
Union Coverage and benefit duration of Unemployment Insurance- are considerably low in the US. Thus,
the persistence on education mismatch does not seem to be a result of lack of labor market flexibility. In the
case of the undermatched, it might be harder for the employers to learn about the true ability when workers
are initially placed at unskilled jobs.


8     Conclusions
The goal of the paper was to determine the impact of education mismatch on labor market outcomes. The
paper provides evidence of under- and over-match both in education and in the labor market among OECD
countries. In fact, these types of mismatch interact with a correlation of about 0.40 between education and
job mismatch, pooling across countries.
    A key step in the analysis was to determine the causes of educational mismatch, taking into account
labor market outcomes. Education mismatch largely reflects taste shocks and not noise in the test score. For
Germany, mismatch is also attributed to education choices based upon imperfect information about ability.
    The analysis was structured to highlight the impacts of education mismatch rather than autonomous
labor market mismatch. From this perspective, we find evidence that education mismatch does indeed have
labor market effects through wages, job assignment and training.
    From Table 22, relative wages in late employment offset the lost education of undermatched individuals
in Germany, Italy and the US. This effect is particularly strong in Italy. In a similar way, the relative wage
of overmatched in education individuals is suppressed by late employment.
    For training, the selection into training is very much country specific and education dependent. In
Germany and the US, undermatched in education leads to high training rates, regardless of initial job
assignment. In Italy, these high training rates for education undermatched are high only for those assigned

to unskilled job in early employment. In Japan, the undermatched in education do not have training
opportunities.
    Finally, looking the job assignment, in all countries even a college degree does not guarantee a skilled
job. Workers without a college degree, including undermatched individuals, are usually assigned to unskilled
jobs. In Germany, Italy and the US nearly 70% of the education undermatch is resolved by late employment
insofar as these workers are placed in skilled jobs. For Japan, in contrast, education undermatch persists.
Also, for both the US and Japan (to a lesser degree), individuals overmatched in education retain skilled
jobs without demotion. For Germany and Italy, this is not the case.
    As structure, the analysis excludes independent sources of labor market mismatch.64 Through this focus,
the analysis omits additional frictions, associated with search and matching as well as informal frictions,
government regulations and so forth, that certainly impede the job assignment process and thus impact
education decisions. These factors are surely important in understanding education rates alone. What
remains to be better understood is how these frictions create education mismatch.
    The paper began with a broad statement about the economic effects of mismatch from the policy per-
spective. At this point, the paper does not address explicitly the sources of inefficiency and potential policy
actions to remedy them. This is of intense interest as well.

Note: This table reports the results from 6 different Mincer regressions. The depend variables for all of them is log hourly
earnings. The first two columns consider the numeracy score as a measure of ability while column 3 and 4 consider the
literacy score and column 5 and 6 the average of the three dimensions. Standard errors are reported in parenthesis. PIAAC
scores are normalized to have mean zero and standard deviation of unity for the whole sample. The variable gender takes the
value 1 if the individual is female, and 0 otherwise. The variable late emp takes the value 0 if the individual is an early
employee (25-34 years old) and 1 otherwise. The variables late under and late over represent interactions between late emp
and education under- and overmatch. All regressions control for country specific characteristics. A */** next to the coefficient
indicates significance at the 10/5% level.

9.2.1         Alternative Measures of MisMatch

An alternative definition of mismatch evaluates an agent relative to others with the same education rather
than compared to the entire population. An agent is undermatched if: (i) the individual does not obtain
a college degree and (ii) the predicted probability of going to college exceeds the 80th percentile of the
predicted probability of going to college among college going individuals. The same point applies to the
labor mismatch calculations: an individual in an unskilled job is viewed as undermatched relative to those
with that same job assignment. This alternative measure has an important property: if there is perfect
sorting by ability into education and jobs, then there will be zero mismatch.

    Looking first at the data moments, the mismatch rates for both education and jobs with this alternative
definition are lower for all countries. Still the patterns noted earlier remain: the education undermatch
rate is larger than the overmatch in Italy, Germany and the US while overmatch dominates in Japan. One
striking difference is that none of the individuals overmatched in education in Germany are overmatched in
their early job assignment. This is not the case in other countries.

                                Table 33: Parameter Estimates: Alternative MisMatch

   The fit of the models is better for Germany and Italy but not as good for Japan and the US. The match
with the mismatch rates is not as good as the baseline and the model still struggles to match the education
coefficient in the Mincer regression. The flows from education to job mismatch are close to the data as are
the training rates. The model continues to overstate the job mismatch rates, particularly the overmatch
rate.
   Removing the taste shocks and re-estimating the model leads to a large deterioration of the fit. So, as in
the baseline, the mismatch is largely a consequence of taste shocks. The experiment with random borrowing
constraints did not improve the fit for any country and is not shown.

9.2.2    Re-evaluating Job MisMatch

As noted earlier, the job mismatch is calculated from (2) using the average of the three PIAAC test scores.
And, like the education decision, there is the potential for reverse causation, i.e. someone placed in a skilled
job might acquire the knowledge to score high.
   These concerns were present and examined by Hanushek, Schwerdt, Wiederhold, and Woessmann (2015),
where the main focus was the estimation of the return to skill. Their main empirical model used the
numeracy score as a measure of skill, rather than a composite score.65 Further, Section 5 of Hanushek,
Schwerdt, Wiederhold, and Woessmann (2015) uses an IV approach to control for endogenous variations in
the numeracy score, leaving their main findings intact.
   Following Hanushek, Schwerdt, Wiederhold, and Woessmann (2015), the model is re-estimated using the
numeracy score as the measure of ability in (2) and thus in the calculation of job mismatch. The data panel
in Table 13. Compared to the baseline measures, the fraction of undermatch (overmatch) in education to
undermatch (overmatch) in early employment, "uu" and "oo" respectively, is much larger in the revised data
  65 As discussed in section 4.4 of Hanushek, Schwerdt, Wiederhold, and Woessmann (2015), the literacy and numeracy scores

are very highly correlated, but the problem solving score is less correlated.

since the measures of ability underlying the education and job mismatch moments are the same. But the
job mismatch rates in early employment themselves are about the same, with the exception of the high level
of job overmatch in Germany.
    The model fit reported in Table 34 is better for Germany compared to the baseline as well as the model
estimated with noisy ability. This improved fit seems to come mainly from the ability of the estimated model
to match the higher "uu" and "oo" flows The fit is worse for the other countries.
    The baseline parameter estimates are reported in the top panel of Table 35 and the estimates using the
revised data moments are reported in the bottom panel. One interesting difference relative to the baseline
is that the noise in the education test is estimated to be lower for all countries except the US, where it is
nearly zero anyways. Relatedly the job test noise in Germany is much lower and in Italy it is much higher
For Germany, this is what allows the model to produce the higher "uu" and "oo" flows. For Italy these flows
are much higher as well in the estimated model but this does not lead to an improvement in the fit.

data were born between 1980 and 1984 while individuals in the NLSY79 data were born between 1957 and
1964. Therefore, our US sample of early employees in PIAAC is closer to the NLSY97 cohort.
    In order to identify the job assignment probabilities in late employment for individuals allocated to skilled
jobs in early that do not train, we need information about their job allocation in late employment. Data for
the NLSY97 cohort is available from round 1 (1997-98) through round 18 (2017-18). Respondents were 32
to 38 at the time of their round 18 interviews. We restrict our sample to individuals that were already in
late employment by that time. 66
    College. The NLSY97 data report the highest degree completed by the respondents at each interview
date. Consistent with our PIAAC education variable, we define two education levels according to the highest
degree reported in 2011: (ii) below college and (ii) college and beyond.
    Occupation. In every round of the survey, NLSY97 respondents answer questions about every occupa-
tion they had since the last interview. We use the information on their most recent occupation at the time
of the round 15 interview in 2011-2012, in order to define their early job type. Similarly, use information on
their most recent occupation at the time of the round 18 interview in 2017-2018, in order to define their late
job type.
    Respondents' verbatim descriptors of their occupations are coded using a three-digit Census code frame.
In order to have a closer comparison with occupations reported in PIAAC, we mapped the 2002 Census
codes reported in the NLSY97 to (two-digit) ISCO88 codes. We then matched those codes to the ISCO skill
levels to define our occupation variable. Same as with PIAAC, we define two types of jobs: (i) unskilled
(first to third ISCO skill levels) and (ii) skilled jobs (fourth ISCO skill level).
    Training. Information on training programs in which respondents participated since the last interview is
also collected in every round of the survey. These data refers to training experiences of respondents outside
of their regular schooling. Our training measure from PIAAC refers to any informal training received within
the 12 months prior to the interview date. Thus, we said an individual in our NLSY97 sub-sample trained
in early employment if he reported any training experience within one year before the round 15 interview in
2011-2011.


9.4     Inferring Late Flows
Table 36 provides the inferred probability that an individual who trains is assigned a late skilled job, by
education. The inference requires the imposition of a steady state assumption to link the early and late
assignments in Table 8.
    The procedure amounted to generating a single equation with a single unknown, the probability an
individual with training was assigned a skilled job. The inputs into this were the training decisions along
  66 As with PIAAC, we excluded respondents that reported to be self-employed in 2011. In addition, the NLSY97 data includes

oversamples of Hispanics and non-Hispanic black which we dropped for this analysis. Our final sample is composed of 2,789
individuals.

with the estimated probabilities that an individual without training would be remain in a skilled job.
   It is important to keep in mind that this decomposition of the return to training only matters for the
post-estimation analysis. The estimation itself only identifies the compound effects of the human capital
accumulated in training and the late job assignment.
