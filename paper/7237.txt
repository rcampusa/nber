Explaining the Poor Performance of
Consumption-Based Asset Pricing Models
John Y. Campbell and John H. Cochrane
NBER Working Paper No. 7237
July 1999
JEL No. G00

                                                ABSTRACT

        The poor performance of consumption-based asset pricing models relative to traditional portfolio-
based asset pricing models is one of the great disappointments of the empirical asset pricing literature. We
show that the external habit-formation model economy of Campbell and Cochrane (1999) can explain this
puzzle. Though artificial data from that economy conform to a consumption-based model by construction,
the CAPM and its extensions are much better approximate models than is the standard power utility
specification of the consumption-based model. Conditioning information is the central reason for this result.
The model economy has one shock, so when returns are measured at sufficiently high frequency the
consumption-based model and the CAPM are equivalent and perfect conditional asset pricing models.
However, the model economy also produces time-varying expected returns, tracked by the dividend-price
ratio. Portfolio-based models capture some of this variation in state variables, which a state-independent
function of consumption cannot capture, and so portfolio-based models are better approximate
unconditional asset pricing models.
