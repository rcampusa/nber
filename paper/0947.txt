          The evidence and analysis in this paper support the earlier findings

of Feldstein and Horioka (1980) that sustained increases in domestic savings

rates induce approximately equal increases in domestic rates of investment. New

estimates for the post—OPEC period 1974—79 imply that each extra dollar of

domestic saving increases domestic investment by approximately 85 cents in a

sample of 17 OECD countries.

          An explicit analysis of the problems of identification and simulta-

neous equations bias suggests that the regression estimates are more relevant as

a guide to the long—run response of international capital flows than to their

short—run behavior. Coefficient estimates based on annual variations in savings

and investment are subject to potentially severe simultaneous equations bias

that is not present when annual observations are averaged over a decade or more

and the regression is estimated with a cross—country sample of these averages.

          A portfolio model of international capital allocation that is pre-

sented in the paper indicates that the short—run change in the rate of net

foreign investment in response to a sustained increase in domestic saving is

likely to be substantially greater than the ultimate steady state response.

           A nearly universal assumption in international economic analysis is that

capital flows freely ang countries to keep the return to capital equal in all

places. The implications of this assumption of perfect capital mDbility are not

only extremely important but are also contrary to most economists' beliefs about

the behavior of national economies. Perfect capital mobility implies, for

example, that the burden of corporate income taxes falls primarily on labor, that

government deficits do not crowd out private investment, that increases in saving

do not raise domestic investment, and that monetary and tax policies cannot alter

the real net rate of return on domestic capital. To avoid such intellectual schi-

zophrenia, we must either nodify the assumption of perfect capital mobility or

abandon the view that national monetary and fiscal policies that alter domestic

saving can thereby influence the process of domestic capital formation.

           An alternative view of the international econoxxr recognizes that capi-

tal mobility is less perfect. Capital tends to flow in the direction of higher

returns but risk considerations, institutional barriers and government policies

impede that flow. For private lenders and portfolio investors, foreign stocks

and   bond are a very imperfect substitute for domestic securities. The profita-
bility of foreign direct investment reflects not only the factor proportions in
the host country but also firm-specific considerations of marketing, tariff
barriers, tax rules, etc. Foreign direct investment also involves political
risks that are fundamentally different from investing in the home country.

Further, government policies may seek to encourage or prevent capital inflows or

outflows during long periods of time. These restrictions on perfect capital

mobility imply that   national   economic policies that affect domestic saving can

also influence domestic capital formation.

          In an earlier paper, Charles Horioka and I presented a direct test of

the perfect capital nbi1ity assumption (Feldstein and Horioka, 1980). We

reasoned that with perfect capital mobility there should be no relation between

a country's domestic saving rate and its domestic rate of Investment. Instead,

a sustained increase in saving in any one country should add funds to the world

capital market. These funds would then be divided among countries in a way that

depends on the relative size of each country's initial capital stock and the

elasticity   of its marginal efficiency of capital schedule. it that does not
depend on which country did the additional saving.
          We used data for the industrial countries that are    members   of the
Organization   for Fsonomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to test this impli-

cation of perfect capital nxbility. We showed first that there are substantial

differences in domestic saving rates among these countries and that these dif-

ferences remain stable over a long period of time. We then estimated regression

equations relating the ratio of danestic investment to gross domestic product as

the dependent variable to the ratio of domestic saving to GDP as the Independent

variable. To reduce the impact of cyclical variations and random shocks, both

variables were averaged over a minimum of five years.

          The evidence overwhelmingly rejected the implication of perfect capi-

tal mobility. The relation between the investment ratio and the savings ratio

is significantly different from zero in every period that we examined at signi-

ficance levels that were always less than 0.001. Indeed, the coefficients were
                                        —3—



always greater   than 0.85 and thin two standard errors of 1.0. The conclusion

was   unavoidable that, contrary to the implication of the perfect capital mobi-
lity   assumption, a sustained increase in the domestic saving ratio caused an

almost equal increase in the domestic investment ratio.

           The Feldstein—Horioka analysis explicitly assumed that intercountry

differences in savings rates are caused by differences in demographic structure,

population growth rates and social security retirement income programs. This

specification, based on earlier york by Modigliani (1970) and Feldstein (1977),

permitted using a simultaneous equations approach to estimating the investment

equation with the savings ratio treated as endogenous. These estimates con-

firmed the ordinary least squares results.1

           The findings of the Feldstein—Horioka study should not however be

overinterpreted. They do not imply that there is no capital mobility nor that

there is no tendency of capital to shift toward countries where it can earn a

high after—tax rate of return.2 Strictly interpreted, the Feldstein—Horioka

paper only claims to be a test of the extreme hypothesis of perfect capital

mobility. More generally, however, it is reasonable to interpret the

Feldstein—Horioka findings as evidence that there are substantial imperfections

in the international capital market and that a very large share of domestic

savings tends to remain in the home country. This implies further that




   1The Feldstein—Horioka paper also reported several other tests that will not
be repeated here, e.g., adding variables measuring country size and openness to
the investment equation. Section 3 of the present paper returns to the problem
of simultaneity.

   2Frisch (1981) and Hartman (1981) present some evidence that investment fLows
are sensitive to after—tax rates of return.
                                        _14_



sustained government deficits do reduce domestic capital formation and that cor-

porate income taxes can reduce the net return to capital.3

            The Feldstein—Horioka study used data for the fifteen year period from

1960 through 1971k. The sample period ended just as the dramatic 1973 OPEC price

increase had   begun to alter substantially the current account deficits of the
industrial nations and therefore the international flow of capital. Government

interference with international capital movements was also reduced in some

countries in the 1970s; the United States, for example, ended its interest

equalization tax on foreign borrowing in the United States in 197I and reduced

the pressure on U.S. nultinationals to finance overseas investment by borrowing

abroad.

             One major purpose of the present study is to extend the sample period

to the    end of the 1970s. The evidence presented in section 1   confirms that the

second    half of the 1970s was a period of substantially greater international

capital flows. Nevertheless, the earlier finding that international differences

in saving rates are associated with nearly equal differences in investment rates



      interpret Harberger (1980) as essentially accepting this interpretation.
In an earlier paper (Harberger, 1978), he argued that international capital
markets were essentially perfect and therefore that rates of return are
equalized internationally just as "water seeks its own level." But by his 1980
paper, Harberger concludes: "My own intuition does not want to accept the notion
that increments of investment activity are in all or nearly all countries effec-
tively 100 percent "financed" by funds flowing in from abroad, and that incre-
ments in saving simply spill out into the world capital markets. I find the
analor to a hydraulic system with perhaps a viscous fluid, in which the pipes
are partially clogged, and in which some vessels are separated by semipermeable
membranes, to be nore consonant with imj image of the world than the alternative
analog to a hydraulic system where the water flows freely through the system
and, essentially instantaneously, finds the same level everywhere." (p.. 336).
If that flow is slow enough, so that the tendency toward equalization imist be
measured in decades rather than months or even years, any relevant analysis zaist
regard the capital novements as incomplete and rates of return as potentially
unequal.

is   reconfirmed. There is no more support for the perfect capital mobility

hypothesis in the regression estimates for l974 through 1919 than there was in

the previous fifteen years.

           Since net foreign investment is equal to the difference between

domestic savings arid domestic investment, the strong association between

domestic investment and domestic savings iniplies that there is only a weak asso-

ciation between net foreign investment and domestic savings. The empirical ana-

lysis presented in section 2 decomposes net foreign investment and examines the

relation between each of the major components of net foreign investment and the

domestic saving rate. A different type of decomposition is suggested by the

essential equality of net foreign investment and the current account surplus.

Section 2 also examines the relation between the components of the current

account balance and the domestic saving rate. Neither of these analyses

suggests any change in the basic conclusion about the long—run independence of

international capital flows from domestic savings rates.

            Since domestic savings and domestic investment are parts of an inter-

dependent economic system, the regression of investment ratios on savings ratios

raises problems of estimation and interpretation. Section 3 discusses the

issues of identification and estimation with the help of a minimal theoretical

model of investment, savings and international capital flows. The analysis

indicates why cross—country data averaged over substantial periods are likely to

be a much nxre reliable basis for testing the hypothesis of perfect capital

mobility and for estimating structural paranenters than time series data for

individual countries.

            Section 1 then examines an explicit idel of portfolio choice that

shows why sustained changes in domestic savings may have only a small effect on

net   foreign investment in the long run and yet may also have a more substantial

effect on capital flows in the short run.

            There is a brief concluding section that comments on some of the

limitations of the current paper and that suggests direction for future

research.


1. The Effect of Saving on Domestic Investment

            The basic data for the present analysis are the ratios of investment

to GDP and savings to GDP for 17 OECD countries.     These ratios are calculated

using the current dollar magnitudes published by the OECD (1981) and therefore

adjusted by the OECD to a common set of statistical definitions.

            Table 1 presents the values of the saving and investment ratios and of

the differences between them. All of the figures refer to gross investment and

saving. The first three columns show the ian values of these ratios for each

country in the 15 year period from 1960 through l97. The comparable ratios

for the post—OPEC years 1975 through 1979 are shown in the next three columns.

            These figures show a striking increase in the absolute differences

between the domestic savings rate and the domestic investment rate. In the fif-

teen years ending in 197k, the difference between the average savings ratio and

the average investment ratio ranged from —0.030 (in Greece) to 0.018 (in the

Netherlands) with a mean of 0.007 and a standard deviation of 0.016. In

contrast, in the second half of the 1970s the range was from _O.012 (in Finland)



   The other seven OECD countries had to be excluded from the sample because
consistent data are not available for the entire period.

   5'rhese ratios differ from the ratios presented in Table 1 of Feldstein and
Horioka (1980) only because of data revisions.

            For virtually every industrial country, the second half of the l9TOs

represented a time when domestic investment exceeded domestic savings. This In

turn implied that net foreign investment was       negative   and therefore that the

current account was in deficit. The negative net foreign Investment for the

industrial countries as a whole in these years was largely a reflection of the

higher prices being paid for imported oil and the resulting surpluses of the

OPEC countries.

            Despite the substantial increase in the size and variability of inter-

national capital flows, the second half of the l9TOs showed the same strong ten-

dency for countries with high domestic savings rates to have high rates of

domestic investment. Table 2 presents estimates of the basic investment

equation:

where i Is domestic investment in country i, Si is domestic savings, Y1 is
GDP, and c is a random disturbance. The equation is estimated with the sample

of 17 countries listed in Table 1 and with the investment and savings ratios

averaged over several different subperiods as well as for the entire 20 year

period from 1960 through 1979.

            The estimate for the second halt of the 1970s indicates that an addi-

tional "dollar" (pound, franc, mark, etc) of domestic saving raised domestic
                                          —9—



investment     by 0.865 dollars with a standard error of 0.185.6   Comparison with

the other subperiods indicates that the response of investment to savings was at

least as high in this final period as in any of the earlier periods. This was
                               —2
true even though, as the lower B implies, there was more "unpredictable"

variation in domestic investment during this period.7

              For the 20 year period as a whole, each extra "dollar" of saving was

associated with 0.796 additional dollars of investment. With a standard error

of 0.112, this is clearly significantly different from zero at any relevant pro-

bability level. The alternative null hypothesis, i.e., that the coefficient of

SlY    is   1.0, can be rejected at a probability level of 10 percent, implying that

capital does tend to flow to countries with low savings rates although certainly

much less than perfect capital mobility would imply.

              The first five equations reported in Table 2 refer to gross saving and

gross investment. Since capital accumulation depends on net investment, it is

interesting to consider also the relation between net investment and net saving.

Since this requires subtracting an estimate of depreciation from both variables,

any error in measuring depreciation will tend to bias the estimated coefficient

toward one. This potential bias is consistent with the result presented in the

sixth equation of Table 2 that shows a coefficient of 0.99 for the regression of

the net investment ratio on the net savings rate.

       the equation is estimated in level form rather than ratio form, the coef-
ficient is very close to one but this reflects the pure scale effect. Only
ratio equations are therefore presented in this paper.

   TThese differences in domestic investment reflected such things as differen-
cesin the response of profitability and of capacity utilization to the 1973
OPEC shock and to the rising rates of inflation.

             If   there were no problems of measuring savings, investment and inter-

national transactions, the difference between gross domestic savings and gross

domestic investment would be equal to the balance on current account (CA). This

suggests that, instead of using the conventional national income account measure

of domestic savings, the value of gross domestic savings could be defined as the

sum   of   gross domestic investment and the current account balance: S =     I + CA. 8
The basic equation is reestimated for the decade of the 1970s with this derived

measure of savings and presented in the final line of Table 2. The coefficient

of 0.886 is only slightly higher than the previous estimate of 0.8143 for this

decade and show that this source of measurement error does not influence the

basic result.

             The estimation of equation 1 with a cross section of country averages

implicitly assumes that each country's disturbance is purely random and uncorre—

lated with the savings ratio. If country investment rates do differ systemati-

cally for some reason that is not directly related to the savings ratio,

equation 1 should be replaced by an equation in which the constant term is

allowed to differ among countries:


                                 __                   ___ +                      (2)

If equation 2 is the correct specification but equation 1 is estimated, the

coefficient of       will be biased if      is correlated with the savings ratio.

             This potential source of bias can be eliminated by extending the ana-

lysis to two      observations   for each country so that the constant values of the

czjs can be eliminated. If equation 2 is generalized by assuming that     all
investment ratios may shift by a constant amount iS between times t and t', the

new specification may be written9:



     'it                                   1

Defining   the latter period as 1973 through 1979 (i.e., the years affected by the

OPEC price shock) and the earlier period as the previous seven "pre—OPEC" years

implies an estimate of     of 1.0214 with a standard error of 0.227 and an estimate

of 6 of 0.013 with a standard error of 0.005. The          for this equation is

0.55. Thus countries that increased their saving between the earlier period and

the later period found that their investment increased on average by an equal

amount between the two dates. There is certainly no support in this estimate

for the view that increases in saving merely augmented the total world supply of

funds and that such capital was allocated among countries in unconstrained pur—
                                     10
suit of the highest rate of return.

           An alternative method of estimating equation 2 is to use each of the

annual observations in a pooled cross—section of time series. Using data for

the entire 20 year period11 implies an estimate of 0.771 for with a standard



   9Although the uj'S are eliminated by first differencing in this way, they can
be estimated in a second step once   and iS are estimated. The procedure is
exactly equivalent to estimations with individual constant terms and two obser-
vations for each country.

   10The use of differences in saving and investment ratios may cause sinulta—
neous equations bias that is not present in the estimates of Table 2. This is
discussed in section 3.

   Some individual annual observations are missing, reducing the sample
to 320 observations.
                                                 —13—


error of 0.0146, very similar to the estimate of 0.796 shown in ble 2 and

obtained when       the   annual data are   averaged     to produce a single value for each

country.

                The similarity of the estimates with individual constant terms                   and
with averaged data suggests that including the individual constant terms

has little effect on the estimate of 8.                This is confirmed when equation 1           is
reestimated with individual annual observations for all countries for the twenty

year period. The estimate of 8 is 0.791 with                 a standard       error of 0.031, vir-

tually identical to the estimates in ¶Lble 2.

                The use of individual annual observations makes it possible to esti-

mate a more general dynamic relation between savings and investment. When a

lagged value of the savings ratio is added to the basic specification, its coef-

ficient is relatively small and negative:



            1                            S.                         Si,
                                            it
                    = 0.0714 + 0.832               —     0.109       .                            (14)
           Yit                  (0.033) 'it             (0.033) t_i

                                                                                      =   0.68

The negative coefficient of the lagged savings variable suggests that investment

does   not adjust to savings gradually but overadjusts at first. The coefficients
of further lagged values are smaller and not statistically significant.
Finally, using      the annual observations to estimate the average effect of year to

year changes in saving among         all countries indicates that:

    'it         —   Ii,t1      =   —0.0001 +     0.863
                                                              Sit         —      Si,t—l            ()

                                             —1 4—




Thus, even year to year increases in saving tend on average to be associated
with increases in domestic investment in the saving country by approximately
                  12
equal amounts.


2. Domestic Savings and the Components of International Capital Flows

           The basic investment equation can be rewritten in terms of net foreign

investment   and then used to analyze the relation between saving and the com-
ponents of international capital flows. More specifically, subtracting the
savings ratio from both sides of equation 1 and multiplying by minus one yields

                        S]• —   Ij    =   —a+ (1—8)                 —                  (6)
                          Yi                               Yi


The national income accounts divide the excess of domestic saving over domestic
investment into net foreign investment (NFl) plus the statistical discrepancy in

the savings—investment account (SDS).13 Substituting this into equation 6

implies:



                                                      Si                SDS
                        NFl1         = — + (1—8)                —             +   ••   (T)

             If   SDS/Y were uncorrelated with the savings ratio, the estimate of

8   obtained from equation      7 would   be exactly the same as the estimate obtained
from equation 1. In fact, there is a small postive association between the sta—


   12Sections      3 and 1 show that the similarity of the coefficients based on long—
term averages      and annual changes may be subject to different interpretations.

   13The net foreign investment of the United States thus represents the net
investment abroad financed by savings in the United States.
                                           —15—


tistical discrepency ratio and the saving ratio in the sample, implying that the

estimate of        implied by estimating equation 7 with the decade averages of NFI/Y

and SlY for 1970 through 1979 yields:



                         NFIi                           S.'

                           Yi       (0.002) (0.785) Yi


The implied value of        is 0.908 and   therefore   slightly higher than the estimate

presented in Table 2. The coefficient of 0.092 implies that each extra "dollar"

of domestic saving causes a capital export of approximately 9 cents but the very

large standard error indicates that there is no statistically significant rela-

tion at all between net foreign investment and the domestic savings rate.1

             Net foreign investment can itself be decomposed into the four major

components of the international capital account (direct investment; portfolio

investment; other long—term capital flows; and short—term capital flows) plus

the total change in official reserves, the net errors and omissions, and a

remaining minor category of the official settlements balance. The lack of a

significant or substantial relation between domestic savings and net foreign

investment as a whole could in principal reflect a balancing of positive and

negative relationships among different components. For example, portfolio

investment outflows might respond positively to the domestic savings rate only

to be offset by changes in official reserves.

             In fact, in each of the separate regressions, the coefficient of the

savings ratio is always less than its standard error. There is no indication of



   ll4The   imich larger standard error in equation 8 than in Th.ble 2 reflects the
importance    of   the statistical discrepancy.
                                          —16—


a relation between sustained differences aung countries in savings rates and any

of   the components of net foreign investment.

            Net foreign investment is conceptually equal to the balance on current

account.'5 This suggests another decomposition that might be useful in analyzing

the effect of intercountry savings differences.16       The relation between the

current account balance and the savings ratio can be decomposed into the

separate effects of savings on: merchandise exports; nrchandise imports; other

credits for goods, services and investment income; other debits for goods, ser-

vices and investment income; private unrequited transfers; and public unrequited

transfers. None of the six regression coefficients relating a current account

component as a fraction of GD? to savings as a fraction of GD? had an absolute

value as large as 0.1 and none was as large as its standard error. The lack of

a significant relationship between the current account balance and savings

reflects a lack of relation between each of its components and savings.

            In short, the two decompositions that have been examined confirm the

finding of section 1 that there is no relation between sustained differences in

domestic savings rates and the external position of the country.


3. Parameter Identification and Estimation with Cross—Country and Time Series Data


            The regression of the domestic Investment ratio on the domestic

savings ratio is an intuitively appealing test of the hypothesis of perfect




   151n practice, the two numbers differ because of such things as the allocation
of special drawing rights and the statistical treatment of gold, extraordinary
military transactions, etc.

     l6Thjs analysis was   suggested   to me by Douglas Purvis.
                                               —17—


capital nobility. Nevertheless, there are fundamental problems of iden-

tification and estimation that should be considered when it is recognized that

both savings and investment are endogenous variables in an economic system.

Feldstein and Horioka (1980) discussed the problem of simultaneous equations

bias briefly and suggested that this was likely to be nuch less serious in esti-

mates based on cross—country data averaged over long periods of time than in

estimates based on annual time series for individual countries. As I noted in

the introduction to the present paper, instrumental variable estimates suggested

by a simultaneous equations model confirmed the ordinary least squares results.

          The current section presents an explicit model and uses it to assess

the regression of domestic investment on domestic saving as a test of the per-

fect capital mmbility bypothesis and, when international capital mobility is

less than perfect, as an estimate of the effect on domestic investment of endo—

genous shifts in domestic saving.

          The simplest del that is adequate for this purpose requires a

domestic investment function, a domestic savings function, a net foreign invest-

ment function, and a savings—investment equilibrium condition. I shall assume

that all investment is financed by issuing bonds and that the demand for gross

domestic investment (I) can be written as a function of the domestic real

interest rate (r)   plus   a random shock (u):


                             I   =   +(r)+u                                 (9)



with •' < 0. A similar specification of the domestic savings function

                            S =      (r)   +   v                            (10)
                                                 —18—


provides that the supply of saving is a nondecreasing function of the real

interest rate (ip'      0) plus a random shock.

          Writing N for net foreign investment (i.e., the net outflow of capital

from the home country), the net capital outflow in response to a higher interest

rate can be 'written:


                               N = n       (r)   + e                                   (ii)


where '   (r)   0 implies that a higher real domestic interest rate reduces (or

leaves unchanged if n' = 0) net foreign investment (or causes a greater net

inflow from abroad, i.e., a negative net foreign investment) and e is a random

shock. Perfect capital mobility implies that n' =               —. More   generally, r' could

differ between the short—run and the long—run and could vary among             countries   or

time periods. Some reasons for such differences are discussed below.

          Equilibrium in the goods rket requires that domestic saving equal

domestic investment plus net foreign investment:1T


                                             S=I+N                                     (12)



These four equations determine values for the four endogenous variables I, S, N

and r as functions of the three random distributions u, v and e.

           Substituting 9, 10 and 11 in 12 yields:



                          4(r) +   v   =   • (r)   + u + n   (r) +   e.                (13)




   1T1 a simple theoretical model, this is equivalent to the equilibrium con-
dition S = I + X — M where X is exports and M is imports since net foreign
investment equals the current account surplus.

Differentating and solving for the change in the real interest rate implies:


                                dr= du—dv+de                                               (i4)
                                                —   4,'    —


Since   ' )   0, 4,' < 0 and n'               0, the denominator is unambiguously positive.

Thus the interest rate rises when there is a positive shock to domestic invest-

ment demand (du > 0) or to the domestic demand for net foreign investment (de > 0).

          The effect of investment and savings shocks on net foreign investment

can be obtained by combining equations 11 and 14:


                        dN =   'dr +     de                                                (15)


                          =      fl'   Idu—dv+de]              + de
                                       — 4,' —



To interpret equation 15, recall that dN > 0 means an increased capital outflow

and that n'    (   0.     Thus an increase in domestic savings (dv > 0) causes an

increase in net foreign investment and therefore both a capital outflow and a

current account surplus. With perfect capital mobility, n'                  = — and   dN/dv =   1;
in this case, all of the additional domestic saving goes abroad. Similarly,

even with a finite value of n', an increase in domestic investment (du > 0)

causes a decrease in net foreign investment and therefore both a capital inflow

and a current account deficit.

          This brief description of the international effects of shifts in

domestic savings and investment has ignored the exchange rate novments that are

likely to occur as part of the process of change. An autonomous increase in



   l8Thj$ is the case discussed by Sachs (l981a, 1981b). I will return to his
empirical results later in this section.
                                                —20—


domestic investment demand (or decrease in savings) will raise the domestic

interest rate and cause a real appreciation of the home currency. With this

increase in the exchange rate there is a current account deficit that accomoda—

tes the capital inflow. The model is consistent with this exchange rate beha-

vior even though the exchange rate is not explicitly modelled.

              Combining equations 9 and 11t shows the relation between domestic

investment and a shift in domestic savings:


                          dl =         ' [du—dv+de]             + du                         (16)

With perfect capital mobility, n' =            —     and dI/dv =       0.   At the other extreme, if

international capital movements do not respond to the interest rate, n' = 0 and

Since 4)' <    0 and 4"        0, in this case dI/dv           1.   If 4" is "small" relative to

—4)', i.e., if the interest elasticity of savings is small relative to the

interest elasticity of investment, dI/dv will be close to 1.

          Now that the theoretical relation between domestic saving and invest-

ment has been clarified it is possible to examine more explicitly the interpre—

tation of the regression coefficient estimated by regressing the investment

ratio on the savings ratio, i.e., the coefficient of equation 1 estimated to be

approximately one in the cross—country regressions reported in Table 2. The
                                                  —21—



regression coefficient of equation 1              is the         ratio of the covariance between

investment and saving divided by the variance of saving. The variance of

savings can be   approximated    in terms of the current model in the following way.

First, differentiate equation 10 and eliminate dr with the help of equation 114

to obtain



                                *' [du—dv-s-de]
                        dS = __________________                           + dv.                           (19)
                                          — 4,? —



Now evaluate each of the derivatives at the mean value of the corresponding

variable, square both sides, and take expectations. Since the expected value of

the squared deviation from the xran is the variance,


  ass =     E(dS)2


       =
                          +

                                                               2aue)
                                                                            —   2*'('+T1')(a         +
                                                                                                          (20)

Similarly, combining equations 16 and 19 yields an approximation for the co—

            With the help of equation 22, we can now consider two questions.

First, what is the implication of perfect capital nbi1ity for the estimated

coefficient 8? Second, what is the relation between the estimated coefficient

8 and the effect on domestic investment of a shift in domestic saving (dI/dv)?


3.1 Testing the Perfect Capital Mobility Hypothesis

            With perfect capital mobility, r' = —       and 22 implies that

                      .
                              UV
                      8—                                                              (23)


Thus perfect capital mobility is consistent with a positive parameter estimate

only to the extent that the exogenous shifts in saving and investment are posi-

tively correlated. The likely magnitude of the correlation between savings and

investment shifts depends on the nature of the data.

            With time series observations for an individual country, d.nand shocks

could well make           > 0. A downturn in economic activity might cause savings to

be relatively low (because consumption depends on permanent income) and might

also cause investment to be relatively low (because of low capacity

utilization). Similarly, a supply shock that lowers income and profitability

might also reduce both saving and Investment. In either' of these cases, the

regression coefficient 8 could be positive and substantial even if there is per—
                                     —23—


fect capital mobility. Conversely time series data for an individual country

could also have     < 0; an exogenous temporary increase in the propensity to

save (dv > 0) could reduce aggregate output and thereby induce a decline in

investment (du < 0). Estimates of based on time series data for a single

country are thus an unreliable basis for evaluating the hypothesis of perfect

international capital mobility.19

          In contrast, when the sample is a cross—section of countries and the

observations for each country are averaged over a long period of time, there is

no reason to expect any correlations between intercountry differences in the exo-

genous component of saving and in the exogenous component of investment. These

intercountry saving differences reflect such things as the demographic structure

of the population, the extent to which unfunded social security substitutes for

private saving, the average level of government deficits, consumer credit and

mortgage arrangements, and the long—term rise in income since current retirees

were working and saving. Sustained differences in investment rates that are not

just a reflection of savings differences (through the effect of saving on the

cost of capital) reflect such things as business tax rules and the effects of

unions on profitability. The intercountry variance in exogenous investment

shifts is thus likely to be smaller than the intercountry variance in exogenous

saving shifts (atr < a) and the covariance between the two is likely to be

small or zero. If there is a nonzero covariance, there appears to be no pre-

sumption about its sign.



   '9Feldstein and Horioka estimated time—series regressions for individual
countries and presented the results in NBER Working Paper No. 310 but did not
include these time series estimates in the published version (Feldstein and
Horioka, 1980) because we concluded that the problem of simultaneous equations
bas meant that these individual country coefficients could not be interpreted
as estimates of the effect on investment of exogenous changes in saving.
                                         —2L—


              Equation 23 shows that the estimated values of 8 presented in Table 2

are not consistent with perfect capital mobility if         is zero or negative.

Moreover, even if there is a positive covariance between exogenous savings dif-

ferences and exogenous investment differences, the high values of the estimated

8's are not consistent with perfect capita1 mobility if the variance of the

savings shifts (a) is large relative to the variance of the investment shifts

            To see this, note that equation 23 can be rewritten:




                         =   ______________                                   (214)



                         =    Puy
                                    r_iavv


where p is the corelat ion between u and v. Since p ( 1, with perfect capital

mobility B is at most equal to the ratio of the standard deviation of the

investment shifts to the standard deviation of the savings shifts. Since the

observed estimates of B are approximately one, equation 214 shows that the evi-

dence is not consistent with both perfect capital mobility and a low ratio of

auu/ avv.

             it is easily shown that with perfect capital mobility the correlation

between savings and investment is the same as the correlation between u and



          perfect capital mobility, the regression of saving on investment pro-
duces a coefficient equal to     =

                                                                    ouv/avv

                                            —25—

The observed correlations between saving and investment (i.e., the square root

of the R2 values reported in Table 2) imply implausibily high correlations bet-

ween the exogenous components of saving and investment.

            In short, the identifying restriction in cross—country data that

uv     0 or that          is   small   is   sufficient to   permit interpreting the
observed   regressions of investment on savings presented in Table 2 as strong

evidence against perfect capital mobility. Alternatively, the restriction that

the correlation between exogenous saving and investment differences is not

greater than 0.5 also implies rejection of the perfect capital nobility hypothesis.

            Estimates of 8 based on a cross—country sample of changes in invest-

ment and saving provides a different type of evidence against the hypothesis of

perfect capital mobility. In such a regression, any association between the

levels of exogenous saving and investment effects is irrelevant. Instead,

     in equation 23 must be interpreted as a relation between shifts in saving

and shifts in investment. If countries in which the exogenous component of

saving has increased between two dates (or two periods) tend to be those

countries in which the exogenous component of investment has also increased,

     > 0 and the estimate of      can be high even if there is perfect capital mobi-

lity. The danger of this covariance being large Is greatest when the data can

reflect changes from one phase of a business cycle to the next.            It is

reassuring therefore that the estimate of 8 =         l.O1 based on the changes in
saving and investment reflected a comparison of two periods of six years

(1968—73 and l97—8O) and that similar results were obtained by Feldstein and

Horioka for a different set of years (8 = O.T21 with a standard error of 0.158

based on the changes for 1960—69 to 197O_T1).21


              the 1968—73 to l97I_8O comparison is influenced by the OPEC—induced
slowdown, the comparison based on the earlier pair of periods is not biased by a
supply shock.

3.2 Estimating dI/dv

          Under what plausible conditions does the estimate of B based on

equation 1 represent the effect on domestic investment of a shift in the exoge-.

nous factors influencing saving? Equivalently, when does the value of B given

in equation 22 equal the value of dI/dv shown in equation 17? And, more

generally, even when exact identification is not achieved, does B tend to dI/dv

as certain limiting conditions are achieved?

          Consider first the case in which saving rates are not sensitive to

the interest rate (4i' =   0) and in which the exogenous differences in saving
among countries are not correlated with exogenous differences in the domestic

investment function or the net foreign investment function (a = 0ve =        0).   In

this case, equations 22 and 17 ii1y that B =                  = dI/dv   and there is no

simultaneous equation bias.22

          Although these assumptions may   not   hold exactly, they may be a reaso-

nable approximation for cross—country data based on averages over extended

periods. In this context, the interest elasticities of domestic investment may

be high relative to the interest elasticity of domestic savings. Similarly, the

variance of domestic savings may be large relative to the covariance between

exogenous savings differences and exogenous differences in investment and net

foreign capital. The value of B in equation 22 tends to dI/dv as

        and ave/ayy all tend to zero.

          An alternative specification places no restriction on the interest

sensitivity of domestic savings but posits that the exogenous differences among



   22The assumptions of 4i' = 0 and ave =   a= 0 make the model recursive
with respect to S and therefore makes ordinary least squares an unbiased
estimator.
                                         —27—


countries in saving rates are large relative to the exogenous differences in

domestic and foreign investment: thus                    and aee/v are both small and

therefore auvla.vy, cevovy and uevv are also small. Taking the limit as

a, grows relative to the other variances and covariances implies that 8                     tends
to 4'/(+n'). Since the true value of dI/dv is $'/(q'+n'—ip), the estimate

overstates the true value. More specifically, the ratio of the sample estimate

(8) to the true value of dI/dv is (4' +         —4')/(c' + ri')       = 1 —

To express these as elasticities, let CSr =       4'r/S       be the saving elasticity,

Ir = —4'r/I be the investment elasticity and                  = —n'r/N be the elasticity of

net foreign investment, Thus



                                                   SE:
                   ______      =        1+               sr

                                                         + (N/I)c.


Since S/I is approximatley one and N/I is very close to zero, 8/(dI/dv) is

approximately 1 plus the ratio of E:Sr to            Most       empirical   research indicates

that this ratio is low and therefore that the relative bias in 8 is small.


3.3 The Regression of Savings on Investment

          In an interesting pair   of   papers, Jeffrey Sachs (1981a, 1981b) empha-

sized the response of international capital flows to temporary                shifts   in

domestic propensities to invest. Sachs showed that countries that increased

their share of investment in GD? between 1968—73 and 19714_T9 also              experienced
                                      —28—


substantial increases in net capital inflows, i.e., substantial decreases in net

foreign investment. As a leading example of this, Sachs pointed to the major

flow of capital into Norway that accompanied the Norwegian investment boom

caused by Norway's discovery of North Sea oil.

          Equation 26 is typical of the type of results reported by Sachs:23



                          NFl 1       = —0.227 — 0.561
                           Y      i        (0.039) (o.i)48)
                      L                                                            (26)

                                                               R =   o.1&6


where (NFI/Y) denotes the average NFI/Y ratio in country i in 197)4—79 minus

that ratio in 1968—73 and (i/y) denotes the corresponding change in the invest-

ment ratio. The paramenter estimate implies that one "dollar" increase in

domestic investment is associated with a net capital inflow of 0.56 dollars.

Thus, treating I/Y as the independent variable appears to imply that net capital

flows play a such more significant role.

          It would be wrong, however, to interpret —0.56 as an estimate of

dN/du. Unless the model is recursive with investment having no interest

elasticity (+' = 0) and no covariance between shifts in dometic investment and

shifts in either saving or foreign investment         =        =   o),   the regression
                                                          %e
coefficient will not be an unbiased estimate of dN/du. Since the equation is

based on changes in domestic investment and changes in capital flows, such lack

of covariance is unlikely. If, for example, a change in economic conditions

between the two periods caused not only an exogenous increase in domestic



   23The dependent variable in Sachs' equation is actually the current account
balance but results for the current account and for NFl are very similar.
                                          —29—


investment but also a shift from foreign investment to domestic investment

      >   0),   the absolute value of the estimated coefficient will overstate

the induced capital inflow.

            The ambiguity that results from using the change form of the

regression can be avoided by examining the relation between the level of net

foreign investment and the level of domestic investment. Since net foreign

investment is essentially equal to the excess of domestic saving over domestic

investment, an alternative specification is the regression of the domestic

saving ratio on the domestic investment ratio, i.e., just reversing the left and

right hand variables of equation 1. The finding of a regression coefficient

significantly less than one irrp1ies that intercountry differences in investment

are associated with international capital flows to finance that investment.2

            For the final five years of the data (l9T'—T9), the results with such

a specification support Sachs' view. The regression coefficient in the

regression of SlY on I/Y is 0.66 with a standard error of O.iI. Thken at face

value, this implies that each extra dollar of exogenous domestic investment

induces a capital inflow of 3 cents.25

            The most recent five years are however an unusual subperiod. For the

entire twenty year period, the regression of S/Y on i/Y is O.9 with a standard

error of 0.13. The point estimate thus implies that each dollar of additional

domestic investment is associated with a net capital inflow of only 6 cents;

with a standard error of 13 cents, this is clearly not significantly different



   2l4There are of course still identification problems in interpreting the
regression coefficient as an estimate of dS/du (and therefore making inferences
about d(S—I)/du) but these are similar to the ones discussed in sections 3.1 and
32.

from zero. Similarly, for the decade of the 1960s the regression of SlY on I/Y

is 1.05 with a standard error of 0.12 while for the first half of the 1970s the

regression coefficient is 0.88 with a standard error of 0.13.

            One possible interpretation is that conditions have changed in the

mid—1970s to make international capital flows more sensitive to differences in

yields. To support this one might     point     to the end of the U.S. interest equali—

zation tax in 1974, to the growth of the Eurodollar market and of the OPEC

balances, and to the relaxation of restrictions on portfolio investment that

were occurring in a variety of OECD countries (0.E.C.D., 1980). Nevertheless,

there is also the alternative possibility that the regression coefficient for

this brief period provides a biased estimate of dS/du because of a temporary

covariance among the "exogenous" saving and investment factors during this unu—

sual period. Only further time will tell.

            It is clear, however, that for the previous fifteen years, the

regressions of SLY on I/Y as yell as the regressions of' I/Y on S/Y support the

conclusion that higher levels of domestic investment do not induce foreign capi-

tal inflows but can only be financed by domestic saving.


4. Portfolio Adjustment and Capital Flows in the Long Run and         the   Short Run

            The analysis of section 3 indicates that the regression estimates are

more relevant as a guide to the long—run response of international capital xve—
ments to changes in domestic savings and investment than to their           short—run

response.    Coefficient estimates based on annual variations in savings and

investment are   subject   to potentially severe simultaneous eq.uatiOn bias that is

not present when annual observations are averaged over a decade or more and the

regression   is estimated with a cross—country sample of these averages. The
                                              —31—


 empirical estimates based on such data that were presented in sections 1 and 2

 imply that, for the 1960s and 1970s as a whole, higher savings rates induce

 higher rates of domestic investment but virtually no increase in net foreign

 investment.

           The behavior of capital flows in the short run may be quite different.

Although the empirical analysis of sections 1 and 2 is not directly relevant,

theoretical considerations suggest that the short—run response of international

capital flows to changes in domestic saving may be much greater than the long—

run response. The essential reason for this is that the short—run capital flow

is part of a once—for—all adjustment of the international portfolio. When the

adjustment is complete, the rate of capital flow returns to a lower level

governed by the rate of growth of the world capital stock and the share of
                                                           26
international assets in the equilibrium portfolio.

          To make these ideas nxre precise, consider an investor who divides his

portfolio between domestic and foreign assets. Domestic assets earn an uncer-

tain return, r, with subjective mean i and subjective variance a00. Foreign

assets earn an uncertain return, r*, with subjective mean ji and variance

      The covariance between the returns is a. If the investor's preferences

can be summarized by a utility function that is a quadratic function of the

portfolio return, the investor well maximize

   26Although early models of Mundell (1968) and others id not distinguish bet-
ween the adjustment phase and the steady state flow, the importance of
distinguishing a temporary capital flow as part of a once—for—all capital stock
adjustment has been recognized at least since Branson (1970). See also Branson
(1979), Cumby and Obstfeld (1982), Girton and Henderson (1977) arid Obstfeld (1981).

Where E    is   the expectations operator, p is                  the      proportion of the portfolio
invested    abroad, and y > 0 is a asure of risk aversion.

             The first order maximization conditions implies that the optimal pro-

portion invested abroad (*) is:

the denominator is y times the variance of r_r* and is therefore unambiguously
positive. The numerator is easier to discuss if we replace a by pAa00 where
p is the correlation between r and r* and                             =            the ratio of the foreign

variance to the domestic variance. Thus

                It is clear that        even if          the foreign expected      return exceeds the
domestic     return (ij*     > t), the          investor may not wish to invest abroad, i.e.,

domestic and foreign rates of return (reflecting, for example, the international

business cycle or common long—term trends in productivity and profitability) and

(2) the subjective variance on the foreign return exceeds the subjective

variance on the domestic return. The subjective variance on the foreign return

may be very large because investors lack information about the foreign econonw,

its individual firms, accounting practices, etc.27 If p <                              0,   the investor may

the difficulty that foreign investors have in getting information on Japanese
securities: "A foreigner here once asked a Japanese securities salesman where

about U.S. firms.

 be constrained to a corner solution with no foreign investment. It is clear

 that since A reflects subjective variances, investors
                                                             in two countries may both
 decide not to invest in the other's securities.

              Conversely, equation 29 implies that p' may be greater than zero even
 jf jj*   < ii if   foreign investing provides a useful diversification, i.e., if

 pA < 1.     Thus investors in two countries may both decide to invest in the

 other's securities even if they have accurate assessments of the expected rates

 of return.

             A sustained increase in the domestic saving rate raises capital inten-

 sity at home and thereby depresses the expected rate of return, ii.      This unam-
 biguously raises p", implying that some of the additional capital should be

 invested abroad.28 If the initial p is negative, however, the increase in p

may still leave the actual p at a constrained corner solution of       p = 0.   In

this case, domestic investors do not seek to transfer any of the additional

saving abroad. The increased domestic saving may nevertheless lead to an

increase in net foreign investment if foreign investors respond to the lower

expected return by reducing their overseas investment. In terms of equation 29,

from the point of view of foreign investors iJ has fallen, causing an unam-

biguous reduction in p". Again, however, if foreign investors were originally

not investing abroad, the reduction in the expected return would have no effect.

Thus portfolio considerations alone could explain why a change in domestic

saving in one country would have no effect on its net foreign investment.




   28m.      is
             unambiguous only because I assume that the increase in domestic
capital has no effect on the variance of the return or the risk aversion
parameter.
           Ignoring the possibility of corner solutions, a sustained exogenous

increase in domestic saving will, by reducing the expected domestic rate of

return, raise p' and cause a capital outflow. This will be reinforced by

foreign investors who respond to the lower expected return by reducing their

overseas investment. The response of p' to the change in i is inversely propor-

tional to y(a +        —
                           2o).   The greater the risk aversion (y) or the uncer-

tainty about domestic and foreign rates of return (a and ),        the   smaller

will be the change in p. Thus, even for countries that do have overseas port-

folio investments, the effect of a change in the expected return on domestic or

foreign investment may be a relatively small change in the optimal allocation of

assets between home and abroad.

           It is useful, however, to divide the response of international invest-

ment into two coonents. rst, a sustained increase in the domestic saving

rate alters i*p and therefore changes p* for both domestic and foreign

investors. There is then a relatively brief period during which portfolios are

readjusted to the new optimal mix.3° During this readjustment there is a relati-

vely large increase in the rate of net foreign investment.     The shorter the time

period during which the adjustment occurs, the greater will be the rate of net

foreign investment per unit of time. Once the adjustment is complete, p

remains unchanged. As the national capital stocks at home and abroad grow over

time with the economies, the fraction p will flow    abroad.   Net foreign invest-

ment   during this steady state growth will be the difference between the steady

 state outflow of funds by domestic investment and the steady state inflow of

 funds from foreign investors. Although the evidence of sections 1 and 2 indica-

tes that this long—run response to a sustained shift in domestic saving is quite

 small, the short—run response during a brief period of transition could be quite
 sustained.


 5. Concluding Comments

              The evidence and analysis in this paper support the earlier findings

of Feldstein and Horioka (1980) that sustained increases in domestic savings

rates induce approximately equal increases in domestic investment rates.

Although this limited extent of international capital nobility is consistent

with the portfolio model developed in section 1, there are clearly other aspects

of both international portfolio investment and international direct investment

that should be taken into account in explaining the observed mobility.

          Government policies establish the framework for private international

investing. Governments of OECD countries have sought to restrict both capital

inflows and capital outflows, including both direct and portfolio investment.

Even the United States, perhaps the most liberal of the OECD countries in its

attitude to capital nvements, restricts the class of institutions that can

invest abroad and thereby reduces the total volume and sensitivity of foreign

investment. It would be useful to examine the capital restriction policies in

detail, to evaluate their effectiveness and to understand the reasons ihy

governments nay choose to restrict international capital movements.31



   310ne such reason, the    ability
                                  of foreign governments' to capture the tax reve-
nue of foreign investment, is discussed in Feldstein (1982).

           More generally, although net capital flows do not appear to be sen-

sitive to domestic saving rates, a stable pattern of net capital flows exists.

It would   be   desirable to examine the reasons for this stable pattern and, in

particular, to resolve the puzzling fact that substantial gross capital flows

produces relatively small net capital flows.
