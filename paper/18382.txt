                                              ABSTRACT

We construct factors from a cross section of exchange rates and use the idiosyncratic deviations from
the factors to forecast. In a stylized data generating process, we show that such forecasts can be effective
even if there is essentially no serial correlation in the univariate exchange rate processes. We apply
the technique to a panel of bilateral U.S. dollar rates against 17 OECD countries. We forecast using
factors, and using factors combined with any of fundamentals suggested by Taylor rule, monetary
and purchasing power parity (PPP) models. For long horizon (8 and 12 quarter) forecasts, we tend
to improve on the forecast of a “no change” benchmark in the late (1999-2007) but not early (1987-1998)
parts of our sample.

                                           1. INTRODUCTION

        In predictions of floating exchange rates between countries with roughly similar inflation rates, a

random walk model works very well. The random walk forecast is one in which the (log) level of the

nominal exchange rate is predicted to stay at the current log level; equivalently, the forecast is one of “no

change” in the exchange rate. This forecast works well at various horizons, from one day to three years. It

does well in the following sense: the out of sample mean squared (or mean absolute) error in predicting

exchange rate movements generally is about the same, and often smaller, than that of models that use

“fundamentals” data on variables such as money, output, inflation, productivity, and interest rates. Classic

references are Meese and Rogoff (1983a,b); a recent update is Cheung, Chinn and Garcia Pascual (2005).

        Whether or not this stylized regularity is bad news for economic theory is unclear. Some economists

think the regularity is very bad news. Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2006,p552) describe it as “...the major

weakness of international macroeconomics.” On the other hand, Engel and West (2005) argue that a near

random walk is expected under certain conditions.1

        Whether or not one thinks the empirical finding of near random walk behavior is bad news for

economic theory, it is of interest to try to tease out connections (if any) between a given exchange rate and

other data. A small literature has used panel data techniques to forecast exchange rates, finding relatively

good success (Mark and Sul (2001), Rapach and Wohar (2004), Groen (2005), Engel et al. (2008)). A very

large literature has found that factor models do a good job forecasting basic macro variables.2 The present

paper predicts exchange rates, via factor models, in the context of panel data estimation, and compares the

predictions to those of a random walk via root mean squared prediction error.

        The panel consists of quarterly data on 17 bilateral US dollar exchange rates with OECD countries,

1973-2007. We construct factors from the exchange rates. We take the literature on predicting exchange

rates to suggest that the exchange rate series themselves have information that is hard to extract from

observable fundamentals. This information might be hard to extract because standard measures of


                                                        1
fundamentals (e.g., money supplies and output) are error ridden, or because we simply lack any direct

measures of non-standard fundamentals such as risk premia or noise trading.3

        We compare four different forecasting models to a benchmark model that makes a “no change”

forecast–the random walk model. One of our four models uses factors but no other variables to forecast.

The other three use factors along with some measures of observable fundamentals. The three measures of

observable fundamentals are: (1)those of a “Taylor rule” model; (2)those of a monetary model; (3)deviations

from purchasing power parity (PPP). Our measure of forecasting performance is root mean squared

prediction error (root MSPE).

        On balance, these models have lower MSPE than does a random walk model for long (8 and 12

quarter) horizon predictions over the late part of our forecasting sample (1999-2007). These differences,

however, are usually not significant at conventional levels. Predictions that span the entire two decades

(1987-2007) or the early part (1987-1998) of our forecast sample generally have higher MSPE than does a no

change forecast. (Different samples involve different currencies, because of the introduction of the Euro in

1999.) The basic factor model, and the factor model supplemented by PPP fundamentals, do best. We

recognize that the good performance in the recent period may be ephemeral. But we are hopeful that our

approach will prove useful in other datasets.

        We close this introduction with some cautions. First, we make no attempt to justify or defend the

use of out of sample analysis. We and others have found such analysis useful and informative. But we

recognize that some economists might disagree. Second, judgment (sometimes rather arbitrary) has been

used at various stages, so we are not (yet) proposing a completely replicable strategy. Third, our exercise is

not “true” out of sample. For example, revised rather than real time data are used in some specifications.

We use revised data because we are using out of sample analysis as a model evaluation tool, and the models

presume that the best available data are used. More importantly, perhaps, our exercise is not true out of

sample because we have relied on research that has already examined exchange rates during parts of our


                                                       2
forecasting sample. The most pertinent reference is Engel et al. (2008), which used similar data, spanning

1973-2005 (vs. 1973-2007). Finally, we limit ourselves to simple linear models; papers such as Bulut and

Maasoumi (2012) suggest that such model miss essential features of exchange rate data.

        Section 2 presents a stylized model that illustrates analytically why our approach might predict well.

Section 3 describes our empirical models, section 4 our data and forecast evaluation techniques. Section 5

presents empirical results, section 6 robustness checks. Section 7 concludes. An appendix includes some

algebraic details. Some additional appendices, available on request, present detailed empirical results omitted

from the paper to save space.


                   2. WHY A FACTOR MODEL MAY FORECAST WELL
        In this section, we present a factor model and a simple data generating process that motivates its use.

        Our basic presumption is that the deviation of the exchange rate from a measure of central tendency

will help predict subsequent movements in the exchange rate. Algebraically, let


(2.1)   sit = log of exchange rate in country i in period t,

        zit = measure of central tendency defined below.


For concreteness, we note that sit is measured as log(foreign currency units/U.S. dollar), though that is not

relevant to the present discussion. Algebraically, our basic presumption is that for a horizon h, sit+h-sit can be

predicted by zit-sit, maybe using two different measures of z in a single regression.

        Many papers have relied on the same presumption (that sit+h-sit can be predicted by zit-sit). For

example, Mark (1995) sets zit in accordance with the “monetary model”, so that zit depends on money

supplies and output levels; Molodstova and Papell (2008) set zit in accordance with a “Taylor rule” model, so

that zit depends on the exchange rate, inflation rates, output gaps and parameters of monetary policy rules;

Engel et al. (2008) set zit in accordance with PPP, so that zit depends on price levels. Some papers (see

references above) have used these specifications of zit in the context of panel data. Our twist is to construct

                                                         3
one measure of zit from factors estimated from the panel of exchange rates.

          To exposit the idea, consider the following example. Suppose that the i’th exchange rate follows the

process


(2.2)     sit = Fit + vit.


Here, Fit is the effect the factor has on currency i; in a one factor model, for example Fit = δif1t where f1t is

the factor and δi is the factor loading for currency i. The idiosyncratic shock vit is uncorrelated with Fit. For

simplicity, make as well some further assumptions not required in our empirical work, namely, that Fit

follows a random walk and that vit is i.i.d.:


(2.3)     Fit = Fit-1 + εit, εit ~ i.i.d. (0, σ2ε), vit ~ i.i.d. (0, σ2v), Eεitvis=0 all t, s.


An i subscript is omitted from the variances σ2ε and σ2v for notational simplicity.

          Then Δsit = εit + vit - vit-1 and the univariate process followed by Δsit is clearly an MA(1), say


(2.4)     Δsit = ηit + θηit-1, Eη2it/σ2η, |θ|<1.


Here, ηit is the Wold innovation in Δsit. The variance of ηit and the value of θ can be computed in

straightforward fashion from the values of σ2ε and σ2v.4

          Let us compare population forecasts of Δsit+1 using the factor model (2.2), the MA(1) model (2.4),

and a random walk model. As above, let “MSPE” denote “mean squared prediction error.” Unless otherwise

stated, in this section MSPE refers to a population rather than sample quantity. (This contrasts to the

discussion of our empirical work below, in which MSPE refers to a sample quantity.) To forecast using

(2.2), observe that Δsit+1 = ΔFit+1 + Δvit+1 = εit+1 + vit+1 - vit Y EtΔsit+1 = -vit / Fit-sit Y


(2.5)     forecast error from factor model = εit+1 + vit+1, MSPEfactor = σ2ε + σ2v.



                                                                    4
The MSPE from the univariate model (2.4) is of course σ2η. With a little bit of algebra, and using the formula

for σ2η given in the previous footnote, it may be shown that σ2ε+σ2v < σ2η. Hence the factor model has a lower

MSPE than the MA(1) model.

        But the relevant issue is whether the improvement (i.e., the fall) in the MSPE is notable, for a

plausible data generating process. A plausible data generating process (DGP) would be one in which there is

very little serial correlation in Δsit. Put differently, if the DGP is such that the MSPE from the MA(1) model

is essentially the same as that from a random walk model, is it still possible that the MSPE from the factor

model is substantially smaller than that of the random walk?

        In our empirical work, we use Theil’s U-statistic to compare (sample) MSPEs relative to that of a

random walk. These are square roots of the following ratio: sample MSPE alternative forecast / sample

MSPE forecast of no change. The forecast error of the random walk model is the actual change in Δsit =εit

+vit-vit-1; the corresponding population MSPE is σ2ε+2σ2v. In the context of the present section (population

rather than MSPEs), define population U-statistics as


(2.6)   Ufactor = [ (σ2ε+σ2v)/ (σ2ε+2σ2v) ] ½, UMA = [ σ2η/(σ2ε+2σ2v) ] ½.


For select values of the first order autocorrelation of Δsit (which is approximately the MA parameter θ

introduced in (2.4)), these are as follows:


(2.7a) corr(Δsit, Δsit-1)              -0.01    -0.02           -0.03        -0.04     -0.05     -0.10
(2.7b) UMA                              0.99995 0.9998           0.9996       0.9992    0.9987    0.9949
(2.7c) Ufactor                          0.995    0.990           0.985        0.980     0.975     0.949


The factor model improves on the moving average model by an order of magnitude. For example, when the

first order autocorrelation of Δsit is -0.10, the population root MSPE for the MA model is only .5% lower

than for the random walk (because .9949 is about .5% smaller than 1), while the population root MSPE for

the factor model is about 5% lower than the random walk.


                                                              5
        We further note that the population values for UMA in (2.7b) are so near 1 that in practice, for any of

the values of the autocorrelations, one would not be surprised if sampling error in estimation of an MA(1)

model led to sample U-statistics above 1. Hence we view the figures in the table as consistent with the

well-established finding that no univariate model predicts better than a random walk. But clearly the factor

model has the potential to predict better, even accepting the point that in practice the best univariate model is

a random walk.

        In the simple DGP consisting of (2.2) and (2.3), whether a factor model will have lower MSPE than

a model that uses information not only on exchange rates but also on fundamentals such as prices and output

depends on whether the additional variables help pin down vit. To allow for this possibility, our empirical

work combines factors with observable fundamentals, as discussed in the next section.


                                            3. EMPIRICAL MODELS

        We use models with one, two or three factors. We will use the three factor model for illustration.

The one and two factor models are analogous. In the three factor model, we first estimate a set of three

factors and factor loadings from the exchange rates. For currency i, i=1, ...,17, the model is


(3.1)   sit = constant + δ1i f1t + δ2i f2t + δ3i f3t + vit

           / constant + Fit + vit.


The factors (the f’s) are unobserved I(1) variables. Here and throughout, we do not attempt to test for unit

roots in the factors or any other variable for that matter. See Bai (2004) on estimation of factor models with

unit root data.

        Let Fit = δ1i f1t + δ2i f2t + δ3i f3t. We aim to use (estimates of) Fit to forecast sit. In contrast to much

work with factors, the factors are not constructed from a set of additional variables. For example, in Groen’s

(2006) work on exchange rates, factors are constructed from data on real activity and prices, and take the

place of traditional measures of real and nominal activity. We take the literature on predicting exchange

                                                             6
rates to suggest that the exchange rate series themselves may have low frequency information on common

trends that is hard to extract from observable fundamentals. This low frequency information might be buried

in standard, but noisy, measures of fundamentals such as relative money supplies and relative outputs. Or

this information might be embedded in non-standard measures of fundamentals that are sufficiently persistent

that they function in part to drive common trends; examples are persistent risk premia or persistent noise

trading. Put differently, we use factors to parsimoniously capture co-movements of exchange rates that are

not well-captured by observable fundamentals. Crudely, we posit that a weighted average of the log levels of

exchange rates represents a central tendency for the log level a given exchange rate, and use this weighted

average to help forecast.

         Mechanics are as follows. We assume that the factors component soaks up a common unit root

component in the s’s. That is, we assume that Fit-sit is stationary, and may be useful in predicting

(stationary) future changes in sit. We do not attempt to test stationarity of vit; our selection of number of

factors was based on presumed limitations of a panel of cross-section dimension 17.5 The factors f1t, f2t and

f3t are uncorrelated by construction. We normalize the f’s to have mean zero and unit variance.

         So this first stage produces a time series for ^f1t, ^f2t and ^f3t and factor loadings, δ^ 1i, i=1,...,17; δ^ 2i,

i=1,...,17; δ^ 3i, i=1,...,17. In our simplest specification, the measure of central tendency zit that was introduced

in (2.1) is


(3.3)    zit = δ^ 1i ^f1t + δ^ 2i ^f2t + δ^ 3i ^f3t / F
                                                      ^
                                                        it.


                                     ^      ^ ^       ^ ^       ^ ^
In this simplest specification, with F it / δ1i f1t + δ2i f2t + δ3i f3t , for quarterly horizons h=1, 4, 8, and 12 we

use a standard panel data estimator (least squares with dummy variable) to estimate and forecast. For

example, with a horizon of h=4 quarters, we estimate


                            ^
(3.4)    sit+4-sit = αi + β(F it-sit) + uit+4,




                                                               7
where αi is a fixed effect for country i. We then use α^ i and β^ to predict (some details below). Here, and in all

of our specifications, there is no “time effect” (in the jargon of panel data): the factors are dynamic versions

of time effects (we hope).

        Our three other specifications combine factors with observables. The other three specifications are

all of the form


                           ^
(3.5)   sit+h-sit = αi + β(F it - sit) + γ(zit-sit) + uit+h,



for three different zit’s. Let country 0 refer to the USA. The three zit’s are:

                                                                ~ ~                       ~
(3.6)   Taylor rule:                   zit = 1.5(πit-π0t)+0.5(y it-y 0t)+sit; π = inflation, y = output gap;
                                                                              ~ ~
                                                 zit-sit = 1.5(πit-π0t)+0.5(y it-y 0t);

(3.7)   monetary model:                zit = (mit-m0t)-(yit-y0t); m = ln(money), y=ln(output);

(3.8)   PPP model:                     zit = pit-p0t; p=ln(price level).


The Taylor rule model builds on the recently developed view that interest rates rather than money supplies

are the instrument of monetary policy. Expositions may be found in Benigno and Benigno (2006), Engel and

West (2006) and Mark (2008). The monetary model was for many years the workhorse of international

monetary economics; see, for example the textbook exposition in Mark (2001) or the abbreviated summary

in Engel and West (2005). The PPP model (3.6) presumes convergence of price levels.


                            4. DATA AND FORECASTING EVALUATION
        We use quarterly data, 1973:1-2007:4, with the out of sample period beginning in 1987:1. The

basic data source is International Financial Statistics, supplemented on occasion by national sources.

Exchange rates are end of quarter values of the US dollar vs. the currencies of 17 OECD countries: Australia,

Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Korea, Netherlands, Norway,

Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. (See below on how we handled conversion to the

                                                                 8
Euro in 1999:1.) The price level is the CPI in the last month of the quarter; output is industrial production in

last month of the quarter; money is M1 (with some complications); the output gap is constructed by HP

detrending, computed recursively, using only data from periods prior to the forecast period. Because some

of the data appeared to display seasonality, we seasonally adjusted prices, output and money by taking a four

quarter average of the log levels before doing any empirical work. For example the price level in country i is

pit = ¼[log(CPIit) + log(CPIit-1) + log(CPIit-2) + log(CPIit-3)].

         To explain the mechanics of our forecasting work, let us illustrate for the four quarter horizon (h=4),

for the first forecast, and for the model that uses only factors but not additional observable fundamentals.

As depicted in (4.1) below, we use data from 1973:1 to 1986:4 to estimate factors and factor loadings, and
          ^
construct F it for i=1,...,17.

(4.1)    --------------data used to estimate factors--------------
         ----data used to estimate panel regression----
         |___________________________________|_____|_____|
                                                       85:4 86:4 87:4

We then use right hand side data from 1973:1 to 1985:4 to estimate panel data regression


                           ^
(4.2)    sit+4-st = αi + β(F it-sit) + uit+4, t=1973:1, ..,1985:4.



We use 1986:4 data to predict the 4 quarter change in s:


(4.3)    Prediction of (si,1987:4-si,1986:4) = α^ i + β(
                                                      ^ ^
                                                         Fi,1986:4-si,1986:4).


We then add an observation to the end of the sample, and repeat.

         As is indicated by this discussion, the recursive method is used to generate predictions: observations

are added to the end of the estimation sample, so that the sample size used to estimate factors and panel data

regressions grows. The direct (as opposed to iterated) method is used to make multiperiod predictions. The

estimation technique is maximum likelihood, assuming normality.

         An analogous setup is used for other horizons and for models with observable fundamentals.


                                                                 9
        For a given date, factors and r.h.s. variables are identical across horizons: for given t, the same
          ^
values of F it-sit are used. However, the l.h.s. variable is different (h period difference in st), and regression

samples are smaller for larger h. This means that the regression coefficients (α^ i, β)
                                                                                     ^
                                                                                        and predictions vary with

h.

        For the 9 non-Euro currencies (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Japan, Korea, Norway, Sweden,

Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), we report “long sample” forecasting statistics for a 1987-2007

sample. For all 17 currencies, we report “early” sample forecasting statistics for a 1987-1998 sample. For the

9 non-Euro currencies and the Euro, we report “late sample” forecasting statistics for a 1999-2007 sample.

Early sample statistics involve forecasts whose forecast base begins in 1986:4 and ends in 1998:4. Towards

the end of the early sample, the forecast occurs in the pre-Euro era, while the realization occurs during the

Euro era. We rescaled Euro area currencies so that there was no discontinuity. See Table 1 for the exact

number of forecasts for each sample and horizon, as well as a summary listing of models.

        In all samples (long, early and late), we use data from all 17 countries to construct factors and panel

data estimates. For post-1999 data, the left hand side variable in both factor and panel data estimation is

identical for all 8 Euro area countries. But because all samples include some pre-1999 data in estimation,
                                                                  ^
there are differences across countries in estimates of the factor F it, and of course the measures of prices,

output and money used in the PPP, monetary and Taylor rule models. This means that the forecasts are

different for the Euro countries. We construct a Euro forecast by simple averaging of the 8 different

forecasts.

        Our measure of forecast performance is root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE). (Here and

through the rest of the paper, all references to MSPE and RMSPE refer to sample rather than population

values.) We compute Theil’s U-statistic, the ratio of the RMSPE from each of our models to the RMSPE

from a random walk model. We summarize results by reporting the median (across 17 countries) of the

U-statistic, and the number of currencies for which the ratio is less than one (since a value less than one


                                                         10
means our model had smaller RMSPE than did a random walk). Individual currency results are available on

request.

           A U-statistic of 1 indicates that the (sample) RMSPEs from the factor model and from the random

walk are the same. As argued by Clark and West (2006, 2007), this is evidence against the random walk

model. If, indeed, a random walk generates the data, then the factor model introduces spurious variables into

the forecasting process. In finite samples, attempts to use such variables will, on average, introduce noise

that inflates the variability of the forecasting error of the factor model. Hence under a random walk null, we

expect sample U-statistics greater than 1, even though that null implies that population ratios of RMSPEs are

1.

           We report 10 percent level one sided hypothesis tests on H0: RMSPE(our model) = RMSPE(random

walk) against HA: RMSPE(our model) < RMSPE(random walk). (Here,“our model” refers to any one of the

four models given in (3.4) or (3.6)-(3.8): factor model, factor model plus Taylor rule, factor model plus

monetary or factor model plus PPP.) These hypothesis tests are conducted in accordance with Clark and

West (2006), who develop a test procedure that accounts for the potential inflation of the factor model’s

RMSPE noted in the previous paragraph. Of course, with many currencies (17, in our early sample), it is

very possible that one or more test statistics will be significant even if none in fact predict better than a

random walk. We guarded against this possibility by testing H0: RMSPE(our model) = RMSPE(random

walk) for all currencies against HA: RMSPE(our model) > RMSPE(random walk) for at least one currency,

using the procedure in Hubrich and West (2010).6 This statistic, however, rarely had a p-value less than

0.10. We therefore do not report it, to keep down the number of figures reported.


                                        5. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

           For the largest sample used (1973-2007), Figure 1 plots the estimates of the three factors, while

Table 2 presents the factor loadings. The factor loadings in Table 2 are organized so that the first block of

six currencies (Austria, ..., Switzerland) includes currencies in the one-time German mark area. The next

                                                         11
block of four currencies (Finland, ..., Spain) are Euro area countries not included in the first block. The final

block (Australia, ..., UK) lists the seven remaining countries.

        The factor loadings suggest that the second factor reflects a central tendency of countries in the

former German mark area. (If the factor loading on the second factor was zero for countries not in the mark

area, then this second factor would literally be a weighted average of countries in the mark area (see Stock

and Watson (2006)). The coefficients are not zero on all non-mark countries, so the second factor is only

roughly an average of mark countries.) By similar logic, the first factor seems to represent an average of

everybody except countries in the former German mark area. The third factor is hard to label.

        Of course this breakdown is not precise. Denmark’s factor loading on what we have labeled the

“mark” factor is smaller than is Japan’s (0.68 vs. 0.78), and its factor loading on the first factor is, in absolute

value, larger than Japan’s (0.70 vs. -0.55).

        Tables 3 and 4 present some forecasting results. We present in these tables summaries of results

over all currencies. We present the median U-statistic across the currencies in the sample, the number of

U-statistics less than 1 and the number of t-statistics greater than 1.282. (Recall that a U-statistic less than 1

means that the model’s had a lower MSPE than did a random walk.) Currency by currency results are

available on request.

        Table 3 presents results for r=2 factors, both for the model that uses only factors, and for the models

that also include observable fundamentals. To read the table, consider the entry at the top of the table for
        ^
model = F it-sit, sample = 87-07. The figure of “1.003" for “median U” and horizon “h=1” means that of the 9

currencies, half had U-statistics above 1.003, half had U-statistics below 1.003. The figures of “1(0)”

immediately below the figure of “1.003” means that only 1 of the 9 U-statistics was below 1, and that 0 of

the t-statistics rejected the null of equal MSPE at the 10% level.7

        One’s eyes (or at least our eyes) are struck by the preponderance of median U-statistics that are

above 1. In the long sample, 13 of the 16 the median U-statistics are above one (the three exceptions are for


                                                        12
^
F it-sit + PPP for the h=4, 8 and 12 quarter horizons). In the early sample, it is again the case that 13 of the

                                                                ^                                 ^
16 the medians are above one (the exceptions in this case being F it-sit + PPP for h=1 and 4, and Fit-sit +

monetary for h=1). In the late sample, however, 9 of the 16 medians are above 1, with the models doing

consistently better than a random walk (median U<1) at 8 and 12 quarter horizons. Note in particular that in
                                                       ^            ^
this sample, 8 of the 10 U-statistics were below 1 for F it-sit and Fit-sit + monetary, and 9 or 10 were below 1

    ^
for F it-sit + PPP.

                                                                                                   ^
         Table 4 illustrates how varying the number of factors affects the simplest model, that of F it-sit;

results for models that include Taylor rule, monetary or PPP fundamentals are similar. The Table indicates

that for the long sample, r=3 performs a little better and the r=1 model a little worse than does the r=2 model

presented in Table 3. In the early sample, the r=2 model is the worst performing; the r=1 model is the best

performing. In the late sample, the r=2 and r=3 models perform similarly, with the r=1 model performing

distinctly more poorly than either of the other models.

         To depict visually what underlies a U-statistic of various values, let us focus on the United Kingdom,
                     ^
r=3 factors, model = F it-sit, long sample. The U-statistics happen to be: 1.003 (h=1), 0.996 (h=4), 0.979

(h=8) and 0.969 (h=12). (These U-statistics, as well as other individual currency U-statistics discussed
                                                                                    ^
below, are not reported in any table.) A scatter plot of the recursive estimates of F it-sit, and of the subsequent

h-quarter change in the exchange rate, is in Figure 2. The values of 0.979 and 0.968 for the U-statistics for

h=8 and h=12 imply a reduction in RMSPE relative to a no-change forecast of about 2-3%. Despite the

seemingly small reduction, the figures for h=8 and h=12 depict an unambiguously positive relation between
                              ^
the deviation from the factor F it-sit and the subsequent change in the exchange rate. On the other hand, there

clearly is a lot of variation in a relation that is positive on average.

         Our predictions fared especially poorly for the Japanese yen, which generally had one of the highest
                                                                                                     ^
U-statistics in each sample and model. For example, the U-statistics for Japan, r=2 factors, model = F it-sit,

long sample were: 1.008 (h=1), 1.051 (h=4), 1.085 (h=8) and 1.160 (h=12). That the yen does not quite fit


                                                          13
into the same mold as the other currencies in our study is perhaps suggested by the large negative weight of

-0.55 for the yen on the first factor (see Table 2). In the late sample, continental currencies (Denmark,

Norway, Sweden, Switzerland) and, to a lesser extent, the Euro were generally well predicted by our models.
                                                               ^
For example, the figures for the Euro for r=2 factors, model = F it-sit, late sample were: 1.009 (h=1), 1.015

(h=4), 0.939 (h=8) and 0.816 (h=12).

        Over all specifications and horizons (1, 2 and 3 factors; long, early and late samples; horizons of 1,
                                ^
4, 8 and 12 quarters), only the F it-sit+PPP model had median U-statistics less than 1 in over 50 percent of the

forecasts.

        To further check the sensitivity of our results to particular sample periods, Figure 3 graphs
                                                                                     ^
recursively computed U-statistics for the h=1 and h=8 horizons, r=2 factors, model = F it-sit, for the United

Kingdom and Japan, long sample, and the Euro, late sample. The initial value in the graphs–1987:1 (h=1) or

1988:4 (h=8) for the U.K. and Japan, 1999:2 (h=1) or 2001:1 (h=8) for the Euro–is computed from a single

observation. The number of observations used in computing the U-statistics increases through the sample

with the number of observations used to compute the final value in 2007:4 given in the relevant entries of

panel A of Table 1: 84 (h=1) and 77 (h=8) for the UK and Japan, 35 (h=1) and 28 (h=8) for the Euro. The

final values in the graphs, in 2007:4, is the one reported in the tables and the text above. For example, 0.939

for Euro, h=8, is the final value for the Euro in the h=8 graph. Note that the vertical scale is different for the

h=1 and h=8 graphs.

        Of course, the initial values in the graphs fluctuate quite a bit. But once a couple of years worth of

observations have been accumulated, the values settle down. We see that the figures reported in the Tables

and text and discussed above are representative: apart from start up values computed from few observations,

there is no apparent sensitivity to sample. In the h=1 graph, U-statistics consistently are near 1, and

generally are above 1. This indicates that for one quarter ahead forecasts, the average squared value of the

forecast from the factor model generally is slightly above that of a random walk model. In the h=8 graph,


                                                        14
we see that the poor performance of our factor model that we noted above for Japan obtains for the whole

sample; the modestly good performance that we noted for the United Kingdom also obtains for most of the

sample; and the good performance for the Euro obtains consistently once the effects of initial observations

have been averaged out.


                                             6. ROBUSTNESS
        We checked the robustness of these results in a number of dimensions.

1. We estimated by principal components rather than by maximum likelihood. Overall, results were

comparable, with one technique doing a little better (occasionally, a lot better) in one specification and the

other doing a little better (occasionally, a lot better) in other specifications. We also used the British pound

rather than the U.S. dollar as the base currency. Estimation was by maximum likelihood. Here, results were

comparable for the early sample, somewhat worse for the long and late samples.

        A detailed summary of the robustness checks is in an appendix available on request. To illustrate, let

us take two lines from Table 3, and present analogous results from principal components estimation, and

from estimation with the British pound as the base currency. These lines are chosen because they are

representative:

                                                                                h=1      h=4     h=8       h=12

       ^
(6.1b) F it-sit, early / N=17, principal components, U.S. dollar                4(2)     4(3)    7(4)      8(2)
       ^
(6.1c) Fit-sit, early / N=17, maximum likelihood, British pound                 6(1)     6(1)    4(2)      4(0)

       ^
(6.2a) F it-sit+PPP, late / N=10, maximum likelihood, U.S. dollar (Table 3) 4(0)         5(0)    8(0)      9(5)
       ^
(6.2b) Fit-sit+PPP, late / N=10, principal components, U.S. dollar          3(3)         3(3)    7(2)      9(4)

        We see in (6.1a) and (6.1b) that in terms of the number of U-statistics less than one, principal

components improves over maximum likelihood at h=12 (8 versus 3 U-statistics less than 1), while the

converse is true at h=4 (4 versus 7 U-statistics less than 1). Results for the British pound in (6.1c) similarly


                                                       15
are better at some horizons, worse at other horizons. We see in (6.2a) and (6.2b) that principal components

and maximum likelihood generate very similar numbers, while (6.2c) illustrates that with the British pound

as the base currency, results degrade for the late sample.

2. We also computed a utility based comparison of our factor models relative to the random walk. Our

approach is stimulated by that of West et al. (1993), who consider alternative models for conditional

volatility in contrast to our comparison of models for conditional means. We consider an investor with a one

period mean-variance utility function, allocating wealth between U.S. and foreign one period debt that is

nominally riskless in own currency. Suppose that a given one of our factor models produces higher expected

utility than does the random walk. We ask: what fraction of wealth would the investor be willing to give up

to use our model rather than a random walk to forecast exchange rates? Of course, if the random walk

forecasts better, we ask the same question, but in our tables present the result with a negative sign. We let
'       '
U F and URW denote utility gains from use of the factor and random walk models, cautioning the reader that

    '
the U here is not related to the “U” in Theil’s U.

        Details are in the Appendix. Interest rate data on government debt were obtained from Datastream,

last day of the quarter. We calibrate our mean-variance utility function so that it implies a coefficient of

relative risk aversion of 1 at the initial wealth level. We answer “what fraction of wealth would the investor

give up” in terms of annualized basis points. Results for one quarter ahead forecasts and two factor models

are in Table 5A. Comparable results for the mean squared error criterion are in the h=1 column that runs

down Table 3. The utility based and mean squared criteria perform similarly in terms of whether a factor

model performs better. For example, for the long sample, Table 5A indicates that the factor based model is

preferred by the utility criterion in 11 (=3+1+3+4) of the 36 comparisons; we see in the h=1 column in the

top four rows of Table 3 that the comparable figure is 8 of 36 for the mean squared error criterion. For both

criteria, the factor models are preferred in a larger fraction of comparisons in the early than in the long or late

samples.


                                                        16
        And by both criteria, performance differences generally are small. Of the 24 performance fees in

Table 5A, all but 5 are less than 200 basis points in absolute value, a comparison that is relevant since

management fees typically run around 200 basis points. This is consistent with the finding that at a one

quarter horizon, the estimates of Theil’s U were generally very close to 1.

        We conclude that by both statistical and utility based criteria, the differences between factor models

and the random walk are small at a one quarter horizon.

3. We repeated the mean squared error comparison using monthly data, for two factor models, and horizons
                                                                                                    ^
of 1, 12, 24 and 36 months. Results are in Table 5B. Comparable quarterly figures are in the three “F it-sit”

lines in Table 3. Results are qualitatively similar for the two frequencies. The factor model does especially

well at the long horizons in the late sample; performance differences are very small at shorter (1 and 12

month) horizons.

4. Finally, in Table 5C we report point estimates and standard errors for the slope coefficient β in (3.5), for

the model Fit-sit. Qualitatively, the results align with those of our out of sample tests, in that t-statistics tend

to increase with the horizon. As well, however, all but two of the t-statistics are significant at the five

percent level (the exceptions being the early and late samples, h=1). Thus, as is often the case, there is more

significance for a predictor with in-sample than with out of sample evidence. We interpret this as an

endorsement of our decision to focus on out of sample analysis: we otherwise might have been unduly

optimistic about the performance of our factor model.


                                             7. CONCLUSIONS
        This first pass at extracting factors from the cross-section of exchange rates yielded mixed results.

Results for late samples (1999-2007) were promising, at least for horizons of 8 or 12 quarters. With

occasional exceptions for models that relied not only on factors but PPP fundamentals as well, other results

suggested no ability to improve on a “no change,” or random walk, forecast.

        Late samples allow larger sample sizes for estimation of factors. While that may be part of the

                                                         17
reason for good results for late samples, that is not a sufficient condition for good results because our

robustness checks found that the when the British pound is the base currency, late samples perform worse

than early samples. Indeed, it remains to be seen whether our results for late samples are spurious. In any

event, the framework here can be extended in a number of ways. It would be desirable to allow different

slope coefficients across currencies, to allow more flexible specification of parameters in monetary and

Taylor rule models, and to use a data dependent method of selecting the number of factors. Such extensions

are priorities for future work. It would also be desirable to compare our predictions to not only a random

walk model, but to other models that have been compared to the random walk in earlier studies.


                                                         APPENDIX
         In this Appendix, we describe the utility based calculation presented in Table 5A. We begin with

some notation. We drop the i subscript from the exchange rate st and other variables for simplicity. Define:


         ^
(A.1)    st = forecast of st+1; ^st = st for random walk, ^st = factor model forecast for factor model;

(A.2)    σ^ 2t = variance of st+1 as of time t, computed as t -13tj=2(sj-sj-1)2 for both models;

(A.3)    Rt+1, R*t+1 = nominal return on one period nominal riskless debt in the U.S. and abroad;

(A.4)    θt+1 = R*t+1 - Rt+1 - (st+1 - st) = ex-post return differential;

(A.5)    θ^ t = R*t+1 - Rt+1 - (^st - st) = ex-ante return differential.


         Let us tentatively assume that θ^ t is positive, i.e., that when we use a given model for ^st, the expected

return is higher abroad than in the U.S. The goal of a U.S. investor with initial wealth W is to


(A.6)    max f EtUt+1 = Et[Wt+1 - .5γW2t+1] s.t. Wt+1 = W[f(R*t+1-Δst+1) + (1-f)Rt+1] = W(fθt+1+Rt+1).


In solving for the optimal f, call it f*, set Etθt+1 = θ^ t, Etθ2t+1 = θ^ 2t + σ^ 2t . Then,

          *   1-γWRt+1       θ^ t
(A.7)    f = ––––––––– –––––        .
                 γW    θ^ 2t +σ^ 2t


                                                                 18

          We compute the total utility of a U.S. investor using one of our models as the sum over t of ct +

dtut+1 in those periods in which θ^ t is positive, i.e., we compute the utility gains for a U.S. investor only in

those quarters in which the foreign return is expected to be higher than the U.S. return (otherwise the U.S.

investor puts all wealth into Rt+1 because this is a safe asset). We compute the total utility of a foreign

investor (with signs of returns reversed) over those periods in which in which θ^ t is negative. We average the

two utilities over P periods of predictions to get an average utility based measure of the quality of one of the

models.
              '       '
          Let U F and URW be the average utility measures that result from a factor model and the random walk

model. We report the fraction of wealth that our investor would be willing to give up to use the higher utility
                                                              '   '
model, expressed at an annualized rate, in basis points. When U F>URW, Table 5A reports

40000×(1-U RW/UF). When URW>UF, the table reports -40000×(1-UF/URW). The factor of 4 converts

quarterly to annual, while the factor of 10,000 converts to basis points.

          For quadratic utility (A.6), the coefficient of relative risk is γW/(1-γW). We fix this value at 1.

1. The Engel and West (2005) argument is not that a random walk is produced by an efficient market;

indeed the simple efficient markets model implies that exchange rate changes are predicted by interest

rate differentials and any variables correlated with interest rate differentials. Rather, the argument relates

to the behavior of an asset price that is determined by a present value model with a discount factor near 1.

2. See Stock and Watson (2006). We use “factor” to refer to a data generating process driven by factors,

even if the estimation technique involves principal components.

3. See Diebold et al. (1994) for another attempt, with methodology very different from ours, to predict

exchange rates using a cross section of exchange rates.

4. Specifically, let γ=σ2ε+2σ2v denote the variance of Δs. Then σ2η = 0.5[γ+(γ2-4σ4v)½], θ=-σ2v/σ2η.

5. In principle, one could use techniques to determine cointegrating rank to determine the number of I(1)

factors and the factor loadings. We take results such as Ho and Sorensen (1996) to indicate that the finite

sample performance of such techniques is likely to be poor, when the cross-section dimension is 17.

6. Although we report ratios of MSPEs, the Clark and West (2006) and Hubrich and West (2008) tests

work off arithmetic difference of MSPEs, evaluating whether this difference is statistically different from

zero. The null hypothesis is that the random walk generates the data. These tests begin by adjusting the

MSPE difference to account for noise that is present in the alternative (the non-random walk model)

under the null hypothesis. For Clark and West (2006), the standard Diebold-Mariano-West (DMW)

statistic is then computed for the adjusted MSPE difference. For Hubrich and West (2009), a parametric

bootstrap is executed, under the assumption of normality. We did 10,000 repetitions in this bootstrap.

See West (1996, 2006) for basic theory and further discussion.

7. The fact the median U was 1.003, but only 1 U-statistic was below 1 of course means that the

U-statistics were tightly clustered near 1.

Notes:

1. The sample period for estimation of models runs from 1973:1 to the forecast base. Models are estimated
recursively. Factors are estimated using N=17 currencies, for all samples.

2. In the late sample, Euro area forecasts are made by averaging forecasts from the 8 Euro countries.

3. Long horizon forecasts are made using the direct method.

Notes:

1. Table 1 defines the long, early and late sample periods, lists the currencies in each sample, and describes
the models.

2. The U-statistic is = (RMSPE Model/RMSPE random walk); U<1 means that the model had a smaller
MSPE than did a random walk model. “median U” presents the median value of this ratio across 9, 17 or 10
currencies. “#U<1” gives the number of currencies for which U<1, a number that can range from 0 to the
number of currencies N.

3. t is test of H0: U=1 (equality of RMSPEs) against one-sided HA: U<1 (RMSPE Model is smaller), using
the Clark and West (2006) procedure. The number of currencies in which this test rejected equality at the 10
percent level is given in the (t>1.282) entry.

Notes to Table 5:

1. Consider a risk averse investor, with coefficient of relative risk aversion of 1, who uses either a factor or
random walk model to allocate his wealth across two assets whose returns are nominally safe when measured
                                '    '
in own currency. In Panel A, U    F>URW means the factor model delivers higher expected utility. The “median
sacrifice” reports the fraction of wealth expressed in annualized basis points that such an investor would be
                                                                              '   '
willing to give up to use the factor rather than random walk model (when U      F>URW ) or the random walk
                                      '     '          '
rather than the factor model (when URW>UF). (The U used here bears no relation to the “U” in Theil’s U
that is referenced in panel B of this Table and elsewhere in the paper.) See section 6 of the paper for
additional detail.
                                                                                  ^
2. Panel B presents estimates for monthly data comparable to the estimates in the F it-sit lines in Table 3.

                                                                                                ^
3. Panel C presents estimates of β from equation (3.5) in the case that γ/0 (i.e., the model is F it-sit) and the
number of factors is two.
