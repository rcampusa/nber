                                         ABSTRACT

We analyze the impact of Covid-19 on productivity in the United Kingdom using data derived
from a large monthly firm panel survey. Our estimates suggest that Covid-19 will reduce TFP in
the private sector by up to 5% in 2020 Q4, falling back to a 1% reduction in the medium term.
Firms anticipate a large reduction in ‘within-firm’ productivity, primarily because measures to
contain Covid-19 are expected to increase intermediate costs. The negative ‘within-firm’ effect is
partially offset by a positive ‘between-firm’ effect as low productivity sectors, and the least
productive firms among them, are disproportionately affected by Covid-19 and consequently
make a smaller contribution to the economy. In the longer run, productivity growth is likely to be
reduced by diminished R&D expenditure and diverted senior management time spent on dealing
with the pandemic.

Introduction

The advent of Covid-19 has been the largest shock to the world economy since World War II. It
has induced a large contraction in GDP that has been unusually synchronized across countries. But
the shock has also had asymmetric effects across sectors of the economy, with those sectors that
involve the most social contact in consumption bearing the brunt. Furthermore, the shock has
necessitated a reorganization of production processes – both in the near-term as an immediate
response but also over the medium-term – that will have implications for productivity and factor
usage. The spread of Covid-19 and measures to contain it are therefore likely to have important
implications for productivity.

This paper presents an analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on productivity in a major industrialised
economy. We use survey data from the Decision Maker Panel (DMP), a large and representative
monthly panel survey of UK firms that was established in 2016. Whilst the DMP survey does not
ask about productivity directly, panel members have been asked about the impact of Covid-19 on
all of the main components of productivity, covering inputs, outputs and prices. We take pre-Covid
measures of firm-level productivity derived from company accounts data and project them forward
using more timely and/or forward-looking data from the DMP on the impact of Covid-19 on these
components. We assess the impact of Covid-19 on both measures of labour productivity and total
factor productivity (TFP). We build our results up from the firm level and decompose the aggregate
impacts into ‘within-firm’ and ‘between-firm’ effects (hereafter within and between effects) using
the accounting framework of Baily et al. (1992). So in contrast to other studies that must infer the
impact of a shock on productivity from some natural temporal or unobserved cross-firm variation
in exposure, the DMP data allows us to ask firms directly. We show that these reported impacts
account for much of the realised changes in the firm-level data.

The results suggest that Covid-19 will reduce TFP in the UK private sector, relative to what would
otherwise have happened, by about 3% on average between 2020 Q2 and 2021 Q2, peaking at 5%
in 2020 Q4 (Figure 1). Businesses anticipate a large reduction in productivity within firms, partly
because measures to contain Covid-19 are expected to increase intermediate costs. The negative
within-firm effect is partially offset by a positive between effect as low productivity sectors, and
the least productive firms among them, are disproportionately affected and consequently make a
smaller contribution to the economy. The effects of Covid-19 on hourly labour productivity are
estimated to be less negative than those on TFP (Figure 1).1 That is because hours worked are
estimated to have dropped by around 40% in 2020 Q2, which is a larger fall than the input share
weighted fall in capital (which dropped by 1% in 2020 Q2) and hours. Labour productivity per
hour is estimated to have increased in 2020 Q2 as the large short-term between effects more than
offset the impact of higher costs. To gauge the effects over the medium term, we use responses to
survey questions asking about the expected impacts of Covid-19 in 2022+. We estimate that the
pandemic will reduce TFP by about 0.7% over the medium term, equivalent to about around one
year of pre-pandemic UK productivity growth.

  The effects on labour productivity per job are estimated to be negative through, particularly in 2020 Q2 and Q3, as
the number of jobs has fallen by much less than hours worked due to workers being put on furlough under the
Government Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (jobs on furlough are assumed to remain but at zero hours).

                                                         1
Importantly, it is worth highlighting this positive between impact of productivity is not entirely
the usual Schumpeterian process of creative destruction, whereby lower productivity firms are
replaced by higher productivity firms. Instead much of this is simply destruction of low
productivity sectors. Industries like accommodation and food, and recreational services have
experienced substantial contractions with limited expansion of other sectors. So, while this may
increase average productivity it will reduce total economic output, and hence likely reduce overall
welfare. As such, while Covid induced changes in productivity so far appear perhaps surprisingly
limited – we estimate a maximum impact of -5% in 2020Q4 – this has arisen in part from the
permanent contraction of some low-productivity sectors.

This paper draws together three strands of literature, on the link between firm-level productivity
and aggregate performance, on business surveys, and on the economic impact of Covid-19.

First, the literature on using micro-data to analyse the drivers of macro productivity. Baily et al.
(1992) developed the formula to decompose productivity changes into within changes and between
reallocation which we employ in this study. Their decomposition has been extensively used in the
productivity literature (see, e.g. Foster, Haltiwanger and Syversson (2001) or Syversson (2011)).
Bartelsman et al. (2013) show that differences in the covariance between size and productivity
drive productivity differences across countries, while our study shows that Covid is expected to
induce changes in this covariance that will offset some of its adverse effects. A Covid induced
productivity slowdown is more concerning given the gradual decline in US, UK and European
productivity growth since the 1960s. Indeed, over the last decade US, UK and EU productivity
growth have fallen to under 1% a year, so a major impact from Covid-19 could easily lead this to
become negative (see for example Jones (2009), Cowen (2011), Gordon (2016), and Bloom et al.
(2020)).

Second, we contribute to the literature on using business surveys to evaluate the impact of major
shocks. We employ a business survey (the Decision Maker Panel) that is one of a growing number
of monthly business panel surveys that collect data to measure firms’ subjective expectations as
well as their objective performance (see Altig et al. (2020a)). Altig et al. (2020b) use these surveys
to assess the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on economic uncertainty. The use of these large scale,
high frequency forward looking firm surveys to measure the productivity impact of shocks – both
the within and between elements – is a novel approach to evaluating the impact of major events as
they happen.

Lastly, our paper is one of many in a rapidly growing literature on the economic impact of Covid-
19, which are already too numerous to cite and many of which are surveyed in Brodeur et al.
(2020). Some examples include Alekseev et al. (2020), Bartik et al. (2020a and 2020b),
Brynjolfsson et al. (2020), Buffington et al. (2020), Bloom, Fletcher and Yeh (2020), Gourinchas
et al. (2020), and Papanikolaou and Schmidt (2020) who show pervasive impacts on firms. Baqaee
and Farhi (2020) show that negative sectoral supply shocks can be stagflationary and can be
amplified by complementarities in production, Chetty et al. (2020), Kahn et al. (2020) and Cajner
et al. (2020) show large and heterogeneous labour-market impacts of Covid-19, Adams-Prassl et
al. (2020), Alon et al. (2020) and Mongey et al. (2020) and show the gender impact of the
pandemic, Guerrieri et al. (2020) show that supply shocks can cause demand shortages, and Jorda
et al. (2020) examine the longer-run consequences of past pandemics.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the
Decision Maker Panel survey and looks at how the pandemic has affected response rates. Section
3 sets out the analytical framework that we use to assess the impact of Covid-19 on productivity.
Section 4 contains our empirical results, highlighting some potentially important measurement
issues, before section 5 concludes.


Section 2: The Decision Maker Panel (DMP)

Survey methodology

The DMP was launched in August 2016 by the Bank of England in collaboration with Stanford
University and the University of Nottingham, supported by funding from the Economic and Social
Research Council.2 It is similar in style to the Survey of Business Uncertainty run in the United
States by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which is described in Altig et al. (2019). The DMP
is a large and representative online survey of Chief Financial Officers in UK businesses. It is a
flexible tool for assessing business conditions, and in particular has been adapted to collect detailed
information on how businesses are being affected by important economic events. For example, it
has been used to assess the response to the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. Most
recently, the DMP survey has been refocused to help assess the impact of Covid-19 on businesses.3
The Covid-related questions are discussed in more detail below. As well as special questions on
topical policy issues, the survey contains regular questions on sales, prices, employment and
investment. These questions ask about recent developments and expectations for the year ahead,
including about uncertainties surrounding those expectations.

The sampling frame for the DMP is the population of all 48,000 active UK businesses with 10 or
more employees in the Bureau van Dijk FAME database.4 It covers small, medium and large
private sector businesses across all industries (see Appendix Figure A1). Firms are selected
randomly from this sampling frame and are invited by telephone to join the panel by a recruitment
team based at the University of Nottingham. This approach helps to ensure that the survey provides
a representative view of the UK economy. Once firms are part of the panel they receive monthly
emails with links to a 5- to 10-minute online survey. Firms that do not respond to the survey for
three consecutive months are re-contacted by telephone to check whether they received the emails
or have other reasons for not completing the survey. When the DMP recruitment team first contact
firms they ask to speak to the CFO, and failing that the CEO. As a result 85% of respondents are
in these two positions (70% are CFOs and 15% are CEOs) with the remainder mostly senior
finance managers (see Table A1). Given that the typical firm in the survey has about 100
employees (see the summary statistics in Table 1) these CFOs and CEOs have a very good sense
of the overall direction and performance of the business.

The DMP grew quickly after its launch and now includes more than 8,300 senior executives; it has
averaged just under 3,000 responses a month since 2019 (see Figure 2). That makes it one of the

largest monthly business surveys in Europe. The surveys have a rotating three-panel structure –
each member is randomised at entry into one of the three panels (A, B or C). Each panel is given
one third of the questions in any given month, so that within each quarter all firms rotate through
all questions. This helps to keep the survey short for respondents whilst yielding a regular monthly
flow of data (so around 1,000 firms respond to each question each month). Results are typically
weighted using employment data.

Data provided by DMP panel members appear to be of high quality. Where comparable data are
available, data provided by respondents match up well with the corresponding audited information
from company accounts for variables such as sales and employment (see Figure A2). By
comparing year-ahead expectations to what subsequently happened in the relevant period (for the
pre-Covid period) we also validate that businesses are able to make relatively accurate predictions
about their future sales, employment and prices and, to a lesser extent, investment (Figure A3).

An important advantage of the DMP survey relative to other business surveys is the quantitative
nature of the data that it collects. Many other business surveys tend to focus on questions that ask
businesses to indicate whether they expect the conditions that they face to get better or worse,
rather than by how much they expect them to get better or worse. But the extent to which conditions
are better or worse has been particularly important in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic where
the size of such changes is much larger than in normal times. This quantitative information on how
businesses have been affected by Covid-19 and expect to be affected in the future is a crucial input
into the analysis in this paper on how Covid-19 is likely to affect productivity. The reason that the
DMP targets the CFOs (or CEOs) at these firms is because they are likely to be sufficiently
numerate to respond to somewhat complex quantitative questions.

The impact of Covid-19 on response rate in the Decision Maker Panel

The Covid-19 pandemic and the associated measures to contain it have disrupted UK businesses,
forcing some firms to suspend operations and many staff to work from home. This disruption may
in itself have impacted the willingness and ability of panel members to respond in a timely and
accurate fashion to the monthly survey. Fortunately, an online survey can be accessed from office
or home and we demonstrate below that there has only been a modest impact on the response rate.
Importantly, there is no evidence to suggest lower response rates have been concentrated amongst
businesses that might be expected to be most severely affected by Covid-19.

Figure 2 shows that in 2019 the response rate of active panel members averaged 55%, with number
of responses also broadly stable at just under 3,000 a month. This response rate fell to 50% in
March 2020 as UK lockdown restrictions were introduced whilst the survey was in the field. But
it recovered in April and has averaged 54% since then, only 1 percentage point lower than the
average for 2019.

Even though the total response rate has held up well, it is still possible that the composition of
firms responding to the survey has been affected by the pandemic. To assess this, in column (1) of
Table 2, we run a simple regression of the propensity for a firm to respond to the survey that month
(conditional on being in the sampling frame) on the industry impact of Covid-19 on sales in 2020
Q2 (as reported in the DMP survey). This regression refers to data from March 2020 onwards,

                                                 4
covering the period when responses may have been affected by the Covid-19 shock. We detect no
significant relationship between the industry level loss in sales from Covid-19 and propensity to
respond to the survey. In column (2) we estimate the regression over a longer period and interact
the Covid sales impact with a dummy variable for the Covid period (March 2020 onwards), again
finding no significant relationship. This indicates that changes in response patterns have not
differed significantly across industries (rather than varying with the extent of the Covid-19
slowdown), possibly reflecting the more general impact of the lockdown disruption on business
survey response.5 In column (3) we test whether there has been any change in the propensity to
respond to the survey since March 2020 by level of pre-Covid productivity, a key input into our
calculations. Again, we find no evidence of a difference in survey response propensity.

In summary, there is no sign that the small and temporary change in survey response rates that we
observed in early 2020 is likely to have materially affected the quality of data in the DMP survey.
The fact these response rates remained high may at least partly reflect the fact that the survey is
carried out online, so that CEOs and CFOs would continue to receive the survey while working at
home. Business failures could also be another source of attrition from the survey, but as we discuss
in more detail later in the paper; these have so far remained low during the pandemic in the UK,
at least up to autumn 2020.


Section 3: Analytical framework

To assess the impact of Covid-19 on productivity we take pre-Covid measures of firm-level
productivity derived from company accounts data and project them forward using more timely
data on the impact of Covid-19 from the DMP survey. By building the results up from the firm
level we are also able to decompose the aggregate impacts into within effects and between effects.
In this section we define the measures of productivity that we consider, discuss how we use the
DMP survey to measure the impact of Covid-19 on various components of productivity, and set
out the framework that we use to decompose productivity into within and between effects

Measures of productivity

The DMP survey does not directly ask businesses about productivity, but as a result of the
refocussing of the survey with new questions on the impact of Covid-19 specifically since April
2020, it has asked about the marginal impact of Covid-19 on inputs, output and prices, all of the
main components needed to calculate productivity. These questions are described below. We use
this data to project forward productivity for each firm under the assumption that it would otherwise
have been unchanged from its 2017-2019 value in the absence of Covid-19.

We consider the effect of Covid-19 on both labour productivity (on a per hour and per job basis)
and total factor productivity. These measures are defined below. For the purposes of this
decomposition, we posit a Cobb-Douglas production function for real turnover ܻ defined over

 Figure A4 in the Appendix also shows this by plotting the change in response rate by industry against the impact of
Covid-19 on sales in 2020 Q2.

augmenting productivity AL, AK and AM respectively:

Taking logs, denoting them with lower-case letters and taking the total derivative we have

And we define TFP for this final output production function as

                                               ෪ ൌ ‫ ݕ‬െ Ƚ݇ െ Ⱦ݈ െ ɀ݉

with the total derivative given simply by

                                              ෪ ൌ ݀‫ ݕ‬െ Ƚ݀݇ െ Ⱦ݈݀ െ ɀ݀݉

We define unit costs mu as the volume of intermediates per unit of real final sales. In this case,
defining value-added as Y-M, we can show that the total derivative for value-added TFP is given
by

                                                      ‫ܯ‬

where Ƚ
      ෝ is the capital share in value-added and so on. We can rewrite this as

                                                   ɀ         Ƚ        Ⱦ

We measure firm-level changes in value-added TFP with this equation.6

We use accounting data provided by Bureau Van Dijk to calculate each measure of productivity
for all firms in the survey in the pre-Covid period. We use a three year average of 2017 to 2019
data rather than a single year to reduce measurement error. Labour productivity is calculated as
real value-added (operating profits plus total labour costs divided by the aggregate GDP deflator)
per employee using accounting data. Data are scaled so that industry-level labour productivity
from accounts is equal to official ONS industry-level labour productivity per job data.7 TFP is
calculated as the residual from a production function, ln(VAit) = (2/3)ln(Lit) +(1/3)ln(Kit), where
VAit is real value-added of firm i in year t, L is labour input which we measure as total real labour
costs and K is capital, measured as total real fixed assets.8 Nominal values from accounting data

  Figure A5 in the Appendix shows that industry level labour productivity data constructed from accounting data are
well correlated with official data from the ONS. However, they are not identical and so we scale the industry
accounting data to match the ONS data to try and ensure that our results align as closely as possible with official
statistics.

  Usually TFP would be normalized at the industry level. We do not do this in our analysis because we require
differences in the level of productivity between industries to be able to consider the effects of reallocation between

are deflated using the GDP deflator. Factor shares are assumed to be 1/3 of capital and 2/3 on
labour, to align with the values from national accounts, which is important for aggregating
productivity impacts.

Measuring the impact of Covid-19 on inputs and outputs using the DMP

Since April 2020, the DMP survey has included questions about the expected impact of Covid-19
on respondents’ sales, employment, and investment. The questions are of the form: ‘Relative to
what would have otherwise happened, what is your best estimate for the impact of the spread of
coronavirus (Covid-19) on the sales/employment/investment of your business in the following
quarters?’ These questions ask about the impact in the current quarter and about expectations for
the following three quarters and 2022+. Respondents are asked to provide a numerical response to
these questions.

To estimate the impact of Covid-19 on total hours worked, information from three separate
questions is combined. We use data from the question outlined above on the impact of Covid-19
on employment, data from a similar question asking about the average hours worked of employees
who remain active, and data on the percentage of employees on furlough – people who remain
employed but who are not required to work any hours. The UK Government’s Job Retention
Scheme offered to pay 80% of the wages of employees who were furloughed, up to a maximum
of £2500 a month.9 People on furlough are still measured as employed in official statistics.
According to the DMP survey around a third of private sector employees were furloughed in 2020
Q2, which accounted for the majority of the fall in hours worked in that period.10 Since June,
businesses have also been asked about the impact of measures to contain Covid-19 on their unit
costs.11

The DMP survey has not directly asked about the impact of Covid-19 on capital or prices, but there
are other data in the survey that we use to estimate these impacts. On capital, we cumulate the
reported effects of Covid-19 on investment at the firm level and assume an annual depreciation
rate of 4% and no additional capital scrapping.12 On prices, the DMP has since its inception asked
firms about changes in output prices over the past year and about expectations for the next year.
For the purposes of this paper, we assume that the change in output price inflation in the year to
2020 Q2, relative to 2019, was the effect of Covid-19. Similarly, we assume that changes in
expected price inflation for the year to 2021 Q2, relative to expectations for 2020 that were

industries on aggregate productivity. We apply the same industry level scaling factor used to help labour productivity
data better match official data to the TFP estimates (this is not available for TFP given industry data are typically
normalised)
9
  Between August and October 2020 businesses also had to make some contribution towards this.
10
   See Figure A6 in the Appendix for a decomposition of the effects of Covid-19 on total hours into employees on
furlough, hours worked by employees who remained active and changes in employment. Although furloughing
accounts for most of the initial fall in hours worked, by 2021 Q2, almost all of the reduction in hours worked is
expected to be via lower employment.
11
   The wording of this question is ‘Relative to what would otherwise have happened, what is your best estimate for
the impact of measures to contain coronavirus (social distancing, hand washing, masks and other measures) on the
average unit costs of your business in each of the following periods?’
12
   Annual investment is equal to about 6% of the capital stock in the UK. The depreciation assumption is consistent
with aggregate UK data. The assumption of no additional capital scrapping poses some downside risk to our capital
estimates.

provided during 2019, were due to Covid-19. We do our calculations at a 1 digit industry rather
than firm level and find that the effects of Covid-19 on both capital and prices are small (see Figure
3), so neither of these assumptions have a large impact on our productivity calculations.13

The data that we use in this paper were collected between July and November 2020. For each firm
we use the most recently available data point for each question.14 Around 2,000 firms in the DMP
survey have answered all of the relevant questions at least once during this period and have all the
accounting data necessary to calculate pre-Covid labour productivity and TFP.15 All our analysis
is for private sector firms with at least 10 employees. Figure 3 summarises all of the DMP evidence
relating to the impact of Covid-19 on inputs and outputs that we use in the productivity
calculations. We save a more detailed description of these data for the results section below.16

This approach to gauging the effects of a shock is different to other studies that estimate the
productivity impact of shocks, in that we have been able to directly ask firms about the impact of
the shock on the variables that determine productivity rather than infer the impact from a before-
after comparison or some natural treatment-control comparison.

Decomposing productivity into within and between effects

In order produce an estimate of the impact of Covid-19 on aggregate productivity in the UK, we
weight together pre- and post-Covid estimates of productivity for each firm, where the input
weights (e.g. employment or hours worked) are allowed to change to reflect the impact of Covid-
19. This approach allows us to decompose the changes in aggregate productivity that are associated
with Covid-19 into within and between effects using the formula below, following Baily et al.
(1992). The between effects in this decomposition also include effects arising from the entry and
exit of firms. Entry and exit effects are more difficult to model using current data from the DMP17,
but in the results section below we demonstrate the potential sensitivity of our results to different
assumptions around entry and exit.

13
   We assume that the impact on prices does not persist over the medium term (2022+).
14
   Figure A7 in the Appendix shows different monthly vintages of data on the impact of Covid-19 on sales and
employment. Monthly changes have been relatively small since July. Not all periods are asked about in all months.
For example, questions about 2020 Q2 were only asked in July and questions about 2022+ were only asked in
November. Where data are not available for all periods for a firm they are imputed using data from the time periods
where data are available for that firm.
15
   As a consequence these data differ slightly from aggregate DMP data published by the Bank of England because
they are based on a subset of the total sample.
16
   Our calculations all rely on questions asking businesses about the marginal impact of Covid-19, relative to what
would have otherwise happened. For variables such as sales and employment where the survey asks also asks about
what has happened to overall sales and employment recently and about expectations for the year-ahead, it is possible
to produce an alternative estimate of the impact of Covid-19 by comparing overall data and assuming that recent trends
would have otherwise continued. The two approaches give broadly similar results although these alternative estimates
are not available for all periods and not for all variables.
17
   In the longer-run we can evaluate these when we obtain the Bureau van Dijk (Amadeus) UK public and private firm
population data for 2020 which will be available from late 2021 onwards.

The within effect measures the contribution of changes in firm-level productivity for a given
allocation of labour across firms, where the labour allocation is measured as the average at time t
and t-1, such that the decomposition is exact.18 The between effect is the impact on total
productivity of a reallocation of inputs towards firms with lower or higher levels of productivity.
Once again, productivity levels are measured as an average of periods t and t-1. There is an
additional between effect arising from the birth or death of firms which depends on both the rate
of entry and exit and the extent to which firms who are born or die have levels of productivity that
are different to the average.


Section 4: Results

Our results imply that Covid-19 is likely to have some large and at least partially offsetting effects
on productivity (see Figure 4). Within-firm effects lower productivity, primarily because of the
higher costs associated with measures to contain coronavirus. In the other direction, between
effects push up on productivity as low productivity firms and industries have been more severely
affected and will be a smaller proportion of the economy as a result. In this section, we first
describe the within effects and then the between effects before bringing the two together and
summarising the overall impact. We finish the section by highlighting some measurement issues
that might affect our results.



Within-firm effects

Figure 3 shows how sales initially fell by less than hours worked following the Covid-19 shock,
which is likely to have pushed up on within-firm productivity. Businesses, on average, estimated

18
  We use this decomposition because it is straightforward to implement. It is also possible to calculate an alternative,
but more complex to implement decomposition where changes in employment shares and productivity are multiplied
with levels which are measured in period t-1, alongside the introduction of an explicit covariance term.

                                                           9
that Covid-19 led to a very sharp fall in sales of around 30% in 2020 Q2 (on an employment
weighted basis), relative to what otherwise would have happened.19 But that masks large dispersion
between industries with sales in 2020 Q2 in the worst affected industries – accommodation and
food and recreational services – estimated at more than 70% lower than they would have been,
compared to around 10% in the least affected industries such other production (which includes
agriculture, mining and utilities) and information and communication. After 2020 Q2, sales were
expected to recover, particularly between 2020 Q2 and Q3, but sales were still expected to be
around 5% lower than they would have been by 2021 Q2. Over the medium term (2022+), the
effects on sales were expected to be small at around -0.5%. Total hours worked were estimated to
have fallen by more than sales in 2020 Q2 and Q3, but with the effect becoming closer to the
impact on sales in later quarters. Sales falling by less than hours worked implies that Covid-19 led
to an increase in sales per employee within firms in 2020 Q2 and Q3.

Increased costs associated with measures to contain Covid-19 will have acted to reduce
productivity within firms. These higher intermediate inputs will accordingly push down on value-
added relative to sales, such that labour productivity within firms will be lower.20 Firms estimated
that Covid-19 increased average unit costs by around 7% in 2020 Q2 and Q3. The unit cost impact
of Covid-19 was then expected to taper off somewhat to around 4% by 2021 Q2. A smaller impact
on costs of just under 2% was expected to persist into 2022+. As discussed above, we map firms’
reported changes in unit costs into unit intermediate costs and then total real costs and TFP using
equation (6) above.

In practice, these additional unit costs could reflect two channels: (i) new costs, for example
associated with businesses having to buy things like PPE and plastic screens; and (ii) increased
unit costs that arise from a reduction in capacity, for instance social distancing at restaurants
reducing the number of tables available. The DMP survey has also asked about the impact of
Covid-19 on capacity. In 2020 Q3, businesses estimated that Covid-19 had reduced capacity by
around 10% on average. At the firm-level, there is a clear correlation between reductions in
capacity and reported increases in unit costs (see Figure A8 in the Appendix). But in a simple
regression this correlation is less than one-for-one, implying some role for new costs too.

Figure 5 summarises the contributions of both real sales per employee and intermediate costs to
aggregate within-firm labour productivity per hour. As well as the percentage impact on sales,
hours worked and prices, this also depends on whether the effects in percentage terms are the same
for high and low productivity firms. For example, a 10% reduction in productivity for a firm with
a low starting level of productivity has a smaller effect on aggregate productivity than a 10% fall
for a firm with a high starting level productivity.21


19
   Using sales weights the fall in sales in 2020 Q2 is estimated to have been smaller at 26%. This fall in sales is smaller
because sales weights give less weight to lower productivity sectors than employment weights.
20
   One corollary of this rise in intermediate inputs is that, in those places where early vintages of GDP are measured
using firms’ sales growth as a proxy, GDP may be overstated. We give more detail on this in the measurement section
below.
21
   In 2020 Q2, the impact of Covid-19 on labour productivity per hour was estimated to have been more negative for
firms with a higher starting level of productivity. This was because some low productivity firms furloughed a large
percentage of their workers and reported sales fell by less than hours worked. However, by 2021 Q2 there is no longer
a clear relationship.

                                                           10
The effects of Covid-19 on within-firm labour productivity per hour are estimated to be negative
through the period from 2020 Q2 to 2021 Q2 (see Figure 5). The average within effect over this
period is around -2%, although peaking at -4% in 2020 Q4. A smaller negative effect is of around
-1% is also expected over the medium term. The contributions from real sales per employee are
typically positive. But the overall within effect is negative throughout because of persistent
negative contributions from higher intermediate costs, although this contribution starts to become
smaller as we move into 2021 and beyond as the extent of these additional costs is expected to fall
back (see Figure 5).

On a per job basis, the within effects on labour productivity are estimated to be much more negative
than on a per hour basis in 2020 (see Figure A9 in the Appendix). That is because employment in
jobs terms fell by much less than employment in hours (shown on Figure 3), as much of the initial
reduction in hours came from employees being placed on furlough (and still measured as being
employed) rather than through job cuts.22

The impact on TFP, relative to hourly labour productivity, will depend on whether the impact on
the capital stock is anticipated to be larger or smaller than on hours worked. Figure 3 shows that
investment is expected to be more negatively affected than sales, and to recover more slowly.
However, quarterly investment is equal to only about 1.5% of the capital stock on average, so that
Covid-19 is anticipated to only reduce the capital stock by around 2% by 2021 Q2. This means
that elasticity-weighted inputs are expected to fall by less than labour inputs, such that within-firm
TFP is expected to perform worse than labour productivity (Figure 6 shows the different
contributions from weighted inputs). Between 2020 Q2 and 2021 Q2, Covid-19 is expected to have
lowered within-firm TFP by around 5% on average, with a peak impact of -9% in 2020 Q2. As
with labour productivity, the within-firm effects become less negative in later quarters as the
additional cost pressures start to ease. Over the medium term, for 2022+, within-firm TFP is
estimated to be around 1% lower than it would have been without the Covid-19 pandemic.

The analysis of the within-firm effects on productivity described above is an accounting type
exercise. It provides some insight into the reasons for lower within productivity, particularly the
role of high intermediate costs, but it does not directly link all of these effects to economic
explanations. Questions in the DMP survey have asked about some of the potential channels. For
example, DMP members estimated that R&D investment in 2020 is likely to be around 14% lower
than it otherwise would have been (see Figure 7). Reduced investment in R&D and innovation
would be likely to lower within productivity, although the effects of this might be largest over the
longer term.

Another relevant factor might be time spent by senior management on managing the effects of
Covid-19 on their business, which might have otherwise been spent on productivity enhancing
activities. DMP members estimated that their CEO’s have spent large amounts of time managing
the effects of Covid-19 on their business over the 6 months to November 2020 (Figure 7) - around
12 hours a week on average. Bloom et al. (2019) show how time spent preparing for Brexit was
associated with lower productivity among UK firms, indicating that this channel is potentially
important. Senior managers are critical for developing new products and processes, and if they are


22
     Figure A6 in the Appendix shows contributions to total hours worked from the different channels.

                                                          11
absorbed in dealing with the pandemic this type of long-run productivity enhancing activity will
suffer.

Finally, there may be some positive offsetting impact of working from home on firm productivity.
However, the magnitude of this is likely to be small at possibly around 2% in the longer-run
(Barrero et al. 2020a), and there may also be some channels through which more regular working
from home reduces productivity, for example through reduced innovation and creativity. It is
estimated that the number of days that employees are likely to be working from home post-Covid
will rise from around 5% pre-Covid to around 25% of days post-Covid, which combined with (at
best) a 10% increase in productivity from home working leads to only a limited 2% rise in
productivity.23

Between-firm effects

Firms anticipate that the impact of Covid-19 will vary a great deal across sectors and across firms
within those sectors. In particular, firms that have seen the most negative effects on demand and
employment are generally those that are least productive. The reason for this is the most face-to-
face sectors of the economy that suffered the largest pandemic contractions – leisure,
entertainment, accommodation and food and travel – have lower levels of labour productivity.24
This gives rise to a positive between or ‘reallocation effect’. This section describes these effects
in more detail. It starts by discussing reallocation effects between surviving firms and then
considers the possible effects from firm entry and exit.

The blue dots on Figure 8 show there was a strong positive correlation between pre-Covid labour
productivity and the impact of Covid-19 on hours worked at the firm level in 2020 Q2.25 The chart
implies that the least productive firms saw a fall of around 60%, on average, in hours worked,
compared to around 20% for the most productive firms, relative to what would have otherwise
happened. As we input-weight productivity in our calculations it is this relationship that is a key
determinant of the extent of the reallocation effects. The data for 2020 Q2 shows that higher
productivity firms shrank less and therefore saw their overall weight increase, while low
productivity firms shrank more and saw their weight fall. The size of the differences is large, which
is consistent with there being a large positive between-firm effect in that period. The red diamonds
on Figure 8 show that, by 2021 Q2, a positive relationship between pre-Covid labour productivity
and the impact of Covid-19 on hours worked was expected to remain. But the effects on hours
worked are much smaller, implying that a positive reallocation effect is expected to persist, albeit
much smaller than in 2020 Q2.

Table 3 formalizes the scatter plot shown in Figure 8 into some simple regressions. The dependent
variable is the impact of Covid-19 on hours worked at the firm level in different periods. Column
(1) shows the strong positive relationship between pre-Covid labour productivity and the impact

23
   Dingel and Neiman (2020) show that a large fraction of jobs in industrialised countries can be done from home.
24
   This is, perhaps, unsurprising given their relatively high shares of low wage workers and low levels of capital
intensity.
25
   We do not have historic data on hours worked at the firm level but rather only on the number of employees.
Consequently, we use labour productivity per job in this analysis as our measure of pre-Covid productivity. This
implicitly assumes that average hours worked per employee are the same across all firms.

                                                       12
of Covid-19 on hours worked in 2020 Q2. In column (2), we add 1-digit industry dummies. The
coefficient on pre-Covid labour productivity more than halves but is still statistically significant.
That indicates how reallocation between industries, or inter industry effects as we define them,
plays an important role in explain the overall reallocation effects, but there is still some effect from
within industries, or intra industry effects. The latter within industry effect could potentially reflect
that fact that more productive firms are better managed and more able to cope with the dislocation
of the pandemic, or possibly better capitalized so more able to deal with a period of tough business
conditions. For 2021 Q2, shown in column (3), the coefficient on pre-Covid labour productivity is
much smaller than for 2020 Q2, consistent with a smaller reallocation effect. Again, the size of
coefficient drops once industry is controlled for in column (4) and is no longer significant this
time, implying that reallocation between industries at least is expected to remain important.
Columns (5) to (8) replicate this analysis in TFP space. The results are similar to those for labour
productivity.

Figure 9 highlights how an important source of the inter-industry reallocation effects is because
the falls in hours worked were reported to have been largest in 2020 Q2 in recreational services
and in accommodation and food, which are also the two lowest productivity industries that we
consider. These are both industries where a large proportion of spending involves face-to-face
contact and/or social activity and where it is particularly difficult for these services to be provided
from home. Figure A10 in the Appendix shows how lower productivity industries were less likely
to involve home working prior to Covid and to have a higher percentage of sales that involve face-
to-face contact with customers.

Importantly, it is worth highlighting this positive between industries impact of productivity is not
entirely the usual Schumpeterian process of creative destruction. Instead much of this is simply
destruction of low productivity industries like accommodation and food or recreational services
without substantial creation in other industries (as evidenced by the large reduction in overall
employment). So, while this may increase average productivity it will reduce total economic
output, and potentially reduce overall welfare.

Figure 10 summarises the estimated between effects among surviving firms. The effects are
positive and large in 2020 Q2, around 10% in hourly labour productivity space and 7% for TFP.26
The effects then diminish sharply over the subsequent four quarters as overall hours worked
recover and as differences between the most and least affected sectors and firms become smaller.
A positive between effect of just over 1% was expected to remain by 2021 Q2 on both measures,
although this is expected to diminish further over the medium term. On average, inter-industry
reallocation between industries accounts for around 85% of the total between effects on hourly
labour productivity. For TFP, the inter-industry component accounts for more like 75% of the
positive effect in 2020 and 2021.

The above analysis focuses on reallocation effects between surviving firms. This is the main source
of reallocation effects that we identify, but firm entry and exit can contribute too. These effects are
more difficult to quantify using the DMP survey because firms are not asked whether they expect
Covid-19 to put them out of business, and businesses that have yet to be born are clearly not part

26
   Between effects on labour productivity per head are small throughout given the impact of Covid-19 on employment
is estimated to be much smaller than the effects on hours. This is shown in Figure A9 in the Appendix.

                                                       13
of the survey either. But we can describe what any firm entry and exit effect will depend on and
provide some sensitivity analysis.

The key determinants of how Covid-19 will affect productivity through firm entry and exit will
be: (i) how Covid-19 affects the number of jobs lost/created, relative to what would have otherwise
happened; and (ii) what is the average productivity of firms that die versus the average productivity
of new firms that are born. Figure 11 shows that employment weighted firm births and deaths both
fell during 2020. They were both around 15% lower than in 2019, such that net entry and exit was
little changed. So, unless there were large changes in the productivity of new firms and those that
die, relative to usual, firm entry and exit is likely to have had little impact on productivity up to
2020 Q3.

Firm entry and exit could have effects on productivity over a longer time horizon if Covid-19 leads
to a large rise in firm failures. The presence of Government support schemes and delays in
processing insolvencies caused by lockdown restrictions (such as reduced operation of courts) can
help to explain why firm deaths have fallen during the first three quarters of 2020. But these are
likely to be temporary factors. Firm births might also fall further. Below we explore the sensitivity
of our calculations to a scenario in which the employment weighted firm death rate rises by just
under 30%, and the birth rate falls by a similar amount. We do this just for firms with more than
10 employees, given that is the sample we use for the rest of our analysis.27 This scenario would
lower overall employment by 1% in 2021 Q2, with equal contributions of 0.5% from lower births
and higher deaths. Such a scenario would be of a broadly similar order of magnitude to the financial
crisis of 2008-09 (see Figure 11).

Firms that are newly born and those that die tend to be less productive than average. That implies
lower births and higher deaths will raise average productivity, since there are fewer low
productivity firms in the economy than there would otherwise have been. Using labour
productivity data derived from company accounts for the DMP sampling frame, businesses
incorporated since 2016 have on average been 19% less productive than the average firm in their
first year. Businesses that have failed over this period have been 15% less productive than average
in the year before they died. In our scenario we assume that new firms that could have been born
would have been 20% less productive than average, in line with historical data. The 1% of firms
in the DMP data who expect the largest reduction in sales from Covid-19 are only 50% as
productive as average so we assume firms who die are 50% less productive than average because
the Covid-19 shock has been particularly concentrated among low productivity sectors.28

In our simple scenario, lower firm births would raise average productivity by 0.1% by 2021 Q2,
and higher deaths would add a further 0.2%, making a total of 0.3% from firm entry and exit (see

   The statistics on firm births and deaths discussed in the previous paragraph are for firms of all sizes because timely
data on firm births and deaths for 2020 were only available for all firms at the time of writing. Data on births and
deaths by firm size are only available on an annual basis with more of a lag.
28
   Note that assuming firms that exit are only 15% less productive would make the overall impact of Covid-19 more
negative on productivity, so this is a potentially conservative estimate, although given the small impact of entry and
exit on the overall productivity effect of Covid-19 this is not material.

Table 4).29 That is smaller than the effect of around 1% from reallocation between existing firms
in 2021 Q2, and much smaller than the larger reallocation effects in earlier quarters. The precise
numbers are sensitive to the assumptions of the scenario, but overall this analysis suggests that
Covid-19 could modestly raise the average productivity of our sample through reduce firm entry
and increased exit.

Overall impact

Bringing all of the different channels together, we estimate that Covid-19 is likely to lower TFP
(see Figure 1 and Table 5). Although between-firm effects are likely to push up on TFP, our
estimates suggest that it will be more than offset by lower within-firm TFP, partly associated with
an increase in intermediate costs. Between 2020 Q2 and 2021 Q2, TFP is estimated to be around
3% lower, on average, than it would have been otherwise because of Covid-19, with a peak impact
of 5% in 2020 Q4. However, in those earlier periods the magnitude of the offsetting positive
between and negative within effects were much larger (see Figure 4). Our estimates imply that
TFP will be around 1% lower over the medium term (2022+).

The effects of Covid-19 on hourly labour productivity are estimated to be less negative than those
on TFP. That is because hours worked fall by more than elasticity-weighted capital and labour
inputs. In 2020 Q2, hourly labour productivity is estimated to have increased markedly.30 Those
effects fall back after 2020 Q2 and become slightly negative by 2021 Q2. A small negative effect
of around -0.3% is implied over the medium term. The effects on labour productivity per job are
estimated to be negative throughout, particularly in 2020 Q2 and Q3 as the number of jobs falls
by much less than hours worked.


Section 5: Measurement issues

The results presented in this paper are clearly heavily dependent on businesses’ expectations and
their response to the DMP survey. The analysis above attempts to measure and project the impact
of Covid-19 on ‘true’ labour productivity and TFP. There may be some ways in which our analysis
does not perfectly capture this concept. But official published data may also measure changes in
productivity with some error. In this section we enumerate the sources of some of these potential
measurement errors:31

29
   The firms who are assumed to die would still shrink in our baseline calculations. That is accounted for in our between
analysis of surviving firms. We allow for this therefore estimate the effect of firm deaths at 0.2% rather than 0.25%
to prevent double counting.
30
   A flash estimate of official data from the ONS points to a fall in hourly labour productivity of around 2% in 2020
Q2 rather than an increase of 8% from the DMP data. That can be entirely accounted for by a smaller fall in hours
worked in the ONS data. However, much of the fall in hours worked in our estimates is accounted for by employees
being furloughed, and in this respect the DMP data match up closely with administrative data from HMRC who run
the scheme and other business surveys such as the ONS BICS survey. But data from the Labour Force Survey on
employees temporarily away from work, which is normally used in the construction of official productivity statistics
point to smaller proportion of employees on furlough. Publication of labour productivity data have been delayed while
this discrepancy is investigated further. No official data on TFP in the UK during the pandemic have yet been published
at the time of writing.
31
   For example see ONS articles on measurement issues affecting National Accounts; prices; the labour market; and
productivity

                                                          15
Capital and Labour reallocation costs

The reallocation of output across firms and sectors may involve adjustment costs for capital and
labour, for example the costs of moving, scrapping or repurposing capital, or the time required to
retrain workers (e.g. Hammermesh and Pfann (1996) or Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006)). As such
this will lower the positive impact of productivity through lost current or future output.32 This
could be particularly important for the Covid-19 shock given the extent of reallocation and its large
cross-sectoral nature (e.g. Barrero et al. (2020b)).

Social distancing, capital utilization and capital productivity

Capital productivity will be reduced by social distancing if business premises (e.g. restaurants and
offices) must operate with few customers and staff. There will be less labour input and value-added
per square metre. This can be thought of as a reduction in the productivity of capital and hence
TFP. However, utilization of equipment will be reduced by social distancing if this is located too
closely together to be fully used (think of a barber shop that can only use every other chair), so
conceptually this could also be defined in terms of lower capacity utilization. Either way output
will fall from the given capital stock. One material effect could be if lower capital utilization leads
to lower capital depreciation, although we think this effect is likely to be very small – restaurants,
shops, factories etc. operating at reduced capacity are probably not going to have materially lower
deprecation rates of buildings and equipment.

Working from home and factor inputs

Workers working from home will employ capital (e.g. home offices) and consume intermediates
(e.g. electricity) which contribute to firms’ value added but are not recorded as such. Labour hours
may be understated by working from home, if home-based employees work longer hours per day.
There is evidence to suggest workers at home work longer hours as part of the time previously
devoted to commuting is used to work. In reverse, however, labour hours at home may be lower
than reported if employees have to carry out childcare while working. On net it appears working
from home may marginally increase longer-run productivity (e.g. Barrero et al. (2020a) and
Emanuel and Harrington (2020)).

Labour quality

Official TFP estimates make adjustments for the average quality of labour input. To the extent that
our estimates account for the changes in composition of the workforce from higher productivity
firms having a relatively higher weight in the economy than they did, they should account for this.
But they will not necessarily account for changes in labour quality within businesses. For example,
low skilled employees within a business may have been more likely to be placed on furlough.




32
     This point has also been made in the context of the broader debate about misallocation, e.g. Asker et al. (2014).

                                                            16
Business use of intermediate inputs

The question on unit costs in the DMP survey is about total unit costs, from which we assume the
rise in intermediate unit costs is the same as the effects on total costs. But it could be that
intermediate unit costs rise by more than unit labour costs. If that were true, the substantial negative
within effects from higher intermediate costs would be even larger than we estimate.


Section 6: Conclusions

This paper presents a detailed bottom-up analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on productivity in the
UK, which has experienced a similar impact of Covid-19 to the US and other advanced European
countries. We employ survey data from the Decision Maker Panel (DMP), a large and
representative monthly panel survey of around 3,000 UK firms that was established in 2016. We
take pre-Covid-19 measures of firm-level productivity derived from company accounts data for
UK businesses and project them forward using more timely data on the impact of Covid-19 from
the DMP. While the DMP survey does not directly ask about productivity, it has asked about the
impact of Covid-19 on all of the main components of productivity, covering inputs, outputs and
prices. Our analysis covers each quarter between 2020 Q2 and 2021 Q2 and presents medium-term
estimates for 2022+. We assess the impact of Covid-19 on both measures of labour productivity
and total factor productivity (TFP). We build our results up from the firm level and decompose the
aggregate impacts into within and between effects using the accounting framework of Baily et al.
(1992).

Our results suggest that Covid-19 will reduce TFP in the UK private sector by up to 5% in 2020
Q4 and by around 1% in 2022 and beyond. Businesses anticipate a large reduction in productivity
within firms, partly because measures to contain Covid-19 are expected to increase intermediate
costs. The negative within-firm effect is expected to be partially offset by a positive between-firm
effect as low productivity sectors, and the least productive firms within them, are
disproportionately affected and make a smaller contribution to the economy. We note these
positive between-firm effects are a mix of creative-destruction – low productivity firms being
replaced by higher productivity firms – and destruction in that low productivity industries like
accommodation, entertainment and travel have shrunk with limited offsetting expansion of other
industries. As such while these between effects may boost productivity through a positive
averaging effect they will not increase total output.

The dynamics of the Covid-19 effect are also very notable. In earlier quarters these offsetting
negative within and positive between firm effects are both estimated to have been larger. The
effects of Covid-19 on hourly labour productivity are estimated to be less negative than those on
TFP because hours worked fall by more than elasticity-weighted capital and inputs.

In the longer run, we see that Covid-19 has led to a large reduction in R&D expenditure by firms.
There are also issues around the efficacy of this R&D because of the difficulty of carrying out
research under lockdown if scientists and engineers cannot physically access equipment. As we
report, Covid-19 has also been extremely time consuming for senior managers with CEOs

                                                  17
spending about a third of their time directly dealing with the pandemic, which is time that has
presumably been taken away in part from other longer-run productivity enhancing activities. To
some extent these channels may be factored in to businesses’ longer-term expectations and may
help to explain why TFP is expected to be around 1% lower over the medium term. But it may
also take time for these effects to become apparent and there may potentially be some additional
longer run negative effect on productivity from diminished innovation and intangible investment
by firms.

Notes: Linear probability model for whether a firm in the sampling frame responds to the DMP survey in each month between January 2019 and
November 2020 (1=responded to DMP, 0=Not responded). Firm characteristics are averages of 2017 to 2019 accounts data from Bureau Van
Dijk FAME database. Labour productivity is defined as real value-added (operating profits plus total labour costs divided by the aggregate GDP
deflator) per employee using accounting data. Regressions only includes firms who were part of the sampling frame in January 2019 and who
have productivity data available from company accounts. Covid period dummy variable takes the value of one for March to November 2020.
All equations are estimated by OLS. Standard errors are clustered at the firm level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: All regressions are weighted using employment data. Labour productivity is defined as real value-added (operating profits plus total labour costs divided by the aggregate GDP deflator) per
employee using accounting data from Bureau Van Dijk FAME database. Data are scaled so that 1 digit industry-level labour productivity from accounts is equal to official ONS data industry-level
labour productivity per job data. TFP is calculated as the residual from a production function ln(Yit) = (2/3)ln(Lit)+(1/3)ln(Kit) where Yit is real value-added of firm i in year t, L is labour input (total
real labour costs) and K is capital (total real fixed assets), nominal values from accounting data are deflated using the GDP deflator. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: Labour productivity is defined as real value-added (operating profits plus total labour costs divided by the aggregate GDP deflator) per employee and is
estimated using accounting data from Bureau Van Dijk FAME database. Labour productivity of firms who enter is productivity in their first year of accounts after
incorporation and is based on firms who have been incorporated since 2016. Labour productivity of firms who die is productivity in their last year of accounts and is
based on firms who have entered liquidation or who have been dissolved since 2016.

Notes: The results are based on the questions: ‘Relative to what would otherwise have happened, what is your best estimate for the impact of the spread of Covid-19 on the sales/employment/average hours worked per active
employee/capital expenditure of your business in each of the following periods?’; ‘Relative to what would otherwise have happened, what is your best estimate for the impact of measures to contain coronavirus (social distancing,
hand washing, masks and other measures) on the average unit costs of your business in each of the following periods?’; and ‘Approximately what percentage of your employees fall into the following categories in each of the
following periods? (i) Still employed but not required to work any hours (eg ‘on furlough’), (ii) Unable to work (eg due to sickness, self-isolation, childcare etc.), (iii) Continuing to work on business premises, (iv) Continuing to work
from home’. Data are the most recent observation per firm for each period collected between July 2020 and November 2020. Data on the impact of Covid-19 in 2020 Q1 have not been collected in the DMP. Data shown for Q1
are absolute changes in aggregate ONS data for private sector output, business investment, private sector employment and hours worked between 2019 Q4 and 2020 Q1. The impact on unit costs is assumed to be zero in Q1.
Effects on the capital stock are estimated using by cumulating the investment impacts. The effects on the price level are estimated using data from DMP questions on actual price inflation and expected year-ahead price inflation:
the impact of Covid-19 is estimated as the difference between 2020 Q2 values for actual and expected year-ahead price inflation relative to 2019 at the 1-digit industry level.

Notes: Y-axes show realised growth in sales, employment, prices, and investment. X-axes show expectations for year-ahead growth rates calculated from questions were respondents are asked to provide 5 scenarios for
year-ahead growth (highest/high/medium/low/lowest) and the probabilities they attach to each scenario. Forecasts made between November 2016 and April 2019 (therefore excluding realisations during the Covid-19
pandemic). Each dot represents 1% of observations grouped by expected sales/employment/price/investment growth.

 Notes: Aggregate DMP data as published on the Bank of England website. The results are based on the question: ‘Relative to what would otherwise have happened, what is your best estimate for the impact of the spread of
 Covid-19 on the sales/employment of your business in each of the following periods?’. Each monthly survey did not ask about all periods.

Notes: The results are based on the questions: ‘Relative to what would otherwise have happened, what is your best estimate for the impact of measures to contain coronavirus (social distancing, hand washing, masks and other
measures) on the average unit costs of your business in each of the following periods?’; and ‘Do you expect the measures to contain the coronavirus such as social distancing, hand washing, masks, and other measures to
reduce the amount of goods or services that your business will be able to produce or offer in 2020 Q3 (July to September)? For example, if a restaurant can only use every other table this would be a 50% reduction. Note, this
refers to the amount of goods and services you could produce if there was sufficient demand, not actual sales.’
