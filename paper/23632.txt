                                          ABSTRACT

The median United States voter supports the legalization of marijuana, at least in part due to a
desire to increase state tax revenues. However, states with legal markets have implemented wildly
different regulatory schemes with tax rates ranging from 3.75 to 37 percent, indicating that policy
makers have a range of beliefs about industry responses to taxes and regulation. We examine a
policy reform in Washington: a switch from a 25 percent gross receipts tax collected at every step
in the supply chain to a sole 37 percent excise tax at retail. Using novel, comprehensive
administrative data, we assess responses to the reform throughout the supply and consumption
chain. We find the previous tax regime provided strong incentives for vertical integration. Tax
invariance did not hold, with some types of firms benefiting much more than predicted.
Consumers bear 44 percent of the additional retail tax burden. Finally, we find evidence that
consumer demand for marijuana is price-inelastic in the short-run, but becomes price-elastic
within a few weeks of a price increase.

1       Introduction

The United States reached a tipping point on marijuana in 2015, when, for the first time, the

majority of adults indicated support for legalizing marijuana in some form (Motel, 2015).

Four states, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington, currently have legally operating

recreational marijuana markets. During the 2016 elections, residents of California, Maine,

Massachusetts, and Nevada voted for legalization.1

    Taxation and revenue generation has been one of the primary political and economic

arguments for legalizing recreational marijuana (Miron and Zwiebel, 1995). However, little

is known about the behavior of participants in legal marijuana markets or, in particular, how

industry participants may respond to alternative policies - particularly given the existence

of readily available substitutes in the form of sophisticated black market goods and legal or

quasi-legal medical marijuana. Policy makers across states have implemented widely different

regulatory regimes: Colorado requires retail firms to grow 80 percent of the product they sell

while Washington forbids retailers from growing at all. Washington’s current tax rate is 37

percent; Massachusetts has a tax rate of 3.75 percent.2 In addition to the difference in tax

rates, states apply taxes at different points in the supply chain. These differences point to

substantial variation in beliefs among policy makers and a need for more information about

the impact of different policy levers.

    We offer new evidence concerning key policy-relevant behaviors by examining the market

in Washington where, after a 2012 vote, recreational marijuana became available for purchase

at retail stores on July 8, 2014. Washington’s regulations created a supply chain with three

     Though marijuana is considered a Schedule I Controlled Substance by the federal government, the
Department of Justice has chosen not to enforce prohibition in the relevant states.

types of firms: cultivators, which grow the cannabis plant, processors, which transform the

raw plant material into usable marijuana3 , and retailers, who sell products to end-users. To

comply with state law, firms must provide detailed information on their operations to the

state government. These unique “seed-to-sale” administrative records track the entire supply

chain, and are verified by the government through frequent audits. We obtain this data,

which gives us the unique ability to observe variation in marijuana prices, quality and variety

as firms enter and compete in the marketplace. Previous studies of the marijuana industry

have examined the illegal market through surveys, prices collected from drug seizures, or

crowd-sourced data (Jacobi and Sovinsky, 2016; Miron and Zwiebel, 1995; Pacula et al.,

2000; Clements and Zhao, 2009; Donohue, Ewing, and Peloquin, 2011; Williams, van Ours,

and Grossman, 2011), and some have used this evidence to speculate about legal market

outcomes. We are the first to examine the legal market directly.

    To understand the effect of market regulations and taxation on industry outcomes, we

take advantage of a reform to Washingtons marijuana tax policy. Prior to July 1, 2015,

a 25 percent gross receipts tax was assessed at each transfer of marijuana (i.e. between

cultivators and processors, processors and retailers, and retailers and consumers).4 After

July 1, 2015, the only tax collected was a 37 percent excise tax at retail. Crucially, this

change was unexpected by market participants: the reform legislation was passed during a

special session of the Washington Legislature on June 27, 2015, and signed by the Governor



   3
      Here and throughout, we consider only ‘usable marijuana’, which is defined as dried and cured flowers for
consumption by smoking. Different ‘products’ refer to different strains of marijuana, which are analogous to
the different cultivars of apples commonly available in supermarkets. While other derivatives of the cannabis
plant, such as oils, topical creams, and edible products, are available, usable marijuana comprises the vast
majority of the market by transaction count, and revenue.
    4
      This was implemented as an excise tax at each transfer of marijuana.

                                                      2
on June 30.5 We estimate the effect of these policy changes on key behaviors and decisions

made throughout the production process, while controlling for product quality and other

factors that may impact demand and supply decisions.

    We find the original tax regime encouraged vertical integration between cultivators and

processors (Washington bans vertical integration between retailers and other firm types).

Due to the variety of business relationships observed in the data, we define vertically in-

tegrated marijuana as product for which the cultivator and processor were the same firm.6

We capture changes in vertical integration by examining two measures: first, we consider

the fraction of wholesale transactions to retailers of vertically integrated marijuana, and

second, we consider the total weight of vertically dis-integrated marijuana sold to retailers.

Before the reform, roughly 94 percent of wholesale transactions comprised vertically inte-

grated marijuana. This drops to about 90 percent following the tax change. The weight of

dis-integrated marijuana sold to retailers increased by 42 percent after the change.

    Taken together, these results suggest the original gross receipts tax created inefficiencies

in the supply chain that persisted after the removal of the taxes due to fixed costs. To test

this hypothesis, we restrict the analysis to transactions stemming from producers in their

first week of business – i.e. to capture firms’ decisions about vertical integration before

paying the fixed costs associated with entry. We find the drop in the percentage of vertically

integrated transactions quadruples to 16 percent, and the increase in the weight of dis-

integrated marijuana more than doubles to 105 percent.

    The tax-invariance folk theorem makes the claim that if taxes remain the same, but a tax
   5
      Contemporaneous media reports suggest that, although the change was supported by the industry, it
was not expected to pass, and market participants did not have confidence in their forecasts of future prices
at the time of the change (La Corte, 2015).
    6
      Vertically integrated processors may process marijuana produced by other cultivators.

                                                     3
reform changes where in the supply chain they are assessed, after-tax prices at each point in

the supply chain will remain the same. Since we find the tax reform eliminated 28 cents of

taxes overall, but the remaining 75 cents of the processor tax were shifted from the processor

to the retailer, the tax-invariance folk theorem suggests that processors would lower their

wholesale prices by 75 cents. However, we find that processors only lower their prices by

an average of 26 cents per gram, suggesting that the tax invariance folk theorem has been

violated in this setting.

   While the price elasticity of demand and tax incidence are of first-order concern for

policy-makers tasked with setting taxes, the analysis is complicated by the degree of product

differentiation – the typical retailer has many tens of different products available at any time.

Given the variation in product characteristics, we test for and find a significant decrease in

the potency of marijuana purchased by consumers, as measured by the concentration of the

psychoactive chemical tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), after the reform. We find no change in

the potency of marijuana grown or sold at wholesale. Taken together, these results suggest

consumers reacted to the reform in part by substituting toward lower quality products.

   We account for this substitution by estimating the retail price response with a specifica-

tion that includes fixed effects for the interaction between cultivator, processor, retailer, and

product. We find the tax-inclusive price faced by consumers for identical products increased

by 2.3 percent. Considering the changes in tax rates as well as the adjustment in retailers’

marginal costs due to the change in processor prices in response to their own tax changes,

we find that consumers bear about 44 percent of the retail tax burden. We find the quantity

purchased decreased by 0.95 percent, though estimates are noisy, implying a short term price

elasticity of -0.43. However, over time, the magnitude of the quantity response significantly

                                               4
increases, and our estimates suggest the price elasticity of demand is about negative one

within two weeks of the reform. We conclude that Washington, the state with the highest

marijuana taxes in the country, is near the peak of the Laffer curve: higher taxes on the

margin may not increase revenue.

   Our vertical integration findings contribute to several broader long-standing public fi-

nance questions. It is theoretically obvious that vertical integration would be a natural

consequence of a gross receipts tax and tax economists frequently come out vehemently

against gross receipts taxes for this and other reasons (e.g., McClure, 2005; Pogue, 2007;

Testa and Mattoon, 2007); however, this is the first paper we are aware of that provides

compelling empirical evidence of this behavior. Gross receipts taxes have begun to prolif-

erate across states in recent years, so this paper provides an important source of empirical

evidence that such taxes do, in fact, lead to inefficient levels of vertical integration.

   We also contribute to the discussion on tax-collection invariance along two dimensions

(Kopczuk et al. 2016; Chetty, Looney and Kroft, 2009). First, we highlight that the pos-

sibility of vertical integration under a gross receipts tax is another reason tax-collection

invariance will no longer be expected to hold. Second, we document that tax collection at

the retail level has different incidence implications than does tax collection at the processor

level. In contrast to previous work, there is no evidence in this case that the result is driven

by different tax evasion possibilities at different points in the supply chain (Kopczuk et al.

2016), nor is it likely driven by a relative lack of awareness of the tax by one side of the

market (Chetty, Looney, and Kroft, 2009). Instead, media reports and conversations with

industry participants suggest processors took advantage of a unique opportunity to increase

margins.

                                                5
    Our incidence results stand in contrast to the literatures on cigarette and gasoline tax

incidence, among others, which generally finds consumers bear the substantial majority of

the tax burden (Kopczuk et al., 2016; Harding, Liebtag, and Lovenheim, 2012) and can

exceed 1 (Kenkel, 2005; Barnett, Keeler, and Hu, 1996). One plausible explanation for the

difference is that our estimated medium-run elasticity of demand for marijuana is higher than

the consensus estimates for cigarettes or gasoline. Alternatively, tight ownership and size

restrictions in Washington’s marijuana market may lead to differential market power effects

or frictions relative to these other markets. This could also be explained by the decline in

federal income taxes some retail firms expected to pay upon the switch from a gross receipts

tax to an excise tax.7

    Finally, our findings additionally contribute to broader research on supply side interven-

tions in drug markets, which has included examinations of policies ranging from alcohol’s pro-

hibition (see Miron and Zwiebel, 1991), to limitations on precursors to methamphetamines

(see Dobkin and Nicosia, 2009) and the legalization of marijuana sale and cultivation for

medical purposes (Anderson, Hansen and Rees, 2013). Our research is some of the first

to study legalized marijuana markets for recreational use, and the first to analyze the sub-

stantial natural experiment the tax change offers. And while prior papers have focused on

the elasticity of demand for illegal markets, we are the first, to our knowledge to study the

market-level elasticity of demand in a legal marijuana market.

    The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the history
   7
     The gross receipts tax was defined as part of the price used to calculate other state and local taxes for
recreational marijuana retail firms. Hence, some portion of the retail market expected to be substantially
better off as a result of the tax regime change because they would no longer owe federal income taxes on their
state gross receipts tax. However, on July 31, 2015, the IRS issued a memo clarifying this issue and noted
that these firms never did owe federal income taxes on their state gross receipts tax liability. We provide
more details on this in Section 4.3.

of marijuana’s legalization and the associated tax system in Washington. In Section 3 we

discuss the administrative data we utilize and the methods we use to estimate responses

to the policy change. We present our results in Section 4. We conclude in Section 5 by

discussing the policy and economic implications of our findings, such as where Washington’s

tax rate is on the Laffer curve and vertical integration’s role in the efficiency of these newly

legalized markets.




2        Background

Prior to 1938, marijuana was a legal substance in the United States. Indeed, it was listed

in the United States Pharmacopeia as a prescription for labor pains, nausea, and other

conditions. Since the passage of the Marijuana Taxation Act of 1938, the consumption of

marijuana has been illegal. The advent of Scheduled substances via the Controlled Sub-

stances Act of 1970 significantly strengthened the prohibition against marijuana, as it was

quickly classified as a Schedule I substance with a ‘high potential for abuse and little known

medical benefit.’8

    In 1996, California became the first state to legalize marijuana for medical use. In

1998, Washington voters also legalized medical marijuana through Initiative 692. Currently,

27 states and regions (including Washington D.C and Puerto Rico) permit the cultivation

and use of marijuana for medical reasons. In response to the growing acceptance of the

medical use of marijuana, in October 2009, the United States Department of Justice issued

a memorandum to United States Attorneys (Ogden, 2009) discussing the appropriate way to


    8
        Other Schedule I substances include heroin and methamphetamine.

                                                    7
allocate resources in states with legal medical marijuana markets. In particular, the memo

stated “federal resources in your States [should not be focused] on individuals whose actions

are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical

use of marijuana.” This was broadly interpreted as an effort to defer to states’ choices in

the absence of federal consensus (Stout and Moore, 2009), though the Department of Justice

emphasized a need to investigate and prosecute “drug traffickers who hide behind claims of

compliance with state law.”

    In the November election of 2012, Washington voters approved Initiative 502 which legal-

ized the recreational possession and consumption of small amounts of marijuana for adults

over 21. Three types of licenses were created: producers (who we term ‘cultivators’ in this

paper), who are permitted to grow and harvest cannabis plants, processors, who transform

the harvested plant material into usable marijuana and other products for wholesale, and

retailers, who may sell final products obtained at wholesale to consumers. The Initiative

specified that taxes would be collected with the revenue set aside for education, healthcare,

and substance abuse prevention. The initial tax structure assessed a 25 percent tax on each

marijuana transaction. This includes when grown marijuana is sold to processors who con-

vert the harvested plant material into usable marijuana9 , when processors sell the usable

marijuana to retailers and when retailers sell it to end consumers.

   9
     ‘Usable marijuana’ is defined by Washington state law as “dried marijuana flowers, [excluding]
marijuana-infused products [and] marijuana concentrates.” In practice, usable marijuana is consumed either
through the use of a fixed apparatus or by rolling the flower into a “joint” with paper produced for the pur-
pose. Though the traceability system has a unique code for products that fall into this category, it contains
two types of products: both raw dried flowers and pre-rolled joints, which include some value-add. Pre-rolled
joint products are also listed under a different inventory type code. As we cannot cleanly distinguish between
raw flower and pre-rolled joints in the “usable marijuana” category, our analysis includes the entire “usable
marijuana” category as well as any pre-rolled joint products we can identify across other categories. As
other product categories include different, difficult-to-distinguish levels of value-add at the processor level,
we focus on the “usable marijuana” category exclusively.

                                                       8
    Cultivator licenses come with capacity constraints – each cultivator is allocated one of

                                  10
three sizes of plant canopy            Firms which grow cannabis plants may also have a license

to process the material into usable marijuana, and vice versa. These vertically integrated

firms did not owe any taxes when they transferred the grown marijuana to their processing

operation. However firms involved in the production or processing of marijuana are forbidden

from owning and operating a retail location. Holders of a retail license were initially limited

to three locations. Broader ownership restrictions exist as well – individuals are not allowed

to have direct or familial financial interests in more than one marijuana license.

    The initiative gave regulatory authority to the newly-renamed Washington State Liquor

and Cannabis Board. One of the early actions the new board took was the implementation

of a state-operated traceability system which would track the cultivation, testing, process-

ing, and retail sales of marijuana throughout the state. We provide more details on these

administrative data in Section 3.

    The federal Department of Justice responded to the changing environment in Washington

and Colorado11 with an August, 2013 memo – commonly known within the industry as the

Cole Memo (Cole, 2013). As with its response to changing views on medical use, the Depart-

ment emphasized the prohibition on production and consumption of marijuana under federal

law, but provided guidance as to specific enforcement priorities. These included concerns


  10
      According to Washington law (WAC 314-55-010), “ ‘Plant canopy’ means the square footage dedicated
to live plant production, such as maintaining mother plants, propagating plants from seed to plant tissue,
clones, vegetative or flowering area. Plant canopy does not include areas such as space used for the storage
of fertilizers, pesticides, or other products, quarantine, office space, etc.”
   11
      Colorado voters also approved a legalization effort in November, 2012. We focus on Washington in this
paper for two reasons. First, in contrast to Washington’s vertically separated market, Colorado’s system
enforces mandatory vertical integration – each retailer sells product they have grown individually. Secondly,
and perhaps more critically, while both states collect similar traceability data, Washington’s legal framework
requires public disclosure of the data and Colorado’s forbids it.

                                                      9
about diversion of products from the legal market to illegal markets or jurisdictions without

legal markets, as well as public health concerns associated with marijuana consumption.

Importantly, the Department set a clear expectation that “states and local governments

... will implement strong and effective regulatory and enforcement mechanisms.” Within

the industry, the traceability system is seen as the implementation of the expectations and

priorities laid out within the Cole Memo.

   The tax reform analyzed in this paper was part of House Bill 2136 introduced during

the 2015 Regular Session of the Washington Legislature. As our identification rests on the

assumption that the policy change was effectively a set of exogenous cost shocks throughout

the supply chain, the details of the bill’s history are critical. Table 2 provides a detailed

time line of the bill’s progress through the Washington Legislature. The bill originated in the

House midway through the 2015 Regular Session, and accumulated a number of amendments

and substitutions before being passed by the full House. However, while a Senate committee

recommended passage on the last day of the session, the full Senate declined to consider the

bill during the session. A similar pattern occurred when the bill was reintroduced in the First

Special Session – the House quickly passed the bill, and the Senate chose not to take action.

It wasn’t until the very end of the Second Special Session, June 27, that the bill received a

vote by the full Senate. The Governor signed it on June 30, and the law went into effect

the next day. Contemporaneous media reporting portrayed the industry as unprepared for

the change, with one retail store manager quoted as follows: “This is supposed to happen

tomorrow. You have a few hours to change an entire market’s pricing structure. It is an

exceptionally short window for such a tremendous change.” (La Corte, 2015)

   While the tax change is the most relevant part of the bill for our purposes, the bill,

                                              10
along with companion legislation, contained a number of other measures, which arguably

may have played a larger role in the internal political process leading to its eventual pas-

sage. Increased funds from recreational market tax collections were made available to local

jurisdictions, on the condition that they allow firms to enter the market within their geog-

raphy. Local jurisdictions also obtained greater zoning flexibility for marijuana businesses.

Finally, Washington’s medical marijuana market, previously legal though essentially unregu-

lated, was brought into the regulatory framework created by the original initiative legalizing

recreational use.

   Today, eight states have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Table 1 delineates the

tax structure within each state. Notably, Washington applies the highest tax rate of 37% –

the next highest is neighboring Oregon, with a 17% tax. Not all states apply taxes at retail –

Nevada applies its tax of 15% at wholesale. California applies a cultivation tax designed as a

fee for each ounce of dried plant flowers and leaves, while Colorado applies a tax at wholesale

based on the average price per gram state-wide. All of these taxes lead to a lower effective

rate than Washington’s – implying that if Washington is on the left side of the Laffer curve,

these other states almost certainly are as well.

   In addition to the difference in tax rates and calculation methods, states also differ in reg-

ulatory requirements for testing, data collection, zoning, and vertical integration. Washing-

ton and Colorado provide extreme examples: Washington bans vertical integration between

retailers and all other firms, whereas Colorado requires retailers to grow a large percentage

of all product they sell.




                                              11
3        Data and Methods

Our data consist of administrative records from the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis

Board (WSLCB). As a part of the legislative effort to legalize and regulate recreational

marijuana production and consumption in Washington, the state implemented a traceabil-

ity system (also known as a seed-to-sale system) produced by BioTrackTHC. Its purpose is

to track each step in the marijuana supply chain, enabling regulators to collect taxes and

prevent diversion to the black market. Compliance is enforced through random inventory

audits, backed by penalties ranging from fines to inventory seizure and destruction. The

state provides an API to market participants and requires timely reporting of many details

of the production process. Firms generally use one of several commercially available soft-

ware packages to report data to the traceability system and comply with state data-reporting

requirements. The end result is data that tracks a cannabis plant’s planting, harvest, produc-

tion into usable goods, the sale of those goods to a retailer, and final retail sale of marijuana

products. Along the way, products are tested for foreign contaminants and moisture content

to ensure quality and safety, as well as for potency via the concentrantration of tetrahy-

drocannabinol (THC), tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THC-A), and cannabidiol (CBD), the

primary psychoactive components of the cannabis plant.

     We utilize an extract of the state’s database that includes all plants and products but re-

moves information about the supply chain that is subject to security and privacy concerns.12

Firms, locations, and production rooms are given unique identifiers. Each plant is registered

at the time of planting. Firms record the provenance of the plant material (e.g. a clone or
    12
      The raw data come in the form of SQL tables which do not include data on individual employees. Ad-
ditionally, while firms are required to report itineraries and planned routes for marijuana transfer operations
(e.g. when a wholesaler makes a delivery to a retailer), our extract does not include them.

                                                      12
a seed) as well as the strain13 and a log tracks its movement through the growth process.

Once harvested, flowers and other plant material are generally collected and converted into

a new inventory lot which is assigned a unique identifier to represent the homogeneity of

product within an inventory lot. These intermediate products may progress through several

processing steps including conversions, combinations, and divisions before wholesale. Along

the way, the database records these transformations, generating new inventory lot ids as

necessary.

    The last step of production is the division of a large wholesale inventory lot into multiple

smaller lots for sale to individual retail stores. Each lot consists of multiple sealed packages

of a specific weight of marijuana (most commonly 1 gram, 2 grams, or 3.5 grams) which

are considered identical. When lots are sold to retail locations, the tracking system records

the date, quantity and price of the transaction and assigns a new id. As a consequence, the

observation of an inventory lot id at the retail store uniquely identifies the retailer, processor,

and cultivator, as well as the strain and package size. Transfer manifest identifiers allow us

to observe wholesale transactions that comprise multiple product lots. Similarly, the system

tracks individual retail transactions, linking the prices and quantity of different items, as

well as the transaction time,14 in a retail transaction to the relevant inventory lots, allowing

us to trace sales back through to a set of original plants.15
   13
      Strains are defined by the cultivator and consequently are the “dirtiest” field in our data. Additionally,
the system allows cultivators to input the seed-grown offspring of two cloned parents as a member of that
clone strain, even though the offspring may not ‘breed true.’
   14
      Washington’s regulatory framework does not require retailers to have a constant connection to the
tracking system. Many connect to the system at the end of their business day and upload their transactions
within one session. While the order of transactions is maintained and other information in the system
(specifically the inventory log file) may allow us to track the specific time of each transaction, we choose the
daily level as our most granular view of activity in the industry.
   15
      Given the details of the production process discussed in this section, it is not possible to precisely
identify which plant or plants a particular retail package of marijuana came from – we can only identify
the set of plants which contributed to the creation of the wholesale lot from which the retail package was

                                                      13
    We examine both tax-exclusive and tax-inclusive prices. The tax-inclusive prices include

both the marijuana-specific excise tax and Washington’s general and locality-specific sales

taxes.16 Given the retail firms’ inability to access traditional financial services markets,

almost all choose to set tax-exclusive prices that lead to round numbers when taxes are

included (this lowers the cash handling costs for firms). As a consequence, the posted prices

faced by consumers include all taxes and therefore, in contrast to many other settings, the

sales taxes are salient to consumer-level decision making.

    We analyze the effects of the tax change on a number of observable behaviors of market

participants through a series of regression exercises. We restrict our analysis at the processor

and retail levels to the “usable marijuana” product category – 74.5% of the total transactions

observed in our data. For each component of the supply chain—cultivators, processors, and

retailers—we collapse the data by firm-day unless otherwise specified after performing minor

cleaning steps, none of which significantly change our results.17 We provide additional details

about data cleaning in the Online Data Cleaning Appendix.18

    Our primary target in our regression analyses is the response to the tax change. As the

change took place within the broader context of the market’s non-linear evolution, our esti-

divided.
   16
      The tax reform also changed the way firms reported prices in the traceability system. Prior to the
reform, most firms reported fully tax-inclusive prices. Afterwards, most firms reported fully tax-exclusive
prices. To clean the price data, for each firm, we search for a multiplier within the bound created by the
maximum effective tax rate to maximize the percentage of prices with round numbers. We verified the results
of this algorithm using public-facing menu data captured by the Internet Archive. Additional details on our
price-cleaning process are given in the Online Data Cleaning Appendix: http://www.keatonmiller.org/
s/data-cleaning-appendix.pdf
   17
      We drop a small number of duplicate sales in the processor data and we drop all retail transactions
that were deleted or refunded. We also drop all processor and associated retail transactions in which the
processor price or total transaction amount was less than or equal to one cent. It is our understanding that
these were generally samples given to the retailer by the processor; they were given a price of one cent so
that these movements of marijuana could be tracked within the traceability system.

mating equations include a polynomial in time. Furthermore, as the change was unexpected

by market participants, we include several dummy variables in the days immediately sur-

rounding the tax change, to account for short-term adjustment effects and the Fourth of July,

which took place just after the reform was implemented. The detail of the data collected by

the traceability system allows us to analyze behaviors at the firm-day level, though cyclical

patterns throughout the course of a week and a month cause us to include additional fixed

effects. Our window of analysis spans the two months before and two months after the tax

change. We examine the robustness of our estimates to this time window.

   Our analyses, therefore, use the following template:

where yit is our outcome variable for firm (cultivator, processor, or retailer) i at date t, taxit

is an indicator variable that is one after the tax change took place on July 1, 2015 and zero

before, tax dayj are indicator variables for June 30 - July 5 to absorb local responses to the

tax change and the 4th of July, dowj are day of the week fixed effects, domk are day of the

month fixed effects, and datelit is a polynomial in the date of sale. June 30 is the date the law

was signed, and July 4th is a holiday which resulted in deviations from normal trends. We

explore the sensitivity of our estimates by shrinking our adjustment window to only include

June 30 and July 1, or extending the adjustment window to June 27th (the date the tax

reform was passed by the Washington Legislature). We also explore the sensitivity of our

analysis to the inclusion of day-of-month fixed effects based on the hypothesis that these

                                                     15
may not always be very important, but do consume many degrees of freedom. Lastly, we

consider the sensitivity of our estimates to changes in the polynomial we use as well as the

inclusion of county-specific polynomials to allow for county-specific time trends.

    We take the logs of all of our outcomes, unless otherwise specified, because the outcomes

we examine are essentially log-normally distributed (with the added benefit of allowing us to

interpret the estimated coefficients on the binary regressors as semi-elasticities). Standard

errors are clustered by firm. Given the details of our estimating equations, we interpret

coefficients on the tax change indicator variable to represent the average short-term response

to the tax reform unless otherwise specified.




4     Results

We report findings as marijuana flows through the supply chain: we first examine cultivators,

then discuss processors, and finish with the retail market. Across markets, we present

tables consisting of point estimates for each of the outcomes we examine, and table and

figures of robustness checks for outcomes of particular significance. For these same important

outcomes, we also provide figures detailing the data and graphically plotting the response.

In the figures, the solid line is a fitted model based on Equation (1), while the hollow circles

represent the raw average daily dependent variable for the days leading up to and after the

tax change. For both the lines and circles, we remove the estimate of the day-of-week, day-

of-month, and firm location fixed effects. We also remove the estimates on the indicators for

June 30 - July 5 from the fitted line.

4.1     Cultivators

We first focus on cultivators – those firms that plant and harvest raw flowers from the

cannabis plant. Table 3 provides summary statistics for cultivators. On average, firms

harvest plants 116 days after planting. Vertical integration is rampant, as over 95 percent

of growers also have a license to process marijuana. The July 1 policy reform decreased

their transaction tax from 25 percent to zero. However, because of the rampant vertical

integration, most cultivators did not owe this tax – taxes were not due if the cultivator sold

to a vertically integrated processor. The high degree of vertically integrated transactions

has also made the cultivator-to-processor transaction data unreliable.19 We thus focus on

other outcomes, which, while they may not be responding to a meaningful change in the

cultivator tax because of vertical integration, may still respond to a decrease in their vertically

integrated processor’s transaction tax from 25 percent to zero. These outcomes, which

auditors routinely verify among growers, include counts of the number of new plantings, and

the total quantities of marijuana harvested.

    Table 4 provides point estimates for three outcomes of interest: the number of plantings,

the number of harvests, and the average number of growth days for plants harvested. For

both plantings and harvests, zeros are included in the analysis when no plantings or harvest-

ings took place that day at that firm. The left panel of Figure 1 illustrates the the counts

of the plants harvested around the July 1 tax change. The harvest rate increases by 7.5

percent, but this change is not statistically significant. However, we may be underpowered


   19
      The administrative data does not contain meaningful prices for many of the transfers of plant material
between cultivators and processors. In the administrative data, many of the processor prices are missing or
are filled in with prices arbitrarily close to zero. Due to the difficulty of interpreting these values, we focus
on quantity outcomes.

                                                       17
to detect effects in the harvesting and planting data because these activities are infrequent

and when they happen occasionally happen in large volumes. We examine the the number of

days from planting until harvesting, and find evidence that the number of days from plant-

ing until harvest falls by 6.9 percent. This suggests that cultivator-processors react to the

processor tax decrease by speeding up the harvest of existing plants in order to get more to

market in the medium-run.

   We examine the sensitivity of our estimates in Table 5 and Figure 2. The empirical

results are largely insensitive to bandwidth, allowing for an adjustment period from June 27

through July 5, polynomial order, interacting the polynomial with county indicators, and

exclusion of day-of-month indicators.

   These estimates suggest that in the short run, firms did not drastically alter their planting

or harvesting in response to the tax shift. In some ways, given the vast amount of vertical

integration and that firms are producing at capacity due to strong demand, this is not

entirely surprising – particularly given the firms did not have a long period to adjust their

production process since the law was only passed days before the tax change went into effect.



4.2    Processors

The tax reform also eliminated the transaction taxes faced by processors – those firms which

take raw marijuana flowers and plant material as inputs and transform them into usable

marijuana and other products. Before the change, the processors paid the taxes after the

transaction, implying the retailers paid the equilibrium price, while processors received the

after-tax price. Table 6 provides summary statistics for processors.



                                              18
    In Table 7, we provide point estimates of the effect of the tax change on the following

potential mechanisms through which processors might have altered their behavior: prices

(those charged to retailers), after-tax prices (those received by the processor after taxes),

weight (total weight of marijuana sold in grams), sales (total number of sales), after-tax

revenue, and THC levels.20 The only significant findings are on prices – we find that average

equilibrium prices fell by 8 percent. Simultaneously, the after-tax price (the price received

by processors after taxes) increased by 21 percent.21 We also find the quantity of sales

transactions, total weight of marijuana sold, and THC levels were unchanged.22

    Figure 3 provides graphical evidence of the after-tax price and weight responses we esti-

mated in columns (2) and (3) of Table 7. Because equilibrium prices did fall, but the after-tax

price for processors increases dramatically following the tax change, it appears that the elim-

ination of the 25 percent tax was a huge boon to processors, while it simultaneously reduced

the portion of variable costs of retail firms attributable to the cost of goods sold. At the

same time, we find the quantity of marijuana processed and sold to retail firms did not

significantly change around the reform. This suggests two things. First, it provides evidence

the firms did not anticipate the tax reform or its timing. The substantial shift in taxes

should give firms incentives to hold back production and sales to retail firms until after the

processor taxes are eliminated. Only the day before the tax change do we find the quantity

of marijuana substantially decreases (indeed June 30 appears to be a true outlier, consistent

  20
      The number of observations differ for sales and prices, because days with no transactions still result in
0 sales or weight, while prices were missing on those days.
   21
      The log change in the tax rate is 29% (i.e. log((1-.75)/1)=0.287).
   22
      Within the “usable marijuana” product segment, THC levels are effectively fixed by the production
process. However, processors may choose to differentially allocate plant material of varying quality to
different production processes (including processes that result in products that fall outside the “usable
marijuana” category and thus outside our analysis). Our null result here suggests firms did not substitute
in this way.

                                                      19
with tax avoidance on the part of processors, albeit extremely short-sighted avoidance).

   Table 8 and Figure 4 detail several variations of our preferred specification for the signif-

icant after-tax price response observed in column (2) and the insignificant change in weight

observed in column (3) of Table 7. The estimates are quite insensitive to bandwidth, allow-

ing for an adjustment period from June 27 through July 5, polynomial order, interacting the

polynomial with county indicators, and exclusion of day-of-month indicators.

   In summary, our findings suggest processors widely benefited from the elimination of

their transaction taxes with retailers. The tax benefits are shared between both the retailers,

whose price paid for marijuana fell by 7 percent on average, and the processors, whose price

received after paying taxes rose by 21 percent. After we estimate the retail response to the tax

regime change in Section 4.3, we will discuss the tax invariance and incidence implications

of these results. We find no significant increase the quantity of marijuana supplied from

processors to retailers, other than a one day anticipation effect and a few days adjustment

period (in which the sales withheld the day before the tax are sold to retail firms after the

tax change). This suggests that in the short run, the tax changes did not fundamentally alter

the supply of marijuana. This altogether suggests that in the short-run window surrounding

the tax change, supply is relatively inelastic – not surprising given the requirements of the

production process.


4.2.1   Vertical Integration of Cultivators and Processors


In this section, we provide the first empirical evidence on how vertical integration behavior

adjusts to an elimination of a gross receipts tax. These estimates inform us about the

potential deadweight loss associated with inefficient vertical integration stemming from the

                                              20
incentives created by a gross receipts tax. This setting is ideal for this analysis because

we have data on each link in the supply chain and it is a closed system (e.g. marijuana

cultivators are not also selling to cigarette companies, which we do not observe).

   We define vertical integration in this context at the retailer inventory lot level. An

inventory lot of marijuana is considered ‘vertically integrated’ marijuana if it was cultivated

and processed by the same firm. An inventory lot is considered ‘vertically dis-integrated’

marijuana if it was cultivated and processed by different firms (even if those firms were

formally vertically integrated).

   Before the tax reform, cultivators and processors had a strong incentive to vertically

integrate because there was a 25 percent gross receipts tax on cultivators that could be

avoided if the cultivator sold their product to a vertically integrated processor. Anecdotally,

cultivators often wished they did not also have to invest in the equipment to be processors,

but could not generally afford to do otherwise. Moreover, even if a company was both a

cultivator and processor, they would have still liked to sell some of their raw product to

other processors or purchased some raw product from other cultivators, but both were often

made too expensive by the existence of the 25 percent tax. These stories are borne out in

the data as about 93 percent of all inventory lots sold by processors to retailers consisted

of vertically integrated marijuana. Additionally, only about 5 percent of the total weight

of processor sales were of vertically dis-integrated marijuana. However, vertical integration

between cultivators and processors could be efficient and so this alone does not inform us

as to the magnitude of the inefficiency associated with the gross receipts tax system. The

tax reform on July 1, 2015 eliminated the incentive to vertically integrate for tax reasons.

We don’t expect many firms would de-integrate and become only a cultivator or a processor

                                              21
because of the fixed costs already paid, but new firms may be less likely to integrate and

there may be more processors purchasing from cultivators with whom they were not vertically

integrated.

   To understand the change in behavior resulting from the tax reform, we examine the

number of transactions of vertically integrated marijuana and the total weight of vertically

dis-integrated marijuana. Neither of these measures should be expected to change imme-

diately in response to the tax change because, on average, it takes roughly six weeks after

processors purchase raw material from cultivators before the resulting products are sold to

retailers. This leads us to make two adjustments to our analysis in this section relative to

our previous processor analysis: (1) we aggregate the analysis at the weekly level, and (2)

we include indicator variables for the six weeks following the tax change to examine the

adjustment period, relative to the long-run effect. In contrast to the rest of the processor

analysis, we also do not drop new firms because these are of particular interest as they may

be the most likely to choose to not be vertically integrated after the tax change.

   Figure 5 illustrates the fraction of transactions that are vertically integrated, and the

log weight of transactions which did not originate from a vertically integrated cultivator.

Point estimates are provided in Table 9. The fraction of vertically integrated sales falls by

3.7 percent after the adjustment period (Column 1), which is driven by a 42 percent long

run increase in non-vertically produced marijuana sold (Column 2). This provides evidence

that the gross receipts tax discouraged otherwise efficient trades between cultivators and

processors, thus creating deadweight loss. Table 9 Column (3) shows that there was no

significant increase in the price of these non-vertically integrated sales in the long-run.

   We further examine the potential inefficiencies created by the gross receipts tax by con-

                                              22
sidering the behavior of each firm in its first week in business – i.e. by considering behavior

closer to the firms’ decision to vertically integrate – in Table 9 Columns (4) and (5).23 The

fraction of vertically integrated sales in the first week in business declines by 16 percent

and the weight of vertically dis-integrated marijuana increases by 105 percent after the re-

form. Table 10 and Figure 6 illustrates the robustness of the results controlling for trends

in a variety of ways, adjusting for shorter or longer adjustment periods, and variation in

bandwidth.

   In summary, we find in the long-run, that the volume of non-vertically integrated trans-

actions rose substantially, although vertically integrated transactions continue to dominate

the market in absolute size. Most of the estimates in this section are likely lower bounds

on the true inefficiencies of a gross receipts tax because we are examining the elimination

of a gross receipts tax, and so many firms will have already paid the fixed costs necessary

to become both cultivators and processors, and may not choose to become one or the other

afterwards, even if that would have originally been efficient in the absence of a gross receipts

tax.



4.3       Retail Market

We now examine the consumer retail market. The tax reform converted the tax at the point

of retail sale to an excise tax which, given the way the original law was written, switched the

sales tax from applying to the tax-inclusive price before the tax change to the tax-exclusive

price after the tax change. The reform also increased the tax rate from 25 percent to 37

percent. Given that we can observe a portion of any given retailer’s input prices and those
  23
       The responses we observe for all firms is not driven by firms in their first week in business.

                                                        23
of their nearest competitors, we add some new covariates to our regression analysis relative

to previous sections. In particular, we add the prices paid to processors (their variable

costs), the prices of local24 competitors, and an indicator for whether there were any local

competitors. This has the potential to be valuable for the price estimates because, at the

firm level, the estimated price could change not only due to a change in the prices, but also

due to a change in the composition of goods sold. The inclusion of these variables is intended

to control for these changes. Retailers also have significant weekend patterns in weight sold

and these can vary substantially by firm depending on their location within a city as well

as the days of the week they are open. Hence, we include interactions between each firm

indicator and the indicators for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in all our baseline estimates;

this increases the precision of our estimates. Summary statistics for the retail market are

provided in Table 11.

    Point estimates across a variety of outcomes are detailed in Table 12. We estimate the

response of tax-exclusive and -inclusive prices, weight, the number of sales, tax-exclusive

and -inclusive revenue, and THC content. We find evidence that tax-exclusive prices, the

prices retailers received, fell by 4.8 percent. We find tax-inclusive prices, the prices paid

by consumers, rise by 2.1 percent.25 We find no significant response in weight or sales to

this marginally significant increase in the prices consumers paid. We find a statistically

significant decline in THC content which, when combined with the null results for THC in

the processor analysis, suggests consumers engaged in a degree of product-level substitution

  24
     We define ‘local’ as ‘within 10 miles.’
  25
     The excise tax increased from 25 to 37 percent and simultaneously the sales tax switched from being
assessed on the tax-inclusive price to being assessed on the tax-exclusive price. Together, these amount to a
7 percent increase in the tax rate (1+τ ) as measured by the log change in 1+τ for a firm with the average
sales tax rate, 8.7 percent.

                                                     24
toward lower quality marijuana in response to the increase in tax-inclusive prices and our

processor price controls are not able to fully control for these substitution patterns. This

biases our price estimates downwards – firms likely increased sticker prices by a larger amount

than a regression using purchases would detect.

    We address this bias by collapsing our data by inventory lot-day instead of retail firm-day

and including inventory lot fixed effects rather than retail location fixed effects.26 Because

inventory lots are unique to individual retailers and consist of plausibly identical goods,

quality (including retailer quality) within an inventory lot is fixed. We also anticipate our

estimates will be substantially more efficient when we estimate the response at the inventory-

lot level because we are able to more effectively control for quality via inventory-lot fixed

effects. We do not estimate the weight response at the inventory lot level because we do

not have the same substitution problem in our firm-level estimates. If individuals shift away

from one product towards another, this will leave our firm-level weight estimates unchanged.

It could, however, become more problematic if we estimated the response by inventory lot

because we are estimating the log change and an increase of one unit and a decrease of

one unit are not equivalent unless the sales volume of the two inventory lots started out

the same.27 Our preferred estimates of the increase in the tax-inclusive price using the

inventory lot-day level data is reported in Table 13 Column (1). We find that tax-inclusive

prices increased by 2.3 percent and this estimate is significant at the one percent level. The

magnitude of the inventory-lot and firm level estimates are quite similar, suggesting that
   26
       Our analysis at the inventory-lot level is restricted to all inventory lots that sell at least once in the
month prior to the tax change. If we did not impose this restriction, our estimates would still be identified
off of inventory lots that sell both before and after the tax change; however, including this restriction allows
us to more accurately estimate the coefficients for the inventory lots from which our identification comes.
    27
       The estimates of the weight response when the data are collapsed by inventory lot are qualitatively
similar to the estimates when the data is collapsed by firm.

                                                       25
processor prices were, in fact, doing a fairly good job of capturing the substitution patterns

we were concerned about at the firm level.

   Combining our preferred estimates on the change in tax-inclusive price (estimated at the

inventory lot-day) and weight (estimated at the retail sales location-day) reported in Table

13 Column (1), the implied average market-level elasticity of demand is -0.43. Figure 7

illustrates these shifts in tax-inclusive price and total weight surrounding the tax reform.

For the regression we report in Table 13, we switch to a linear polynomial in date sold with

an interaction between the tax change and this linear polynomial. The estimates are not

sensitive to this change in polynomial and it allows us to conserve degrees of freedom and

assess whether the tax change also affected the steady decline in prices or increase in weight

in this market over time.28 This short-run price elasticity of demand suggests Washington

is on the part of the Laffer curve where higher taxes on the margin would increase revenue,

and this is consistent with the positive effect on tax-inclusive revenue in Table 12 Column

(6). However, the decrease in tax-exclusive prices leads to a significant decrease in revenue

received by retailers. The long-run elasticity of demand appears higher; there is a significant

negative slope on the weight interaction term, which means that weight is continuing to

decline over time; in fact the implied elasticity of demand is about negative one within two

weeks of the tax change. Although we don’t have the power to detect this in our estimation,

our visual inspection of the raw data in Figure 7 suggests that the decline in the growth rate

of marijuana demand seems to slow down several weeks after the tax change, suggesting that

this is about when we hit the medium-run elasticity of demand after the tax change, holding

all else constant. This larger medium-run elasticity of demand suggests that Washington is

  28
       See Figure 9 for evidence that the estimates are not sensitive to polynomial choice.

                                                      26
near the peak of the Laffer Curve in the medium-run.

   We consider sensitivity of our main price and weight estimates in Table 13 Columns (2)

to (7) and Figures 8 and 9. Our estimates are insensitive to bandwidth, allowing for an

adjustment period from June 27 through July 5, decreasing the adjustment period to June

30 - July 1, interacting the polynomial with county indicators. We also show the weight

estimates are insensitive to dropping the inclusion of processor price covariates, which is

not surprising given that the weight estimates should not be influenced by substitution

decisions on the part of consumers as discussed above. We report the baseline price estimate

again in this column because we never control for processor prices in the inventory lot-day

analysis (these covariates would be collinear with the inventory lot fixed effects). The weight

estimates are sensitive to the exclusion of the day-of-month indicators in Column (4), which

is not surprising as there are systematic fluctuations in demand within a month. There is no

noticeable effect on the price estimates when we drop the interactions of Friday, Saturday,

and Sunday with each retail firm location in Column (5). The weight estimates get slightly

smaller and less precise.

   With estimates of the changes in prices for both the processor and retailer markets in

hand, we summarize the components of the tax-inclusive price charged by the average firm

for a gram of marijuana in Figure 10. The left and right bars, respectively, present the

components of the retail price before and after the tax change. Starting with the average

dollar amount spent to purchase a gram of marijuana from the retailer, we consider how

much goes to processor and retail taxes as well as how much the firms keep. Before the

tax change, all prices and taxes (in dollars) are based on the average prices across all firms

the month prior to the tax change. The post-reform numbers are calculated by applying

                                              27
our estimated price responses to the pre-reform numbers. This holds the composition of

the market constant and eliminates any secular trends in prices as well as changes in the

consumption patterns of consumers.

    The tax changes that were implemented on July 1, 2015 were intended to be approxi-

mately revenue neutral, and, in practice, they were not too far off from this. We calculate

that the average excise taxes collected on a gram of marijuana before the tax change was

$3.46 ($1.03 collected and paid by the processor and $2.43 paid by the retailer) and the

average taxes paid on a gram of marijuana after the tax change was $3.42 (all collected and

paid by the retailer).29 When we add sales taxes into this mix, which switched from being

applied on the tax-inclusive price before the tax change to tax-exclusive price after the tax

change, the total excise and sales taxes collected before the tax change were $4.51 per gram

of marijuana and were $4.23 afterwards, a decrease of 28 cents. Total retail taxes (leaving

the processor tax change out of the mix) went up by 75 cents.

    Processors paid an average of $1.03 in taxes for each gram sold prior to the change (and

nothing afterwards). The tax reform eliminated 28 cents of taxes overall, but the rest were

shifted from the processor to the retailer. The tax-invariance folk theorem suggests that, in

light of the fact that incidence is fixed and already accounted for in pre-reform prices, this

shift in taxes from the processor to the retailer should be reflected in the processor price

falling by the full amount of the tax shifting, 75 cents. However, we find that processors

only lower their price by an average of 26 cents per gram, suggesting that tax invariance has

been violated in this setting.

  29
     We ignore the taxes applied to cultivators in this discussion because over 90 percent of the market was
vertically integrated, and thus did not have to pay the tax and our price data for the remaining cultivators
is not of high-enough quality to consider this part of the tax change directly.

                                                    28
    We now consider the retail incidence implications of our results. If we were only con-

sidering a retail tax change (i.e the excise tax rate increased from 25 to 37 percent and the

sales tax switched from being on the tax-inclusive to the tax-exclusive price), the incidence

calculations would be straightforward. The retail tax rate increased by 7 percent30 , and

prices faced by consumers went up by 2.33 percent, so tax pass-through to the consumer

would be 33 percent.

    However, the processor tax also changed and this led to a decline in processor prices (i.e.

retailers’ marginal costs went down). We expect marginal cost changes will be passed through

to consumers in the same way as tax changes, so our calculation of consumer incidence that

ignores this processor price change is biased downwards. In fact, if the tax change was

entirely revenue neutral and tax-invariance had held, we would expect no change at all in

retail prices, not because there was no pass-through, but because there was no change in

taxes to be passed-through. We see from Figure 10 that processor prices fell by 26 cents for an

average gram of marijuana. This amounts to a 1.94 percent decrease from the equilibrium

tax-inclusive price, $13.49.31 . Hence, the net change in taxes and marginal costs is 5.06

percent, so consumers bear 44 percent of the tax burden (=.0233/.0506).

    We would be remiss to not mention the federal income tax in the discussion of incidence,

though appreciating exactly how it changed in expectation in response to the tax change is

challenging. The wording of the original Washington law suggested that retail firms may

owe federal income taxes on the tax-inclusive price.32 This was part of the instigation for
   30
      The tax changes amount to a 7 percent increase in the tax rate (1+τ ) as measured by the log change
in 1+τ for a firm with the average sales tax rate, 8.7 percent (= log((1 + .37 + .087)/(1.25 ∗ 1.087)).
   31
      We calculate this as the log change, 0.0194 = log((13.49 − .26)/13.49).
   32
      Here is the original language of the bill: “This tax is the obligation of the licensed marijuana retailer, is
separate and in addition to general state and local sales and use taxes that apply to retail sales of tangible
personal property, and is part of the total retail price to which general state and local sales and use taxes

                                                        29
the reform of the tax system on July 1, 2015. An IRS memo was eventually written, which

clarified that taxes were not owed on taxes paid to the state and this memo was retroactive

to the previous year’s taxes, but this memo was not issued until July 31, 2015, after the tax

reform had taken place.

    If retailers anticipated this decision by the IRS, then there was no change in the amount

of federal income taxes owed other than due to the change in retail and processor prices in

response to the tax change. If they did not, the tax change on July 1, 2015 would have

appeared to provide a large federal tax break to retailers – before the tax change, they

owed federal taxes on the tax-inclusive price and after the tax change, they owed federal

taxes on the tax-exclusive price. If firms believed that that the federal income tax always

applied to the tax-exclusive price, we find that incidence is split approximately 42-68 between

consumers and retailers – the only difference from the baseline incidence estimate is that

firms can deduct processor prices from their federal income taxes and these went down in

response to the tax change. As another benchmark, we would have found that taxes were

completely passed through to consumers if 70 percent of firms believed there would be no

federal income tax break due to the reform and 30 percent believed that there would be a

tax break (or equivalently if all firms believed there was a 30 percent chance there would be

a federal income tax break associated with the tax reform). For additional details on our

incidence calculations that include the federal income tax, please see Appendix A.




apply.” Because of the last part of this sentence, retail firms were concerned/believed that they owed federal
income taxes on their tax-inclusive price, too.

5     Conclusion

After the ballot measures passed during the 2016 elections are fully implemented, recreational

marijuana will be legal for 21 percent of the United States’ population. Given the broad

society-wide shift in support for legalization, driven in part by the desire to increase state

revenues, it is crucial to accurately gauge how industry participants, and, ultimately, revenue,

will respond to alternative regulatory and taxation systems. Internationally, countries that

have chosen to legalize marijuana, such as Canada and Uruguay, have had robust public

debates about the design of the regulatory and taxation scheme in the face of black market

availability.

    We contribute to this debate by analyzing a unique natural experiment in Washington

wherein the tax regime was reformed from a three-tiered structure of gross receipts taxes

throughout the supply chain to a single excise tax at retail. We use novel, comprehensive

administrative data on the universe of marijuana production and transactions within the

state to understand how cultivators, processors, retailers, and consumers responded to the

reform.

    We find gross receipts taxes increased vertical integration, which decreased the efficiency

of the market, given that non-vertically integrated transactions increased substantially, and

newly entering firms were far less likely to vertically integrate after the tax system moved

away from a gross receipts tax. This suggests that the deadweight loss of these gross receipts

taxes may be larger than other taxes with similar collected amounts given their effects on

decreasing the efficiency of production. This finding is particularly relevant given the diverse

regulations present in the nascent marijuana markets across the United States. Colorado


                                              31
requires vertical integration (retail firms must produce at least 80 percent of the marijuana

they sell) and Washington allows some types of vertical integration (between cultivators

and processors) and forbids integration between retailers with firms involved in marijuana’s

production. Our findings suggest that requiring vertical integration, as Colorado does, will

decrease market efficiency.

   While the previous literature has studied the elasticity of demand for marijuana within

the black market, ours is the first to focus exclusively on the legal market for recreational

marijuana. Some recent studies, notably Jacobi and Sovinksy (2016), have estimated the

elasticity of marijuana to be -.2, our findings suggest demand is inelastic (-.4) in the days

surrounding the price increase driven by the exogenous tax reform. However, we find that

that the quantity of marijuana purchased kinks downward from its prior upward trend.

This suggests the medium-run response to a price increase is elastic, which in turn suggests

Washington is close to the peak of the Laffer curve. Given that the tax rates that were

passed in California (15 percent), Maine (10 percent), Massachusetts (3.75 percent), and

Nevada (15 percent), are considerably lower than Washington’s rate, our findings suggest

considerable state revenue may be left on the table.

   Though seven of the eight states with legal marijuana have a sales or excise tax, several

states have also imposed cultivation taxes. Our findings suggest cultivation taxes can directly

affect incentives to vertically integrate. Additionally, Alaska and California’s cultivation

taxes are based on weight alone and Colorado’s wholesale tax is based on the average price-

per-gram of marijuana sold in the state. As the amount taxed in those states does not change

in response to the price of the wholesale marijuana sold, these taxes are relatively higher for

cheaper marijuana, which tends to be of lower quality and potency. Thus, the tax regimes

                                              32
in Alaska, California, and Colorado may incentivize suppliers to produce higher priced and

higher potency marijuana.

   While our results suggest significant tax revenue may be left on the table in many ju-

risdictions, evaluating the impact of marijuana policy (and constructing optimal policy) in

a broader social sense requires additional considerations. For one, the public health exter-

nalities of marijuana consumption are not well established. Nor is the relationship between

legal marijuana consumption and the consumption of other ‘sin’ goods such as alcohol or

tobacco. If it is indeed true, as many advocates claim, that marijuana consumption is ‘bet-

ter’ in a public health sense than alcohol or tobacco consumption, the optimal regulation of

marijuana should be designed to take into account responses in these other markets as well.

We leave such analysis to future authors.

A       Federal Income Tax Incidence Calculations

In this appendix, we consider how our incidence results would be affected if we incorporated
the federal income tax into our calculations. Without considering the federal income tax,
we found that consumers bore about 44 percent of the increased taxes due to the tax reform
on July 1, 2015. Understanding exactly how federal income taxes changed in expectation in
response to the tax reform is challenging and, as we described in the main text, depends on
whether firms believed that they always owed taxes on the tax-exclusive price of marijuana
or whether they believed that they owed taxes on the tax-inclusive price before the tax
reform and on the tax-exclusive price after the tax reform. While we can’t say exactly what
incidence looks like when we incorporate federal income taxes without knowing all firms’
expectations, we examine two benchmark cases. First, we consider what incidence would
look like if firms always believed that federal taxes would apply to the tax-exclusive price. We
then consider what beliefs would have needed to look like in order for taxes to be completely
passed-through to consumers as an alternative benchmark.33
    We don’t directly observe federal income taxes owed in our administrative data, so we
must estimate them. Section 280E – the federal tax code that governs the taxation of illegal
substances – and subsequent Chief Counsel Advice (CCA 201504011) specifies that retailers
are only allowed to deduct the costs of goods sold (as opposed to, say, labor and capital
costs), which in this case consists of the price paid to the processor and any transportation
costs of obtaining the inventory. We thus calculate a retail firm’s federal income tax liability
assuming the following: (1) their only income source is their marijuana business, (2) their

  33
      We do not consider processor federal income tax liability in this section for two reasons: (1) it is much
less likely that processors thought they were subject to a federal income tax on their tax-inclusive price
before the tax change, so there would be no real change in the amount of federal income tax owed as a result
of the reform except due to changes in the processor price, and (2) cultivators and processors are allowed
more deductions under federal law, many of which we don’t see, so our calculations of the federal income
tax liability would be much less accurate.

                                                      47
only cost of goods sold is the marijuana purchased, (3) they do not itemize, and (4) they are
married with one child. We recognize these assumptions are not perfect, but they are the
best we can do given what we observe and reasonable variations in any one of these would
not substantially change the estimated tax liability on a gram of marijuana.
   When all firms believe federal income taxes are always assessed on the tax-exclusive
price, we calculate how federal income taxes changed on a dollar of marijuana at the new
equilibrium price, $13.49, but we allow the processor price to change with the tax reform.
We find that at the new processor price, federal income taxes on a dollar of marijuana are
$1.54 and at the old processor price are $1.48; that is, federal income taxes on a dollar of
marijuana rose by 6 cents, which amounts to a 0.44 percent increase from the equilibrium
tax-inclusive price, $13.49.34 . Hence, the net change in taxes and marginal costs is 5.50
percent, so consumers bear 42 percent of the tax burden (=.0233/.0550).
   As an alternative benchmark, we consider what happens when 70 percent of firms be-
lieve that federal income taxes are always assessed on the tax-exclusive price and 30 per-
cent of firms believe that federal income taxes are assessed on tax-inclusive prices before
the tax reform and tax-exclusive prices after the reform. We calculate how federal income
taxes changed on a dollar of marijuana at the new equilibrium price, $13.49, but we allow
taxation to switch between tax-inclusive and tax-exclusive prices and we allow the proces-
sor price to change with the tax reform. In this scenario, federal income taxes are $1.90
(=.3*$2.74+0.7*$1.54) on average before the tax reform. Federal income taxes on a dollar
of marijuana declined by 36 cents, which amounts to a 2.7 percent increase from the equilib-
rium tax-inclusive price, $13.49.35 . Hence, the net change in taxes and marginal costs is 2.33
percent, so consumers bear 100 percent of the tax burden (=.0233/.0233). As the fraction of
firms that expected to pay taxes on the tax-inclusive price before the tax change increases
above 30 percent, pass-through to consumers would be more than 100 percent. And, as it
decreases below 30 percent, pass-through to consumers would be less than 100 percent.
  34
       We calculate this as the log change, 0.0044 = log((13.49 + .06)/13.49).
  35
       We calculate this as the log change, 0.027 = log((13.49 − 0.36)/13.49).
