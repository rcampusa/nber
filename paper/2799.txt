                                      ABSTRACT




      In this paper a production theory-based model of firms' markup behavior

is constructed.     The theoretical structure is based on variants of generalized

Leontief    cost and expenditure functions.     This structure yields a full

specification of behavior    from which the impacts of both supply and demand

shocks on firms' markup behavior can be assessed through elasticities.

Adjustment costs on both labor and capital and economies

incorporated.     Estimation is carried out using manufacturingdata for the U.S.

and Japan from 1960 through 1981.      The empirical results suggest that markups

for manufacturing firms     in the U.S. and Japan have increased      over time, but


tend to be procyclical    in the U.S. and countercyclical       in Japan.   This

diffetence stems primarily from differential investment behavior.            In

                                                                  tend to
addition,    capacity utilization and especially returns to scale

counteract the short run profit potential from markup behavior, so that

markups measured assuming constant returns may be biased downward.            Finally,

both supply and demand shocks appear to have a significant systematic impact

on markups.

I. Motivation

         Recently   there has been renewed interest   in factors affecting the levels

and cyclical    behavior of short tun markups of ptice ovet matginal cost.        Hall

[1988a], for example, has addressed the markup behaviot of firms in a number

of industties       and comes to the conclusion that markups exist and are large.

According to Hall, in manufacturing firms prices exceed the costs of added

inputs    by approximately63%.     Hall ]l988a, l988bJ has also suggested, however,

that profitabilityimplied by these markups may be counteractedby excess

capacity or returns to scale.

         Other researchers such ms Rotemberg and Saloner [1986], Bils [1987a,

l987b]    and Domowitz, Hubbard and Petersen [1987] have consideredmore

explicitly the behavior of the markup over the cycle.         Some suggest that


markups are counrercyclical       because in booms marginal cost increases more

rapidly than price with the expansion of production, while the reverse occurs

with downturns.        Others find that although this holds   for some types of goods,


markups overall are procyclical.        This implies important interrelationships

not only between markups and capacity utilization, as suggested by Hall, but

also between their cyclical variations.

         These studies provide important implications about short run pricing

behavior.      However,   they do not assess the structure of the production

technology underlying this behavior and are therefore limited in their

interpretationabout factors affecting the markup.          For example, the Hall

study is nonparametric and ignores the dependenceof markup levels on changes

in market conditions from supply and demand shocks, which Shapiro [l987b]

recognizes as important.        Although other studies such as Bils [1987b] and

Domowitz or al. [1987] relax some of those restrictions,         they still

essentially use nonparametric       or simple regressionmodels for estimationof
the pattern of markups.         In all these cases, since the measures       are nor


founded on an explicit optimization       model, the impact of changing         economic


factors    on production decisions and    thus the markup cannot be determined

on markups of demand and supply shocks can be consideredmore directiy.

      Empirical implementation        of existing models is also restrictedby the

number of inputs considered.         Although many studies recognize        the fixity of


capital,    most studies except those of Domowitz, Hubbard and Peterson consider

Although this facilitates theormtical analysis,

             changes in short run marginal    cost depend also on costs of other
cyclical

factors such as intermediate        materials and energy.

      Even morm importantly, constraints on the production process resulting

from fixity of inputs must be included explicitly to assess their cost

impacts.      For example, labor hoarding may have a considerable impact on markup

trends if it cauass avmrage variable        cost to increase as marginal cost

adjustmentmust therefore be carefully modeled to determine

these characteristics     of the production structure on firm decisions and thus

markup behavior.      In addition, if the firm faces fixiriea other than those

based on slow capital adjustmentand labor hoarding,                 to isolate the impact

 the resulting    curvature   of the long run   average cost curve must       be       recognized.

If this is the case, overall economic profits remain negligible even with high

markups,    which appears consistent with empirical observation.       Assessing these

relationships and how     they might   vary when exogenous variables change provides

and their determinants.

      The purpose of this paper is to analyze the markup behavior of firms

using an applied production theory approach.         The model allows characteristics

of the production structure such as adjustment costs and returns to scale, as

well as potential for markup pricing behavior, to affect firms' decisions.

The structure does not restrict the number of fixed or variable          inputs which

may be taken into account.       It also permits independent identification of the

effects    of supply and demand shocks on the short run optimizationprocess of

the firm.     Based on this framework,    markup indexes and associated endogenous

economic performance indicators and elasticities are measured for the U.S. and

Japanese manufacturing sectors.        Capacity utilization and returns    to scale

indexes are computed    to assess the impacts of these characteristics       of the

production technology on markups.        Although some   of these measures may be

difficult    to interpret in the aggregate, the estimates appear to reflect very

important    characteristics    of the production process, since their values are

significant and reasonable.        Elasticities with respect to both supply    (cost)

and demand shocks are employed to compute impacts on price and cost

fluctuations     and accompanying utilizationand profitabilityvariations.           These

measures    suggest both supply and demand shocks, particularly investment rates,

have important impacts on markups.
II. The Model

      The theoretical model for this study is a dynamic profit-maximizing

factor demand model with imperfect competitionin the output market.                 The

technology is assumed to be represented by a restricted cost function, G,

which is a function     of J variable input prices pj (or vector p), K quasi-fixed

inputs xk (x), output Y, the state of technology          t,    and net investment in

quasi-fixed inputs axk—dxk/dt (ax); C—G(Y,p,x,t,dx).              This function can also

be written as   G(Y,4'),   where 4' is a vector of the shift variables or "supply

(cost) shocks" for the firm.        In the short run the level of quasi-fixed inputs

x is fixed for the firm, as is the state of technology and p.              Investmentand

output or output price are, however,         endogenous   to the full optimization

process of the firm, because the firm is faced with adjustment costs with

respect to additional investment and a demand curve for its output.

      In particular,       adjustment   costs are reflected by the incorporation       of dx

in the cost function, with 3G/BIAxkI>O for all k.              This formalizes   the notion

that investmentin fixed inputs causes increased variable input use and

therefore   internal   costs of productionat a given output level.            In addition,

market power in the output market is included by assuming the firm maximizes

net revenues subject to a downward sloping demand curve for its output,

representedby the demand function          YD(py,4') or the inverse demand function

     D(Y,4').      In this specification,         is a vector of shift variables
Py

affecting demand which reflect "demand shocks".

      The firm's intertemporal profit maximizationproblem is therefore to

of x, a.

       This optimizationproblem is solved in three steps.              Variable costs are

minimized,    given x, dx and   '1;   the maximum   (instantaneous) variable profit

obtainable    at time t is derived,      subject to the variable      cost function

obtained   in the first stage and conditional on the levels of x and dx; and

then the present value of total net receipts are optimized over the quasi-

fixed inputs.

       Minimization of variable costs is incorporated by specificationof
                                                                minimum variable
G(Y,*);2   by definition this restricted cost function captures

costs conditionalon p,x,dx and Y.           The function C has two important

                                                                                      v   is


the short run cost minimizinginput level and 2k is the normalizeduser cost

or marginal shadow value of the stock of xk.

       Given the cost minimizingvariable            input demands embodied in C, profit

maximization conditionalon the quasi-fixed inputs requires maximizing

                     with respect to Y.3        The solution to this problem can be

characterizedby the standard equality of short tun marginal revenue (MR) and

marginal     cost (MC)

 The final step in the maximizationprocess,            determining    the path of the quasi-


 fixed inputs, requires substituting the optimized values for output price and

 input quantities    into the maximizationproblem:

      The solution to the overall profit maximizationproblem therefore is

representedby a system of equations including the optimized level of variable

input demand reflected              by aC/6p —   vj    the profit maximizing output price from


(2) and the path of            x and Ax   captured in (4).              Thus, to implement   this model


empiricallyone must next specify the inputs under considerationand the forms

of G(Y,) and D(Y,).

       I assume there are four inputs, capital (K), labor (L), energy (E), and

non-energy intermediate materials (K).                   Capital         is consideredquasi-fixed,   ss

is standard for short run models.                Energy and materials are assumed to be

variable because it is reasonable to hypothesize that they can be obtained

rapidly in response to fluctumtions                  in the supply or demand conditions facing

the firm.       The fixity of labor is unclear.                For both the U.S. and Japan some

fixity ham been noted by researchers, although the extent of the fixity and

how it differs between the U.S. and Japan is not certain.4                           For the current

                      therefore, labor was specified           to be quasi-fixed.        This makes the
application,

speed of adjustment endogenous,        thus permitting

 5The properties of this function are outlined in greater detail in Morrison
 [l9g8a] . Note that unless there are proportional movements in relative
 sectoral growth, the computationof a level of returns to scale for an
 entire industry using this function does not reflect a level of rerurns for
 any particular firm. Although constant returns is often assumed to
 circumvent this problem this seems too limiting.   Preliminary empirical
 investigation of the data with constant returns imposed resulted in
 implausible results. In addition, estimates from this study as well as
 previous work by gerndt and Khaled [1979] and Hall [1988a, 1988b] suggest
 that returns to scale estimates ate significant. This significance, in
 addition to the reasonablesize of the estimates found in the current study
 and Berndt and Khaled, suggest that something important is being picked up
 from the data by the scale parameters, so they have been retained.    Further
 consideration of markups and returns to scale using more disaggregateddata
 is found in Morrison ]1988b].

        Elasticities   oi the markup and its price and cost components with

respect to changes in the exogenous variables, can now be clearly interpreted

as reflecting responses to demand and supply 'shocks.                 Constructing these

elasticities is somewhat complex, however, because a standard elasticity

measure requires evaluation at a given quantity or price of output.                   by

constrast,   in this case the simultaneous determinationof price and output

must be taken into account.         To allow for this endogeneity,         the formulas    for


price and marginal cost incorporate           the solved value of output from the price

determinationequation.         The resulting equations then reflect the full short

run optimizationprocess.

        More specifically,     the price equation used for elasticity construction

is the inverse demand equation as a function of the solved value of output

from (2).    To compute this, Y can be solved from (2) as Y—f(4',b) and

substitutedback into the left hand side of the equation to represent the

chosen price-output combination.             Then elasticities of price with respect to

components of the        vector,    such as #1 for example, can be computed as

Iln D(#,f(#,#))/8ln        l       This effectivelycomputes         the output price

elasticity as dln py/dln             3Py/8l +      dpy/8Y.(3f/31)].1/py, allowing for
both price and output adjustments with            a    shift in demand.   Analogous   reasoning

holds for changes in the cost function with a variation in an element of                     and

corresponding      movements   along the demand curve that yield a new optimized Py

Y   combination.

        In this model the specificationof the cost and demand equations do not

allow an analyticalsolution for the f(ô,) function.                   In this case, instead

of the explicit solution, the implicit function 0—(Y,,) may be used.                       Then

                                   becomes                 -

of both capital and labor is permitted,          so any deviation    is a combination of

these   two impacts.     In addition,   the impact on the utilizationpatterns         of

supply and demand shocks may be assessed in terms of elasticities by

constructing an expression for CUc and computing dln CUc/dln            #   using

processes   analogous    to those outlined above for markup elasticities.

        Finally,     returns to scale can   be measured by evaluating the     slope of the

long run average cost curve.        This requires     computing a long run elasticity of

cost with respect to output,       c*y,     which turns out to be equivalent io the

ratio of the short run cost elasticity,          cy—3lnC/8lnY, and CUc, because

                      This results from the long run cost elasticityexpression,

                             where ECk—alnC/alnxk and k denotes the quasi-fixed

inputs IC and   L,    as developed in Morrison      [1986, l988c[.   This measute can be

computed, its statistical significancetested, and the impacts of exogenous

shocks on it calculated,       similarly to those for markups and capacity

utilization discussed above.

        Theme indexes of capacity utilization and returns to scale ate important

for evaluatingmarkup behavior.          In particular. Hall [l988a, l988b] suggests

that markup behavior and excess capacity or returns to scale trade off in

generating profits.        In the current model the impacts of both capacity

utilization,       and returns to scale on profitability      of returns to scale, can be

independently       identifiedand assessed.

        More specifically, Morrison [l988c] has recently shown that an

adjustment factor (AIM) can be developed that decomposes the difference

between revenues and costs when fixity, returns to scale and imperfect

competition exist; C.AI3J—p.Ywhere                                                  The first

component    of this adjustment factor reflects returns to scale,           CU   captures

 the current context, if the impact of the elasticity in turn determines the
 markup, the full adjustment is the relevant computation.

the deviation   of revenues from costs, or profits, facilitates assessment oi

the Hall Ll9SSa] hypothesis that markups may be consistent    with zero profits

because profits generated by market power are counteractedby excess capacity

with respect to capital.

      To formalize this argument, assume constant returns to scale and one

fixed input (capital) that determinescapacity utilization.      The deviation of

revenues   and costs then becomes ADJCUcIPRAT where CUc(G+ZK•K)/(G+Pg•K).

Thus, Hall's argument can be expressed   as the hypothesis

This is obviously equivalent to the hypothesis that l/CUc—PRAT; CUc and the

so l/CUc also exceeds one.    The interpretation   also makes intuitive    sense,

because CUc falling short of one means the firm is overcapitalized,        so profits

are not as high as they might be with full long run optimization.         Jhether or

not this is true empirically can be determinedby comparing the capacity

utilization and markup values.

         First, with labor quasi-fixed the impact of labor hoarding             on fitm

behavior can be modeled.      This will affect the capacity utilization measure

and potential profits because if too much labor is being held, even if capital

is at the correct short run level, full capacity utilizationwill be lower

than one and the firm will he employing more labor than it would with full

optimization.     This could help rationalize the capacity utilization argument

if it pushes capacity utilization measures below one.

         Second, the full adjustment measure depends not only on capacity

utilization and markups but also on returns ro scale, reflectingother

fixities    that affect production.    If returns to scale are permitted, to

evaluate the potential profitability of the firm even with market power the

full        measure is the relevant one to compare to flAT.              Since most studies

incorporating    returns to scale have found fairly large returns exist,                this

could further reduce     CY   sufficiently    to counteract the profit margins

available from market power.       This profitabilityhypothesis can be assessed

by comparing the     indexes of capacity utilization,     returns to scale and the

markup.     The impacts of supply and demand shocks on profitability             in turn can

be assessed in terms of elasticities of these measures.

Estimation was catried out by three stage least squares with once-lagged

variables    as instruments to allow for the endogeneity of output, output price

and investment and for the unobservedexpected prices of the inputs.

although additional pooling parameters included

identify     other differences   in interactions between inputs and output were

insignicant.      The extent of pooling in the model suggested by the data implies

some similarityof production functions facing manufacturing firms in the two

countries.      It is likely, however,     that even if the available     technology is

similar,     the two countries would choose to produce at different points on the
                                                           and flexibility of

and aMY) also has important implications because restrictionof the cost

function to constant returns to scale resulted not only in a rejection of

constant returns, but also yielded implausible indexes and elasticity

 estimates)-5 The significance of these interactions clearly reflect an

 important    aspect of the technology     that should be included in the model.

       The R2's, squares of the simple correlationbetween actual and fitted

 values,    are all greater than .6, and those for the        Py and C(Y,)   equations    are

                                          the model is providing    a good representation
 greater than .92.        This suggests

  14Parameterestimates which were statistically insignificant were deleted,
  unless symmetry between variable or fixed inputs required retaining them.
  15An interesting pattern that arises when constant returns to scale
  estimation is carried out is that markups and adjustment coats both appear
  smaller and adjustment costs often are insignificantly different from zero.
  It appears, therefore, that the additional flexibilityallowed with the
  scale parameters is important for the representation of markup behavior even
                                            in the aggregate is problematic.

of the technology,    particularly since the cost equation was not estimated and

many of the equations do not have an intercept.            Estimmtion of alternative

systems with intercepts       appended to the equations were attempted, but did not

result in substantive changes in results, although           the R2's were higher.

         From these parameter    estimates   performance   indexes and elasticities   for

the two countries were computed.        Consider    the markup indexes in the first two

columns of Table 2.        These indexes, computed as the price ratio py/MC—PRAT,

suggest    that price margins in the U.S. and Japan have varied both across

countries    and time.16     The markup of price over marginal cost in the U.S. has

remained in the relatively small range of 11% to 23%, generally increasing

over timej7      The markup for Japan is only slightly larger on average than

that for the U.S., but it varies substantiallymore, ranging from 7% in the

beginning of the sample to 4g% at the end.          The markup is also statistically

significant;    the standard error for 1976 is .009 for the U.S. and .02 for

Japan.




 16This  is true also of average cost measures computed with this model,
 although  there is a large differencebetween the markup of price over
 marginal  and over average cost. This suggests that previous methods that do
 not well distinguishmarginal from average costs, or assume they are the
 same may contain serious biases that fluctuate over time. The estimates
 suggest a declining markup over average cost over time. Combined with the
 PRAT measures above this implies that average costs are increasing relative
 to marginal cost over time. Since MC—AC+Y.ÔAC/8Y, this implies a decrease
 in Y.3AC/8Y if increasingreturns to scale exist so ÔAC/JY is negative.
 Thus cost curves may be shifting to the right over time so available returns
 to scale are increasing.   This is consistentwith evidence on returns to
 scale outlined below.
 17This contrasts with estimates generated in studies like Hall [1986) using
 nonparametricmethods. Most of this deviation can be attributed to the
 gross output as contrasted to value added framework used here since
 Domowitz, Hubbard and Peterson have shown that including materials should
 reduce the estimated margin by a factor of (l-eM) where     is the share of
 materials in output.   Since °M is approximately 60%, this implies a value-
 added markup of approximately 45% to 60% which is in the range of the Hall
 estimates.   Such a comparison is not strictly applicable, however, since
 both capital and labor are quasi-fixed in the current model.

           In addition   to the secular ttends in these indexes, cyclical     ttends    ate


evident,       For example, in some recession years, especially those after the

OPEC price shocks of 1973-74 and 1979-80, the price ratios decline.             These

trends ate not, howevet,        as strong as the trends over time, especially      in

             For example,   the drop in the price margin between 1973 and 1974     in    the
Japan.

U.S.   ,   from 19%   to 14%, is only slightly lower than the gap between the 1960

and 1981 markup measures.         However,   the decline in the markup in Japan of 34%

to 30% in 1973-74 was not only smaller than that in the U.S. but also much

less dramatic than the change over the whole time period.

           Also, the recovery   from impacts on the markup is faster in Japan.          In

Japan, for example,         by 1975 the markup already exceeded that in 1973, and it

continued to rise until 1978, when the subsequent (perhaps OPEC-inspired)

setback experienced until 1980 was again accommodatedby 1981.               In the U.S.,

                   the decline became worse through 1975 and then turned around
by contrast,
slowly, with the markup just reaching          the pre-OPEC level of 1973 by 1981 and

never reaching that attained in 1970-71.

            Further informationabout the trends in markups and their responses to

                                  to demand shocks can be obtained using the price,
 supply (cost) as compared

marginal cost and price ratio elasticities presented in Table 3.              For example,

                                                                 show that if the price of

 increase.       Although both components of the total price ratio change are
                                                             much larger for
 statistically significant, the magnitude of the response is

 materials, as would be expected from the more substantial cost share for

 materials than energy.         The response to materials price changes is also

                                                     for energy it is smaller
 slightly larger in Japan than in the U.S., although

      The combined effects on the price ratio, reflected by                 P%T pE and
            are that increases in the input prices decrease the markup ratio,
6PRAT,pM'

more for energy in the U.S. and mote for materials              in Japan.    This is

consistent with the implications observed             in the computed    index for responses

to energy price changes;      the larger energy price elasticity in the U.S.


implies that OPEC would have had a more substantial downward impact                on    the

markup ratio in the U.S.          The magnitude    of this   change   is also substantial;

even with only a .04% change in the ratio for a 1% change in energy prices,

the doubling and tripling of energy prices experienced in the l970s would

clearly have caused significantdeclines             in the price margin.      This suggests

that supply ahocks based on input prices are important and in aggregate could

appear as procyclicalvariations in price margins.

      Similarly,      increases    in the levels of capital or labor, which could

arise due to any relaxationof the constraint but could potentiallybe a

result of declines      in their prices and corresponding          investmentbehavior,

cause decreases in both Py and MC and a corresponding increase in PEAT.                   This

impact appears even larger for capital than for labor, which is consistent

with the larger markups found in Japan over time when investment in capital

was phenomenally high.

      A final cost side change         --   the   last component   of the 5 vector - -    is
technical   change.     The 6Pyt' MC,t' and          PEATt    elasticities   suggest that if

the state of technology improves price decreases, but marginal costs decrease

even more so the price ratio increases slightly.               Since this price ratio

response    is larger in Japan than in the U.S. it appears that technical                change

is more beneficial to Japanese         firms than U.S. firms, or possibly         that the

extra capital that has been accumulated in Japan embodies more recent

technology and thus supports a higher price margin.18
                                             -20-




         Demand side short run chsnges stem from shifts in the demand function

due to vmrimtions in the components of the              vector.    Increases    in all of

these variables except EXP have positive            impmcts   on both Py and    MC.   Most of

these price impacts are smaller for Japan than the U.S., hut all are

significantlydifferent from zero.           Each of the impacts is mlso small          for MC,


and, in fmcr, is insignicantly         different from zero, especially in Japan.

This suggests slightly more price rigidity in response to demand shocks in

Japan as compared to the U.S., and a correspondingly              smaller movement along

the marginal    cost curve, which also is likely flatter than that for the U.S.

This latter implication is supported by the low CMCY elasticity reported at

the bottom    of the    Table.

         Overall,    both demand and supply shocks have an important impact on PEAT.

All the elasticitiesare statistically significantand both supply shocks

(particularly       capital investment and materials price changes) and demand

shocks    (especially    expenditure   per capita and coat of living changes) have

rather large influenceson markup behavior.              Note also that in all cases the

PEAT response to cost shocks is reversed from that of the price and marginal

coat elasticities.        This stems froa the larger marginal coat than price

elasticity.     The reverse holds for demand shocks because the price effect

dominates.     This is consistentwith what might be expected; shifts in curves

rather than the correspondingmovements along curves dominate                   price setting

behavior.

         The degree of market power, in the sense of the deviation of price froa

marginal    coat, appears from these indexes and elasticities to be significant

both statisticallyand in magnitude, and changes both secularly and cyclically



         interpretation is, however, difficult to justify explicitly since
  embodied technical change is not directly modeled.

in response   to various    exogenous shocks.      Additional   evidence   about the


importance of market power can he obtained from the implied output price or

demand elasticity.      This   fypy elasticity is     the invetse of the     pyy
elasticity teported      in Table 3; -8.326 for the U.S. and -3.640 in Japan, which

is within the range suggested by Hall f1988aJ fot the U.S.             This elasticity is

                                                                     in the U.S. than in
quite large for the U.S., suggestingmore competitiveness

Japan in 1976.     The elasticities    for the remainder of the sample, however,

indicate    a larger demand elasticity in Japan than for the U.S. earlier in the

sample, consistentwith increasing         market power over time, as is implied by

the relationship PRAT—l/(l+epyy). The inverse demand elasticities                   are

significantlydifferent from zero in all years so there is statistical support

for the importance of the downward slope of the demand curve for manufacturing

output.     This conclusion again coincides with the evidence of significanceof

the price ratio from one.       These results suggest that the hypothesis of

perfect competition can clearly be rejected.           Although   it is more difficult to

interpret the level of markups as that experienced          by individual firms        unless

extensive    implicit   collusion   is assumed,    the level is reasonably consistent

with estimates computed by other researchers.           Finally, this discussion

suggests    that flAT elasticities can be interpretedas changes in the demand

elasticitywith changes in the exogenous variables.

       In addition to markup measures, indexes indicating the extent of input

fixity may be used to evaluate the importanceand impacts of these constraints

on production.     As discussed in the previous section, the extent of fixity is

representedby the capacity utilization measure CUE.               This measure, which

reflects    a combination of the costs of capital and labor fixity, is presented

in the second two columns of Table        2.   The CUc index is greater than one for

most of the time sample for the U.S., only indicating             excess capacity    for the
1977-1978   period.   This is similar to measures constructedby Berndt and

Morrison    [19811. among others, and is consistent with observations        of strong

investment in manufacturing even in years of relatively slow growth.

       By contrast, in Japan excess capacity became available as early as 1970

and the amount of excess capacity       increased from that time.      This was a result

primarily of the extensive     investment   in new capital carried out     by Japanese

manufacturing firms in the 1970s, so that excess capacity in capital was

available    from 1970.   Capital   investment in the U.S.   •   even post-OPEC, was

mmall enough that it fell short of that implied         by profit maximization.      The

impacts of labor fixity partially       counteract   this, since the shadow value to

market price ratio for labor is less than one from 1964 through 1974 and 1976

to 1980 for the U.S. and from 1971 through 1979 for Japan with the values for

1975 and 1976 very slightly exceeding one.

       The imporrance of fixity of factors can be determinedby considering the

statisticalsignificance of the deviation of the capacity utilizationmeasure

from one.     The individual shadow price ratios can also be evaluated.           For CUc

rhe standard error tended to be between .01 and .015 for most years.              Thus,

for 1976 CUc was significantlydifferent from one for Japan but not for the

U.S.   This arose primarily because of the deviation of capital from ira

oprimum level; for a ZK/PK value of 1.21 in the U.S. and .72 in Japan, the

standard    errors are .10 and .06,    suggesting    at least marginal statistical

significance    from one.   For labor, the analogous index yields values of .954

in the U.S. and 1.026 for Japan with standard errors of .03 and .0519
 19   It is possible also, however, to compute the significance of adjustment
 coats to ascertain the impact of fixity. Theme computations provide quite
 different implications; they suggest adjustmentcoats for capital are
 marginally significant in the U.S. and insignificant in Japan. For labor,
 however, adjustmentcosts were generally positive and significant for both
 countries, supportingSolow's [1968) suggestion that labor fixity may be
 even more important than capital fixity for representation of the
 technology.  This evidence of adjustment coats suggests that the enormous
                                           -23



        Returns     to scale can he measured by inverting the long run cost

elasticitywith tespect to output changes to obtain l/Ecy.               The cost

                                                       sixth columns in Table
elasticity is presented in index form as the fifth and

2.    This elasticity indicates that estimated returns tn scale in 197i are

1.186   for the U.S. and 1.261     for Japan.    A cost increase of 1% supports a

                                                                  in Japan;
larger output increase in Japan so returns to scale appear larger

Japanese    manufacturing firms ate on a steeper portion of the long run avorage

cost curve.       The correspondingstandard errors were estimated to be .012 for

the U.S. and .017 for Japan, clearly indicating statistical significanceof

the measure from one for both countries.          This evidence   plainly conveys

evidence    of returns to expanding output production,      even though it is


difficult to interpret those results as indicating returns to scale for

individual firms.        The indexes suggest that returns to scale are increasing

over time, possibly due to an outward shift of the long run average cosr curve

as larger networks cause reduced costs of inputs such as capital, labor,

energy and intermediate materials.

         Finally,    these measures of fixity and returns to scale can be used to
                                                                            to
motivate assessment of the hypotheses that fixity (Hall [1988a]) or returns
                                                                           have
scale     (Hall   [l988b]) may counteractprice markups so firms effectively

zero profits.        As suggested in the previous section, this requires computing

 the adjusted indexes ADJiCUc•PRAT to assess the impact of fixity of capital

 and labor, A0J2—c0yePRAT to determine the relationship between markups and

 returns to scale, and A0J3CU•c110y•PRATE0y•FRAT            to ascertain the combined

 effect of capacity fluctuations and scale economies on the profitabilityof

 firms.     These indexes are presented in Table      4.




                                                       constant labor force has a

     basis in the fixity of labor relative to capital.

      A glance    at the indexes for hnth cnuntties    shows that the simple

hypothesis that capacity utilizationalone can attenuate the excess
                                                                    not
profitability implied by the gap between price and marginal cost is

supported.     This arises because overutilization     of capital in an economic

sense is not sufficiently      counteracted by underutilizationof labor to cause

the total capacity utilizationmeasure to fall short of unity, so the effect

of the adjustment is to push the combined ADJ1 measure farthet from one.

However,     it is also clear that the availabilityof long run economies       of

scale, possibly     arising from some other fixity the firm faces, does attenuate

the markup;     the values reported    in the third and fourth columns are very close

to one in most years, and drop below one in the later years of the sample for

the U.S.      This suggests   that although excess profitabilityexisted to some

extent in the early years of the sample, since 1970 the "excess capacity" from

potential     scale economies reduced profitability    even with a latger markup.

       The fmportanceof returns to scale in attenuating excess profitability

implies that models that impose constant returns to scale on the data likely

underestimate markups.        This arises because if   ccy is   assumed to equal one,

flAT (and CUc) must absorb the impact of scale economies,         so their estimates

will be biased.      Estimationof the current model imposing constant returns

confirms this.      In fact, markups decrease by nearly fifty percent from thnse

estimated when nonconstant returns to scale are allowed.          This is also

consistent with the lower markups estimated by Appelbaua [1982J in a similar

model with constant returns to scale imposed; Shapiro [l987a] argues that

 forcing the equality of marginal and average costs causes these aatkup

 estimates    to be biased downward.

       This development provides a perspective on the cyclicality of markups

 since the question of cyclical price margins has typically been considered in
                                                    -25-




the literature20    as the question of whethet the correlationbetween capacity

utilization and matkups is negative or positive.                  If the Hall hypothesis is to

be correct,    this implies that                  or CCI in the generalizedproblem with

returns to scale, must be invetsely related to the markup since PRAT•CUcl

implies PRATl/CUc.         This imposes a countercyclical           variation    in the markup by

definition if this correlation is thought to be the relevant interpretationof

the cyclicaiity question.               In the U.S. the correlations as well as the levels

of CU0 are inconsistentwith the Hall hypothesis, but when returns to scale

are also taken into account some confirmation is found; the simple
                                                                                          .65 and   -
correlations of the price ratio with CUc, C'CY and CCI are .009,
                                                                                      -




.47,   respectively.       The relationships          in Japan are quite different;       for Japan

                                         - .981   and -.975.   For the U.S. only, therefore,
the correlations are        -
                                .945,
the result for capacity utilizationis consistentwith the Domowitz, Peterson

and Hubbard [1987,1988] finding of slightly procyclicalmarkups.

        The interactions between PRAT, CU0 and                 cCy can be   further explored


using elasticities of these values to see how they change with exogenous

supply and demand shocks.               The elasticities with respect to CUc,        6C1 and
their coabination cy presented in Table 5 can be compared with the PRAT

elasticities    in Table 2.         This comparison        suggests some very interesting

relationships    between the indicators.               For example, for the U.S. the impact of

                                                                         to be
 input price shocks and of technology on the price ratio and CU0 appears

very similar.      Thus,    the dramatic energy price shocks of the 1970s not only

 caused PRAT to decline but caused ADJ1 to decrease even more substantially;

 the trends are in the same rather than opposite direction.                     This supports

 procyclicalityrather than the countercyclicality                  implied by the hypothesis

 that capacity utilization is a buffer for profitability                 from markups.


  20See Domowitz, Hubbard and Peterson [1986, 1988], for example.

      The response to capital, and particularly labor adjustment,                is somewhat


different.               the CUc ratio increases wirh investment21,            it does not
              Although

rise by as much as the price ratio.            For labor, by constrast,      increeses in


employment cause the price ratio to increase but the capacity utilization

ratio to decline slightly.      Overall,       therefore,    for the U.S., all cost shocks


except changes   in employment cause the price ratio and capacity utilization to

move in the same direction.22

      For Japan the story is quite different.               Although   input price changes

cauae PRAT and CUc to move in the same direction, the impact on CUc is less

than half that on PRAT.      In addition, the effects of investment and labor

force expansion on CUc are both negative, whereas the impact on the price

ratio is positive, particularly for capital.            Thia suggests some profit


potential    for inveatmentin Japan that is not found in the U.S., possibly from

more technologyembodied in capital.             More simply, it may be that the Hall

hypothesis that high price margins support excess capital capacity is more

applicable to Japan.      Technological    change also appears to have pushed PRAT up

in Japan by more than capacity utilization, or than PRAT in the U.S.

       Demand shocka appear to have        a   rather similar impact on capacity

utilization and the price to marginal coat ratio in both countriea; the

direction of the impact is the same for all variables except POP but the
                                                              the price ratio
magnitude of the capacity utilizationresponses aa compared to

movement is considerably larger in the U.S. and similar for Japan.




  21Hote that this elasticity, similarly to the other elasticitycomputations,
  allows a full optimization change to occur rather than holding output
  constant.  Otherwise, an increase in K should by definition increase
  capacity and decrease the utilization rate for a given output.
  22Since adjustments in appear to be countertyclical, restrictions in labor
  are consistentwith procyclicality, similar to the Keynesian view of the
  impacts of labor hoarding on cyclicality of productivity.

        The   overall effect    of these   differenr   shocks   is that   demand shocks tend

to   be procyclical for both countries, and have a larger impact on capacity

utilization in the U.S.         Supply shocks exhibit more variation.          They are

primarily     procyclical in the U.S., and also in Japan for the variable input

                    Labor force changes may attenuate somewhat            the general
price changes.
                                                          More importantly,     on   balance
procyclicalityof markups for both countries.

the response     to capital investment      differs substantially;        the significanceof

                               found in Japan as compared       to the U.S. appears     to stem
the countercyclicality

from the large growth in the capital stock during this period.



XV.    Concluding Comments

        This paper has developed mnd implemented empirically a model of firms'
                                                  framework based on output
markup pricing behavior using a production theory

demand and restricted cost functions.           My frasework allows evaluation of

important     determinants     of production structure and thus firm decision making,

such as market power, returns to scmle and capacity utilization with quasi-

fixed capital and labor hoarding.           The procedures used allow explicit

consideration of the effects of supply (cost) as compared to demand shocks on

pricing behavior.       The resulting rich structuralmodel permits assessment of a

number of important issues that have been raised in the recent literatureon

the pricing behavior of firms.

        The model has been implementedby applying it to pricing behavior in the

manufacturing sectors of the U.S. and Japan.             The estimated markup indexes

                                                       and lie in the 11% to
suggest that price margins are statistically signicant

48% range, that they have increased over time, especially in Japan, and that
                                                                                        in Japan.

latter.    Both supply and demand shocks appear to have important                impacts on

pricing decisions and their cyclical nature, particularly prices of the

variable inputs, capital accumulation, and the cost of living.                   In addition,

the fixity of labor seems to be an important constraint           on firm behavior in

the short run because adjustment costs are significant,           and nonconstant

returns appear important to take into account.

      An   interesting      feature of this study is the U.S. -Japan comparison.

Overall,   these countries appear to have a similar productionstructure

statistically,     since most pooling parameters      included   in the model were

insignificant,     although some important differences      arise.     The major

difference is the size and extent of time trend of the markups.                   This appears

primarily to arise from the investment behavior observed in Japan; although in

the U.S. investment has not been large enough to provide a profit-maximizing

level of capital capacity, the enormous level of investment in Japan caused

excessive capital to be available from the early 1970's, supporting the latge

observed   price margins.

       Another potentially illuminating comparison is between different

industries.      Although    diaaggregation   from the manufacturing       level was not

puraued here, some important differences have been noted in particular for

durable as compared      to nondurable goods by Bils [1987a] and Domowitz             et al

[1987] .   Applying   the rich structural      model of this study to more

disaggregated data will ho a useful future extension.
