Long Run Impacts of Childhood Access to the Safety Net

                                            ABSTRACT

A growing economics literature establishes a causal link between in utero shocks and health and human
capital in adulthood. Most studies rely on extreme negative shocks such as famine and pandemics.
We are the first to examine the impact of a positive and policy-driven change in economic resources
available in utero and during childhood. In particular, we focus on the introduction of a key element
of the U.S. safety net, the Food Stamp Program, which was rolled out across counties in the U.S. between
1961 and 1975. We use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to assemble unique data linking family
background and county of residence in early childhood to adult health and economic outcomes. The
identification comes from variation across counties and over birth cohorts in exposure to the food stamp
program. Our findings indicate that the food stamp program has effects decades after initial exposure.
Specifically, access to food stamps in childhood leads to a significant reduction in the incidence of
“metabolic syndrome” (obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes) and, for women, an increase in
economic self-sufficiency. Overall, our results suggest substantial internal and external benefits of
the safety net that have not previously been quantified.

1. Introduction

        There is substantial evidence on the strong intergenerational correlations in health and

income. As documented by Case, Lubotsky, and Paxson (2002), health and economic disparities

unfold early in life. There is less evidence, however, on causal mechanisms behind this gap. The

“early origins” literature offers some guidance toward the causal relationships underlying

intergenerational correlations. However, whether public policy may be able to benefit by

accessing these “early origins” linkages remains to be been established.

        In this paper, we evaluate whether increasing resources available in utero and during

childhood improves later-life health and economic outcomes. In particular, we focus on the

introduction of a key element of the U.S. safety net, the Food Stamp Program (FSP). The FSP

was rolled out at a county by county basis between 1962 and 1975, providing low-income

families vouchers that could be used at grocery stores to purchase food. Economic theory and

prior empirical evidence suggest that these vouchers were treated the same as cash income

(Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2009). Thus, we can utilize the FSP rollout as an identification

strategy for increases in resource availability early in life. Our analysis builds on previous

research finding a positive “first stage” effect of FSP rollout on contemporaneous health, as

measured in natality data by birth weight (Almond, Hoynes, and Schanzenbach 2011, Currie and

Moretti 2008). The program rollout design links the paper to a growing literature evaluating the

introduction of other Great Society programs.1

        Our analysis also makes an important contribution to the economics literature that relates

resources in utero and during childhood to economic and health outcomes in adulthood.
1
 Other rollout studies examine Head Start (Ludwig and Miller 2007), Medicare (Almond, Chay and Greenstone,
2007, Finkelstein and McKnight 2008), WIC (Hoynes et al 2012), family planning programs (Bailey 2012), Title I
(Cascio et al. 2010), and community health centers (Bailey and Goodman-Bacon 2012).



                                                      1
Previous design-based observational studies have generally looked at extreme, negative events

including famines, natural disaster, or disease outbreaks (see Currie 2009, Almond and Currie

2011a, b for recent reviews). A point of departure in our analysis is to evaluate the impact of a

positive and policy-driven event; one that is manifested by an increase in family resources

available in utero and during childhood. This income variation may be relevant for a larger

population than those touched by extreme events. Nevertheless, it is a relatively open question

whether a moderate increase in resources exerts corresponding long-term effects, or whether

these linkages are restricted to extreme events.

        The Food Stamp program, recently renamed Supplemental Assistance for Needy Families

or SNAP, is the fundamental safety net in the U.S. Importantly, it is the only public assistance

program that is available to all income eligible families (other programs limit eligibility to

particular groups such as female headed households, children, the disabled or the elderly). It is

currently the largest U.S. cash or near cash means tested transfer program with spending in 2011

of 70 billion dollars compared to 31 billion for TANF and 59 billion for the federal EITC.2 The

importance of the FSP program is particularly apparent in the current Great Recession, where

almost 1 in 7 persons received benefits and lifted more than 5 million families out of poverty3.

Interestingly, in contrast to the rest of the U.S. safety net, the FSP is a federal program and

exhibits little variation across states (Currie 2003). It also has remained largely intact in the

presence of dramatic reforms to other parts of the safety net (Bitler and Hoynes 2010). This lack
2
  Food stamp participation has increased to historic highs during the Great Recession. In 2007, food stamps, at 31
billion, compared to 48 billion for the EITC and 27 billion for TANF. Program costs are found at U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services (2012), Internal Revenue Service (2012), and U.S. Department of Agriculture
(2012).

  The food stamp participation data refer to 2011 (USDA 2012). The poverty data are based on the supplemental
poverty measure (Short 2011) and are for 2010. The anti-poverty effects of the FSP were eclipsed only by the
Earned Income Tax Credit, which lifted more than 6 million families out of poverty.




                                                        2
of variation across states and over time presents significant challenges for evaluating the impacts

of the FSP (Currie 2003).

          Our main results are for a sample of adults born between 1956 and 1981 who grew up in

disadvantaged families (their parent had less than a high school education). We refer to this as

the “high impact sample.” We employ a difference-in-difference model where the treatment

varies by county of birth and birth cohort, and we include controls for county and year of birth

and interview fixed effects, state linear time trends, and county-year of birth controls. We also

estimate a triple difference model that extends beyond the low education sample and uses

variation across subgroups with varying propensities of being affected by food stamps (Hoynes

and Schanzenbach 2009). Our main treatment variable is the share of time between conception

and age 5 that a food stamp program was available in the individual’s county of birth. We

estimate impacts on weight, height, general health status, disability, the incidence of many

conditions and diseases (e.g. high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, etc.), health behaviors

(smoking, drinking), as well as education, earnings, income, and program participation. Because

of the many outcome variables, we follow Kling, Liebman and Katz (2007) and Anderson (2008)

estimate summary standardized indices that aggregate information over multiple treatments.

          We find that access to the FSP in utero and in early childhood leads to a large and

statistically significant reduction in the incidence of “metabolic syndrome” (obesity, high blood

pressure, heart disease, diabetes) as well as an increase in reporting to be in good health. We also

find for women, but not men, that access to food stamps in early childhood leads to an increase

in economic self-sufficiency. Our results are robust to adding a rich set of county controls

(possible confounders) and event study models further support the validity of the research

design.


                                                  3
       Our results not only make a contribution by establishing a link between expanding

resources in childhood and long run health outcomes, but we also can speak to the “program

evaluation” of FSP. Presumably, the FSP passes a cost-benefit criterion based on the

contemporaneous or “real time” benefits (nutrition, anti-poverty). Given that empirical evidence

on “early origins” is relatively recent, the long-term benefits of such longstanding programs were

neither considered nor expected. An additional contribution of our work is, therefore, to explore

the possibility of internal and external benefits of the safety net that have not previously been

quantified. This raises the possibility that policies targeting early childhood may be sub-

optimally small. In other words, the FSP generates larger private and social benefits when taking

into account the “multiplier effect” on later-life outcomes.

       The remainder of our paper is as follows. In Section 2 we summarize the economic

literature on long term effects of early life interventions. In Section 3 we summarize the

biological science literature in order to provide guidance for which health impacts are expected

to be impacted by the FSP treatment. In Section 4 we provide the background on the FSP and in

Section 5 we describe our data. In Section 6 we present our empirical model and Section 7 our

results. We conclude in Section 8.



2. Background and Prior Research

       That in utero and early childhood events can have important vestigial effects has been

documented for a wide range of later-life outcomes, including health status, test scores,

education attainment, wages, and mortality. Observational studies have leveraged short, extreme

events experienced in utero as identification strategies (see reviews by Currie 2009 and Almond

and Currie 2011a,b). Examples include famine (Painter et al. 2005, Susser and Lin 1992),


                                                 4
disease (Almond 2006, Barreca 2010), and radiation (Almond et al. 2009). A natural question is

how generalizable such linkages are, and in particular whether more routine childhood

experiences may also shape health and economic outcomes during adulthood. To date, there has

been relatively little research that combines the strength of design-based identification strategies

for causal inference with more commonplace treatments/exposures. Those that are amenable to

policy are rarer still.

        The shortage of previous work stems from the challenge of marrying identification

strategies for program evaluation to: a) policies that affect children at a young age and b) policies

that can be mapped to data on later-life outcomes in adulthood. Thus, whether “early origins”

are more of an empirical curiosity or a general policy avenue remains largely unknown.

        A relatively large literature considers the effect of income on health. Much of this

literature is concerned with the short-term effects of income changes experienced in adulthood,

and there are few studies that considering the long-term effect of early-life income changes. Van

Den Berg, Lindeboom and Portrait (2006) compare Dutch mortality rates among those born

during economic downturns to those born during expansions. Those born during expansions

lived substantially longer, which they argue is not due to changes in cohort composition or other

potential confounders. Banerjee et al. (2010) consider the a 19th century blight of French

vineyards that created a region by birth cohort varying shock to production and hence income.

They find this led to shorter heights in adulthood but no impact on mortality.

        A second strand of research has considered the long-term effect of specific, well-

identified programs. Among these studies, the closest is Ludwig and Miller (2007), who

consider the long-term effect of Head Start program. Their approach uses application assistance

provided to poor counties as an instrument for Head Start Program operation, and finds the


                                                 5
program reduced childhood mortality rates in affected counties. Furthermore, Ludwig and Miller

find that educational attainment is also higher due to Head Start exposure. Chetty et al. (2011)

and Dynarski, Hyman and Schanzenbach (2011) find persistent effects of class-size reductions

on educational attainment and initial labor market outcomes. Reyes (2007) and Nilsson (2009)

consider the effect of early childhood lead exposure on later life outcomes, and Glied and Neidell

(2010) evaluate the long-term impacts of water fluoridation.4 Chay, Guryan, and Mazumder

(2012) consider the long-term human capital effect of early childhood health, as proxied by local

post-neonatal mortality rates. They find that improved health for young black children during

the late 1960s and early 1970s yielded substantially increased NAEP and AFQT test scores

during the 1980s. Building on Almond, Chay, Greenstone (2007), they argue that improved

access to hospitals following the Civil Rights Act and Medicare-induced desegregation of

hospitals drove the reduction in post-neonatal mortality rates for blacks that subsequently yielded

higher test scores. Likewise, more specific medical interventions in the early postnatal period

have been found to exert long-term effects, including surfactant and related treatments for very

low birth weight infants (Bharadwaj, Loken, and Nielson, 2012) and breastfeeding-

encouragement by hospital nurses following delivery (Fritzsimmons and Vera-Hernandez 2012).



3. Impacts of Early Nutrition and Expected Effects of the FSP

        Causal mechanisms by which early childhood events affect later-life are best understood

for nutrition. This section reviews specific mechanisms by which early malnutrition can impair

development with long-term consequences.
4
  Duncan, Ziol-Guest, and Kalil (2010) use the PSID to examine the impact of income during childhood on later life
economic and health outcomes. Importantly, they explore how income during different stages of childhood (early
life, later childhood, etc) affects outcomes and they explore income’s nonlinear impacts. This is an observational
design, however, and it is unclear whether they have recovered causal income channels.


                                                        6
       Although FSP was clearly a nutrition program, because most recipients received a Food

Stamp Benefit below their normal food expenditures, the program is better understood as an

income transfer (Hoynes and Schanzenbach, 2009). However, because recipients were by

definition poor, a large portion of their FSP benefit was spent on food. Further, at the time FSP

was introduced, hunger and nutritional deficiencies were not uncommon among Americans. For

example, a survey of low income families in Texas, Louisiana, Kentucky, and West Virginia in

1968-1970 found that 15 percent of whites and 37 percent of blacks had low hemoglobin levels

as well as relatively high rates of deficiencies in vitamin C, riboflavin and protein (Eisinger

1998). The 1968 CBS documentary “Hunger in America” raised national awareness of the

problem and possibly influenced the policy debate on the FSP (Berry 1984). Here, by briefly

summarizing the linkages between early life nutrition and later life outcomes, we provide

predictions about outcomes that may be altered by our FSP treatment.

       Some linkages between early life nutrition and later life outcomes are fairly intuitive. For

example, severely undernourished children may suffer from anemia and listlessness. This may

reduce their ability to invest in learning during childhood and may harm their long-run earnings

and other outcomes. Poor early life nutrition may also directly harm long-run outcomes through

altering the body’s developmental trajectory. There is an emerging scientific consensus that

describes critical periods of development during early life that “program” the body’s long-term

survival outcomes (Barker, 1992; Gluckman and Hanson 2004). During development, the fetus

(and post-natally the child) may take cues from the current environment to predict the type of

environment it is expected to face in the long run and in some cases adapts its formation to better

thrive in the expected environment (Gluckman and Hanson 2004). A problem arises, however,

when the predicted later environment and the actual later environment are substantially different.


                                                 7
For example, if nutrients are scarce during the pre- (or early post-natal) period, the developing

body therefore predicts that the future will also be nutritionally deprived. The body may then

invoke (difficult-to-reverse) biological mechanisms to adapt to the predicted future environment.

For example, the metabolic system may adapt in a manner that will allow the individual to

survive in an environment with chronic food shortages. This pattern is termed the “thrifty

phenotype” and is sometimes referred to as the Barker hypothesis. The “problem” arises if in fact

there is not a long-run food shortage, and nutrition is plentiful. In that case, the early-life

metabolic adaptations are a bad match to the actual environment and will increase the likelihood

that the individual develops a “metabolic disorder,” which is the clustered association between

high blood pressure (hypertension), type II diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. The

negative consequences do not usually appear until after reproductive age, which is preferable to

the species from an evolutionary perspective (Barker 1992). Note that both pre- and post-natal

nutrition can drive this programming.

        Lasting impacts of nutrient deprivation in both the pre- and post-natal period have been

found on both long-term health and economic outcomes. Much of the experimental work on

nutritional programming has been conducted on rats. In McCance (1962), the researchers

experimentally manipulated how much breast milk was available to baby rats during their normal

21-day suckling period. At the end of the experiment, the treatment group (who were fed less

than normal) were smaller than the control group (who were fed normally). Subsequently, both

groups were fed normally, and the treatment group quickly caught up to normal size. In the

longer-run, however, they found that the (former) treatment rats became more obese than the

control group even though they were fed the same, normal amount. This set off a number of

follow-up studies. In one, the researchers found that if they manipulated the food intake for a


                                                   8
different (later) 21-day period, there were no long-run effects. This suggests there is a “critical

period” in the early post-natal period during which programming continues to occur.5

        Some of the strongest research on humans comes from studies of the Dutch Hunger

Winter. In World War II, the Nazis imposed strict rationing of food during their occupation of

the Netherlands over the 7 month period between November 1944 and April 1945. As a result,

the previously well-nourished society experienced an abrupt, severe restriction in available

calories. Average caloric intake fell almost overnight from about 1800 calories per day to

between 400 and 800. Upon liberation, the food supply returned to normal levels almost

instantaneously. Because of the abrupt and severe nature of the period of malnutrition, it is

possible to isolate the impact of malnutrition that occurred at different points during

development. Painter et al. (2005) find that children had lower birth weight if exposed to famine

in the third trimester.6 Further, when the cohort that was exposed to malnutrition in utero hit

middle age, they were more likely to be obese, and had higher incidence of heart disease, lower

self-reported health status, and worse mental health (Painter et al. 2005, Susser and Lin 1992).

        Almond and Mazumder (2011) consider the effect of nutrition timing during pregnancy

on later-life outcomes, focusing on the Ramadan fast as an identification strategy. They find that

children born with in utero exposure to the Ramadan fast experienced large increases in

disability in adulthood. Because fasting during Ramadan is confined to daylight hours, the

nutritional treatment is relatively mild compared to famine episodes. “Net nutrition” can also be

compromised by infectious disease (Bozzoli, Deaton, and Quintana-Domeque 2009), which can

increase energy expenditure and reduce consumption and absorption of nutrients. Thus, previous
5
  Findings from animal models may need to be interpreted with additional caution if the timing of birth occurs at
different stages of development.
6
  In a parallel manner, our earlier work (Almond, Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2011) finds that children have higher
birth weight if exposed to food stamps in the third trimester.


                                                        9
well-identified findings on the long-term effect of the postnatal health environment (esp. Chay,

Guryan, and Mazumder 2012) may also include nutrition as a portion of the underlying

mechanism.

         To summarize, the literature has found that lack of nutrition in early life leads to higher

incidence of metabolic syndrome. These impacts have occurred both when the nutritional shock

occurred in utero and when it occurred in the period shortly after birth. Importantly, the long-run

health outcomes have been found even in cases in which birth weight itself was not affected.

Thus the impacts of in utero shocks do not necessarily directly map into birth weight and

evaluating the long term impacts requires the analysis of a many-decade past change, such as we

do in this paper.

       In our setting, we examine a policy-driven increase in resources to a population that had

previously experienced chronic low levels of nutrition. Therefore, we expect that individuals

who were exposed to the FSP program in early life will be less likely to have mis-adapted to the

future environment. As a result, we expect to find that these cohorts experience lower incidence

of metabolic syndrome – as measured by high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes – in adult

life. We also expect to find better human capital outcomes, as measured by education, earnings,

income and the like. Because the literature is unclear about the exact timing of post-natal

damage, we will explore alternative specifications for the timing of FSP exposure.



4. Introduction of the Food Stamp Program

       Today, food stamp benefits are the fundamental safety net in the U.S., being the only

public assistance program that is available to all family types (most programs are targeted on

female headed households, children, or the elderly). Eligibility requires satisfying income and


                                                 10
asset tests and benefits can be used to purchase most grocery store food goods. A family’s

benefit is equal to the difference between the federally defined maximum benefit level for a

given family size and the amount that the family is deemed to be able to afford to pay for food on

its own according to the benefits formula (essentially 30 percent of cash income, less some

deductions).

        The roots of today’s Food Stamp Program began with President Kennedy's 1961

announcement of a pilot food stamp program that was to be established in eight impoverished

counties. The pilot programs were later expanded to 43 counties in 1962 and 1963. The success

of these pilot programs led to the Food Stamp Act of 1964, which gave local areas the authority

to start up the FSP in their county. As with the current FSP, the program was federally funded

and benefits were redeemable at approved retail food stores. In the period following the passage

of the Food Stamp Act, there was a steady stream of counties initiating Food Stamp Programs

and Federal spending on the FSP more than doubled between 1967 and 1969 (from $115 million

to $250 million). Support for a national FSP grew due to a public spotlight on hunger (Berry

1984). This interest culminated in passage of 1973 Amendments to the Food Stamp Act, which

mandated that all counties offer FSP by 1975.

        Figure 1 plots the percent of counties with a FSP from 1960 to 1975.7 During the pilot

phase (1961-1964), FSP coverage increased slowly. Beginning in 1964, program growth

accelerated; coverage expanded at a steady pace until all counties were covered in 1974.

Furthermore, there was substantial heterogeneity in timing of adoption of the FSP, both within

and across states. The map in Figure 2 shades counties according to date of FSP adoption

 Counties are weighted by their 1970 population. Note this is not the food stamp caseload, but represents the
percent of the U.S. population that lived in a county with a FSP.

(darker shading denotes a later start up date). Our basic identification strategy considers the

month of FSP adoption for each county to trigger the beginning of the FSP “treatment.”

         For our identification strategy to yield causal estimates of the program, it is important to

establish that the timing of FSP adoption appears to be exogenous. Prior to the FSP, some

counties provided food aid through the commodity distribution program (CDP)—which took

surplus food purchased by the Federal government as part of an agricultural price support policy

and distributed those goods to the poor. The 1964 Food Stamp Act allowed for counties to

voluntarily set up a FSP, but the Act also stated that no county could run both the FSP and the

CDP. Thus, for counties which previously ran a CDP, adoption of the FSP implies termination

of the CDP.8 The political accounts of the time suggest that debates about adopting the FSP

pitted powerful agricultural interests (who favored the CDP) against advocates for the poor (who

favored the FSP, see MacDonald 1977; Berry 1984). In particular, counties with strong support

for farming interests (e.g., southern or rural counties) may be late adopters of the FSP. On the

other hand, counties with strong support for the low income population (e.g., northern, urban

counties with large poor populations) may adopt FSP earlier in the period. This systematic

variation in food stamp adoption could lead to spurious estimates of the program impact if those

same county characteristics are associated with differential trends in the outcome variables.

         In earlier work (Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2009), we documented that larger counties

with a greater fraction of the population that was urban, black, or low income indeed
8
  This transition in nutritional assistance would tend to bias downward FSP impact estimates, but we do not think
this bias is substantial because of the limited scope of the CDP. The CDP was not available in all counties and
recipients often had to travel long distances to pick up the items. Further, the commodities were distributed
infrequently and inconsistently, and provided a very narrow set of commodities—the most frequently available were
flour, cornmeal, rice, dried milk, peanut butter and rolled wheat (Citizens’ Board of Inquiry 1968). In contrast, Food
Stamp benefits can be used to purchase a wide range of grocery food items.

implemented the FSP earlier (i.e. consistent with the historical accounts).9 Nevertheless, we

found that the county characteristics explain very little of the variation in adoption dates. This is

consistent with the characterization of funding limits controlling the movement of counties off

the waiting list to start up their FSP (Berry 1984). We view the weakness of this model fit as a

strength when it comes to our identification approach in that much of the variation in the

implementation of FSP appears to be idiosyncratic. Nonetheless, in order to control for possible

differences in trends across counties that are spuriously correlated with the county treatment

effect, all of our regressions include interactions of these 1960 pre-treatment county

characteristics with time trends as in Acemoglu et al. (2004) and Hoynes and Schanzenbach

(2009).



5. Data

           Given the county rollout of the FSP, our analysis requires data with information on adult

health and economic outcomes as well as county of birth for cohorts that were impacted by the

FSP introduction (1963-1975) at birth or during early childhood. We use the Panel Study of

Income Dynamics (PSID) which began in 1968 with a sample of approximately 5,000

households, and subsequently followed and interviewed all members and descendants. The

original sample comprises two subsamples: a nationally representative sample of 3,000

households and the “Survey of Economic Opportunity subsample” including 1,900 low-income

and minority households selected from an existing sample. To adjust for this nonrandom

composition, we conduct all analysis using the PSID weights.
9
    For more detail, see Table 1 in Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2009).




                                                         13
         Since the beginning of the survey, the PSID has collected detailed information on

economic and demographic outcomes. We use those data to generate adult economic outcomes

such as educational attainment, employment, earnings, family income, and poverty. Starting in

the 1980s and 1990s, the PSID also began regularly collecting information on health outcomes.

We use self-reported general health status (reported on a 5 point scale: excellent, very good, etc.)

and disability (physical or nervous condition that limits the type or amount of work), both of

which have been asked of heads and wives each year beginning in 1984. In addition, the PSID

reports height and weight (hence we can construct obesity10 and height stunting11), and

information on whether a doctor has diagnosed the respondent with specific health conditions

such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart attack and heart disease.12 These data are also

collected for all heads and wives and have been available since 1999, when the survey became

biennial. These data allow us to test for the prediction that the introduction of food stamps in

early life leads to a reduction in the incidence of metabolic syndrome. In addition, we use

information on health behaviors (smoking and drinking) and health care utilization

(hospitalization).

         We use a restricted version of the PSID allowing for identification of county of residence

for each year of the survey (the public-use version of the data identifies state). Because of the

longitudinal and dynastic nature of the data, for each individual, we can assign their county of

residence at birth or, for those born prior to the beginning of PSID data collection, their county
10
   Obesity is defined as having a body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 30
and above.
11
   Height stunting is measured as being below the 5th percentile in the nationally normed height distribution (Lewit
and Kerrebrock 1997). We use a gender-specific height distribution for those aged 30-50 in 2003-2006 reported in
McDowell et al. (2008).
12
   Other health conditions measured in the PSID include stroke, arthritis, asthma, cancer, psychiatric problems, lung
disease, and mental ability.




                                                         14
of residence in 1968 when their family is first observed in the data. We merge the PSID data to

FSP program information based on this county of birth. The key variable for our analysis is

constructed from the month and year that each county introduced the FSP, which we collected

from USDA annual reports on county FSP caseloads (USDA, various years). With this, and

using the month and year of birth (measured for each person in the survey), we construct

measures of childhood exposure to the FSP. In our main specification, we use the share of time

between conception and age 5 that FSP is available in county of birth.13

        Our sample includes individuals born between the years 1956 and 1981. Importantly,

this yields cohorts that span the entire food stamp rollout period (as well as several cohorts both

pre- and post-rollout) to identify the impact on adult outcomes. In addition, we only include

individuals whose family is observed at the individual’s birth or in early life.14 This is necessary

to identify the individual’s county of birth.15 We also use information on the family background

of the individual in early life (whether the child was born into a family is headed by a single

woman, education of head, and family income) as control variables and to identify groups more

and less likely to be impacted by the FSP. We limit the sample to persons age 18 and above for

the health outcomes and age 25 and over for the economic outcomes (to facilitate completed

education). The sample includes one observation for each interview year that the individual

satisfies these age restrictions, and is a head or wife (recall that the health measures are only

asked if a head or wife). We use the PSID data through interview year 2009. Thus given our birth

cohorts (1956-1981) the oldest individuals in our sample are 53 at the end of the period. We
13
   We assume a 9-month gestation, so month of conception is 9 months prior to birth month.
14
   In effect, this limits the sample to persons born into original 1968 PSID families.
15
   Because of the possibility of nonrandom migration, we calculate childhood exposure to the FSP using county of
birth, rather than the time varying county of residence.




                                                        15
focus on a “high impact” sample, the sample of adults who grew up in disadvantaged families

(their parent had less than a high school education).

         We augment the PSID data with additional county variables to control for possible

county confounders. First, we use county-level variables from the 1960 Census of Population

and Census of Agriculture including: the percent of the 1960 county population that lives in an

urban area, is black, is younger than 5, is older than 65, has income less than $3000 (in 1959

dollars), the percent of land in the county used for farming, and log county population. Second,

we measure for each county and year the number of hospital beds and hospitals per capita (from

the American Hospital Association16), real (non-FSP) government transfers per capita (from the

REIS17), and whether or not the county has a community health center18. We use the AHA and

REIS data and construct averages for the first five years of life (using county and year of birth).

We use the community health center data to measure the share of months between conception

and age 5 that there was a community health center present.

         Table 1 presents descriptive statistics on our estimation sample. About 69 percent of the

full sample and 60 percent of the high impact (parent low education) sample report to be in

excellent or very good health. About 10 percent report a work disability and less than 5 percent
16
   The AHA data provides annual data that allows for us to measure county variables for the first five years of life
for all birth cohorts (the “Hospitals: Guide Issue” publication goes back to 1948). We collapse the hospital level data
to county-year and then convert to per capita measures using historical county population data. We then prepare a
simple average over the first five years of life. We thank Amy Finkelstein and Martin Gaynor for the pre-1976 data,
Jean Roth of the NBER for the 1976 and on data, and Martha Bailey and Andrew Goodman-Bacon for providing
code to clean the data.
17
   The REIS data is available for 1959 and 1962 and then annually beginning in 1965. We construct three measures
for real per capita transfers that can be consistently measured throughout this period: cash public assistance benefits
(Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Supplemental Security Income and General Assistance), medical
spending (Medicare and military health care), and cash retirement and disability payments (OASI, DI, other). We
interpolate to fill in the gaps (1960, 1961, 1963, 1964). Analyses with these controls must drop birth cohorts before
1960 due to missing data.
18
   The information on community health centers provide the year that the first center established in a county, which
occurred between 1965 and 1974 (Bailey and Goodman-Bacon 2011). We thank Martha Bailey and Andrew
Goodman-Bacon for sharing this data.

are diabetic. 12 (17) percent of the full sample (low education subsample) has high blood

pressure and 23 percent (31 percent) are obese.



6. Empirical Model

        Our basic specification is a difference-in-differences model, where we compare adult

outcomes for those with early childhood exposure to FSP in their county of birth to those born

earlier (and therefore without childhood FSP exposure). We estimate:

                yicb     FSPcb  Xicb  c  b   t s *b  CB60c *b  icb            (1)

where i indexes the individual, c the county of birth, b the birth year, s the state of birth, and t the

survey year. FSP is a measure of food stamp availability in early life. In our base case models we

measure the share of months between conception and age 5 that food stamps is available in the

adult’s birth county.

        Because counties adopted FSP at different times, we compare those with or without FSP

access in early childhood by virtue of their county and date of birth. Thus, we can allow for

unrestricted cohort effects at the national level λb , unrestricted county effects ηc, unrestricted

interview year effects γt and state specific linear year of birth trends θs*b. The parameter of

interest is δ, the effect of exposure to FSP, which is identified from variation across counties and

birth cohorts. We also control for individual-level covariates Xicb (including gender, marital

status, race, and a quadratic in age) and family background (whether you were born into a female

headed household, the education attainment of the head of household, and the family’s income to




                                                   17
needs ratio19). All models are estimated using the PSID sample weights and we cluster standard

errors by county of birth.

         Because of the many outcome variables, we follow Kling, Liebman and Katz (2007) and

Anderson (2008) and estimate summary standardized indices that aggregate information over

multiple treatments. In particular, we form two indices: metabolic syndrome and economic self-

sufficiency. As discussed by Kling et al. (2007) aggregating multiple measures in a given area

(e.g. metabolic syndrome) improves statistical power. The summary index is the simple average

across standardized z-score measures of each component. The z-score is calculated by

subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.20 In the case of metabolic

syndrome, all components are “bads” (obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, heart

attack) and so an increase in metabolic syndrome index indicates a worse outcome. For

economic self-sufficiency, we convert each component of the index so that a higher score is a

better outcome (e.g. convert “poor” to “not poor”). Economic self-sufficiency includes seven

measures: high school graduate, employed, not poor, not on TANF, not on food stamps,

earnings, and family income.21

         The validity of our design depends on the exogeneity of the introduction of the FSP

across counties. We address this in two ways. First, following Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2009)

we control for trends in the observable determinants of FSP adoption by including interactions

between characteristics of the county of birth and linear trends in year of birth (CB60c*b).
19
   These family background measures are averages over the first five years of life, or in the case of the cohorts born
prior to the beginning of the PSID, the first five years of sample.
20
   Kling et al (2007) analyze a randomized experiment and use the control group mean and standard deviation in
calculating the z-score. In our quasi-experimental design, we mimic this approach by using the mean and standard
deviation of the cohorts born before food stamp rollout began (cohorts born before 1961).
21
   The top-coding of earnings and income changes over the course of the survey. We trim the sample and drop those
(relative few observations) with earnings or income in excess of $300,000.




                                                          18
Further, this period of FSP introduction took place during a period of tremendous expansion in

cash and noncash transfer programs as part of the War on Poverty and Great Society. To explore

these possible confounders, we directly control for several characteristics of county of birth

(community health centers, hospitals and hospital beds per capita, and non-FSP government

transfers per capita), measured as averages over the first five years of life.

       The basic identification strategy underpinning equation (1) is different from previous

design-based studies in the fetal origins literature and other papers in the “rollout” literature.

Typically, natural experiments induced by famines, disease outbreaks, etc., are episodic: they

turn on and then turn off. In contrast, once the FSP starts operating in a given county, it keeps

operating and does not “turn off”. An analysis of short-term impacts of the policy, such as

maternal exposure and impacts on birth weight (as in Almond, Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2011)

leads to a 0/1 treatment variable for “FSP introduction”. However, in the current setting, we have

a much longer period of potential exposure (through childhood). This restricts the set of cohort

comparisons that can be made. For example, we will never observe a birth cohort exposed in

early childhood (e.g., up to age five), but without exposure in later childhood (after age 5).

Instead, comparisons are “from above”: we observe cohorts with the addition of exposure prior

to age five, but this comes on top of exposure at older ages. So, comparisons are inherently

about additional FSP exposure earlier in childhood, conditional on “already” having it later in

childhood. To illustrate the variation we have, Figure 3 shows average FSP exposure by birth

cohort for three measures of food stamp availability: in utero, share of months between birth and

age 5, and share of months between 6 and age 18.




                                                  19
7. Results

High Impact Sample

        We begin with our “high impact” sample, adults born between 1956 and 1981 that grew

up in disadvantaged families (their parent had less than a high school education). Table 2

presents estimates for metabolic syndrome for the high impact sample. We define FSP exposure

as the share of months between conception and age 5 that the FSP was available in the

individual’s county of birth (“FS share IU-5” in the table). The “metabolic syndrome index” is

the equal weighted average of the z-score of five dichotomous variables: obese, diabetic, high

blood pressure, heart disease and heart attack. This, and all subsequent specifications, include

individual demographics, family background controls, and fixed effects for year of birth, year of

interview, county, state linear trends (in cohort), and 1960 county characteristics linear trends (in

cohort). The effect of access to food stamps in childhood on metabolic syndrome, as shown in

column 1, is -0.294 and is statistically significant at the 1 percent level. The magnitude of the

coefficient implies that increasing the share from 0 to 1 (from no exposure to full exposure in

utero to age 5) reduces metabolic syndrome by 0.3 standard deviations.

        The remaining columns of Table 2 show the regressions for the individual components of

metabolic syndrome index. While individually only obesity reaches statistical significance, each

of the point estimates indicate an improvement in adult health with the food stamp treatment in

childhood.

        The estimates in Table 2 are intent-to-treat estimates, averaging across persons with

higher and lower likelihoods of being affected by food stamps.22 Of course, the food stamp
22
  This is a reduced form model, rather than an instrumental variables approach with the FSP rollout instrumenting
for the household’s FSP participation. We do not estimate the IV because participation is measured only beginning
in 1968, the first year of the PSID survey.



                                                        20
participation rate is not 100 percent, even in this high impact sample. We estimate that for

families where heads have less than a high school degree, about a quarter participate in food

stamps at some point in their child’s life. Thus to convert these estimates to the treatment on the

treated, one should divide the treatment effects by 0.24.23

         Table 3 presents estimates for other health outcomes for the high impact sample. Column

1 presents results for being in “good health” defined as one if the individual reports being in

excellent or very good health (as opposed to good, fair or poor health). The coefficient is 0.11

which implies that going to full exposure between conception and age 5 leads to an 11

percentage point increase compared to a mean of 59 percent, though this is not statistically

significant. Column 2 presents estimates for a work limiting disability and while the coefficient

is negative (e.g. an improvement as expected) it is very small and statistically insignificant.24

The third column indicates that access to the food stamp program leads to a reduction in the risk

of stunting (below the 5th percentile of the nationally-normed distribution of height).25 The final

two columns of the table present results for health behaviors—dichotomous variables for

whether the person ever smoked and whether they drink (at all). Both suggest an improvement

but neither is statistically significant.

         We go on to analyze the economic outcomes for the high impact sample in Table 4. The

first column presents estimates for the “economic self-sufficiency index.” This is an equal
23
   It is the participation rate of the sample individuals at birth and in early life that is relevant, rather than their
contemporaneous (adult) participation rate. To calculate the 0.24 FSP participation rate, we calculate the share of
families with children who ever report receiving food stamps (in the period when they have children in the
household). We limit the sample to 1978 and later, after the FSP has been rolled out in all counties.
24
   Note that the sample size for health status and disability are substantially larger than those in Table 2 because
these questions have been included in the survey since 1984.
25
   Table 3 shows that the mean of the stunting measure is below 0.05 which is consistent with the results in XX
finding that the height measures in the PSID are somewhat higher other health surveys. The qualitative results are
the same if we define stunting as below the 10th percentile.




                                                            21
weighted average of seven items where, for each, the variables are converted (if needed) such

that an increase in the outcome represents a better outcome. The components are: educational

attainment is high school or higher, not poor, not on food stamps, not on TANF, employed,

earnings and the log of family income. 26 The coefficient on the food stamp treatment is 0.182,

implying that full FSP access to age 5 leads to a 0.2 standard deviation improvement in

economic self-sufficiency (p-value is 0.14). The remainder of the columns provides the estimates

for the individual components of the economic self-sufficiency index. All coefficients with the

exception of employment status suggest that exposure to food stamps leads to an improvement in

economic well-being: increases in education, earnings, and income and a reduction in poverty

and participation in public assistance programs. However, only the coefficient on educational

attainment reaches statistical significance.

         Interestingly, the interpretation of the coefficient on adult food stamp receipt (column 4

of Table 4) is potentially more complicated than the biological theories discussed above.

Observational data shows a relatively strong degree of intergenerational transmission of “welfare

use” (Bane and Ellwood 1994). Obtaining causal estimates for intergeneration transmission is

difficult, however, given the strong persistence in other factors associated with economic

success. In any case, the intergeneration transmission story would imply a positive effect of

exposure to food stamps in early life on adult participation in the program. While the results here

are not conclusive given the lack of precision in the estimate, the point estimate (positive on not

participating in food stamps) suggests that on net the biological story dominates.
26
  Note that in Table 4, the mean of the self-sufficiency index is not zero. As described above, we use the full sample
of individuals born before 1962 to create the z-scores of each component. The mean here is lower due to our “high
impact” subsample (which is lower SES) and due to our sample being younger (and thus lower earnings etc) than the
pre-1962 sample.




                                                         22
         In Table 5 we present the main results in the high impact sample by gender of the adult.27

We find quite striking evidence that the effects for economic self-sufficiency is large and

statistically significant for women, compared to the smaller and insignificant results for men.

This is consistent with the several studies that find larger impacts of post-natal, early life

interventions among girls (Anderson 2008, Bleakley 2007, Dahl and Lochner 2012, Field et al.

2009, Kling et al. 2007, Maccini and Yang 2009, Milligan and Stabile 2011). The estimates for

the effect of food stamps on metabolic syndrome are significant for both groups, but larger for

men than for women. The larger effects for men are consistent with the biological evidence that

males are more subject to harm in utero than females (Almond and Currie 2011a).28

Interestingly, the gender differences in self-reported health status show a different pattern, with

significant positive effects concentrated among women. In interpreting these gender differences,

it is important to point out that there is no evidence of pre-natal exposure to food stamps on live

births or infant mortality overall or by gender (Almond, Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2011); such

an effect, if present, suggests selective mortality which would cloud the interpretation of these

results.29

         Identification in the model comes from variation in food stamp rollout across counties

and birth cohorts. Importantly, the food stamp program was expanded in the midst of the Great

Society, a time when many health and human capital programs were expanding across the U.S.
27
   Table 5 shows that we have more women in our sample than men. This is a result of the fact that our sample
includes individuals in survey years when they are a head or spouse and is consistent with the analysis in Andreski
et al. (2009).
28
   Males tend to suffer higher mortality rates in response to adverse events than females In addition to higher
mortality, males could also exhibit larger long-term effects if males suffer a more pronounced (unobserved) health
shock than females in response to the same event (e.g. Food Stamps).
29
   Aside from biological factors, it is possible that post-natal treatment differs between girls and boys, and that this
might change with food stamp treatment. Interestingly, Lhila and Simon (2008) find that families with girls are more
likely to take up the WIC nutrition program post-natally.




                                                          23
Much of that policy variation resulted from state rather than county implementation. However, in

Table 6, we examine the sensitivity of our core health and economics outcomes, to adding

controls for county programs and resources available between ages 0 and 5. The first three

columns examine metabolic syndrome, where the first column repeats the main estimates from

Table 2, column 1. In the second column we add controls for access to health care resources

(hospitals per capita, hospital beds per capita, presence of community health centers). In the third

column we add controls for real per capita government transfers.30 We then repeat the three

specifications for the economic self-sufficiency index in columns 4 to 6. The table shows that our

results are highly robust to adding these controls.

        An additional test for the validity of the design is to estimate the model by limiting the

sample to those who are unlikely to have been impacted by the program. In Table 7, we employ

this placebo test and limit to only those individuals from families with high levels of head’s

education (more than a high school education). These results show small, imprecise and

generally wrong-signed impacts for both health and economic outcomes. This adds support to

our approach.

        The results so far show that in the high impact sample, we find that childhood exposure

to the food stamp program leads to robust and significant improvement in metabolic syndrome

(obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes) for adult men and women. We also find

that childhood exposure to the safety net improves economic outcomes for adult women, but not

for men.

Full Sample Triple Difference
30
  The number of observations declines when we add the county controls for government per capita transfers. This is
because the REIS data begins in 1959 and we therefore have to drop all observations with a year of birth 1958 or
earlier.



                                                        24
        In choosing our preferred sample for this analysis, we face a tradeoff between sample

size (using the full sample of adults) and targeting (using the smaller high impact sample). To

build on the findings for the high impact sample, here we use the full sample of adults in our

PSID sample, but use a triple-difference specification that accounts for different probabilities of

being affected by food stamps. In particular, we augment model (1) above and estimate:

 yicb     FSPcb   FSPcb Pg  X icb  c  b   t  g  s * b  CB60c *b  icb     (2)

To capture the varying risks of being treated we multiply the FSP treatment by a group level

food stamp participation rate (Bleakley 2007, Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2009). The group food

stamp participation rate Pg is defined for 12 groups using education (<12, 12, >12), race (white,

nonwhite), and marital status (married, not married) based on the family background of the adult.

We calculate the participation rate in the same fashion as discussed above (to convert intent-to-

treat to treatment-on-treated). In addition to the variables in the model (1), we add a main effect

for food stamp treatment, fixed effects for each group  g , and (although not shown in (2)),

interactions of Pg with demographics, year of birth and interview fixed effects, and 1960 county

characteristic trends. The coefficient on the main effect for food stamp treatment,  , represents

the impact for a participation rate of zero; therefore we expect this coefficient to be zero. In this

triple difference model, the maintained assumption is that there are no differential trends for high

participation versus low participation groups within early versus late implementing counties.

        Results for this specification are presented in Table 8. Note that the main treatment

variable, FS Share IU-5, is interacted with the participation rate and therefore the coefficient

represents the impact of FSP exposure on health and economic outcome for someone who takes

up the program. Thus, these are treatment-on-the-treated estimates and should be compared to

the inflated estimates in the high impact sample.


                                                    25
        The results in Table 8 show that full exposure to food stamps through age 5 leads to a 0.4

standard deviation reduction in metabolic syndrome and a 30 percentage point increase in

reporting good health. Economic self-sufficiency is improved, but not significantly. The

magnitudes are similar but somewhat smaller than the comparable results for the high impact

sample. Further, as expected the main effect on food stamp exposure (effect implied for a group

with a participation rate of 0) is very small and insignificant.

Does the Timing of Treatment Matter?

        All the results thus far measure food stamp treatment as the share of time between

conception and age 5 that food stamps is in place in your county of birth. There are two reasons

to explore alternative specifications for exposure to the food stamps rollout. First, as discussed

above, the nature of our treatment is such that the policy turns on and does not turn off.

Therefore, when a child is treated in early life (e.g. age 0-5) they are also treated in later

childhood. Our estimates, therefore, may be reflecting more exposure than previously considered

which is important for interpreting the magnitudes of the effects. Second, the biological and

economic literature is not clear on when exposure to the safety net matters. Thus exploring

alternative specifications for food stamp exposure can provide new evidence on this important

issue. For this and the remainder of the results we return to the high impact sample.

        To explore the timing of food stamp exposure more systematically, and to evaluate the

validity of the research design, we also estimate an event study model. In particular, these

estimates allow us to explore non-parametrically the relationship between age at initial rollout

and adult outcomes. In addition, we can use these results to rule out the presence of pre- (or

post-) trends that could lead to spurious findings. Specifically, we allow for the impact of FSP

program to vary with the age at FSP introduction in their county of birth. For example, a person


                                                  26
born in 1970 whose birth county implemented food stamps in 1975 would have an event time of

5. They would have event time of -5 if FSP was implemented in their birth county in 1965 (and

thus they were exposed during their entire childhood).

            We estimate a version of model (1) where the main FSP effect (FSPcb) is replaced with a

series of dummies for whether the program was first implemented 5 or more years prior to birth,

4 or 3 years prior to birth, 2 or 1 year prior to birth, at birth or at age 1, at age 2 or 3, age 4 or 5,

and so on up to age 12 or later.31 We present results for metabolic syndrome index in Figure 4.

Note that these are the reverse of a typical event study graph, in that negative “event time” is the

case where a person was fully treated (food stamps was in place in their county prior to birth).

Further, treatment (exposure to the program) increases as we move from the right (treated in later

life) to the left (treated in early life).

            While we do not have a strong prediction about the precise shape of the treatment effects,

our hypothesis is that the impact of the FSP treatment should decline as age at initial exposure

increases. Or to state the reverse, the younger the initial age of exposure the larger the

(cumulative) effect of the FSP. If exposure in later childhood does not matter, then the event

study coefficients should be flat on the right end of the graph (suggesting no “pre-trend”).

Eventually, once we hit the point in early childhood when exposure matters, a movement left

(towards earlier initial exposure) should reduce the metabolic syndrome index. Eventually, the

event study should be flat once exposure is “complete” (exposure is prior to conception or an

event time of -1 or before).

            The results in Figure 4 are highly consistent with these predictions and quite encouraging

for our research design. They show that the largest effects of the food stamp treatment (in this
31
     The omitted coefficient is for exposure at age 10-11, so all results are relative to exposure at that age.


                                                              27
case a reduction in metabolic syndrome is good and so a beneficial effect is represented by a

negative impact) are to those who are treated in utero and early childhood. The improvement in

health is steepest with additional exposure between conception and age 4 or 5. The results

suggest that the adult health impacts of the FSP are minimal if the child is exposed after age 5. It

is notable that for negative event time (fully exposed) the line is flat (and similarly that it is flat

across older ages)—this is an important result that can rule out that our estimates are identified

by cohort trends within counties.

        Table 9 explores the issue of timing in the regression setting. Column 1 repeats the base

specification for metabolic syndrome, from Table 2 column 1. In the second column, we add a

second exposure variable for the share of months between age 6 and 18 that the adult was

exposed to food stamps. Consistent with the results in Figure 4, the 6-18 coefficient is small and

statistically insignificant; and its addition does not change the magnitude of the coefficient on the

early child exposure. In the third column, we include a dummy for whether food stamps was

available when the adult was in utero (specifically, we look whether the program is in place at

conception). The biological and economic literature predicts that we should see benefits to

exposure in utero. The estimate on in utero exposure is -0.11, implying that exposure in utero

reduces metabolic syndrome. These results are not conclusive (the p-value is 0.13) and, along

with the basic trends illustrated in Figure 1, suggest that we don’t have the power to separately

identify the in utero and share of childhood impacts. The remaining three columns repeat these

specifications for economic self-sufficiency. The results in column 5 suggest that food stamp

exposure in both early and later childhood is beneficial to adult economic outcomes. This is

consistent with a story where by children with better nutrition gain more from school which

translates into higher economic self-sufficiency. The basic patterns—effects on metabolic


                                                   28
syndrome result from pre- and early post-natal exposure whereas the effects on economic self-

sufficiency result from childhood exposure—are an important result from the analysis.



8. Conclusion

       In this paper, we present new evidence that expanding resources in utero and in early

childhood can lead to significant improvement in adult health. In particular, we use the rollout of

the most important cash or near cash safety net in the U.S., the food stamp program. We find that

access to food stamps in utero and in early childhood leads to significant reductions in metabolic

syndrome conditions (obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes) in adulthood and, for

women, increases in economic self-sufficiency (increases in educational attainment, earnings,

income, and decreases in welfare participation). Further, we provide new evidence on when

exposure to additional resources matters—the gains are large an increasing with exposure to age

5. Beyond that point the additional resources do not translate into improved adult health

outcomes. These results pass several robustness tests including controlling for other county-year

of birth controls for the Great Society period, a placebo test, and event study models.

       Given the near-cash nature of food stamp vouchers (Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2009),

the exact biological mechanisms that lead to the long run improvement in health and human

capital is not clear. The availability of food stamps leads to more food consumption (Hoynes and

Schanzenbach 2009, Currie 2003) and thus one clear channel is through an increase in nutrition

in the critical in utero and early life period. Additionally, recent work suggests that additional

income can lead to reductions in cortisol in mothers, reducing biological harm due to persistent

stress (Aizer, Stroud, and Buka, 2009, Evans and Garthwaite 2011).




                                                  29
       Because “long-term impacts can only be estimated for cohorts treated a long time ago,”

an intrinsic challenge is how to “generalize estimates of long-term effects to current policies”

(Ludwig and Miller, 2007). Some have argued birth weight is a relatively good proxy for the

long-term effect of early life health conditions (Behrman and Rosenzweig 2004, Black,

Devereux, and Salvanes 2007). If birth weight was a “sufficient statistic” for early life exposure,

this would facilitate more timely evaluations of shocks and treatments. However, evidence from

Dutch famine suggests otherwise: the cohort showing the largest birth weight decrease was

exposed to famine later in pregnancy, while the larger long-term morbidity effects appear for the

cohort exposed to famine earlier in pregnancy (Painter et al. 2005). Similarly, Kelly (2009) and

Royer (2009) find less consistent long-term effects of birth weight. In other words, birth weight

may be an unreliable metric of long-term health, and that from an empirical perspective an

important component of this effect remains latent early in life.

       Moreover, our analysis finds effects for food stamp exposure through early childhood.

Thus, although in previous work we found that the FSP increased birth weight (Almond, Hoynes

and Schanzenbach 2011), the evidence presented here show that it is unlikely this is the only or

primary mechanism by which food stamps affects long run outcomes.

Notes: The figure plots coefficients from an event‐study analysis. Event time is defined as age
when FSP is implemented in the birth county. The models are estimated for the sample of
individuals born into families where the head has less than a high school education. Age 10‐11
is the omitted year so estimates are relative to that point. See the text for a description of the
model.

Notes to Tables 2 and 3: Each parameter is from a separate regression of the outcome variable on FSP
exposure (share of months between conception and age 5 that FSP is in the county). The sample comes from
the 1968‐2009 PSID and includes heads and wives born between 1956‐1981 who are between 18 and 53 (or
24‐53 for economic outcomes). The high impact sample includes those born into families where the head had
less than a high school education. Estimates are weighted using the PSID weights and clustered on county of
birth. The models control for individual demographics, family background, and fixed effects for year of birth,
year of interview, county, state specific linear cohort, and 1960 county characters interacted with linear
cohort. Standard errors are in parentheses and ***, **, and * indicate that the estimates are significant at
the 1%, 5% and 10% levels.

Notes: Each parameter is from a separate regression of the outcome variable on FSP exposure (share of
months between conception and age 5 that FSP is in the county). The sample comes from the 1968‐2009
PSID and includes heads and wives born between 1956‐1981 who are between 18 and 53 (or 24‐53 for
economic outcomes). The high impact sample includes those born into families where the head had less than
a high school education. Estimates are weighted using the PSID weights and clustered on county of birth. The
models control for individual demographics, family background, and fixed effects for year of birth, year of
interview, county, state specific linear cohort, and 1960 county characters interacted with linear cohort.
Standard errors are in parentheses and ***, **, and * indicate that the estimates are significant at the 1%,
5% and 10% levels.
