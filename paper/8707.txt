How Migration Restrictions Limit Agglomeration and Productivity in China

                                              ABSTRACT


        China strongly restricts rural-rural, urban-urban, and rural-urban migration. The result which this
paper documents is a surplus of labor in agriculture. However, the paper argues that these restrictions also
lead to insufficient agglomeration of economic activity within both rural industrial and urban areas, with
resulting first order losses in GDP. For urban areas the paper estimates a city productivity relationship,
based on city GDP numbers for 1990-97. The effects of access, educational attainment, FDI, and public
infrastructure on productivity are estimated. Worker productivity is shown to be an inverted U-shape
function of city employment level, with the peak point shifting out as industrial composition moves from
manufacturing to services. As far as we know this is the first paper to actually estimate the relationship
between output per worker and city scale, as it varies with industrial composition. The majority of
Chinese cities are shown to be potentially undersized - below the lower bound on the 95% confidence
interval about the size where their output per worker peaks. The paper calculates the large gains from
increased agglomeration in both the rural industrial and urban sectors. It also examines the effect of
capital reallocations, where the rural sector is grossly undercapitalized.
