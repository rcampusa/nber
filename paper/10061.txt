                                            ABSTRACT
Over the last 20 years, some financial events, such as devaluations or defaults, have triggered an
immediate adverse chain reaction in other countries -- which we call fast and furious contagion. Yet,
on other occasions, similar events have failed to trigger any immediate international reaction. We
argue that fast and furious contagion episodes are characterized by "the unholy trinity": (i) they
follow a large surge in capital flows; (ii) they come as a surprise; and (iii) they involve a leveraged
common creditor. In contrast, when similar events have elicited little international reaction, they
were widely anticipated and took place at a time when capital flows had already subsided.

       For reasons that are not always evident at the time, some financial events, such as

the devaluation of a currency or an announcement of default on sovereign debt

obligations, trigger an immediate and startling adverse chain reaction among countries

within a region and in some cases across regions. This phenomenon, which we dub “fast

and furious” contagion, was manifest after the floatation of the Thai baht on July 2, 1997,

as it quickly triggered financial turmoil across East Asia. Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia,

and the Philippines were hit the hardest—by December 1997, their currencies had

depreciated (on average) by about 75 percent. Similarly, when Russia defaulted on its

sovereign bonds on August 18, 1998, the effects were felt not only in several of the

former Soviet republics, but also in Hong Kong, Brazil, Mexico, many other emerging

markets, and the riskier segments of developed markets.1 The economic impact of these

shocks on the countries unfortunate enough to be affected included declines in equity

prices, spikes in the cost of borrowing, scarcity in the availability of international capital,

and declines in the value of their currencies and in output.

     Table 1 presents summary material for recent contagion episodes. The first column

lists the country, the date that marks the beginning of the episode, the nature of the shock,

and currency market developments in the crisis country, while the remaining columns

include information on the existence and nature of common external shocks, the

suspected main mechanism for propagation across national borders, and the countries that

were most affected.

     The challenge for economic researchers is to explain why the number of financial

crises that did not have significant international consequences is far greater than those

that did. It is no surprise that a domestic crisis (no matter how deep) in countries that are
                                             2

approximately autarkic (either voluntarily or otherwise) will not likely have immediate

repercussions in world capital markets. The countries may be large (China or India) or

comparatively small (Bolivia and Guinea-Bissau.) More intriguing cases of “contagion

that never happened” are where the crisis country is relatively large (at least by emerging

market standards) and is reasonably well integrated to the rest of the world through trade

or finance. Along with the fast and furious contagion episodes, these are the cases we

focus on in this paper.

       Some recent examples of financial crises with limited immediate consequences

include Brazil’s devaluation of the real on January 13, 1999 and eventual flotation on

February 1, the Argentine default and abandonment of the Convertibility Plan in

December 2001, and Turkey’s devaluation of the lira on February 22, 2001. Given that

Brazil, Turkey, and Argentina are relatively large emerging markets, these episodes could

have been–at least potentially--as highly “contagious” as the Thai and Russian crises.

Nonetheless, financial markets shrugged off these events, despite the fact that it was

evident at the time that some of these shocks would have trade and real sector

repercussions on neighboring countries over the medium term.2 Table 2 presents some

summary material for these episodes, in a format parallel to Table 1.

       This paper seeks to address the central question of why financial contagion across

borders occurs in some cases but not others.3 Throughout the paper, we stress that there

are three key elements—an abrupt reversal in capital inflows, surprise announcements,

and a leveraged common creditor (the unholy trinity)--that distinguish the cases where

contagion occurs from those where it does not.
                                              3

   First, contagion usually followed on the heels of a surge in inflows of international

capital and, more often than not, the initial shock or announcement pricked the capital

flow bubble, at least temporarily. The capacity for a swift and drastic reversal of capital

flows—the so-called “sudden stop” problem—played a significant role. 4

    Second, the announcements that set off the chain reactions came as a surprise to

financial markets. The distinction between anticipated and unanticipated events appears

critical, as forewarning allows investors to adjust their portfolios in anticipation of the

event.

   Third, in all cases where there were significant immediate international repercussions,

a leveraged common creditor was involved—be it commercial banks, hedge funds,

mutual funds, or individual bondholders—who helped to propagate the contagion across

national borders.

         Before turning to the question of what elements distinguish the cases where

contagion occurs from those where it does not, however, we provide a brief tour of the

main theoretical explanations for contagion and the most salient empirical findings on the

channels of propagation.



What is Contagion?

         Since the term “contagion” has been used liberally and taken on multiple

meanings, it is useful to clarify how it will be used in this paper. We refer to contagion

as an episode in which there are significant immediate effects in a number of countries

following an event--that is, when the consequences are fast and furious and evolve over a

matter of hours or days. This “fast and furious” reaction is a contrast to cases in which
                                             4

the initial international reaction to the news is muted. The latter cases do not preclude the

emergence of gradual and protracted effects that may cumulatively have major economic

consequences. We refer to these gradual death by a thousand cuts cases as spillovers.

Common external shocks, such as changes in international interest rates or oil prices, are

also not automatically included in our working definition of contagion. Only if there is

“excess comovement” in financial and economic variables across countries in response to

a common shock do we consider it contagion.



Theories of Contagion

       Through what channels does a financial crisis in one country spread across

international borders? Some models have emphasized investor behavior that gives rise to

the possibility of herding and fads. It is no doubt possible (if not appealing to many

economists) that such “irrational exuberance,” to quote Federal Reserve Chairman Alan

Greenspan, influence the behavior of capital flows and financial markets and exacerbates

the booms as well as the busts. Other models stress economic linkages through trade or

finance. This section provides a selective discussion of theories of contagion. The main

message conveyed here—consistent with our unholy trinity proposition--is that financial

linkages (i.e., cross border capital flows and common creditors) and investor behavior

figure the most prominently in the theoretical explanations of contagion.



Herding

       Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch (1992) model the fragility of mass behavior

as a consequence of informational cascades. 5 An information cascade occurs when it is
                                             5

optimal for an individual, after observing the actions of those ahead of him, to follow the

behavior of the preceding individual without regard to his or her own information. Under

relatively mild conditions, cascades will almost surely start, and often they will be wrong.

In those circumstances, a few early individuals can have a disproportionate effect.

Changes in the underlying value of alternative decisions can lead to “fads,” that is drastic

and seemingly whimsical swings in mass behavior without obvious external stimulus.

       Banerjee (1992) also develops a model to examine the implications of decisions

that are influenced by what others are doing. The decisions of others may reflect

potentially important information in their possession that is not in the public domain.

With sequential decision making, people paying attention to what others are doing before

them end up doing what everyone else is doing (i.e., herding behavior), even when one’s

own private information suggests doing something different. The herd externality is of

the positive feedback type: If we join the crowd, we induce others to do the same. The

signals perceived by the first few decision makers–random and not necessarily correct--

determine where the first crowd forms, and from then on, everybody joins the crowd.

This characteristic of the model captures (to some extent) the phenomena of “excess

volatility” in asset markets, or the frequent and unpredictable changes in fashions.

       Another story suggests that the channels of transmission arise from the global

diversification of financial portfolios in the presence of information asymmetries. Calvo

and Mendoza (1998), for instance, present a model where the fixed costs of gathering and

processing country-specific information give rise to herding behavior, even when

investors are rational. Because of information costs, there are equilibria in which the

marginal cost exceeds the marginal gain of gathering information. In such instances, it is
                                              6

rational for investors to mimic market portfolios. When a rumor favors a different

portfolio, all investors “follow the herd.”



Trade Linkages

       Some recent models have revived Nurkse’s (1944) classic story of competitive

devaluations (Gerlach and Smetts, 1996). Nurkse argued that since a devaluation in a one

country makes its goods cheaper internationally, it will pressure other countries that have

lost competitiveness to devalue as well. In this setting, a devaluation in a second country

is a policy decision whose effect on output is expected to be salutary, as it induces

expenditure-switching (i.e. reduces imports, increases exports, and improves the current

account.) An empirical implication of this type of model is that we should observe a high

volume of trade among the “synchronized” devaluers. As a story of voluntary contagion,

this explanation does not square with the fact that central banks often go to great lengths

to avoid a devaluation in the first place (often by engaging in an active interest rate

defense of the existing exchange rate, as in Lahiri and Végh, 2003) or by enduring

massive losses of foreign exchange reserves nor that devaluations have often been

contractionary.



Financial Linkages

       Other studies have emphasized the important role of common creditors and

financial linkages. The “type” of the common creditor may differ across models but the

story tends to remain consistent.
                                              7

       In Shleifer and Vishny (1997), arbitrage is conducted by relatively few

specialized and leveraged investors, who combine their knowledge with resources that

come from outside investors to take large positions. Funds under management become

responsive to past performance. The authors call this Performance Based Arbitrage

(PBA). In extreme circumstances, when prices are significantly out of line and

arbitrageurs are fully invested, PBA is particularly ineffective. In these instances,

arbitrageurs might bail out of the market when their participation is most needed. That is,

arbitrageurs face fund withdrawals, and are not very effective in betting against the

mispricing. Risk averse arbitrageurs might chose to liquidate, even when they do not

have to, for fear that a possible further adverse price movement may cause a drastic

outflow of funds later on. While the model is not explicitly focused on contagion, one

could see how an adverse shock that lowers returns (say, like the Mexican peso crisis)

may lead arbitrageurs to liquidate their positions in other countries that are part of their

portfolio (Argentina, Brazil, etc.), as they fear future withdrawals.

       Similarly, Calvo (1998) has stressed the role of liquidity. A leveraged investor

facing margin calls needs to sell asset holdings. Because of the information asymmetries,

a “lemons problem” arises and the asset can only be sold at a firesale price. For this

reason, the strategy will be not to sell the asset whose price has already collapsed, but

other assets in the portfolio. In doing so, however, other asset prices fall and the original

disturbance spreads across markets.

       Kodres and Pritsker (2002) develop a rational expectations model of asset prices

to explain financial market contagion. In their model, assets’ long run values are

determined by macroeconomic risk factors, which are shared across countries, and by
                                              8

country-specific factors. Contagion occurs when “informed” investors respond to private

information on a country-specific factor, by optimally rebalancing their portfolio’s

exposures to the shared macroeconomic risk factors in other countries’ markets. When

there is asymmetric information in the countries hit by the rebalancing, “uninformed”

investors cannot fully identify the source of the change in asset demand; they therefore

respond as if the rebalancing is related to information on their own country (even though

it is not). As a result, an idiosyncratic shock generates excess co-movement—

contagion—across countries' asset markets. A key insight from the model is that

contagion can occur between two countries even when contagion via correlated

information shocks, correlated liquidity shocks, and via wealth effects are ruled out by

assumption, and even when the countries do not share common macroeconomic factors,

provided that both share at least one underlying macroeconomic risk factor with a third

country, through which portfolio rebalancing can take place. Their model, like the

rational herding model of Calvo and Mendoza (1998), has the empirical implication that

countries with more internationally-traded financial assets and more liquid markets

should be more vulnerable to contagion. Small, highly illiquid markets are likely to be

under-represented in international portfolios to begin with and, as such, shielded from

this type of contagion.

       Kaminsky and Reinhart (2000) focus on is the role of commercial banks in

spreading the initial shock. The behavior of foreign banks can exacerbate the original

crisis by calling loans and drying up credit lines, but can also propagate crises by calling

loans elsewhere. The need to rebalance the overall risk of the bank’s asset portfolio and
                                              9

to recapitalize following the initial losses can lead to a marked reversal in commercial

bank credit across markets where the bank has exposure.



Other Explanations

       The so-called “wake-up call hypothesis” (a term coined by Morris Goldstein,

1998) relies on either investor irrationality or a fixed cost in acquiring information about

emerging markets. In this story, once investors “wake up” to the weaknesses that were

revealed in the crisis country, they will proceed to avoid and move out of countries that

share some characteristics with the crisis country. So, for instance, if the original crisis

country had a large current account deficit and a relatively “rigid” exchange rate, then

other countries showing similar features will be vulnerable to similar pressures (see Basu,

1998, for a formal model).



Channels of Propagation: The Empirical Evidence

       As discussed, some theoretical models emphasized trade linkages as a channel for

the cross-border propagation of shocks, while most models have looked to financial

markets for an explanation.

       Perhaps because trade in goods and services has a longer history in the post World

War II period than trade in financial assets, or because of far better data availability, trade

links have received the most attention in the empirical literature on channels of

contagion. Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz (1996) find evidence that trade links help

explain the pattern of contagion in 20 industrial countries over 1959-1993. Glick and

Rose (1999), who examine this issue for a sample of 161 countries, come to the same
                                             10

conclusion. Glick and Rose (1999) and Kaminsky and Reinhart (2000) also study trade

linkages which involve competition in a common third market. While sharing a third

party is a necessary condition for the competitive devaluation story, Kaminsky and

Reinhart (2000) argue it is clearly not a sufficient one. If a country that exports wool to

the United States devalues, it is not obvious why this would have any detrimental effect

on a country that exports semiconductors to the United States. Their study shows that

third-party trade links is a plausible transmission channel in some cases but not for the

majority of countries recently battered by contagion. For example, at the time of the

Asian crisis, Thailand exported many of the same goods to the same third parties as

Malaysia. This, however, does not explain all the other Asian crisis countries. Bilateral or

third party trade also does not appear to carry any weight in explaining the effects of

Mexico (1994) on Argentina and Brazil. At the time of Mexico’s 1994 devaluation, only

about 2 percent of Argentina’s and Brazil’s total exports went to Mexico. Similarly,

Brazil hardly trades with Russia, as only 0.2 percent of its exports are destined for

Russian markets; yet in the weeks following the Russian default Brazil’s interest rate

spreads doubled and Brazil’s equity prices fell by more than 20 percent.

       Kaminsky and Reinhart (2000) compare countries clustered along the lines of

trade links versus countries with common bank creditors, and conclude that common

financial linkages better explains the observed pattern of contagion. Mody and Taylor

(2002), who seek to explain the comovement in an exchange market pressures index by

bilateral and third-party trade and other factors, also cast doubt on the importance of trade

linkages in explaining the propagation of shocks.
                                               11

       Conversely, in many cases of crises without contagion, there are strong trade

links. About 30 percent of Argentina’s exports are destined for Brazil, yet in the week

following Brazil’s devaluation, the Argentine equity market increases 12 percent.

Similarly, nearly 13 percent of Uruguay’s exports are bound for the Argentine market.

Yet, the main reason why the crisis in Argentina ultimately affected Uruguay was the

tight financial linkages between the two countries. Uruguayan banks have (for many

years) been host to Argentinean depositors, who thought their deposits safer when these

were denominated in U.S. dollars and kept across the Río de la Plata. At first, as the

crisis deepened in Argentina, many deposits fled from Argentine banks and found their

way to Uruguay. But when the Argentine authorities declared a freeze on bank deposits

in December 2001, Argentine firms and households began to draw down the deposits

they kept at Uruguayan banks. The withdrawals escalated and became a run on deposits

amid fears that the Uruguayan central bank would either run out of international reserves

or (like Argentina) confiscate the deposits.

       Other studies focused primarily on financial channels of transmission. Frankel

and Schmukler (1998) and Kaminsky, Lyons, and Schmukler (2000) show evidence to

support the idea that US-based mutual funds have played an important role in spreading

shocks throughout Latin America by selling assets from one country when prices fall in

another – with Mexico’s 1994 crisis the being a prime example. Caramazza, Ricci, and

Salgado (1999), Kaminsky and Reinhart (2000), and Van Rijckeghem and Weder (2000)

focus on the role played by commercial banks in spreading shocks and inducing a sudden

stop in capital flows in the form of bank lending, especially in the debt crisis of 1982 and

the crisis in Asia in 1997. Mody and Taylor (2002) link contagion to developments in the
                                            12

US high yield or “junk” bond market. The common thread in these papers is that,

without the financial sector linkages, contagion of the fast and furious variety would be

unlikely.

Summing Up

       Table 3 summarizes the some of the arguments about propagation of contagion

among the five fast and furious cases emphasized earlier: Mexico in 1982, the European

Exchange Rate Mechanism crises of 1992, Mexico’s currency devaluation in 1994,

Thailand’s devaluation in 1997, and Russia’s devaluation in 1998. 6 In each case, we

consider the possible trade channel, whether the affected countries shared similar

characteristics with the crisis country and with each other, and whether a common

creditor was present with the possible financial channel. Indeed, Table 3 lays the

foundation for our unholy trinity of financial contagion proposition, which the next

section discusses in greater detail. Several features summarized in Table 3 are worth

highlighting. In all five cases, a common leveraged creditor was present, making it

consistent with the explanations offered by Schleifer and Vishny (1997), Calvo (1998),

and discussed in Kaminsky and Reinhart (2000). In three of the five cases, the scope for

propagation via trade links is virtually nonexistent and in one of the two remaining cases

(Thailand) the extent of third party competition is with Malaysia, not the other affected

Asian countries. Lastly, with the exception of the countries that suffered most from

Russia/LTCM fallout, the affected countries tended to have large capital inflows and

relatively fixed exchange rates.

The Unholy Trinity: Capital Inflows, Surprises, and Common Creditors

          Having summarized some of the key findings of the literature on contagion, we

now return to our central question of why contagion occurs in some instances but not in

others.

The Capital Flow Cycle

          Fast and furious contagion episodes are typically preceded by a surge in capital

inflows which, more often than not, come to an abrupt halt or sudden stop in the wake of

a crisis. The inflow of capital may come from banks, other financial institutions, or

bondholders. The debt contracts typically have short maturities, which means that the

investors and financial institutions will have to make decisions about rolling over their

debts – or not doing so. With fast and furious contagion, investors and financial

institutions are exposed to the crisis country and often highly leveraged. Thus, the

investors can be viewed as halfway through the door, ready to back out on short notice.

          This rising financial exposure to emerging markets is not present to nearly the

same extent in the crises without major external consequences. Financial crises that have

not set off major international dominos have usually unfolded against low volumes of

international capital flows. Given lower levels of exposure, investors and institutions in

the financial sector have a much lower need to adjust their portfolios when the shock

occurs. In many instances, because the shock is anticipated, portfolios were adjusted

prior to the event.

          In all five of the examples from Table 1, the capital flow cycle has also played a

key role in determining whether the effects of a crisis have significant international

ramifications. For example, in the late 1970s, soaring commodity prices, low and
                                              14

sometimes negative real interest rates (as late as 1978 real interest rates oscillated

between minus two percent and zero), and weak loan demand in the United States made it

very attractive for U.S. banks to lend to Latin America and other emerging markets—and

lend they did. Capital flows, by way of bank lending, surged during this period, as shown

in Figure 1. By the early 1980s, the prospects for repayment had significantly changed

for the worse. U.S. short-term interest rates had risen markedly in nominal terms (the

federal funds rate went from below 7 percent in mid 1978 to a peak of about 20 percent in

mid-1981) and in real terms (by mid-1981 real short-term interest rates were around 10

percent, the highest level since the 1930s.) Since most of the loans made had either short

maturities or variable interest rates, the effects were passed on to the borrower relatively

quickly. Commodity prices had fallen almost 30 percent between 1980 and 1982, and

many governments in Latin America were engaged in spending sprees that would seal

their fate and render them incapable of repaying their debts. In 1981, Argentina’s public

sector deficit as a percent of GDP was about 13 percent while Mexico’s was 14 percent;

during 1979-80 Brazil’s deficit was of a comparable order of magnitude. Prior to

Mexico’s default in August 1982, one after another of these countries had already

experienced currency crises, banking crises, or both. When Mexico ultimately defaulted,

the highly exposed and leveraged banks retrenched from emerging markets in general and

Latin America in particular.

       During the decade that followed, there were numerous crises in Latin America,

including some severe hyperinflations (Bolivia in 1985, and Peru, Argentina, and Brazil

in 1990) and other defaults. Yet, these crises had minimal international repercussions, as
                                            15

most of the region was shut out of international capital markets. The drought in capital

flows lasted until 1990.

       Figure 1 shows net private capital flows for the contagion episodes of the 1990s,

while Table 4 provides complementary information on capital flows and capital flight for

the crisis country and those affected by it. Again, notice the common pattern of a run-up

in borrowing followed by a crash at the time of the initial shock and much inflows of

capital thereafter. Net private capital flows to Europe had risen markedly and peaked in

1992 before coming to a sudden stop after the collapse of the Exchange Rate Mechanism

crisis, in which the attempt to hold exchange rates within preset bands fell apart under

pressure from international arbitrageurs. The crisis in the European Monetary System in

1992-93 showed that emerging markets do not have a monopoly on vulnerability to

contagion, although they certainly tend to be more crisis prone.

        In the case of Mexico, as the devaluation of the peso loomed close late in 1994,

capital flows were close to their 1992 peak after surging considerably. (As late as 1989,

Mexico had recorded net large capital outflows.) The rise in capital flows to the East

Asian Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand (shown in Figure 1) was

no less dramatic—especially after 1995, when Japanese and European bank lending to

emerging Asia escalates.

       The bottom right panel of Figure 1 shows the evolution of capital flows to all

emerging markets and the progression of crises. The halcyon days of capital flows to

emerging markets took place during the first half of the 1990s and held up at least for a

short time after Mexican crisis and its contagious effects on Argentina. But the East

Asian crisis brings another wave of contagion along the marked decline in capital flows
                                             16

in 1997. The Russian crisis of August 1998 delivers another blow from which emerging

market flows never fully recover in the 1990s. As shown in the right bottom panel of

Figure 1, this crisis is associated with the second major leg of decline in private capital

flows to emerging markets. Since Figure 1 is based on annual capital flow data, it

significantly blurs the stark differences in capital flows during the pre- and post-Russia

crisis. Figure 2, which plots weekly data on emerging market bond issuance before

(negative numbers) and after (positive numbers) the Russian default (dashed line) and,

for contrast, the Brazilian devaluation on January 1999 (solid line). The vertical line

marks the week of the crisis. It is evident that bond issuance collapses following the

Russian crisis and remains for over two months following the event; by contrast, the

Brazilian devaluation had no discernible impact on issuance, which actually increases

following the devaluation.

       As Figure 1 highlights, the next three crises--the Brazilian devaluation of January

1999, the Turkish devaluation of February 2001, and the Argentine default at the end of

2001—take place during the downturn of the cycle and at levels of net capital inflows

that were barely above the levels of the 1980s drought. Indeed, the estimates of capital

flows to emerging markets in recent years shown in Figure 1, indeed, may actually be

overstated because total net flows include foreign direct investment, which held up better

than portfolio bond and equity flows.



Surprise Crises and Anticipated Catastrophes

       Fast and furious crises and contagion cases have a high degree of surprise

associated with them while their quieter counterparts are more broadly anticipated. This
                                              17

distinction appears to be critical when “potentially affected countries” have a common

lender. If the common lender is surprised by the shock in the initial crises country, there

is no time ahead of the impending crisis to rebalance portfolios and scale back from the

affected country. In contrast, if the crisis is anticipated, investors have time to limit the

damage by scaling back exposure or hedging their positions.

       Evidence that quieter episodes were more anticipated than the fast and furious

cases is presented in Table 5. Standard and Poor’s credit ratings had remained

unchanged during the twelve months prior to of the Mexican and Thai currency crises. In

the case of Russia, the credit rating is actually upgraded as late as June 1998 when the

broader definition that includes Credit Watch (CW) status is used. The CW list lists the

names of credits whose Moody’s ratings have a likelihood of changing. These names are

actively under review because of developing trends or events which warrant a more

extensive examination. Two downgrades eventually take place prior to the crises on

August 13, 1998 and again on the 17th, the day before the default. By contrast, Argentina

has a string (five) of downgrades as it marched toward default, with the first one taking

place in October 2000, over a year before the eventual default. Likewise, Brazil and

Turkey suffered downgrades well before the eventual currency crisis.

       As further evidence that markets anticipated some of the shocks and not others,

Figure 3 plots of the domestic-international interest rate differential for the Emerging

Market Bond Index (EMBI) and the EMBI+ for two of the contagious episodes (Mexico

and Russia, top panels) and for two crises without immediate international repercussions

(Argentina and Brazil, bottom panels). 7 The patterns shown in these four panels are

representative of the behavior of spreads ahead of anticipated and unanticipated crises.
                                             18

(The vertical axis is measured in basis points, so a measure of 1000 means a gap of 10

percentage points between the domestic borrowing rate and the international benchmark.)

If bad things are expected to happen, risk increases and spreads should widen. The

overall message is that fast and furious episodes are accompanied by sharp spikes in yield

differentials – reflecting the unanticipated nature of the news -- whereas other episodes

have tended to be anticipated by financial markets.

       The top left panel of Figure 3, which shows the evolution of Mexico’s spread in

the pre-crisis period is striking. In Mexico, spreads are stable at around 500 basis points

in the months and weeks prior to the December 21, 1994 devaluation. Indeed Mexico’s

spreads remained below 1,000 until the week of January 6, 1995. Russian spreads,

illustrated in the top right panel of Figure 3, show remarkable stability until a couple of

weeks prior to the announcement and default. In the case of Russia, the devaluation of

the ruble appears to have been widely expected by the markets, as evident on the spreads

on ruble-denominated debt. One can conjecture that it was either the actual default or the

absence of an IMF bailout (following on the heels of historically large bail-out packages

for Mexico and Korea) that took markets by surprise.

       The data presented in Figure 3 bottom panel illustrates the fact that markets

foreshadowed turbulence in the cases of Argentina (2001) and Brazil (1999). The left

bottom panel of Figure 3 presents evidence for interest rate spreads for Argentina and

shows that the cost of borrowing began to rise steadily and markedly well before its

default on December 23, 2001. In effect, since the week of April 22,spreads began to

settle above 1,000 and since July 20 the never fell below 1,500. The bottom right panel of

Figure 3 shows Brazilian spreads. There is a run-up in spreads well before Brazil floats
                                            19

the real on February 1,1999. This chart also reveals that Brazil—more so than

Argentina—was quickly and markedly affected by the Russian crisis.

        In sum, we have provided suggestive evidence that anticipated crises are preceded

by credit ratings downgrades and widening interest spreads before the crisis while for

unanticipated crises the downgrades and widening of spreads come during the crisis or

after the fact.

Common Creditors

        As noted, international banks played an important role in the transmission of

some of the crises of the 1980s and the 1990s. In the 1980s it was U.S. banks lending

heavily to Latin America while in the 1990s it was European and Japanese bank lending

to Asia, the transition economies and, in the case of Spanish banks, Latin America. In the

remainder of this section, we discuss the role that commercial banks and mutual and

hedge funds have played in the recent contagion episodes.

        International bank lending to the Asian crisis countries grew at a 25 percent

annual rate from 1994 to 1997 (or at a pace of about US$40 billion inflow per year.) At

the onset of the crisis, European and Japanese banks’ lending to Asia was at its peak at

US$165 and US$124 billion, respectively, while the exposure of US banks was much

more limited. Japanese banks had the highest exposure to Thailand, which also accounted

for 26 percent of their total lending to emerging markets (the largest representation of any

emerging market country in their portfolio.) Collectively, the Asian crisis countries

(excluding the Philippines, which did not borrow much from Japanese banks), accounted

for 65 percent of the emerging market loan portfolio of Japanese banks. For European

banks, the comparable share was 23 percent. Following the floatation of the Thai baht on
                                             20

July 2, 1997, the exposed banks retrenched quickly and cut credit lines to emerging Asia.

The bank inflows quickly became outflows of about US$47 billion.

       As with Asia, lending to transition economies had accelerated in the mid-1990s.

In the three years before the Russian crisis, international bank lending to the region grew

at 14 percent per annum. German banks were more heavily exposed to Russia, with

lending to Russia averaging about 20 percent of all their lending to emerging economies.

As with earlier fast and furious contagion episodes, bank flows to the region, which

oscillated around US$28 billion per year in the years before the crisis, turned into a

US$14 billion dollar outflow in the year following the crisis. This retrenchment in

lending helps explain why other transition economies were affected by the Russian crisis.

However, it fails to explain why Brazil, Hong Kong, and Mexico come under significant

pressures at this time. To understand these and other cases, we need to turn our attention

to non-bank common creditors.

       Equity and bond flows also declined sharply in the aftermath of the fast and

furious crises of the 1990s. For example, U.S.-based mutual funds specialized in Latin

America withdrew massively from the region following the Mexican crisis in 1994. As

discussed in Kaminsky, Lyons, and Schmukler (2002), withdrawals from Latin America

oscillated around 40 percent in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. The countries most

affected were Argentina, Brazil, and (of course) Mexico, which were the countries to

which the mutual funds were most heavily exposed to in Latin America at the time of the

crisis. For example, if one examines the Latin American portfolio of mutual funds

specialized in emerging markets at around the time of the crisis, Brazil, Mexico, and
                                             21

Argentina account for 37, 26, and 14 percent of their portfolio, respectively (i.e., three

countries accounted for 77 percent of the Latin American portfolio)!

       The Thai crisis in 1997 also triggered equity outflows through mutual funds from

Asia. As discussed in Kaminsky, Lyons, and Schmukler (2002), the countries most

affected by abnormal withdrawals were Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, the

countries with the most liquid financial markets in the region. As was the case of the

Mexican crisis, these were the countries to which mutual funds were heavily exposed. Of

the portfolio allocated to Asia, 30 percent was directed to Hong Kong, 7 percent to

Singapore, and 13 percent to Taiwan. They estimate that abnormal withdrawals (relative

to the mean flow during the whole sample) oscillated at around 10 percent for the three

economies.

       Similarly, highly leveraged funds seem to have had an important role in the

speculative attack against Hong Kong dollar in August of 1998 following the Russian

crisis see Corsetti, Pesenti, and Roubini (2001). According to the Financial Stability

Forum 2000 Report of the Market Dynamics Study Group of the FSF Working Group on

Highly Leveraged Institutions (2000), large macro hedge funds appear to have detected

fundamental weaknesses early and started to build large short positions against the Hong

Kong dollar. According to available estimates, hedge funds’ short positions in the HK$

market were close to 10 billion U.S. dollars (6 percent of Hong Kong’s GDP), but some

observers believe that the correct figure was much higher. Several large hedge funds also

took very large short positions in the equity markets, and these positions were correlated

over time. As reported in the FSF study, among those taking short positions in the equity

market were four large hedge funds, whose futures and options positions were equivalent
                                             22

to around 40 percent of all outstanding equity futures contracts as of early August prior to

the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervention. Position data suggest a

correlation, albeit far from perfect, in the timing of the establishment of the short

positions. Two hedge funds substantially increased their positions during the period of

the HKMA intervention. At end August, four hedged funds accounted for 50,500

contracts or 49 percent of the total open interest/net delta position; one fund accounted

for one third. The group’s meetings suggested that some large highly leveraged

institutions had large short positions in both the equity and currency markets.




Concluding Reflections

       To date, what has distinguished the contagion episodes that happened from those

that could have happened seems to have had little to do with more “judicious” and

“discriminating” investors—nor with any improvements to boast of in the state of the

international financial architecture. If investors behaved in a more discriminating manner

in the recent crises where contagion could have happened but did not, it is because: i)

those crises tended to unfold in slow motion and were thus widely anticipated; and ii) the

capital flow bubble had been pricked at an earlier stage, when those same investors were

more “exuberant” and iii) hence, the “common creditor” we have stressed in our

discussion was less leveraged in these episodes. When looking back into history, one is

struck by an overwhelming sense of “déjà vu. It certainly seems a mystery why episodes

of financial crises and contagion recur, in spite of the major costs associated with crises

(this would seem to provide a sufficient motivation for avoiding them.) But based on

historical experience, there appears to be little hope that during the good times future
                                             23

generations of sovereign borrowers or investors will remember that the four most

expensive words in financial history are “this time it’s different.”

       If history is any guide, financial crises will not be eliminated—as Kindleberger

(1977) noted, they are hardy perennials. But it should be possible, based on the

understanding of what causes contagion and what does not, for countries to take steps to

reduce their vulnerability to international contagion.

       Contagion appears to be linked to a substantial inflow of capital to a country. Of

course, the prospect of financial autarky as a way of avoiding fast and furious contagion

is not particularly attractive as a long run solution. In fact, it may not even be feasible

when countries have already liberalized the financial sector and the capital account. But

before turning to the issue of capital account restrictions, it is critical to remember that in

many crises (most of those discussed here and many others), the lead and largest

borrower in international capital markets during the boom periods are the sovereign

governments themselves. As Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003) observe, it is the

most debt intolerant countries with a history of serial default that can least afford to

borrow that usually borrow the most. Often the outcome is default.

       So, as a first important step, the risk of contagion would be reduced if

policymakers in countries that are integrated with world capital markets remember that

many a surge in capital inflows often ends in a sudden stop—whether owing to home-

grown problems or contagion from abroad. As a consequence, prudent policymaking

would at a minimum ensure that the government does not overspend and overborrow

when international capital markets are all too willing to lend, as most of those episodes

end in tears. In contrast, fiscal policy in emerging markets currently tends to be markedly
                                            24

procyclical, with countries engaging in expansionary fiscal policy in good times and

contractionary fiscal policy in bad times (Talvi and Végh, 2000). Fiscal reforms aimed at

designing institutional mechanisms that would discourage such procyclical behavior

(particularly on the part of “provinces” or other autonomous entities) appear as an

essential ingredient in preventing future crises from building up. Such consistent self

discipline, however, on the part of governments has historically proved elusive.

       As regards to curbing private borrowing from abroad, the issues are even more

complex. The best case for restrictions on international financial inflows would seem to

focus on debt contracts with short maturities that are denominated in a foreign currency–

which have been the trigger in many modern contagion episodes. But although such

policies may help in tilting the composition of capital flows toward longer maturities,

their overall long-term effectiveness is unclear. Curbing capital outflows, once

contagion and the ensuing sudden stop has occurred, is even more problematic.

Experience has shown that capital flight has been an endemic problem for countries that

have tried to turn the clock back and re-introduce tight capital account and financial

restrictions amidst economic turmoil. More fundamentally, pervasive capital controls

hardly seem likely to be the solution in the medium and long run to the contagion and

sudden stop problem.

       As to new mechanisms in financial centers that could curb these periodic bouts of

lending and “irrational exuberance” and lessen the likelihood of unpleasant future

surprises, we remain very skeptical that there are easy or obvious solutions. Access to

more information may not lessen surprises when borrowers and lenders have often

shown themselves willing to downplay worrisome fundamentals that are in the public
                                           25

domain in the late 1990s under the guise of having superior information. The economic

historian Max Winkler wrote:

“The over-abundance of funds, together with the difficulty of finding the most

profitable employment therefore at home has contributed greatly to the pronounced

demand for and the ready absorption of large foreign issues, irrespective of

quality...While high yield on a foreign bond does not necessarily indicate inferior

quality, great care must be exercised in the selection of foreign bonds, especially today,

when anything foreign seems to find a ready market...Promiscuous buying, however,

is destined to prove disastrous.”

                                                 The New York Tribune, March 17, 1927

       In 1929 a wave of currency crises swept through Latin America—it was quickly
followed by a string of defaults on sovereign external debt obligations. At the time of
this writing, with investors searching for high yields quickly snapping up emerging
market bonds, Winkler’s warning rings as true now as it did then.

    The international financial turmoil that followed Russia’s default was compounded in a

significant manner by another negative surprise announcement: on September 2, 1998 it

became public knowledge that Long Term Capital Management (LTCM), owing to its

large exposure to Russia and other high-yield assets, had gone bankrupt.

     As Brazil is Argentina’s largest trading partner, the sharp depreciation of the real

(about 70 percent between January and end February) left the Argentine peso overvalued.

Similarly, through its extensive financial and trade links, Uruguay’s economy (as it has

through history) would be whiplashed by the Argentine crisis.

few decades. Commonly cited examples of contagion include the first Latin American

debt crisis -- which began with Peru’s default in April 1826 -- and the international

financial crisis of 1873. Going back even further in time, Neal and Weidenmeir (2002)

also discuss the “contagion” dimension of the Tulip Mania of the 1630s and the

Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles of 1719-20. Two leading examples of financial crises

that did not lead to contagion include the well-documented Argentina-Baring crisis of

1890, and the United States financial crisis of 1907. For detailed accounts of historical

episodes of financial crises, see Bordo and Eichengreen (1999), Bordo and Murshid

(2000), Kindleberger (2000), and Neal and Weidenmier (2002.)

Caballero and Krishnamurthy. (2003) for a model that traces out the economic

consequences of sudden stops.

    For a detailed discussion of the evolution of these contagion episodes, the interested

reader is referred to IMF World Economic Outlook (January 1993) for the ERM crisis,

    The Emerging Market Bond Index Plus (EMBI+) tracks total returns for traded external

debt instruments in the emerging markets. While the EMBI covers only Brady bonds, the

EMBI+ expands upon the EMBI, covering three additional markets: (1) Eurobonds, (2)

U.S. dollar local markets, and (3) loans. The country coverage of the EMBI+ varies over

time, currently including 19 members Current members are: Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria,

Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, Mexico, Malaysia, Morocco, Nigeria, Panama, Peru,

Philippines, Poland, Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Venezuela, and South Africa. The selection

of countries and instruments follow four eligibility criteria imposed by JP Morgan Chase:

(1) a minimum balance in outstanding, (2) rating, (3) remaining maturity, and (4) ability

for international settlement. In order to construct the index of a specific country, a daily

total return of each instrument is first computed, and then aggregated by market-

capitalization-weight.
