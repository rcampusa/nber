                  The Second Best Theory of Capital Taxation




                                   ABSTRACT




     An important proposition in the theory of efficient taxation is that, if
capital income is taxed, all types of capital income should be taxed at the same
rate. This conclusion has motivated extensive empirical analysis of the tax
rates on different types of capital income. It has also been the basis for a
variety of proposals to revise actual tax rules.
     The present paper emphasizes that the comventional view must be modified in
the very common situation in which some capital tax rate is politically
constrained to something other than its optimal value, e.g., the zero rates on
the imputed income on owner-occupied housing. The formal analysis of the paper
examines the case in which there are three types of capital income and one of
the tax rates is arbitrarily constrained to be zero.
     Three general "rule of thumb" results emerge from the specific analysis:
First, if the several types of capital can be regarded as independent in produc-
tion, the optimal tax rates on the taxable types of capital income should depart
from equality in the direction of an inverse elasticity rule. Second, in com-
parison to these rates, capital that is a complement to the untaxed capital
should generally be taxed more heavily while capital that is a substitute for
the untaxed capital should be taxed less heavily. Third, variations in the
degree of complementarity or substitutability between the two types of capital
should alter the two tax rates in a way that maintains a constant difference in
the total taxes on each type of capital.
     Although these rule-of-thumb results help to modify the conventional equal-
tax—rates rule in an appropriate way, the most important implication of the pre-
sent analysis is that any departure from optimal taxation makes it very
difficult to set other capital tax rates optimally.

             THE SECOND BEST THEORY OF DIFFERENTIAL CAPITAL TAXATION


                               Martin Feldstejnl



      A fundamental principle of optimal tax theory is that production efficiency

should be maintained (e.g., Diamond and Plirrlees, 1971). If lump-sum taxation

Is not feasible, all taxes should be levied on factor Incomes or on the

consumption of different goods. Explicitly precluded is the differential

taxation of the inputs of firms.

     As specific applications of this principle, studies have estimated the

welfare costs of taxing capital differently in different uses. Individual

studies include the excess burden of the corporate income    tax   (Harberger, 1964;

Shoven and Whalley, 1972), of the differential taxation of equipment, structures and

Inventories (King and Fullerton, 1984; Auerbach, 1979). and of the lack of

taxation of the Implicit income produced by owner—occupied housing (Laidler,

1969; Aaron, 1972). In the recent tax reform debate in the United States, the

Treasury (U.S. Treasury, 1984, 1985) has emphasized the existing disparities in

capital income tax rates among industries and types of capital investments and

has proposed changes designed to reduce these disparities.

     Experience nevertheless suggests that governments will continue to use

suboptimal tax policies. It Is significant that even the initial "radical

reform" proposals of the U.S. Treasury (1984) did not suggest taxing the

implicit income of owner-occupied housing capital or eliminating the corporate

income tax or taxing the interest on general purpose bonds issued by state and

local governments. Although it is useful to derive the optimal tax rules that

should guide a benevolent and politically unconstrained government, we also need

a firmer base for prescribing piecemeal improvements when tax policy is

restricted by suboptimal constraints.2 For example, if political constraints

make it impossible to tax the implicit Income on owner-occupied housing, should

other types of capital income still be taxed at equal rates with the aim of

assuring production •ffici.ncy in the rest of the economy? If not, what

principle should guide the relative tax rates on the other types of capital

income?

        There has been surprisingly little attention to the issue of second best

factor taxation in general or to the second best differential taxation of

capital income in particular. The one noticeable exception is an important but

little heeded paper by Auerbach (1979) in which he shows that in general it Is

not optimal to tax all types of capital equally if some other condition of

optimal fiscal policy is not satisfied. Auerbech analyzes two significant cases

in which different types of capital should be taxed at different rates: first,

when the government does not have the instruments needed to   bring the economy    to

the golden rule level of capital intensity3 and second, when the tax rate on
labor   Income is   not set optimally.
      Auerbach's analysis assumes that the government is free to set an optimal
tax   rate on each kind of capital income. His results are therefore not directly



      20n the equal theory of piecemeal reform, see Bruno (1972) and Guesnerie
(1977).

    3This is described by Auerbach and others as a limitation on government
debt activity although in reality the necessary level of the government debt
would be negative. That Is, the government would have to be a creditor to
increase the nation's total capital stock to the golden rule level.

 relevant to the question of how capital tax rates should be set when

 owner-occupied housing or interest on state and local government securities Is

 untaxed or corporate capital is subject to an additional tax. When such

constraints are Imposed, how should the tax rates be set on capital invested in

different sectors or in different types of capital assets? When investment in

owner-occupied residences is untaxed, should business investment in housing be

taxed   at   the same rate as all other types of business investment? When

structures used for owner-occupied housing bear no tax, should other structures

be taxed at the same rate as equipment and inventories? Several studies of the

inefficiency of existing tax rules4 assume that the answer to these and other

such questions is yes. The present paper will show that the opposite is true.

     The analysis here is related to the studies of second-best excise taxation

(see Green, 1961 and Atkinson and Stiglitz, 1980). In his classic study, Green

(1961) derived the optimal tax rates on n-i consumer goods when the tax rate on

the n-th good Is constrained to be some arbitrary value. Since the

government In Green's analysis can also use lump-sum taxes and transfers, the

optimal tax rates on all n goods would be zero if there were no constraint.

Green showed that the constraint implies that the remaining n-i tax rates

should not be equal but should differ according to the complementarity or

substitutability of the goods with leisure and with the n-th good. When the

government does not have a lump sum tax as an option, the unconstrained

optimum for the n tax rates (or for any available subset of rates) satisfies



    4Auerbach's (1983) analysis of the welfare cost of the differential
taxation of different types of business capital ignores his own earlier
conclusions about the inappropriateness of taxin9 all capital equally when the
economy is not at the golden rule level of capital intensity. See also
Fullerton and Henderson (1984) and U.S. Treasury (1984,1985).

the rules derived by Ramsey (1927), Diamond and Hirrlees (1971) and others.

        In the present paper, I look at the problem of setting optimal tax rates on

n—i types of capital Income when               the   tax rate on the n-th type     of   capital Income

Is arbitrarily set equal           to   zero. To focus on the optimal allocation of the

capital stock, I Ignore the problem of labor supply and intertemporal capital

accumulation.5 I assume fixed supplies of labor and capital and a fixed amount

of tax that must be raised by taxing capital income.                     In   this context, if all

tax rates could be set optimally, it would be optimal to tax all types of

capital equally. The analysis shows                  that   constraining the tax rate on one type

of capital to be zero implies that in general the other tax rates should no

longer be equal. An explicit expression for those tax rates is derived end

interpreted.



1.      OptImal Tax Rates on Capital Income

        The economy produces aggregate output (X) using three types of capital

p5.'    K,   and 1(3) and labor (1) according to the production function


(1.1)     X —
                F(K1, 2' K3 1).

Labor income is untaxed and the government must raise total revenue R by

taxing the three types        of   capital income.          If   all types of capital income can

be taxed,    the   government's budget constraint is


          R —            +              +
(1.2)           ttFiKI       t2F2Kt         t3F3K3


    5Thls focus is essentially the same adopted by Auerbach (1983), King and
Fullerton (1984), Fullerton and Henderson (1984), and the U.S. Treasury
(1984,1985) in their analyses of existing tax distortions.

where F1 is the marginal product of capital of type i.

             Private investors will allocate the fixed stock of capital (K) among

the three uses to equalize the after tax rates of return. Thus:

(1.3)        (1—t1)F1 — (1—t2)F2

and

(1.4)        (1—t1)F1 • (1—t3)F3.

        The government's proble.            is   to set tax rates to maximize aggregate output

subject to the government's budget constraint and the constraint that the

available capital will be allocated by investors to equalize net rates of

return. It is immediately clear that the government can achieve this by

setting all tax rates equal. With t1                           t3, the net return equalization
                                                       t2
(equations 1.3 and 1.4) Implies that gross returns are also equal:

F1      F2     F3. Since F1 — F2 - F3 Is the condition for maximizing output In the
absence of a government budget constraint, the government achieves the

first—best allocation by setting all tax rates equal. This is not at all

surprising since with total capital fixed this is equivalent to a lump—sum tax

on capital Income.

        Consider now the more general and realistic second-best problem in which

one of the tax rates Is arbitrarily fixed. Specifically, let t1                     0. What is

the optimal relation between t2 and

        The government's problem is to maximize the Lagranglan expression:


(1.5)        Z —                   +                       +
                   F(K1,K2,K3PL)       A(K1+K2+K3-K)           p(t2F2K2+t3F3K3-R)

subject to the further constraint that the investors will equalize after tax

rates of return. With t1 —             0,   these extra constraints Imply F1 —
                                                                                    (1-t2)F2   and
                                                    —6-


F1 —     (1-t3)F3.      These conditions can be used to rewrite 1.5 without t2 and

t3 since they Imply that t2F2 — F2 - F1 and t3F3 — F3 - F1.                         Thus the

government's problem is to maximize


(1.6)         Z —                    +                                           -             R].
                      F(K1,K2K3,L)       A(K1+K2+K3-k) +.z((F2—F1)K2 + (F3—F1)K3

        Although the government does          not   control the allocation of capital

directly, the choice of t2 and t3 uniquely determines                            and 1(3. The

government's proble. can therefore be solved by choosing the values of

      and K3 that maxImize (1.6) and then noting the implications for t2 and t3.

The three first order conditions are:

(1.7)        F1 + A + p[K2(F21—F11) + K3(F31—F11)] —                0,

(1.8)        F2 + A + p((F2—F1) + K2(F22—F12)             +                   — 0,
                                                               K3(F32—F12)]
and
(1.9)        F3 + A + p[K2(F23—F13) + (F3—F1) + K3(F33—F13)]                    0

        Using equation 1.7 to eliminate A from (1.8) and (1.9) and noting again

that F2 —         —                    —
             F1       t2F2 and F3 — F1   t3F3 yields:

(1.10)       (1+,.Ot2F2 —                                 +
                              M((F11+F22—2F12)K2              (F11+F32—F31—F12)K3]
and

(1.11)       (1+p)t3F3 — —p[(F11+F23—F13—F21)K2 +
                                                  (F33+F11—2F13)K3]

The optimal ratio of t2 to t3 therefore satisfies:


             t2            (F11+F22—2F12)K2 + (F11+F32—F31—F12)K3
(1.12)          * F3
                                               +
             t3   F2       (F11+F32—F31—F12)K2    (F11+F33—2F13)K3

2.      InterpretinQ the Second Best Optimum Conditions

        It is immediately          clear     that the second-best tax       rates   on the two types

of taxable capital will not In general be equal. To interpret (1.12), It Is

useful to begin with the simplest case in which the marginal product of each

type of    capital does        not depend on       the   amounts   of the   other types of capital

in   use, i.e., F 0 for i                    j.   The more general case in which the different

types of capital may           be substitutes or complements will be considered in the
next    section.
        If F1   0, for i *          j,    equation (1.12) becOmes:

             tF3 F11(K2+K3)                       32K2
(2.1)
                3        2     11 2 3             333
        Two special cases will point the way to the general implications of this

equation. Consider first the case in which the marginal product of the

untaxed capital Is constant, i.e., F11 —                   0.   EquatIon (2.1) then Immediately

implies

                                         —
                                             (aK2/aF2)F2/K2
                                                                as the elasticity along the

production function of type 2 capital with respect to its own marginal

product, equation (2.2) yields the familiar Inverse elasticity formula:

            t2 — £33
(2.3)
             3    22

This rule tells us to tax capital incomes of type 2 and 3 in a ratio which is

the inverse of the responsiveness of the two capital stocks to changes in the
marginal product of capital.

        A second interpretation of (2.3) is also familiar from the theory of

Ramsey tax rules: flaw taxes on capital incomes of type 2 and 3 should be

levied in a ratio that causes the two capital stocks to shrink in the same

proportion. To see this note that (2.3) can be rewritten as

             dK2   F2             dK3         F3
(2.4)
               2     2               3         3

Since F1 —
              (1—t2)F2 is a condition of investor equilibrium and we are
studying the special case of F11 —                 0,   a change in t2 causes

dF2 —   -F2dt2/(1-t2).       A new small tax (i.e., approximately dt2 —              at t2 — 0)
                                                                                t2
therefore implies dF2            -F2t2. Substituting into (2.4) shows

             1 ôK2                - 1
(2.5)        -—2 j—2   •
                           dF2      — — dF3.
                                        33
The optimum conditions of (2.4) thus imply equiproportlonate decreases in

K2 and K3.

     Why does F11 —        0 imply these results? With F11 — 0, the reduced capital
in K2 and K3 can be absorbed as increased K1 with constant productive value,

F1. The entire welfare loss therefore arises because each successive unit of

K2 and K3 has a greater value. The tax rates t2 end t3 must therefore be set

so that K2 and K3 are reduced            in   a mix that minimizes the aggregate loss.

This requires taxing more heavily the capital for which any given tax induces

a smaller reduction in the type of capital. The exact balancing is expressed

by the inverse elasticity rule of (2.4).

    Return now to the first order condition of (1.13) end, instead of
                                      -9—


assuming F11 — 0, consIder the opposite special case in which —F11 tends to

Infinity. As —F11 Increases, the values of F22 and F33 become relatively less

important as determinants of the optimal tax ratio and t2/t3 tends to F3/F2.

In the limit, t2/t3 — F3/F2 or t2F2 — t3F3. Combining this optimum condition

on the tax rates with the investors' equilibrium condition that

(1—t2)F2 — (1-t3)F3 implies that F2    F3 and therefore that t2 — t3. So in

this limiting case it is optimal to tax all of the taxable types of capital

income equally. The reason for this is easy to see. In the limiting case In

which —F11 is infinite, the investor equilibrium that F1 — (1—t2)F2 implies

that K1 cannot change at all (since any finite change in K1 would cause an

infinite change in F1). With K1 fixed, the total K2 +
                                                        K3
                                                              is also fixed. The

optimum allocation of a fixed total amount of capital between two different

uses requires equal marginal products In both uses (F2 — F3) and therefore

equal tax rates. Thus, with the capital in the untaxed sector fixed in

quantity and with a separable production technology, the untaxed sector

becomes irrelevant and the problem becomes equivalent to a first—best taxation

question for the taxable sectors of the economy.

     Between the two extremes of F11 — 0 and —F11 — ,   the   relative tax rates

vary monotonically from the inverse elasticity condition of equation (2.3)

when F11 — 0 to the equality of tax rates when -F11   co.6 To see this, note

that (2.1) can be rewritten using F1 — (1—t2)F2    (1—t3)F3 as:

their relative magnitudes.

 3.    Substitutes and Complements in Production

       The simple optimal tax formula of equation (2.1) and the conclusion that

 the ratio of the tax rates on the taxable sources of capital income lies between

one and the inverse elasticity ratio depend on the simplifying assumption that

the different types of capital are independent in production, i.e., F13 — 0 for

 I    3.   This   section of the paper analyzes how relaxing this assumption alters

the second best pattern of taxes.

      Note first that even with no restriction on           the two tax rates tend

toward equality as —F11 tends to infinity. This result, which is directly

apparent in equation (1.12), occurs for the same reason that it did in the

simpler context in which F13 — 0 for I * 3. At —F11 —        , K1   is effectively

constant and can therefore be ignored. The problem is then equivalent to

setting tax rates t2 and t3 as If K2 and K3 were the only types of capital. In

this context, with no restriction on the relevant tax rates, t2 and t3 should be

equalized.

      Nore generally, however, the sign and magnitude of the F13 terms influence

the optimal rates of tax on the two types of taxable capital Income. The

analysis in this section shows that the effect of a change in the production

function   cross-product terms, F12   and F13, can be decomposed into two

components,   a direct "allocation effect" and a secondary "budget     effect." The

direct "allocation effect" of a change in F12 or           on the optimal relative
                                                     F13
taxation of the two types of taxable capital income is unambiguous: the

relative tax rate on a partIcular type of capital rises if that type of capital

becomes more of a complement with the untaxed good and falls if that type of
                                            —12—


capital becomes more of a substitute with the untaxed capital. The Indirect

"budget effect" reflects the fact that a change In F12 or F13 alters the shadow

value of the government's budget constraint, gt. A change In p can either

reinforce the direct allocation effect or shift the optimal tax rates in the

opposite direction. This section derives the explicit expressions for the

allocation effect and the budget effect and discusses the conditions under which

they are reinforcing and those in which they are opposing. The section a1so

considers the implication of these results for two examples: the nontaxation of

housing end the differential taxation of equipment and structures.

        The basic results and the decomposition into allocation effects and budget

effects follows directly fro. equations (1.10) and (1.11). Dividing both sides

of these equations by 1 +       p and subtracting (1.11) from (1.10) yields an
expression for the difference between the tax per unit of type 2 capital

         t2F2) and the tax per unit of type 3 capital (03 —
                                                                  t3F3):

                                                       (F11+F32—F31—F12)(K3—K2)


                       —
                           (F33+F11—2F13)K3].

The derivative of this tax difference with respect to F12 is therefore



            d(02—:3)
(3.2)                      j—(K2+K3) +      (02_03)9fl
        The first term on the right side of equation (3.2) is unambiguously

positive since p Is the shadow cost of the government budget constraint and

therefore p >   0.     The second term reflects the effect of a change in the shadow
                                                 —13—


cost of the government budget constraint. Since It will be shown that

                        <   0, the sign of the "budget effect" Is the opposite of the sign
of 02 —      03   The Implications of this and the explicit derivation of

                    <   0 wIll be presented below. But first I derive the effect of a

change in F13.

        It follows immediately from (3.1) that

                                  1 K2.K3)
The direct allocation effect of an increase In F13 is to reduce 2 —                  This
                                                                                03
corresponds exactly to equation (3.2) sInce a decrease in              -
                                                                           03 means that
93 —    2    rises with F13.

        The economic interpretation of the direct allocation effect Is clear.

Consider first the effect of variations In F12. In comparison to the optimal               tax
rates when F12 a        . the     direct allocation effect implies that °2 rises relative

to 03 if type     2 capital       Is a complement to the untaxed type 1 capital.

Conversely, 2 falls relative to 03 if capital of types 1 and 2 are

substitutes (F12 <          0).   For example, if the three types of capital are owner

occupied housing (K1), rental housing (K2) and manufacturing capital (K3), It

is reasonable to posit F12 < 0 and F13 — F23 —          0.   Since owner-occupied

housing and rental housing are substitutes, the optimal tax on rental housing

is lower relative to the tax on manufacturing capital than it would be if

F12 a   0.   One way of stating the rationale for this is that a lower tax on

rental housing capital helps to balance the specific distortion in favor of

owner-occupied     housing.
                                               —14-


        As a second example, assume that the three types of capital are

manufacturing equipment (K1), manufacturing structures (K2), and housing (K3).

By assumption, let the effective tax rate on manufacturing equipment capital

be zero. It Is reasonable to posit that manufacturing structures and

equipment are complements In production (F12 >          0)   and that the contribution of

housing capital is independent of both (F13            F23
                                                              0). It now follows that

manufacturing structures should be taxed more heavily than housing capital

(relative to the optimal tax rates when F12 — 0 as well). A higher tax on

manufacturing structures raises the overall taxation on manufacturing capital

and thereby reduces the distortion that would otherwise exIst between the

manufacturing sector and the housing sector.

        It is clear from equation (3.2) and (3.3) that the direct allocation

effect of variations in F12 and F13 depends on the relative degrees of

cosplementarity and substitutability of K2 and K3 with K1. Combining these

two equations implies

(3.4)        d(82—93) —    j(K2+K3)(dF12—dF13)

                                 o   —e   a(u/l+u)JF


Thus, If d2 —              there is no direct allocation effect.
                   dF13,
        Consider now the effect that works through changes In i.         To be specific,

I will examine equation (3.2). The value of aut/1+p)/aF12 can be evaluated

from the budget constraint:

(3.5)       R =            +
                  t2F2K2       t3F3K3.

Using (1.10) and (1.11) to substitute for t2F2 and t3F3 yields

Since R must remain constant at the required level of revenue, it follows that

                                         aR/aF12

         Substituting this expression into (3.2) and writing R                    021(2 + 031(3   yields

the   effect of F12 on 02 -
                                      93 is ambiguous and depends on the relative
magnitudes of the tax rates and capital stocks.

       The   source of the ambiguity can be explained as follows: An increase in
F12 reduces the        output     loss associated with any given budget requirement

because the tax on               is to some extent also an indirect tax on the             untaxable

complement            In   the   extreme, if 2        and       had to be used in fixed

proportions, the inability to tax                    would be irrelevant      and the   tax rates on
K2 and 1(3 could be set to avoid any excess burden. This explains why

                  <   0.
       Equations (1.10) and (1.11) show that                      and 03 respOnd to variations in

t/(1+ji) with elasticities equal to one. For example, since equation (1.10)

can be written


(39)         2 — — 1NF11+F22—2F12)K2                  +
                                                          (F11+F32—F31—F12)K3],

It follows Immediately that

Thus If 02 —
                 03. a change In & does not alter that equality. But if 02 >03? a
decline in A causes            to decline by more than 03• Since the direct

allocation effect of an increase in F12 Is to raise 02 relative to 03. the

indirect effect that works through a reduction in z has an offsetting effect

                                                              <        the induced
if 02 is initially greater than 03• Conversely, if                O,
decline   in i   reduces 03 by more than       and therefore reinforces the direct

allocation effect of an increase in F12. The effects on 02 -                 of decreases
                                                                        03
in F12 and of variations in F13 can be explained in the same way.

     Although the optimal tax rates must in principle be evaluated explicitly

in each case, the expression for d(02-03)/dF12 in equation (3.8) suggests that

the direct allocation effect is likely to dominate the indirect budget effect.

That will not be true and d(02-03)/dF12 < 0 only if 03(K2+K3) +
                                                                (03-02)K2 (            0.
This requires not only that 02 > 03 but also that the tax that would be

collected if the lower of the two optimal tax rates were applied to the entire

capital stock (03(K2+K3)) be less than the extra tax collected on the

complementary stock by the differential tax rate ((02-03)K2]. Reversal of the

direct allocation effect therefore requires that the difference In the tax

rates (0203) must be larger than the lower of the tax rates ((02—03) >

and that this differential must be proportionately greater than the ratio of

the total taxable capital stock to the stock of the complementary capital:

           0203 >K2+K3
(3.11)
                 3         2

Although this inequality could in principle be satisfied, in general it would

not be and the direct allocation effect would dominate.
                                                 —17—



        A final word is appropriate about the effect of the production
interdependence of K2 and       1(3.
                                           It follows from (3.1) that


 3     2
              d(e2-e3)     -           —        (l+JA)    —        au/(1+p)


                               g.i(K2+K3)
                                                  (O2k283K3)
                           (1+p)(62K2+03K3)

Thus an increase in F23, the comple.entarity in production between the two

                                                   -
taxable types of capital, increases                    e3 if   more revenue is initially

collected from type 2 capital. The nature of this result is clear If we focus

on the effect of F23 on the two amounts of taxes collected (e2K2-e31(3)                    rather
than   the   two tax rates. Multiplying equation (1.10) by 2 and equation (1.11)

by 1(3 and subtracting (1.11) from (1.10) yields


(3.13)       e2K2 —         — - j[(F11+F22-2F12)K              —
                                                                    (F33+F11—2F13)K].

Since F23 does not appear on the righthand side of this equation, it follows

immediately that the degree of complementarity or substitutability between

     and 1(3 does not alter    the   optimal difference in taxes collected on these

two types    of capital.


4.     ConcludinQ Remarks

       This paper   has   emphasized that the       conventional view that       all tax   rates

should be set equal to each other must be modified in the very common situation
in which some tax rate is politically constrained to be                   at something other than
its optimal value. Although the present analysis has focused on                    the
                                         -18-

 implications    of not taxing one type of capital income,   the   results here could

 easily be extended to the case where one type of capital income is taxed at an

 arbitrary non—zero rate.

        It would be useful to extend the current analysis to explore the

 Implications    of the existence of a corporate inCome tax or the favorable tax

rates on extrective industries and on the capital used by state and local

governments. It would also be desirable to analyze en economy with more than

three   kinds   of capital so that two or more tax rates could be fixed arbitrarily.

       Three general "rules of thumb" type results emerged from the specific

analysis of the present paper. First, if the several types of capital can be

regarded as independent in production, the optimal tax rates on the taxable

types of capital Income should depart from equality in the direction of an

Inverse elasticity rule. Second, in comparison to these rates, capital that Is

a complement to the untaxed capital should generally be taxed more heavily while

capital that Is a substitute to the untaxed capital should be taxed less

heavily. Third, variations in the degree of complementarity or substitutability

between the two types of taxed capital should alter    the two      tax rates in a way

that   maintains a constant difference in the total taxes on       each type of capital

Income.

       Although these rule-of-thumb results may help to modify the conventional

equal-tax-rates rule in an appropriate way, it is important to recognize that

they are only rough approximations to the optimal second best taxation of

capital. Perhaps the most Important implication of the present anlaysis is that

any departure from optimal capital taxation makes it very difficult to set other

capital tax rates optimally. That is a further reason for seeking to overcome
                                     -19-


political constraints that prevent setting all tax rates optimally. But as long

as such political constraints remain, economists should recognize the limitation

of the simple equal-tax-rates rule and should try to point to the optimal

second-best differential taxation of capital income.
