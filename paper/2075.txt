                    How Integrated are World Capital Markets?

                                   Some New Tests




                                      ABSTRACT




     This   paper presents   some new emprcal EV] dence on tha extent of
world capital—market   ntegration.   The first set of   tests carrie out
uses data from different countries to compare internationally expected
marginal rates of substitution between consumption on i+4erent dates.
If residents of different countries have access to a nominally risk-+ree
bond denominated in dollars, say, their common expected marginal rate of
substitution of future for present dollars should equal the gross
nominal return on dollar bonds. Tests of the international equality of
expected marginal substitution rates yield evidence conslster!t with a
substantial degree of international capital—market integration after,
but not before, 1973. These tests are naturally based on a carticular
model of intertemporal consumption choice, but direct estimation of the
inter—country relationships implied by that model lends support to its
assumptions. These last findings are relevant to the current debate in
macroeconomics about the role of interteinporal substitution. The second
set of tests conducted in this paper concerns correlations oetween
countries' saving and investment rates. For a sample of ten countries,
correlations between annual changes in saving and investment rates over
the period 1948—1984 look q.uite similar to those those found in quar-
terly data. Surprisingly, however, the correlation coefficients are
often lower before the mid—1960s than afterward This finding throws
further doubt on the interpretation of saving—investment correlation
coefficients as structural parameters reflecting the reponse of domestic
investment to shifts in national saving.

     The vicissitudes of the international capital market are a recur—

rino these in the work of Carlo; Din Alejandro. Simple microeconomic

theory shows how internationally integrated financial markets can is—

Drove global resource allocation by channeling the world flow of saving

toward its most productive uses. A major message of Diaz's work;

however, is that a realistic analysis of the international capital

market must contend with the influence of factors that sometimes are

difficult to model formally: moral hazards, political pressures, and

even shifts •in the prevailing paradigms of economic science. Over more

than a century and a half, all of these factors have helped produce a

series of booms and busts in international financial intermediation.

     The booming world capital market of the five decades ended by World

War I provides a benchmark against which economists have often measured

the adequacy of contemporary international capital flows. In that golden

age, the market effected a continuing and substantial resource transfer

from developed to developing countries in spite of occasional reverses.1

The post—1945 world capital market appears to have been less vigorous on

the whole. Only after the early 1970s did international lending expand

to levels comparable with those of the pre—1914 period. And since the

early 1980s, the net resource transfer to developing countries has

stopped and a widespread default on foreign debts has been averted (so




   Evidence on the absence of arbitrage opportunities between sijor
   financial centers also supports the view of a smoothly functioning
   world capital market in the decades before 1914. See, for example,

far) only throuoh the constant involvement of official financial

agencies.

     One important indicator of the contrast between the pre—1914 and

post—1945 capital markets has been the average magnitude of countries

current—account imbalances in the latter period. The current account

surplus, as the difference between a countrys overall saving anu its

domestic Investment, shows the amount of domestic savings being invested

abroad——or, in the case of a deficit, the amount of foreign savings

being borrowed to finance domestic investment. In 1965, countries class-

ified by the World Bank as middle—income oil importers financed a mere 5

percent of their domestic Investment by drawing on foreign savings. The

figure rose to 7.6 percent in 1973 and to 15.4 percent by 1980, but

dropped sharply after 1982.2 Compare these figures with the one—third to

one—half of Argentine investment that Dlaz (1970, p. 31 reckoned was

financed by foreign capital in the years 1880—1914! For developed

countries in the postwar era, current accounts have tended to be even

smaller (as a percentage of SlIP) than for industrializing countries. The

recent United States current—account deficit, which in 1985 amounted to

nearly 18 percent of U.S. domestic investment, is an extreme outlier in

this repect.

     The fact that current accounts have on the whole been so small

since 1945 is a major puzzle for economists hoping to apply open—economy

theory to open—economy policy problems. Our predictions about specific

policy measures, however, depend crucially on whether the limited net

capital flows we observe reflect an efficient global resource alloca-

tion, given countries preferences and intertemooral transformation

            In   an earl   i   or paper i983     i surveyed two eportant aporoaches

taken in trio empirical literature on world capital—market inteqration.

The fIrst of toose approaches attempts                   to compare the returns avallobi e

on        assets located in        different   countries. Because asset returns are
inherently          uncertain the         conclusions drawn from an international com-
parison          of asset returns inevitably rest on an assumed model of the

pricinq of risk. To avoid takinq a stand on the appropriate asset—

pricinq model, my earlier paper restricted its discussion to assets

whose returns would be the same in all states of nature in a                     world of
perfectly          integrated capital markets. Evidence on trie Interest paid by

onshore and offshore deposits denominated in the same currency seemed to

me consistent with a high degree of international capital mobility.

            The second empirical approach I reviewed is based on a direct

comparison of divergences between countries saving and investment

rates. This second approach, due to Feldstein and Horioka (1980) and

Feldstein (1983),               argues   that the small size of average current accounts

over long periods is indeed evidence that sizable barriers impede the

free international movement of capital. I suggested that this inter-

pretation of the data suffers from potentially serious identification

problems, and presented quarterly time—series evidence with implIcations

apparently different from those Feldstein and Hc.rioka drew from their




     -t

          Researchers who have attempted to model risk explicitly have reached
          differing conclusions. Two recent examples are the papers of wheat-
          ley (1985) and Jorion and Schwartz (1986).

        ibIs   paper develops additional evidence or the integration of world

c.apta1 markets. fhe first set of tests I carry out IS based on an

international comparison of marginal rates of substitution between

consumption on di++erent dates. If residents of two countries have

access to a nominally risk—free bond denominated in dollars say, their

common expected marQinal rate of substitution of future for present

dollars should equal the oross nominal return on dollar bonds. Tests of

                I. A Test of World Capital—Market Integration



     Recent work in finance and macroeconomics has drawn on consumption—

based models of asset pricing developed by Breeden (1919), Lucas (1978),

and others. These models extend to a stochastic setting Irving Fisher's

i193OJ celebrated account of intertemporal consumption choice under

certainty. In the equilibria of the stochastic models, the joint dis-

tributions of asset returns and individual consumption satisfy condi—

tion that generalizes Fisher's equality between marginal rates of inter—

temporal substitution in consumption and a relative interteeporal price.

     Suppose that a typical consumer maximizes

subject    to budget constraints, where Et(.} is a conditional expectation

based on time—t information, P < 1 is a subjective discount factor, c,

is consumption on date t, and the period utility function LU.) is

strictly concave and differentiable. Then if Rt+i denotes the (possibly

ranøo.i real time—(t+1) payoff on any asset relative to its real pur-

chase price on date t, individual maximization forces the consumer's

contingency plan for future consumotlon to obey the expected marlinal

equality

Under the rational expectations assumption, equations (5) and (6)

provide the testable predictions about consumption, price—level, and

exchangerate movements that underlie the statistical tests carried out

in this section and the next one.5

       Before going on to assume the additional restrictions needed to

infer testable implications from (5) and (6), I want to sake two points




    I am assuming that domestic and foreign agents have identical infor-
    mation sets. (Clearly, nominal interest rates at which bath sets of
    residents can transact are common information.) The tests carried
    out below do not require this assumption provided they are based on
    common lagged information. Interest taxes are ignored. This omission
    should have little effect on the tests if tax rates are similar
    across countries.
                                                  U



about triese        relationships.    First! if the interest rates in equations (5)

and    o      are offered by asset; issued in the same location (for example,

if    they are London Eurocurrency            deposit rates), the model yields expres-

sions for the forward foreign—exchange premium, which i related to the

nominal interest—rate differential               through   covered interest parity. The

interteuiporal consumption allocation conditions have been used in this

way by Hansen and Hodrick i9B3:, Mark (19g5), Campbell and Clarida

(I9) and Cumby (196) in attempt; to model forward premia. In my 19B6

caper. I observed that tests which do not involve assets located in

different political or regulatory jurisdictions are uninformative about

capital mobility between countries. Nonetheless, the same basic

theoretical framework can throw light on questions about international

capital mobility f they are used to compare consumption paths in dif—

+erent countries. The marginal equalities in (5) and (6) do not require

any particular location for the assets being considered, but they do

require      that   residents of     different   countries be able to trade the seine

asset,

             second point about euuations (5          and 4i is   that   they are not

based    on any as;uepton of purchaslnq power              parity or perfect goods—

        To   ieolement        and    63 empirically, however,      two   ;tronq as;ufip-
t ons must now        be   made. First it      is assumed that consumers in macn

assumption one other than tne absence of practical alternatives. The

next section provides partial evidence that the data are consistent with

       The assumptions just made, together with (5) and (6), lead to the

bond—market segmentation are likely to change only gradually over time,

I follow the sefficient_marketsu tradition of testing whether past

discrepancies in marginal substitution rates help forecast future dis-

       The data used were quarterly series drawn from the International

capita consumption series were defined as nominal consumption divided by

population and deflated by the consumer price index (CPI). Price levels

are CPIs and exchange rates are quarterly averages. Over a grid of ten m

values ranging from u = 0.5 to m =              25.0,   these data were used to con-

can be rejected at the 10 percent significance level or below. Since u

values of 7 or greater are Implausibly high. the tests seem to indicate

that over the entire period since 1962:11, expected intertemporal mar-

ginal substitution rates for dollars and deutschemarks have no been the

same in the United States and Bermany.

     The results for the U.S. and Japan show an even stronger rejection

of the null hypotheses over the sample period as a whole. Except for the

implausible cases a = 12 and 25, both H0 and H are always rejected at

the 5 percent level or below.

     It is unlikely that the entire sample period studied in Tables 1

and 2 Is structurally homogeneous. In particular, the International

capital.market has expended dramatically since the early 1970s, when a

marked liberalization of industrial—country capital markets began.8 One

possible explanation of the rejections is that they reflect the in-

fluence of the earlier observations, which come from a period when

international financial markets seem to have been less Interdependent

than they are today.

     To check this possibility, I split the sample at 1973.1 and con-

ducted separate tests for the resulting subsamples. The results are

reported in Tables 3 (United States—Sermany) and 4 (United States—

Japan). The striking feature of the results in Table 3 is that for all

values of the inverse intertemporal substitution elasticity, the null

hypotheses is always rejected at lower significance levels in the first

subsample than in the second. This finding is consistent with the

hypothesis that capital—market integration has increased since the early

1970s. In most cases, however, rejection of the null hypotheses In the

        iris   subsample tests comparino the United States and Japan tell a

somewhat stronger story. Table 4 reports that for the period annng in

1972lV, both null hypotheses are rejected at extremely low significance

levels (which in most cases are essentially zero). Nonetheless, the

sqnitcance levels of the test statistics are all extremely high for the

period beginning in l973l. The results suggest that in the recent

period, U.S. and Japanese consumption have behaved as if residents of

the two countries had access to the same risk—free borrowing and lending

opportunities in both dollars and yen. This was decidedly not the case

before the early 1970s.

        nother interpretation of the results comes -from the fact that the

ex post internationci differences between marginal rates of substitution

become substantially more variable after 1973. Gn this interpretation,

the higher test significance levels -found in the second subsample

reflect a drop in the tests power caused by additional noise in the

data, not an increase in world capital—market integration. In principle,

this ambiguity can be resolved in the 4uture when more data are avail-

able.




                                   II.   Discussion


        Some important caveats apply to the interpretation of the previous

sections results

        1. The consumptIon series I have used include expenditure on
                                      14



durable goods. Host recent studies of consumption use either expenditure

on non—durables or expenditure on non—durables plus services. Both of

these measures are only partial measures of consumption: implicit (or

explicit) in the use of these measures Is the arbitrary assumption that

the excluded portion of consumption enters the utility function in a

separable manner. As Mankiw, Rotemberg, and Summers (1985) argue,

however, the separability assumption is implausible. Since some degree

of mlsspecificatlon seems likely no matter what consumption measure is

chosen, results based on the consumption measure utilized above are of

Interest. Future research should examine the sensitivity of the results

to alternative consumption proxies.

     2. Available published consumption data are seasonally adjusted.

The first—order Euler condition (2) from which the tests are derived,

however, applies to seasonally unadjusted data. Miron (1985) has con-

structed seasonally unadjusted data for U.S. consumption and shown that

the estimation of equations like (2) may be quite sensitive to the use

of seasonal prefilters.9 The tests in this paper, however, are based on

data In the form of Inter—country differences. This may reduce the bias

due to deseasonalization, particularly if deseasonalization practices

are similar across countries.

     3. The theory underlying equation (2) assumes that consumption is

uniform over the time period beginning on date t, with the consumption

decision made at the beginning of t and all variables dated t in the

consumers time—t information set. In reality, the data used are quar-

terly averages, so measured consumption over the quarter starting on

date t Incorporates Information that accrues between dates t and t+1.



   Singleton (1986) gives a useful theoretical discussion of the effect
   of prefiltering in estimating Euler-equation models.

efficiency. At the very icast, shifting conditional distribution; will

induce conditonai heteroscedasticity into estimation problems, and

econometric technique should take                 this   feature of the data into account.

Although Cumby and          I (1984)   present evidence of conditional heteros—

cedasticity in data on exchange rates, interest rates, and prices, the

estimates in the present paper assume the problem is                      unimportant.
Clearly, future work will have to check on the validity of                      that     assump-

tion.

         A    more fundamental question is whether the model underlying the

tests        in   this section has any claim to empirical validity. Because the

tests        are joint tests of certain        propositions about capital mobility and

a     particular model of consumer behavior,              test results have     no implica-
tions about capital mobility if               the model is wrong.     It is therefore

important to examine         independent      evidence on the adequacy of equations

(1)     and (2) as descriptions        of    economic behavior in the real world.
         Much of the evidence on this question is              discouraging. Studies of

U.S. consumption by Hansen and Singleton (1982) and by Mankiw, Rotem—

berg,        and Summers (1985) reject the model in many            cases,   often obtaininp

negative point estimates of            the    intertemporal elasticity coefficient e.

Mark     (1985) obtains estimates of          m   which, while positive, are        in   most
cases imprecIsely                  measured and iniplaus].biy       high.
            Some countervailinq considerations sungest, however, that complete

abandonment of the model qiven by (1) and (2) may be premature. In the

study mentioned above, Miron (1985) finds that the model cannot be

rejected for U.S. data if seasonally unadjusted data are used. As I

suoqested earlier, estimates such as those in the present paper, which

are based on inter—country differences, may be less sensitive to

problems of                  seasonality.   In addition, tests of Euler conditions that use

data from only a sng1e country must find appropriate data series on

rates of return. Some researchers, such as Summers (19B4), suggest that

this        is a major           difficulty.

                Several studies point to liquidity constraints as a possible cause

of deviations from (2) in the aggregate. Zeldes (1985), for example,

analyzes data from the Michigan Panel Study on Income Dynamics and finds

that tfle Euler condition is rejected for families with low ratios of

linuid wealth to income, but not for the others. From that finding, and

from direct estimates of the Lagrange multipliers associated with bind-

ing borrowing limits, he concludes that liquidity constraints may lie

hehind           the rejections of (2)          by    U.S. aggregate     data.. International

synchronization                  of monetary conditions could           give rise to; high posi-

tive correlation between the fractions                          of households that are    liquidity

constrained in different                    countries.    In this case,     aggregate tests com-

               iii. Cross—Country Tests of the Consumption Model



         test of the consumption model used in section I can be based on

equations (7) and (8. To derive readily estmab1e equations, I follow

Hansen and Hodrick (1983), Hansen and Singleton (1983) • and Hall (1985)

in assuming that per capita consumption levels, price levels, and the

exchange rate are lonormally distributed in equilibrium, that is, that

the natural loqarthms of these variables are normally distributed. No

attempt will be made to write down a general—equilibrium model that

explicitly derives a lognorinal dIstribution for these endoqenaus vari-

ables from the dstrhutions of the exogenous van ables.

       Denoting by lower—case letters natural logarithms of the cor-

responding upper—case variables, I assume that tfle vector

          =
                                                    is


is generated by the attoregressive process

         CI —                 =        +
                A(L)]vt           A0
where I is the 5 x 5 identity matrix, A0 is a 5 x 5matrix of constants,

and AlL) is a polynomial in positive powers of the lag operator L. A

lognorsal model results from assuming that the vector p of disturbances

is covariance stationary and normally distributed. Thus, the conditional

mean of             may vary over time, but because                is distributed idepen—

dently of the information set at_I =                                         the covariance

matrix of               conditional on at_i is a time—independent constant matrix.

        The restricted information set a is a subset of the broader infor-

mation available to agents In the economy. Let Etc.) denote a condi-

tional expectation with respect to the restricted information set, that

s, EJ = Ec.$at.                   Then equations (7) and (8) continue to hold if

Etc.) is replaced everywhere by Etc.).

        For the empirical exercise of this section, I drop the assumption

that i       = at   so that It can be tested against the data.1° If the

restricted expectations operator is applied to (7), the equation that

results is therefore

         1                                  I                *               *

                                           ECexC—u*act11—axt,1—sp41i).

where a      =I     —   L.   Lognormality now implies that (ii) can be written as


        exPcEc—sact+1              aP+i) + V{—uac+1 —            hPt+i)'2]

where Y(.) is a variance conditioned on a. As noted earlier, these




       The assumption p = at is also inessential at this point. Relaxing
       that assumption affects only the interpretation of the constant
       terms in the eouations estimated below.

conditional       variances are time—zndepenent constarts.   Define the   per—

centaqe     change in the real exchange rate of the hocne currency as

        =x    +   p* — p.

Then (12> implies

where       is a constant that depends on the time—independent conditional

covariances in (l).

       The economic intuition behind (13) is    standard. in a deterministic,
continuous—time analogue of the present model, the marginal utility of

consumption in each country grows at a proportional rate equal to the

difference between the rate of domestic time preference and the domestic

real interest rate. By interest parity, the international difference

between home and foreign real interest rates is the percentage change in

the real exchange rate, q. Thus, the difference between the derivatives

(dc/dt) and *(dc*/dt) is dq/dt plus a constant reflecting any interna-

tional time—preference difference. Equation (13) is the same condition

in expectation, adjusted by a constant risk premium.

       Equation (13) must be expressed in terms of observables before it

can be estimated. Define the expectational errors


        q -—
             = ct+1    -
                           Et{c+1),

   Of course, if (8) also holds, it can be used to derive an equation
   that differs from (13) only because of a different constant term,
   *. The condition w =         * is,
                                however, an equilibrium condition c'f
   the model if (7) and (8) both hold. This equality provides an addi-
   tional restriction on the model which should be tested in future
   war k.

properties of v imply that the parameters of (14) may be estimated by

instrumental variables, with variables in                          serving as instruments)

        In a multi-country framework, there are alsocross—equation

restrictions that can be tested as an additional check on the model.

Take the starred country in (14) to be the United States. Then for

German and Japan, (14) implies the relationships

rejected by the data the significance level of the ((1) test statistic

is .3a.

        The results are somewhat favorable for the model, but not com-

pletely so. For the United States and Japan, the parameter estimates are

of reasonable magnitude and quite significant. They are roughly corsis—

tent with the magnitudes found b Hansen and Singleton (1953), who also

used a logarithmic specHication but estimated Euler equations like (2)

jointl with consumers linear forecasting equations. in addition, the

key    cross—equation restriction implied by                               the model appears consistent

with the data. The estimated interte.crporai substitution parameter for

sermary is negative, however implylng a convex utillty function. Evn

though the German estimate is insignificant, its incorrect sign is

troubl    ns.

        In light of the tests carried out in section 1, it is of interest
to    test the restriction a.US               = m_ = a, that was assumed there. The

restriction         cars be rejected at tne 2.5 percent significance level.

       A problem with the foregoing results arose already in section 1: we

have good       reasons for oel ievins. that thE structure of world captai
markets changed dramatically after the eariy                                  lQ7Os.   This structural
                                           22


change say be behind the model's uneven empirical performance, so it is

informative once again to split the sample and perform separate sub-

sample tests.

      Estimation over the subsample 1961:1 — 1972:IV yields the estimates


      I   = 0.897,     ,     0.175,             a .0.067
            (0.501)          (0.301)                (0.242)


when the cross—equation restriction is imposed. The significance level

of the test statistic for those restrictions is .721. The parameters are

all correctly signed, but smaller and less significant than those found

over the complete sample. These characteristics of the estimates is

unsurprising in view of the low variability of real exchange rates over

the first subsample period compared to the second. The restriction that

all the a's are equal cannot be rejected for this sample; the point

estimate for the common value of a is 0.244, and its standard error is

0. 164.


      When the model is estimated over 1973:1—1985:11 the results are


             2.254 ,       = 0.804     ,
                                                a = (0.611)
                                                     1.086;
            (1.015)         (1.306)


the cross—equation restriction cannot be rejected. (The significance

level for the test statistic is .759.) These results are closer to the

full—sample results, except that the German preference parameter is

correctly signed. The parameter estimate is, however, insignificantly

different from zero. The 123 test statistic for the hypothesis that

all the a's are equal has a significance level of .693, so that

hypothesis appears to fit the data. The estimate of a under this

restriction is 1.240, with a standard error of 0.523. On the whole, the

results from subsample two support the model, as well as the interna—
tlonal equality   of intertemporal substitution elasticities that as

assumed in section 1.

     As noted in the last section Hall (1985) has arqued that the time

aggregation problem inherent in existing consumption data.. nay bias

results such as those reported above. He sugqests laqginq instruments an

additional period, and shows that the results of Hansen and Singleton

(1983) are quite sensitive to the timinq of the instrument set. To check

whether the time—aggregation issue raised by Hall has an important

impact on the results, I now discuss estimates in which the first laq of

each instrument used is omitted. Thus, the estimates below are based on

an instrument set containing only a constant and the second and third

lags of qDM/$, Aq'! AcUS, Ac6, and Ac. The results are summarized in

Table 5.

     The full—sample results are quite similar to those found using the

original set of instrumental variables. Because of probable structural

shifts, however, the subsample findings are of greater interest. For the

I961I—1972IV sample, the model appears to break down completely when

the instruments are changed. 11 coefficients are incorrectly signed,

quite insignificant, and small in absolute value. Once again however.

these results are to be expected in light of the relatively low capital—

market integration and real exchange rate variability of the period.

     The results for the second subsample, 1973:I—1985:IU are similar

to those found with the original instrument set. The main differences

are that the point estimate for Germany is once again negative while tne

point estimate for Japan is substantially higher. The cross—equation

restriction easily fits the data, as does the restriction that tte three

ms are the same. The estimated common value of     is plausible, and the

estimate is significant at the 5 percent level.

       Taken as a whole1 the results pDint to the persistently insig-

nificant and frequently Incorrectly—signed 6erman preference parameter

as the model 's major empirical shortcoming. Another source of concern is

evidence of some serial correlation in the equation residuals. Even

thauqh the procedure suggested by Hall (1985) does not make a dramatic

difference for the parameter estimates, the timing problem Hall dis-
                                                                13
cusses may induce serial dependence in equation disturbances.        A more

detailed specification analysts is therefore needed before firm conslu—

sions can be drawn. Tentatively, however, it seems reasonable to view

the results of this section as generally supporting the model used to

construct the tests in section 1.

       A potential criticism of this view comes from the empirical litera-

ture on the determinants of forward foreign—exchange premia. As Hansen

and Hodrick (1983) showed, the lognormal model implies a constant ex-

pected return to forward speculation. Their empirical tests rejected the

resulting model of the forward premium. The evidence on conditional

heteroscedasticity reported by Cumby and me (1984) also contradicts

lognormality, as do Cumby's (1986) explicit estimates of forward—

exchange risk premla, which vary significantly over time.14 It is pos-

sible that the tests of this section are less sensitive to deviations

from lognarmality than tests using forward—market data. A closely re—




 13
      Hall's criticism also applies to the tests carried out in section 1.
      When those tests were re-run using regressions on lags two through
      nine of the dependent variable (rather than regressions on lags one
      through eight), the results were qualitatively the same. Not
      surprisingly, though, significance levels tended to be higher.
 14
      Fama (1984) and Hodrick and Srivastava (1986) report additional test
      results showing the variability of risk premia. Some Indirect
      evidence comes from Hansen and Singleton (1983, pp. 262—264), who
      are able to reject a lognormal model in the closed—economy U.S.
      context.

 IV. More on the Correlation between Saving Rates and Investment Rates


         In my 1986 paper          reported time—series estimates, for several

countries, of       the correlation between quarter—to—Quarter changes in
saving and investment rates. The sample period ran from around 1960                        to
the early 1980s.       Those results were compared with the cross—sectional

findings reported by Feldstein and Horioka (1980) and Feidotein (1983)

I argued strongly 10 the paper that serious identification problems make

it difficult       to interpret saving—investment correlations as unambiguous

evidence about capital mobility either in a time—series cr cross—

sectional context. Nonetheless., the pattern of time—series correlations

I found in the quarterly data seemed to me                inconsistent      with the

Feldstein—Horioka conclusion that capital is                  essentially    immobile in

some long—term sense.

         10   this sectIon 1 extend        my   earlIer work by   presenting time—seraes

estimates       of correlations between annual changes in savinq and invest-
ment rates. There are four reasons why tests based on annual data are 0+
interest. First use of annual data a! lows me to expand the sample cf
coLtntrl es and the sample period of the test. Second, annual data may be
more reiable than quarterly            data, which     are often based      on interpola—

tI on   and otrer aporoximate procedures-. lhrd , annual data are not sub—
ject to seasonality.       Fourth   short—term capital movements that are

essentially self-reversino such as trade credits) should be less impor-

tant in annual than jr quarterly data. Thus, calculations based or

annual   data say come closer to addressing the issues of 1onterm

capital mobility       that Feldstezn   and Horioka see-n to have in mIRd

     The data I use are nominal yearly national account data from the

International Financial Statistics data tape. Saving, 5,         is   defined as

gross national product (GNP) minus private pius qoverament consumption.

Investment, ,     is   gross fixed capital formation plus the chanqe in

stocks.'5 The correlations computed are those between (S/6NF) and

(I/6NP.L, where        is now an annual first difference.

     Table 6 reports the estimated correlation coefficients between

year—to—year changes in the saving rate and the investment rate for ten

countries. The sample period runs from around 1950 to 1984 in most

cases, and because structural homogeneity is unlikely over such a long

time span, I have split the sample period at 1967. The standard errors

of these coefficients were calculated using the spectral estimator

described in Obstfeld (1986k.

     Two major empirical regularities seemed to emerge from my earlier

quarterly estimates First, the estimated correlation coefficient r51

between (S/8NF) and L(iJ6NP} seemed positively related to country size,

and was statistically insignificant for some small countries and sample

periods. Second! r51 fell for all but one country between the 1960—1972

period and the period beginning in 1973, 1 noted that the first

regularity was consistent with a high degree of world capital—market



   Sovernment consumption includes government investment in the U.S.
   data, while in the other countries government investment is included
   in I. When the alternative accounting convention was applied to the
   U.S., however, the estimation results were virtually the same.

integration because of the greater ability of larger countries to In-

fluence world interest rates. The second reqularity seemed consistent

with an increasing degree of capital mobility after 1973, a view that is

also supported by the earlier results of the present paper.

     Both of these stylized facts are to some extent overturned by the

data in Table 6. For most countries, r91 actually rises between the

first and second periods in spite of the presumed increase in the inter-

national mobility of capital. Further, the association between country

size and r91 Is such less striking. Austria, for example, which had a

very low r1 value in quarterly data, has a rather high one in Table 6.

In contrast, the correlation coefficients for France (which was not in

my earlier sample) are rather low.

     The new estimates underline the pitfalls of drawing inferences

about capital mobility from correlations such as those reported in the

table. The change in current account patterns between the two subsample;

probably has more to do with changing investment opportunities than with

the extent of capital—market integration. It is plausible that emerging

Investment opportunities In Europe in the 1950s and early 1960s caused a

pattern of investment increases financed by foreign (mostly American)

savings. A relative scarcity of such opportunities from 1967 on would

have tended to increase sa9lng—investment correlation coefficients, in

spite of increasing world financial integration. The reverse story

certainly seems plausible for Mexico. The development of that country's

oil resources is the probable cause of the sharp drop in Its saving—

investment correlation between the two subsample periods.

     While it is difficult to place great weight on such explanations in

the absence of complete structural models of saving and investment, the

numbers do pose a challenge for those who argue that capital is essen—
                                   28


tially immobile. The capital immobility hypothesis is impossible to

reconcile with many of the reported correlations, some of which do not

differ significantly from zero at the 5 percent level and most of which

are comfortably distant from the value of unity that would :haracterize

a closed economy. The correlation coefficients furnish statistical facts

about saving and investment which future structural models will have to

explain.
