                                         ABSTRACT

Shelter in place orders (SIPOs) require residents to remain home for all but essential activities
such as purchasing food or medicine, caring for others, exercise, or traveling for employment
deemed essential. Between March 19 and April 20, 2020, 40 states and the District of Columbia
adopted SIPOs. This study explores the impact of SIPOs on health, with particular attention to
heterogeneity in their impacts. First, using daily state-level social distancing data from
SafeGraph and a difference-in-differences approach, we document that adoption of a SIPO was
associated with a 5 to 10 percent increase in the rate at which state residents remained in their
homes full-time. Then, using daily state-level coronavirus case data collected by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, we find that approximately three weeks following the adoption
of a SIPO, cumulative COVID-19 cases fell by 44 percent. Event-study analyses confirm
common COVID-19 case trends in the week prior to SIPO adoption and show that SIPO-induced
case reductions grew larger over time. However, this average effect masks important
heterogeneity across states — early adopters and high population density states appear to reap
larger benefits from their SIPOs. Finally, we find that statewide SIPOs were associated with a
reduction in coronavirus-related deaths, but estimated mortality effects were imprecisely
estimated.

                                                 1. Motivation

        The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the disease COVID-19, has spread rapidly within

the United States. The total number of confirmed cases in the United States on March 12, 2020

was 1,629 which grew to 18,747 confirmed cases within seven days (Center for Disease Control

and Prevention 2020a). The primary strategy suggested by governments worldwide to reduce the

spread of COVID-19 is social distancing (Australian Government Department of Health. 2020;

Public Health England. 2020; Public Health Agency of Canada. 2020; White House 2020). As of

April 2, 2020, over 90 countries worldwide, representing half of the world’s population, have

requested or ordered their citizens to stay at home (Sandford 2020). In the United States, the

most common comprehensive social distancing policy adopted is a shelter-in-place order (SIPO).

A state SIPO requires residents to remain in their homes for all but essential activities such as

purchasing food or medicine, caring for others, exercise, or traveling for employment deemed

essential.

        The authority to issue SIPOs rests with state and local officials. While agencies of the

Federal government (i.e. the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) or the Executive

Branch can make recommendations on social distancing to state and local officials, the authority

to place a state under a SIPO is left to its governor. In some cases, sub-state local jurisdictions,

i.e. counties, cities, and townships, also have the authority to issue SIPOs through orders from

mayors, County Public Health Department officials, and other local government entities. 1

        The first statewide SIPO was announced by Governor Gavin Newsom of California on

March 19, 2020. Following the adoption of the California order, between March 20, 2020 and




1
 For example, Austin, Texas and Denver, Colorado (among many other municipalities) put in place municipal
SIPOs when there was no state-level SIPO in place at the time.
                                                      3
April 19, 2020, 39 additional states and the District of Columbia enacted similar statewide

SIPOs.2

        Enforcement of SIPOs is handled at the local level via law enforcement agencies

(Napoleon 2020; Fracassa 2020; Caswell 2020), though warnings for failure to comply with a

SIPO are very common for first offenses (Barr 2020). However, in contrast to a shelter-in-place

advisory (Commonwealth of Massachusetts 2020) or a gubernatorial recommendation (Herbert

2020), SIPOs have the weight of state law behind them. Violating a SIPO is considered a

misdemeanor (Allday 2020; Martineau 2020). Punishments vary from state to state, but

generally take the form of a fine or, if repeated, a prison term. For example, in Maryland, those

who willfully violate the state’s shelter-in-place order are subject to a fine of $5,000 and up to

one year of imprisonment (Maryland Executive Order 20-03-30-01 2020). To take another

example, in Minnesota, individuals are subject to fines up to $1,000, and imprisonment for no

more than 90 days (Minnesota Executive Order 20-20 2020). Still, social pressures appear to

play a very important role in SIPO compliance (Ronayne and Thompson 2020). 3

        Numerous reports from national, state, and local media sources suggest a substantial

reduction in public gatherings following SIPOs (Hermann 2020; Fry 2020) as well as business

closings (Arnold 2020; Cox 2020; U.S. Department of Labor 2020). However, these

associations may be explained in whole, or in part, by voluntary social distancing in response to

health knowledge that predated and, perhaps, drove SIPO adoption. Emerging evidence by

economists that has sought to isolate the causal impact of SIPOs on social distancing points to



2
  As of April 15, 2020, 6 states issued limited orders that closed non-essential businesses, and 2 states enacted
targeted shelter-in-place orders that applied only to those ages 65 and older and who had underlying health
conditions (Mervosh et al. 2020; Weaver 2020).
3
  Media reports suggest that some private citizens have begun to monitor neighbors’ behavior and local businesses,
reporting perceived violations of SIPOs to local law enforcement agencies (Webber 2020).
                                                         4
modest short-run effects from statewide orders (Friedson et al. 2020; Gupta et al. 2020: Abouk

and Heydari 2020), with larger effects for county policies (Gupta et al. 2020).

        A rapidly emerging literature has begun to study the short-run health effects of SIPOs.

Friedson et al. (2020) focus specifically on California, which enacted the nation’s first shelter-in-

place order. Using a synthetic control approach, and a variety of matching strategies, Friedson et

al. (2020) find that California’s SIPO was associated with approximately 125.5 to 219.7 fewer

COVID-19 cases per 100,000 following the policy’s first three weeks of enactment. To put their

estimates in context of SIPO-related economic costs, they suggest that California’s SIPO caused

approximately 400 job losses per life saved. 4

        While understanding the experience in a single state is important, the findings of work

such as Friedson et al. (2020) may not generalize to jurisdictions with different population or

outbreak characteristics. For example, California is an outlier, both as an early SIPO adopter and

as a highly urbanized state with extraordinarily low COVID-19 case growth at the time of SIPO

adoption. Given that an additional 40 states (including D.C.) adopted statewide SIPOs following

California’s enactment, understanding both the average effect of SIPOs and the heterogeneity of

their impact based on the characteristics of the target location is of primary policy importance.

        First, using daily state-level measures of social mobility from SafeGraph, Inc., we

document that statewide SIPOs were associated with a 5 to 10 percent increase (relative to the

pre-treatment period) in the share of the population that sheltered in place completely on any

given day. This treatment-control differential increases during the first week following SIPO

adoption and then remains constant or slightly declines. Next, turning to COVID-19, difference-


4
 While primarily focusing on mobility responses to SIPOs, Gupta et al. (2020) extensively discuss the empirical
challenges associated with estimating the health impacts of SIPOs. They find evidence that states enacting SIPOs
may do so in periods of rapid local coronavirus case growth. Failure to adequately explore endogenous policy
adoption may positively bias estimated treatment effects.
                                                        5
in-differences estimates show that the adoption of a SIPO had little effect on COVID-19 cases

during the five (5) days following its enactment, corresponding to the median incubation period.

However, after the incubation period, and intensifying rapidly three weeks or more after the

policy’s adoption, SIPO adoption is associated with an up to 43.7 percent decline in COVID-19

cases. Approximately 3 to 4 weeks following SIPO adoption, this corresponds to approximately

2,510 fewer cumulative COVID-19 cases for the average SIPO-adopting state.5 Evidence from

event study analyses is consistent with common pre-treatment trends. Our results persist when

we (i) drop California from our panel, confirming that we are not simply replicating Friedson et

al. (2020), and (ii) when we control for state-specific growth in COVID-19 testing, which could

affect the number of reported coronavirus cases. While statewide SIPOs were negatively related

to coronavirus-related deaths, estimated mortality effects were imprecisely estimated.

        Importantly, we find that the impact of the average state SIPO masks important state-

level heterogeneity. The earliest adopters of statewide SIPOs saw the largest declines in the rate

of coronavirus cases, including declines in the rate of COVID-19-related mortality. In addition,

more densely populated states also appear to reap relatively larger health benefits from their

SIPOs.6 Consistent with these larger health impacts, we find that statewide SIPOs are far more

effective at increasing social distancing among early adopting states and states with higher

population densities. We conclude that there are important heterogeneous health impacts of

statewide SIPOs across states and adoption time.



                                               2. Background



5
  The mean number of cumulative cases of coronavirus in the average SIPO-adopting state over our sample period
was 5,744 (for the full sample, this number was 5,501).
6
  This is consistent with findings from a case-study of county-level orders in Texas (Dave et al. 2020).
                                                       6
        After being detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the first confirmed case of

COVID-19 in the United States was identified on January 20, 2020 in Washington State. 7 The

disease spread exponentially over the next three months across the U.S., with confirmed cases at

778,328 as of April 20, 2020, accounting for 32 percent of the global caseload. Public health

interventions to flatten this growth trajectory have mobilized around two complementary sets of

policy responses. 8 Surveillance-based policies, such as expanding COVID-19 testing capacity

and deploying antibody tests, seek to monitor the spread and intensity of the disease (Gupta et al.

2020).9 These efforts can be instrumental in identifying infected persons, and tracing and

monitoring their contacts to limit further spread of the virus. In addition, mitigation and

suppression policies aim at lowering the reproduction rate of the virus and slowing its spread by

limiting interactions between individuals in the community and increasing social distancing

(Ferguson et al. 2020). Components of such a response include shelter-in-place orders, closures

of educational facilities, restrictions on mass gatherings, and closure of business and non-

essential services.

        Given that the authority for imposing sheltering-at-home orders and school or businesses

closures rests with states and localities, the Federal response has focused on (i) providing

funding to states to bolster preparedness and healthcare capacity, and (ii) surveillance-based

policies aimed at expanding testing and tracking infection rates. Some suppression efforts have

also included travel restrictions to limit infections from international exposure. For example, on

January 31, 2020, the Trump administration enacted restrictions on all foreign nationals who had

  While numerous clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine and anti-viral treatments are underway, significant lag
times with clinical testing and approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mean that an effective
prophylactic and treatment are unlikely over the short-term. Hence, public health efforts centered on suppression and
mitigation take on added relevance to prevent the surge in cases from overwhelming the healthcare system.

been in China over the past 14 days from entering the U.S. Then, following a surge in COVID-

19 related deaths, the administration suspended travel from the Schengen Area to the U.S.

starting on March 13, which was further extended to include the U.K. and Ireland three days

later. 10 A global health advisory, advising U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel, was

issued by the State Department on March 31. Also, the Centers for Disease Control and

Prevention (CDC) has issued further guidelines for social distancing and personal protective

measures (face covering, hand-washing, etc.) as part of a broader strategy for community

mitigation while awaiting a vaccine or effective treatment.

         A flurry of responses at the state and local levels also ensued. At the local level, one of

the first actions taken by many jurisdictions was to declare a state of emergency, which typically

frees up the state’s office of emergency management to deploy resources to localities for

immediate assistance. 11 The power for imposing the strongest mitigation and suppression

policies lies with state and local authorities. Consequently, following the declaration of

emergency, many states and jurisdictions started closing schools and shutting down non-essential

businesses and services.

         The first shelter-in-place order was simultaneously imposed by health authorities on

March 17, in the San Francisco Bay Area (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Mateo, and Santa

Clara counties, and the cities of San Francisco and Berkeley). Two days later, on March 19,

2020, Governor Gavin Newsom ordered the first statewide shelter-in-place order in California.

Following CA’s SIPO, 40 states and D.C. issued SIPOs of their own. 12 Additionally, several

cities and counties issued their own shelter-in-home order even if there was no statewide order;

11
   President Trump declared a National Emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak, on March 13.
12
   States generally include some exceptions to shelter-in-place orders, including going to work for certain jobs,
grocery shopping, walking the dog, exercising, or getting medical care.

for instance, as of April 20, 2020, more than 50 percent of the population in Utah is covered

under orders issued by Davis county, Salt Lake county, and Summit county despite no statewide

order in place.

         Transmission of COVID-19 is presently believed to occur via respiratory droplets,

usually emitted during coughing, sneezing, or nose-blowing (Centers for Disease Control and

Prevention 2020a, World Health Organization 2020c & 2020d) and possibly also through normal

breathing function in close proximity to an infected person (Fineberg 2020). In light of this, the

primary pathway through which a shelter-in-place order can potentially mitigate and suppress the

spread of COVID-19 is by restraining close contact between persons. If SIPOs effectively

promote greater social distancing, then this should translate into a reduction in the number of

reported cases and deaths as disease transmission slows. 13 However, reductions in new cases

and deaths should occur with a lag given that the incubation period for COVID-19 is 2 to 14 days

(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020b, Li et al. 2020)14 and time from first

symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is strongly associated with

mortality from COVID-19, may take up to an additional 8 days (Wang et al. 2020, Wu et al.

2020, Zhou et al. 2020).15

         Other indirect behavioral pathways may also explain a link between SIPOs and

coronavirus-related cases and deaths. For instance, SIPOs may affect confirmed cases by

affecting selection into testing. Attempting to comply with the stay-at-home order or because of

fear of getting exposed at medical facilities, infected persons who are unaware of their status

may choose not to seek out medical care. Conditional on infection, SIPOs may also affect


13
   There is, in fact, important work showing that increased generosity of sick leave pay, which encourages social
distancing, reduces the spread of contagious disease (Pichler and Ziebarth 2017; Pichler et al. 2020).
14
   The incubation lag is 5 days at the median, and 10 days at the 97.5 percentile.
15
   Some transmission from asymptomatic infected persons during this period is also possible.
                                                          9
coronavirus-related mortality by reducing the demand for non-essential or elective medical

procedures, thereby freeing up resources for care of COVID-19 patients.

       This discussion underscores several key points that guide our empirical analyses. First,

the incubation period for the virus and the lag from presentation of symptoms to acute

respiratory distress imply important dynamics. SIPOs would not be expected to immediately

dampen the growth curve given these dynamics, and strong effects may take some time to

materialize (> 5 days for cases, and perhaps at least 14 days for deaths). Second, given that the

effectiveness of SIPOs is driven by an increase in social distancing, this effectiveness may be

moderated by factors such as urbanicity and population density that play in integral role in the

spread of infections across communities. In other words, urbanicity and population density may

serve as multipliers which can enhance the efficacy of a given level of social distancing. Third,

given the exponential progression of infections, the effects of social distancing may magnify and

accelerate over time if enacted early (Florida 2020; Friedson et al. 2020). This suggests that

health benefits of SIPOs can vary depending on whether they were enacted early or late during

the outbreak cycle. Our study provides among the first national evidence on the effectiveness of

statewide shelter-in-home orders in promoting social distancing, in decreasing infection rates and

coronavirus-related deaths, and potential heterogeneity in the response based on timing of

enactment and state characteristics.



                                       3. Data and Methods

3.1 Social Mobility Data

       We begin our analysis by examining whether SIPOs affect social mobility, drawing daily

state-level data on social distancing for the period March 8, 2020 to April 17, 2020 from


                                                10
SafeGraph, Inc. For our analysis, we leverage this firm’s anonymized population movement

dataset representing 45 million smartphone devices. These data have recently been used by the

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to gather information on the degree to which

social distancing has been practiced by individuals in the United States following the COVID-19

outbreak (Lasry et al. 2020). From these data we collect a state-by-day measure of the percent of

the state population who remain at home for the entire day. A person’s home is defined as a 153-

meter by 153-meter area that receives the most frequent GPS pings during the overnight hours of

6pm to 7am. While this measure of social distancing is imperfect — for instance, it does not

capture whether an individual engages in social distancing while outside the home — it is

plausible to expect that having a higher percentage of the population who is “fully” sheltering in

place is positively correlated with rates of social distancing.

           Over our sample period, 35.7 percent of the population reported staying at home at all

times (see Appendix Table 1). On average, 42.3 percent of individuals stayed at home on days

when a state had a SIPO in place. This compares to 28.7 percent on state-days when a SIPO was

not in effect.



3.2 Coronavirus Case and Mortality Data

           Turning to our main analysis, we draw a panel of state-specific daily counts of COVID-

19 cases from March 8, 2020 through April 20, 2020. These data are collected by the Centers for

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and made public by the Kaiser Family Foundation. 16 By

April 20, 2020 there were a total of 778,328 positive screenings for COVID-19 in the United

States. In Appendix Table 2, we show the day on which the first confirmed reported coronavirus


16
     See data available here: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html

                                                          11
case (and death) occurred in each state. The first known confirmed case was in Washington on

January 20 followed by Illinois on January 24, though scientific knowledge on initial coronavirus

arrival in the United States is evolving and earlier cases may yet be discovered. The state with

the last initial case of reported coronavirus was West Virginia on March 17. Deaths followed a

similar pattern, with a lag, as expected from the coronavirus’s incubation period (Lauer et al.

2020) and time from first symptom to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Wang et al.

2020). In Appendix Table 1, we show that the mean rate of coronavirus cases per 100,000

population over our analysis period was 45.9.

       Figure 1 shows state-specific coronavirus case growth over our sample window. New

York and New Jersey are clear outliers, on case growth trends that are higher than any other

state. Over our sample period, the average increase in cases per 100,000 was about 8 times

higher in New York and New Jersey as compared to the other 49 states (26.9 daily cases per

100,000 vs. 3.4 per 100,000). This is owed to the spread of COVID-19 in the high population

density cities of New York City, Newark, and Jersey City (Rosenthal 2020; Warren 2020).

       Figure 2 and Appendix Table 2 describe coronavirus-related mortality from March 8

through April 20. The average COVID-19 death rate was 1.6 per 100,000 population. Figure 2

suggests a delay in the growth of deaths, as compared to cases. Total deaths did not start rising

(even in New York and New Jersey) until late March or early April. This lag is consistent with

the time period from infection to death.



3.3 Shelter-in-Place Orders




                                                12
         We collect statewide shelter-in-place orders from Mervosh et al. (2020) as well as from

our own search of state orders. 17 Table 1 lists the set of SIPOs enacted over our sample period

and Appendix Figure 1A shows maps depicting the geographic and temporal adoption of SIPOs.

California was the first state to adopt a shelter in place order on March 19, 2020. Following

California, the first cluster of states to adopt SIPOs was in the Midwest and parts of the

Northeast, as well as Louisiana. Notably, many of these states were also in the midst of COVID-

19 outbreaks during that time (Gupta et al. 2020). Later adopters of SIPOs were largely

concentrated in the mid-Atlantic and upper Midwest.

         As of April 20, 2020, 40 states and the District of Columbia had adopted statewide

SIPOs. Among those states who had not adopted a SIPO, six (6) had adopted some limited

shutdown orders that fell short of full SIPOs, including mandates to close non-essential

businesses (Arkansas, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts 18, North Dakota, and Wyoming), and

more narrowly targeted SIPOs, which apply only to elderly individuals and those with

underlying health conditions (Kentucky and Oklahoma). Only Nebraska, South Dakota, and

Utah had not adopted a SIPO, a limited shutdown order, or a targeted SIPO. 19



3.4 Methods

         For our main analyses we use a difference-in-differences design to estimate the

association between state SIPOs and COVID-19 cases. Specifically, we estimate:

   The governor of Massachusetts did not issue a shelter-in-place order, but did offer a shelter-in-place advisory on
March 24, 2020. However, this advisory did not carry the force of law.

   Notably, however, county shelter-in-place orders in Texas and Utah covered over half of the state population by
March 25 and April 2, respectively.

where ln (COVIDCASEst) is the natural log of the count of COVID-19 cases in state s on day t,

SIPO_1to5st is an indicator set equal to 1 for the period 1 to 5 days following a SIPO’s adoption,

SIPO_6to14st an analogous indicator for the period 6 to 14 days following adoption,

SIPO_15to19st is also an analogous indicator for the period 15 to 19 days following adoption,

and SIPO_20plusst is a final analogous indicator for 20 or more days following adoption. We

are particularly interested in the periods (i) 6 to 14 days following adoption and (ii) two or more

weeks following adoption, as these represent the periods following the median and 99th

percentile thresholds, respectively, in the incubation window for COVID-19 (Lauer et al.

2020).20

         With regard to control variables, PARTORDERst is an indicator for whether at least 50

percent of the state population were covered by a local SIPO, LIMITORDERst is an indicator for

whether a non-essential business closure was adopted, or a state enacted statewide SIPO for

elderly individuals or those with underlying health conditions, TRAVELst is an indicator for

whether a state required visitors or residents to self-quarantine for 14-days upon visiting or

returning to the state, EMERGst is an indicator for whether the Federal government had declared

the state a major disaster area due to the coronavirus crisis, TEMPst denotes the average high

et al. 2020).

temperature in the state, and PRECIPst is an indicator for whether measurable precipitation had

fallen in the state.21

        In addition, αs is a set of state fixed effects to control for fixed differences across states in

COVID-19 infections due to, for example, baseline hospital capacity differences, population

density, the presence of an important airport hub, or baseline testing capacity; γt is a set of day

fixed effects to control for national factors that commonly affect state COVID-19 infections such

as national travel restrictions, announcement of Federal guidelines, expansion of COVID-19

testing capacity, general awareness and proliferation of concern regarding COVID-19, or

important news pronouncements by National Institutes of Health Infectious Diseases Head

Anthony Fauci.

        Finally, we include controls, αs*t, for state-specific linear time trends to capture any

unmeasured state-level time trends that could be coincidentally associated with the timing of a

state coronavirus outbreak and SIPO adoption. Importantly, the state trends help to account for

unobserved factors driving the exponential growth trajectory of transmissions, and our effects

would be identified off deviations from this trend growth. State-specific linear trends have some

drawbacks, mainly that they might also soak up time-varying treatment effects (Goodman-Bacon

2019; Lee and Solon 2011). However, we view this as a reasonable tradeoff to make in order to

establish event studies which satisfy the common pre-trends assumption for difference-in-

differences models, and we view our estimates as a lower bound on the treatment effect. To be

transparent, we also report results with alternative approaches to controlling for unmeasured

state-specific linear trends, such as extrapolated treatment state specific pre-policy trends into

post-treatment (as recommended by Goodman-Bacon 2019), and controls for census region- or

census division-specific day effects to account for common unmeasured spatial shocks.

        Identification of our key coefficients of interest, β1 to β4, comes from within-state

variation in SIPO adoption. Over the period under study, 40 states and the District of Columbia

adopted SIPOs (see Table 1). It is important to note that our estimates of β1 to β3 capture the

impact of the SIPO itself over and above any impacts from general increases in social distancing

and avoidance behaviors common to treated and untreated states.

        In a standard difference-in-differences research design that is capitalizing on the

treatment turning on at different times, as with the differential timing of SIPO adoption across

states and over time, Goodman-Bacon (2019) shows that the treatment effect is a weighted

average of all possible two-group and two-period DD estimators. In other words, the main DD

treatment effect is identified off many “mini” experiments comparing: 1) early- and late-adopting

states with never-adopting states as controls; 2) early-adopting states with late-adopting states as

controls; and 3) late-adopting states with early-adopting states as controls. In the presence of

dynamic treatment effects, using early adopters as a control for the treated later adopters may

underestimate the treatment effect. This is because the trajectory of the early-adopting states, at

the time when the late-adopting states enact their own SIPOs, is still being affected by the policy

(that is, by the SIPOs in the early-adopting states).

        In this context, Goodman-Bacon (2019) suggests that it may be better to compare treated

early adopters with yet untreated later adopters or never adopters, and compare treated later

adopters with never adopters. At the same time, however, specifically when it comes to shelter-

in-place orders, non-adopting states may be different than states that issue such an order. 22 This


22
   Appendix Figure 1B shows COVID-19 case growth was somewhat higher among the later- and never-adopting
states relative to the early adopters.
                                                    16
suggests that it may also be important draw on variation just among the ever-adopters, excluding

the never adopters from contributing any identifying variation.

         These considerations guide our main analyses and supplementary checks. First, in order

to assess the sensitivity of our estimates to these different sources of timing-based identification,

we draw on subsets of the treated cohorts to identify our effects – essentially validating that our

effects are not driven by utilizing one particular cohort of states as a counterfactual. Second, we

utilize the Goodman-Bacon decomposition for suggestive evidence on which sets of comparisons

are driving identification. 23 Third, while the general issues outlined in Goodman-Bacon (2019)

are valuable in thinking about which groups are identifying the effects, and which groups may be

potentially problematic, event studies help to alleviate these concerns of bias in a standard

difference-in-differences analysis (Goodman-Bacon 2019; Sun and Abraham 2020).

         In light of this, we place an added focus on flexible event study formulations. Event

studies, because they rely on different states turning on and off as treated vs. control for different

leads and lags (Sun and Abraham 2020), are more sensitive in manifesting through the lead

effects any issues with problematic controls. In the context of somewhat tricky timing-based

identification and potentially strong dynamic effects, flat pre-trends in the event study analysis

become an important signal of the presence (or lack thereof) of these issues (Sun and Abraham

2020). We are careful in assessing the pre-policy trends and accounting for any unmeasured

time-varying shocks that may be correlated with policy adoption.

         In order to produce unbiased estimates of the effects SIPOs on social distancing and

COVID-19-related health, the common trends assumption must be satisfied. Threats to



23
   The decomposition is meant to be suggestive because, as originally implemented in Goodman-Bacon (2019), it
applies to a standard DD setting with a single treatment indicator, and not to a flexible dynamically-specified DD
framework.
                                                         17
identification include (i) state-specific time-varying unobservables correlated with SIPO-

adoption and the outcomes under study, and (ii) policy endogeneity, whereby social distancing

trends or trends in COVID-case or death growth induce the adoption of SIPOs.

We take a number of tacks to address each threat. With regard to state-specific time-varying

unmeasured heterogeneity, one important concern is that changes in COVID-19 testing may

conflate the effects of SIPOs on COVID-19 cases. To address this issue, we measure data on

testing from the COVID Tracking Project, compiled by The Atlantic and Related Sciences from

state public health authorities. 24 The variable TESTSst measures the cumulative number of

COVID-19 tests conducted in state s on day t. We then explore (i) whether SIPOs are associated

with changes in log testing rates, and (ii) how the estimated coefficient β1 changes when we

control for state-specific changes in testing.

        To take another example, it may be that other unobserved COVID-related policies or

voluntary behaviors are both related to SIPO adoption and impact social distancing or COVID-

related health. To address this possibility we (i) partial out other state COVID policies that may

be contemporaneously adopted, and (ii) control for state-specific linear time trends, which

capture any state-specific unobservables that trend linearly that may include voluntary tastes for

social distancing or heterogeneous infection growth across states.

        Endogenous adoption of SIPOs is an important concern. For instance, some jurisdictions

may adopt SIPOs in response to a noticeably accelerating COVID-19 outbreak (Gupta et al.

2020). While controlling for state-specific time trends is one important way to ameliorate the

possibility of policy endogeneity leading to biased estimates, the event study analysis further

allows us to examine and address whether pre-treatment COVID-19 case trends were common

across jurisdictions.

           To explore the association between statewide SIPOs and COVID-19-related deaths, we

turn to a negative binomial model. As can be gleaned from Appendix Table 2, approximately 27

percent of state-days in our sample had a death count of zero. Thus, we estimate a negative

binomial model of the following form:



COVIDDEATHst= exp (β0 + β1* SIPO_1to5st + β2* SIPO_6to14st + β3*SIPO_15to19st +
                               β4*SIPO_20plusst + β5*LIMITORDERst + β6*PARTORDERst +
                               β7*TRAVELst + β8*EMERGst + β9*TEMPst + β10*PRECIPst + αs + γt +
                               αs*t + εst)                                                  (2)



where COVIDDEATHst is the count of COVID-19 related deaths in state s on day t. We include

the same controls as model (1) and use state-level population as an exposure measure. In

addition, we also utilize a Tobit regression model and Poisson regression model and find results

that are qualitatively similar. 25

           All regressions described above are weighted using the state population and standard

errors are corrected for clustering at the state-level (Bertrand et al., 2004).



                                                  4. Results

 4.1 Statewide SIPO and Social Distancing

           We begin by examining the effect of statewide SIPOs on social distancing. Table 2

presents estimates of the relationship between state SIPOs and the percent of individuals who


25
     These findings are available upon request.
                                                   19
stayed at home throughout the day. In our most parsimonious specification, which includes state

fixed effects, and day fixed effects we find that the enactment of a SIPO is associated with a 2.1

percentage-point increase in stay-at-home rate. After adding a control for pre-treatment SIPO-

state specific linear time trend (to control for differential voluntary social distancing in the pre-

treatment period, reported in column 2), we find that the enactment of a SIPO is associated with

a 1.2 percentage-point increase in stay-at-home rates. This marginal effect represents a 5.2

percent increase relative to the mean pre-treatment stay-at-home rate among future SIPO-

adopting states.

         Event study analysis shown in Figure 3 suggests an interesting pattern of results.

Differential pre-treatment trends are relatively flat, and there was a sharp and steep relative

increase in stay-at-home rates in treatment versus control states in the week following the

policy’s adoption. 26 We interpret these findings as evidence that the SIPO had an important

short-run impact on social distancing.

         However, following the first week after SIPO enactment, the stay-at-home differential

between treatment and control states experienced a slight decline before leveling off. This result

can be interpreted in several ways. First, the finding could suggest that residents become

complacent over time and reverted back to usual habits. Such an effect could have been

exacerbated by “cabin fever,” a belief that a week was sufficient time for a SIPO to have worked,

or diminishing marginal utility (or perhaps disutility) of family time such that facing the

expected risk of coronavirus is rationally preferred to staying at home. However, trends in the

percent of individuals sheltering-at-home are positive throughout the sample period for the SIPO



26
  Appendix Figure 3 (Panel A) presents the event study for the two-way fixed effects models and shows a weak
increasing differential trend in staying-at-home full time prior to the SIPO adoption. Thus, accounting for the pre-
policy trends (as is done in Figure 3 and the results presented in Table 2, models 2-8) is important in this context.
                                                          20
adopting states, and do not indicate an absolute decline in such social distancing behaviors.

Second, a SIPO might have led to short-run panic, including an overestimation of the risk of

serious COVID-19 illness. Additional time to overcome the negative emotional shock of being

ordered to shelter in place, along with gathering of more health information, may have led to a

more accurate assessment of risk of contracting serious illness from venturing outside of one’s

home. Third, those who were sheltering in place full-time may have learned appropriate

precautions to take to increase safety while venturing away from their residences.

         Of course, the explanation could also reflect factors other than behavioral responses by

residents of SIPO-adopting states. For instance, a lagged increase in voluntary social distancing

by those in control states, perhaps in response to widespread SIPO adoption in other states or

general proliferation of awareness and concern regarding COVID-19, may have led to greater

convergence in rates of staying at home. 27 It is important to note, however, that even if SIPOs

merely accelerated sheltering in place in treated versus untreated states, and both sets of states

achieved the same level of social distancing eventually, there may be meaningful benefits to

SIPO-adoption in the longer term by slowing spread of the illness earlier in the outbreak cycle.

         Next, we test the sensitivity of our estimates to controls for state-specific linear time

trends across treatment and control states through the entire sample period (column 3). In this

specification, the estimated marginal effect is larger, suggesting that SIPO adoption is associated

with a 2.1 percentage-point increase in the share of the population staying at home time,

representing a 9.3 percent increase relative to the mean. When we include controls for other


27
   Trends in Appendix Figure 1C are consistent with this interpretation, showing a general increase in social
distancing across all states that accelerated initially and then slowed down. Rate of growth is monotonic with the
timing of SIPO adoption, with relatively faster growth in social distancing experienced by the early-adopting states.
Appendix Figure 1D shows the trends in stay-at-home behavior across event time, and suggest diminishing returns
in the increase in social distancing among the early-adopting states, as the non-adopting states are somewhat
catching up – thus partly narrowing the differential.
                                                         21
COVID-19 orders (column 4), travel restrictions, disaster declaration (column 5), and weather

controls (column 6), the results do not change. We find consistent evidence of a 2.1 to 2.3

percentage-point increase in stay-at-home rates, representing daily increases in social distancing

of about 9.3 to 9.9 percent relative to the mean stay-at-home rate. These findings are largely

consistent with those of Friedson et al. (2020), Gupta et al. (2020), and Abouk and Heydari

(2020).

          The dynamics of the SIPO effects on stay-at-home behaviors, presented in Panel II,

confirm the pattern evident in the event study analysis (Figure 3). We find strong significant

effects in sheltering-in-place full time within 14 days post-adoption, with effect magnitudes

representing an 8-13 percent increase. The effect sizes slightly diminish after this point,

reflecting an increase in voluntary social distancing in the control states, though the differential

for the treated states remains positive and statistically significant.

          Together, our findings thus far suggest that SIPOs were effective, particularly in the short

term, in encouraging residents to stay at home. 28 But are our difference-in-differences findings

simply a replication of Friedson et al.’s (2020) results on the stay-at-home effects of California’s

SIPO? In column (7), we drop California from our analysis sample. While the magnitude of the

estimated SIPO effect declines to 2.0, it remains statistically distinguishable from zero at

conventional levels. Moreover, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients

reported in columns (6) and (7) are statistically equivalent.




28
  Complete sheltering-in-place full time, our main measure, is an extreme margin. And, we view this social
distancing measure as a litmus check on whether or not the mechanism is active, but not as the full story on social
distancing behavior as there is potential for a great number of margins of response. There may be other forms or
social distancing and avoidance behaviors, induced by the SIPO, that are being followed and which can drive
containment in the infection rate. We also assessed effects on two other measures: 1) median hours spent at home;
and 2) percent full-time work outside the home. These effects are consistent with the estimates for stay-at-home
behavior, and also suggest a significant increase in time spent at home and a decrease in work outside the home.
                                                         22
         Finally, in column (8), we drop New York and New Jersey from the analysis sample.

These states are outliers with respect to both COVID-19 case levels and annual growth rates,

owed to outbreaks in the high-population density cities of New York City and Jersey City. From

March 8 through April 20, the average daily increase in COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population

was around 8 times higher in New York and New Jersey as compared to the remaining 49 (26.9

daily cases per 100,000 population vs. 3.4 daily cases per 100,000 population). In addition, these

states were also early adopters of SIPOs, perhaps in response to the gathering storm of outbreak.

When we drop these states from our sample, the estimated effect of SIPO adoption on stay-at-

home rates are unchanged.



4.2 Statewide SIPOs and COVID-19 Cases

         We begin our coronavirus case analysis with a sample including 48 states and the District

of Columbia, excluding the two states on a very different case growth trajectory, New York and

New Jersey. However, we will return to these states shortly.

         In Table 3, we present difference-in-differences estimates of the effect of SIPO adoption

on COVID-19 cases. 29 In our most parsimonious specification, we find little evidence that

COVID-19 cases were affected during the 5 days following a SIPO’s enactment. This is not too

surprising given that transmission may not be as common during an asymptomatic incubation

period.30 However, the estimated coefficients on the SIPO policy become much larger after 6 to

14 days. After 20 days of adoption, enactment of a SIPO is associated with a 37.7 percent

decline in COVID-19 cases (column 1), though this effect is imprecisely estimated. 31



29
   Appendix Table 3 presents coefficients on the control variables for the regressions shown in Table 3.
30
   This finding could also be explained by lags in COVID-19 testing.
31
   This estimate is calculated as (e-0.473-1)*100=37.7
                                                         23
        In column (2) we utilize controls for treatment-state-specific pre-policy trends. This

model accounts for potentially differential systematic timing in treatment yielding inappropriate

control comparisons (Goodman-Bacon 2019). This model yields results that are consistently

negative and statistically significant for all time periods beyond 5 days (the median incubation

period of the virus), but also detects somewhat strong results during the 0-5 day period,

suggesting that it is insufficiently cleaning out the effect of existing trends in the spread of the

disease.

        In column (3), we add controls for state-specific linear time trends as additional controls.

We believe this specification is preferable to that shown in columns (1) and (2) for two reasons.

First, in a model with log cases as the outcome, state linear trends control for the state-specific

exponential growth path of the outbreak (at least prior to reaching the peak number of cases),

making the estimated effect of the SIPO deviations from that growth path. Second, with regard

to the common trends assumption, the specification including state-specific linear time trends is

more defensible when examining event studies, as the pre-treatment trends are flatter. 32

        In column (3), we find that between 6- and 14-days following enactment of a SIPO, there

was a 28.0 percent decline in COVID-19 cases, an effect that is statistically distinguishable from

zero at the 10 percent level. In this instance, the inclusion of state-specific linear time trends

generates a more precisely estimated coefficient as it soaks up some of the residual variance.

Moreover, 15 to 19 days after SIPO adoption, we find that coronavirus cases fell by 37.8 percent.

And after 20 days after SIPO adoption, we find that coronavirus cases fell by 45.1 percent,

suggesting that the health benefits of SIPOs may grow larger in the periods following enactment.



32
  COVID-19 case specifications that include state-specific linear time trends (see Figure 4, Appendix Figure 5)
produce much stronger evidence of common pre-treatment trends than the two-way fixed effects model (Appendix
Figure 3)
                                                       24
         The remaining columns of Table 3 show the robustness of the COVID-19 case results to

observable state-level observable controls. We find no evidence that other COVID-19-related

shutdown or shelter policies (column 4), travel restrictions or major disaster emergency

declarations (column 5), or weather (column 6) affected the estimated impact of SIPOs on

COVID-19 cases. 33 In our preferred specification (column 6), we find that between 6 to 14 days

following a SIPO, coronavirus cases fell by 25.5 percent, between 15 to 19 days following a

SIPO, coronavirus cases fell by 35.6, and approximately three weeks following adoption,

coronavirus cases fell by 43.7 percent. 34

         An event-study analysis of COVID-19 cases from the specification described in column

(6) is shown in Figure 4. We find very little evidence of differential pre-SIPO COVID-19 case

trends in treatment and control states during the week prior to adoption. Each of the leads is

statistically indistinguishable from zero and each point estimate is near zero. Following the

adoption of the policy, estimated case reductions accelerate over time, becoming largest after 20

days following enactment of a SIPO. These findings are consistent with a causal interpretation

of our findings from Table 3 and with exponential growth in short-run health benefits during the

period of the shelter-in-place order.

         Drawing out the sources of identification, about 70 percent of the identifying variation in

the post three-week period comes from comparing adopting states to never adopters while about

25 percent of the identifying variation comes from comparing early-adopters when they adopt

their SIPOs, to later adopters as controls (when they have not yet adopted their SIPOs). The



33
   In Appendix Table 4, we explore the lagged effects of non-essential business closure policies, which was a
common policy adopted just prior to full SIPOs or instead of SIPOs. We find no evidence that non-essential
business closure policies affect the number of COVID-19 cases.
34
   In alternate specifications, available upon request, we estimate negative binomial and tobit regressions of the
effect of SIPOs on COVID-19 cases. The findings are qualitatively unchanged from those we report.
                                                          25
experiment provided by comparing the SIPOs of late-adopters to early adopters (using the early

adopters as controls), which may lead to under-estimated effects (Goodman-Bacon 2019),

contributes less than 5 percent to our identifying variation. 35 We revisit this issue below and

confirm that our estimates are not sensitive to turning off each of these sources of identifying

variation in turn.



4.3 Sensitivity Analysis

         In Table 4, we explore the sensitivity of our main findings to the inclusion and exclusion

of states from the analysis sample. Above, we argued for the exclusion of New York and New

Jersey from our sample. In column (1) of Table 4, we include these states in the analysis sample.

The estimated effect of SIPO adoption on coronavirus cases is quite similar to that reported in

column (5) of Table 3 (-.485 vs -.575). 36

         Given that California’s SIPO is significantly associated with a decline in coronavirus

cases (Friedson et al. 2020), we next excluded this state from the analysis to ensure that our

findings were not driven by the earliest-adopting state for which there is already strong evidence

for SIPO-induced COVID-19 case reductions. Our results show that the average SIPO effect we

detect is not driven by California. Excluding California, we find that 20 days following SIPO

sample, provided in Figure 6, shows no evidence of pre-treatment trends in the week following




35
   This decomposition should be interpreted with caution and meant to be suggestive. It is developed for the context
of a standard DD setting with a single treatment indicator rather than a dynamically-specified DD model.
Nevertheless, it is informative in drawing attention to which sources of variation are relatively more important in the
data.
36
   Appendix Figure 4 shows an event-study analysis when we include New York and New Jersey in the main
analysis sample. Note that as we approach the period over one week prior to adoption, the coefficient estimates
decrease, suggesting a pre-treatment upward trend in cases when we include New York and New Jersey to our
sample.

SIPO adoption and a similar pattern of case declines that grow larger in the weeks following

enactment.

       In columns (3) through (7), we exclude a number of states with high COVID-19 case

levels (relative to the national mean), as well as states with relatively high COVID-19 case rates.

The states we drop include Washington (column 3), Massachusetts (column 4), Louisiana

(column 5), District of Columbia (column 6), and Connecticut (column 7). The results show that

the average SIPO effect we detect is not also driven by these states. We estimate that, after 20

days of enactment, SIPO adoption is associated with a 40.2 to 45.6 percent reduction in COVID-

19 cases when we exclude these states from our sample.

       In the final three columns of Table 3, we drop several states with lower rates of

coronavirus and low rates of coronavirus case growth: Oregon (column 8), Texas (column 9),

and Minnesota (column 10). Again, we find no evidence that our main finding is changed.

       One concern with the estimates presented thus far is that they may be biased if SIPO

adoption were correlated with COVID-19 testing capabilities. This may be the case due to the

evolution of testing over the period of analysis. As of March 13, only 15,000 tests had been

conducted in the U.S. To address the low testing rate in the U.S., the Food and Drug

Administration approved a new COVID-19 test from the pharmaceutical company Roche

(Arnold 2020). In the following days, Delaware, New York, Massachusetts and Texas, began

implementing drive-up testing sites, which made testing more accessible (Yancey-Bragg 2020).

Despite these improvements in accessibility, many testing delays persisted due to laboratory

capacity constraints (Brown and Court 2020).

       SIPOs could affect COVID-19 testing in several ways. First, SIPOs may induce some

who have flu-like symptoms to stay at home rather than seek medical attention, either due to


                                                27
perceived civic duty or a perception of greater adverse selection in patients who present at

medical facilities during a pandemic. Second, SIPOs could strain public resources such that

there is a budgetary tradeoff in enforcing SIPOs and expanding COVID-19 testing capabilities.

On the other hand, if SIPOs are effective at reducing caseloads, medical resources that no longer

have to be used to treat coronavirus patients can be used to expand testing. Moreover, if SIPOs

prevent symptomatic COVID-19 cases, fewer patients will present for testing.

       Data on COVID-19 testing are obtained from COVID Tracking Project. A test is counted

if the result was deemed positive, negative, or inconclusive. In Appendix Table 1, we report that

the average testing rate over the sample period was 363.8 tests per 100,000 population.

       The first two columns of Table 5 show estimates of the effect of SIPOs on the natural log

of COVID-19 tests. We find that SIPOs are negatively related to testing, but these effects are

never statistically distinguishable from zero at conventional levels. In light of these findings, it

is perhaps not surprising that in columns (3) and (4) of Table 5, we find no evidence that the

estimated effect of enactment of a SIPO on COVID-19 cases is affected by the addition of a

control for COVID-19 testing capacity. Given that testing is a potentially endogenous control

(though we do not find any evidence that it is affected by a SIPO), we nevertheless take this

descriptive evidence as suggestive of the hypothesis that our estimates are not biased due to

state-level heterogeneity in growth of testing capacity.

       The difference-in-differences estimates presented to this point have identified the effect

of a SIPO on the state-specific change in cumulative cases of coronavirus. In Table 6, we

explore the effect of SIPO adoption on the “derivative” of cumulative COVID-19 cases, that is,

daily COVID-19 cases. And, in fact, we find evidence that the enactment of a SIPO also




                                                  28
affected the rate of change in cumulative COVID-19 cases. The results suggest that state

adoption of a SIPO was associated with a 44.6 to 47.5 percent decline in daily coronavirus cases.

        We undertake additional analyses to address specific issues. First, there may be some

concern that the composition of states that identify each of the lagged effects is changing over

time. We have at least 14 days of post-treatment data for all SIPO states. Furthermore, 29 of the

41 treated states contribute to identification of the coefficient of the longest lag window, that is

effects over 20 or more days following adoption. Appendix Figure 2 plots the event study

analyses on a restricted sample of states that have 20+ days of post-treatment data following the

adoption of a SIPO, showing largely similar results and dynamics.

       Second, our results and conclusions are not materially affected by alternate approaches to

controlling for unmeasured time-varying state factors. Appendix Table 5 presents estimates that

control for region by day and census division by day fixed effects. Appendix Table 6 utilizes the

Goodman-Bacon two-part correction, which estimates state-specific trends (separately for each

state and alternately for each treatment cohort) using only the pre-policy observations and then

partials out these extrapolated pre-policy trends from the post-policy periods. Comparing these

estimates to our main analyses, we draw the following empirical conclusions. Our interpretation

of the pattern of results across all models is similar: the estimated effect of SIPOs on COVID-19

cases grows over the post-treatment period, becoming largest in the window three weeks or more

following enactment. Estimates of SIPO effects from all models that account for state-specific

trends are generally more precise than from the two-way fixed effects model, suggesting that the

trend controls are soaking up some of the residual variance. Estimates from the Goodman-Bacon

two part procedure are the largest (in absolute magnitude), indicating a 60 to 63 percent decline

in COVID-19 cases three or more weeks following adoption. While this finding is consistent


                                                  29
with the hypothesis that estimated policy effects from models including the state-specific linear

time trend may understate the policy’s impact, with an exponentially growing outbreak,

extrapolating the pre-treatment trends forward using the pre-policy periods may also risk over-

estimating the dynamics if the intervention is effective and dampens the trajectory to sub-

exponential growth.

       Third, in order to assess the sensitivity of our estimates to different sources of timing-

based identification, we draw on subsets of the treated cohorts to identify our effects, in turn

excluding late adopters, early adopters, and non-adopters from the sample). These results

confirm that: 1) the effects of SIPOs in reducing COVID-19 cases are substantially larger among

early-adopting states relative to later-adopting states; 2) the effects for the early adopters are

progressively larger with the length of the post-treatment window; 3) these effects are robust to

using non-adopters as controls or late-adopters as controls; and 4) the pattern of results is largely

similar to those discussed above, utilizing all states in the analysis.



4.4 Statewide SIPO and COVID-19 Mortality

       Next, we turn to an analysis of whether statewide SIPOs affected mortality. There are

several channels through which mortality may be affected by SIPOs. If SIPOs reduce

coronavirus cases, mortality will decline in the longer-run because fewer people will become

infected with the coronavirus. Of course, these effects are likely to come with a much longer lag

than cases given that the time from first symptoms until acute respiratory distress syndrome

(ARDS) is, on average, about 8 days (Wang et al. 2020). In addition, SIPOs may affect the

likelihood that infected patients choose to stay at home rather than seek out testing and other

medical care, having the unintended consequence of increasing serious illness and death.


                                                  30
Finally, SIPOs may also impact the availability of resources for medical care, as public resources

are used to enforce SIPOs instead.

       Negative binomial regressions of the effect of SIPO enactment on COVID-19-related

mortality are shown in Table 7. We find that the results are sensitive to our specification model.

Models without state trends of any sort (column 1) and with state-specific linear time trends

(column 3) suggest that after 20 days, SIPO adoption is associated with 47.1 to 53.7 percent

reduction in mortality. Controlling for state-specific linear time trends, the estimated mortality

effects are somewhat smaller, but continue to show long-run COVID-19 death declines. But

because none of these estimates are statistically distinguishable from zero at conventional levels,

we can only cautiously interpret these findings as evidence of mortality declines. We note here

that due to the longer lag with which we expect mortality effects to materialize, the effects for

the longer time windows (15-19 days post SIPO, > 19 days post SIPO) are identified off a few

early-adopting states. Hence, more long-run data is necessary for a definitive conclusion.

       In Appendix Figure 5, we show the event study analysis on COVID-19 related mortality,

obtained from the negative binomial regression shown in column 4 of Table 7. We find no

evidence of differential pre-treatment trends in mortality, with a longer delayed potential decline

in mortality.



4.5 Heterogeneity in Estimated Impacts of SIPOs

       The results presented above provide consistent evidence that the adoption of a statewide

shelter-in-place order significantly reduced infection rates, with the strongest effects realized two

or more weeks after enactment. This lag is consistent with the incubation period of the virus (2-

14 days) over which transmission may be possible but less efficient due to lack of symptoms.


                                                 31
Given the exponential growth trajectory of infection, there may additional dynamics in terms of

the effectiveness of the SIPO depending on when the policy is enacted – whether early or late

over the cycle of disease progression. That is, the beneficial effects of social distancing on

COVID-19 caseload may have an accelerating effect over time if enacted early.

         Friedson et al. (2020) find strong evidence that California’s first-in-the-nation SIPO had a

strong public health benefit, and continued to do so even after social distancing measures

between California and its control narrowed. This is suggestive of persistent and magnified

effects of enacting a SIPO early in the outbreak cycle. However, given the study’s focus on

California, Friedson et al. (2020) were not able to explicitly test for heterogeneity in the response

across early vs. late adopters. 37 Table 8A presents effects separately across early adopting states

(adopted on March 25 or earlier) and late adopting states (adopted after March 25). These results

confirm that the effects are primarily driven by states which enacted the shelter-in-place orders

relatively early, thus capitalizing on the magnified benefits of social distancing as the growth

trajectory was rising but still relatively low compared with later adopters. 38 In addition, we now

uncover some evidence that SIPOs are effective at reducing coronavirus-related mortality when

they were adopted early in the U.S. COVID-19 outbreak. While some of this result could be

explained by insufficient longer-run data from later adopters, all later adopters and early adopters

have data between 2 and 3 weeks after SIPO adoption and early adopters see substantially larger

health benefits than earlier adopters over this period. 39



37
   The states within each percentile group used to subset the data in the analyses to follow can be found in Appendix
Table 7.
38
   Appendix Table 8 explores heterogeneity in the efficacy of SIPOs based on whether or not the state in question
had a nonessential business closure or local SIPOs covering over 50 percent of the state population in place prior to
the statewide SIPO. Statewide SIPOs are less effective when these other policies are enacted first, for further
discussion of this phenomenon see Dave et al. (2020).
39
   Appendix Table 9 conducts a similar analysis to Table 8A, instead splitting states into groups based on their
average daily growth rate of COVID-19 cases prior to their SIPO as a proxy for how early or late their adoption was
                                                         32
         In Table 8B, we explore whether COVID-19-related health benefits are larger among

states with higher population density. To do this, we explore the interquartile range of

population density rankings of U.S. states.40 In the main, our findings suggest larger COVID-19-

related health benefits among those outside the lower 25th percentile of state population density

rankings. Those states in the middle 50th percentile and upper 25th percentile of population

density tend to see larger reductions in COVID-19-related cases. This result is consistent with

the hypothesis that stay-at-home orders are likely to generate greater health benefits when

crowd-related contagion is avoided. The relationship between population density and the

marginal effect of SIPOs on mortality appears more non-monotonic.

         Together, the findings in Tables 8A and 8B generally suggest compounding and stronger

effects of social distancing among the early adopters and higher population density states and

provide some explanation as to why the SIPOs continue to have a beneficial effect on infection

rates 6 to 20+ days post-enactment. 41 In Table 8C, we test this hypothesis by presenting

estimates of the effect of SIPOs on stay-at-home rates by (i) whether the enacting state was an

early or later adopter, and (ii) the interquartile range of population density.

         First, consistent with our health results our findings in Panel I provide strong evidence

that SIPOs were more effective at increasing social distancing in as compared to later adopting

SIPO states. The estimated social distancing effect was twice as large for early as compared to



relative to their state specific outbreak. Results show that states which adopted earlier relative to their outbreaks had
stronger effects.
40
   We obtain our population density measures here: https://www.statista.com/statistics/183588/population-density-
in-the-federal-states-of-the-us/
41
   Event-study analyses on early-adopting and more densely populated states, available upon request, produces a
pattern consistent with coronavirus case differentials that trend near zero in the pre-treatment period and fall
precipitously following SIPO enactment. Furthermore, there is sufficient variation in the distribution of population
density across the early adopting states. Models that further separate out the effects of early adoption from
population density indicate that states which adopted earlier and are more densely populated experienced the
strongest decrease in COVID-19 cases. We lose precision in these models however.
                                                           33
later-adopting states (2.6 percentage-points vs 1.3 percentage-points). One explanation for our

finding may be that residents of later-adopting SIPO states already adopted some social

distancing behaviors prior to their SIPO adoption or because later-adopting SIPO state residents

were less compliant with social distancing mandates, perhaps because of political or ideological

preferences (Painter and Qiu 2020).

       Next, if the primary mechanism through which SIPOs impact case rates is through social

distancing, then we would expect these benefits to be further magnified in states with a high

population density. Population density is an independent predictor of community spread of

infection; SIPOs therefore would have more capacity to reduce social distancing in these states,

and a given decrease in social distancing would also translate into reduced modes of person-to-

person contact. In Panel II Table 8C, we assess heterogeneity in the effects on stay-at-home

behaviors across states with lower versus higher rates of population density, as measured by

population per state area in square miles. Consistent with our findings on COVID-19, we find

that SIPOs are more effective in promoting social distancing in more densely populated states.

The patterns uncovered in Table 8C, with respect to heterogeneity in social distancing, parallel

the stronger health effects that we find among states that adopted the orders earlier and among

more densely populated states.



                                            5. Conclusions

       Since March 19, 2020, 40 states and the District of Columbia have adopted shelter-in-

place orders to attempt to hasten the spread of COVID-19, smooth illnesses and treatment over

time, and prevent short-run medical capacity constraints from causing otherwise avoidable

deaths. Critics, however, argue that SIPOs impose large, and perhaps long-lasting, job loss,


                                                34
strain social insurance programs beyond their capacity, and slow the progression toward

community-level herd immunity. While the lack of long-run data does not yet permit us to

answer all of the claims made by proponents and opponents of SIPOs, this paper proposes an

important first step: to estimate the short-term impact of statewide SIPOs on COVID-19 cases

and COVID-19-related mortality. That is, did these policies meet their immediate public health

objective?

       First, using GPS-based anonymized cell phone records from SafeGraph, Inc. to measure

state-level daily social mobility, we find evidence that the enactment of a state SIPO resulted in a

short-run increase in the percent of state residents remaining at home full time. While longer-run

differentials in stay-at home rates for treatment and control states were smaller or slightly

negative, the findings do suggest an important effect of SIPOs on social distancing. We view the

social distancing results as an important first-stage outcome, but by no means the complete story

with regards to policy and social distancing behavior. Our results capture a single, but important

measure of social distancing, and studying other metrics of mobility (as done by Gupta et al.

2020) will likely be a fruitful way to push this literature forward.

       Second, using coronavirus case and mortality data from March 8, 2020 to April 20, 2020,

and a difference-in-differences approach, we find that approximately three weeks after the

enactment of a statewide SIPO, the average number of cumulative cases fell by approximately 44

percent. Approximately 3 to 4 weeks following SIPO adoption, this corresponds to

approximately 2,510 fewer cumulative COVID-19 cases for the average SIPO-adopting state.

Event study analysis suggests that this result was not driven by differential pre-treatment trends,

nor was it driven by the California experience (Friedson et al. 2020). We find that states that

were highly urbanized and were early SIPO adopters saw the largest declines in cases, consistent


                                                 35
with the hypothesis that early adopters with high population densities had the largest margins for

larger short-run public health benefits. 42

         An important limitation of our work is the preliminary examination of COVID-19-related

deaths. While it is true that detecting more consistently negative death effects of SIPOs may

take more time to uncover, effects on COVID-related deaths could be quite different from cases.

For instance, it could be that SIPOs may have important case-reducing effects mostly among

populations at low-risk for mortality from this disease. In that case, the avoided infections may

not generate substantial reduction in mortality because the high-risk infections, i.e. in nursing

homes, still occurred. Future work might explore characteristics of marginal individual who

avoided a COVID-19 infection due to a SIPO.

          The larger efficacy of a statewide SIPO depends on a number of factors beyond the

specific scope of our paper. But if we assume (i) SIPOs are temporary because the economic

costs are substantial, (ii) development of a vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19 is

unlikely in the short-run (Fauci 2020), and (iii) universal (or at least widespread) testing of

asymptomatic individuals is also very unlikely in the short-run (Center for Disease Control and

Prevention 2020d), some of the short-run COVID-19 cases and deaths may simply be postponed

to the near future when the SIPO is lifted. In that case, deaths and serious illnesses averted by

avoiding short-run shortages of ventilators, hospital beds, and medical professionals may be a

SIPO’s most likely path to generating long-run public health benefits.

Notes: Indiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Ohio implemented a statewide SIPO at 11:59pm on
March 24, March 27, March 27, and March 23 respectively. We code each state’s SIPO as being effective
the minute following its effective time.

In Massachusetts, instead of a formal order, Gov. Charlie Baker issued a “Stay at Home Advisory,” which
we treated as a non-SIPO.

Notes: Estimates are obtained using weighted least squares regression. A business closure order is an indicator for whether the state had issued a non-
essential business closure order (that fell short of a SIPO). Partial SIPOs include a targeted SIPO for older individuals or those with underlying health
conditions and an indicator for whether coverage of local (i.e. city or county) SIPO orders covered at least 50 percent of the state population. A travel
restriction is an indicator for whether the state had issued restrictions on travel to or from the state. A major disaster declaration is an indicator for
whether the state had received a major disaster emergency declaration from the Federal government. Finally, weather controls include the average
temperature (in degrees Celsius) in the state and an indicator for whether measurable precipitation fell in the state. All models include state fixed effects
and day fixed effects. Standard errors, clustered at the state-level, are reported in parenthesis.

Notes: Estimates are obtained using weighted least squares regression. The model includes the following controls:
an indicator for whether the state had issued a non-essential business closure order (that fell short of a SIPO) or a
targeted SIPO for older individuals or those with underlying health conditions, an indicator for whether coverage of
local (i.e. city or county) SIPO orders covered at least 50 percent of the state population, an indicator for whether the
state had issued restrictions on travel to or from the state, an indicator for whether the state had received a major
disaster emergency declaration from the Federal government, the average temperature (in degrees Celsius) in the
state, an indicator for whether measurable precipitation fell in the state, state fixed effects, day fixed effects, and a
state-specific linear time trend. Standard errors, clustered at the state-level, are reported in parenthesis.

Notes: Estimates are obtained using weighted least squares regression. The model includes the following
controls: an indicator for whether the state had issued a non-essential business closure order (that fell short of a
SIPO) or a targeted SIPO for older individuals or those with underlying health conditions, an indicator for whether
coverage of local (i.e. city or county) SIPO orders covered at least 50 percent of the state population, an indicator
for whether the state had issued restrictions on travel to or from the state, an indicator for whether the state had
received a major disaster emergency declaration from the Federal government, the average temperature (in
degrees Celsius) in the state, an indicator for whether measurable precipitation fell in the state, state fixed effects,
day fixed effects, and a state-specific linear time trend. Standard errors, clustered at the state-level, are reported in
parenthesis. States that enacted SIPO between March 19 and 25 are coded as early adopting states. States that
enacted SIPO on March 26 or later are coded as late adopting states.

Notes: Estimates are obtained using weighted least squares regression. A business closure order is an indicator for whether the state had issued a non-essential business
closure order (that fell short of a SIPO). Partial SIPOs include a targeted SIPO for older individuals or those with underlying health conditions and an indicator for whether
coverage of local (i.e. city or county) SIPO orders covered at least 50 percent of the state population. A travel restriction is an indicator for whether the state had issued
restrictions on travel to or from the state. An emergency order is an indicator for whether the state had received a major disaster emergency declaration from the Federal
government. Finally, weather controls include the average temperature (in degrees Celsius) in the state and an indicator for whether measurable precipitation fell in the state.
All models include state fixed effects and day fixed effects. Standard errors, clustered at the state-level, are reported in parenthesis.
