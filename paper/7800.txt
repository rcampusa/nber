1     Introduction
1.1    Motivation
What are the implications of technical change for the labor market? How does new
technology a¤ect the distribution of wages and income? Is technology responsible for the
changes in the wage structure observed in many advanced economies since the 1970s?
    The recent consensus is that technical change favors more skilled workers, replaces tasks
previously performed by the unskilled, and exacerbates inequality. This view is shaped
largely by the experience of the past several decades, which witnessed both major changes
in technology, including the rapid spread of computers in workplaces and in our lives, and
a sharp increase in wage inequality. In the U.S., for example, the college premium—the
wages of college graduates relative to the wages of high school graduates— increased by over
25 percent between 1979 and 1995. Overall earnings inequality also increased sharply. In
1971, a worker at the 90th percentile of the wage distribution earned 266 percent more than
a worker at the 10th percentile. By 1995 this number had risen to 366 percent (author’s
calculations from March CPS data). Many commentators see a direct causal relationship
between technological changes and these radical shifts in the distribution of wages taking
place in the U.S. economy. The title of Krueger’s (1993) in‡uential paper on computers
and inequality summarizes this view: “How Computers Have Changed the Wage Structure.”
Greenwood and Yorukoglu (1997, p. 87) similarly give a succinct statement:

         “Setting up, and operating, new technologies often involves acquiring and
      processing information. Skill facilitates this adoption process. Therefore,
      times of rapid technological advancement should be associated with a rise in
      the return to skill.”

    They further argue that we are now in the midst a “Third Industrial Revolution”, fueled
by advances in information technology, and that this revolution is responsible for the in-
crease in inequality (as does Caselli, 1999, in a paper entitled “Technological Revolutions”).
    The view that technological developments favor skilled workers receives support from
accounts of earlier episodes. For example, there were already signs of signi…cant technology-
skill complementarity in the 1910s. Goldin and Katz (1998) argue that the spread of batch
and continuous-process methods of production increased the demand for skills. They add
“...the switch to electricity from steam and water-power energy sources was reinforcing
because it reduced the demand for unskilled manual workers in many hauling, conveying,
and assembly tasks.” (p. 695). Over this period, capital-intensive industries increased the
demand for skills considerably (see Goldin and Katz, 1998, Table 3), and the scope of these
industries expanded with the sharp fall in the price of electricity (see, for example, Woolf,
1984, p. 178). The rapid increase in the importance of white collar and clerical occupations

                                              1
gave another boost to the demand for skills. Generalizing from the experience of the 1920s,
Harry Jerome (1934, p. 402) argued that “...in the future...there is considerable reason to
believe that the e¤ect of further [mechanization] will be to raise the average skill required.”
    The early twentieth century evidence was so powerful that Griliches (1969) suggested
capital and skills are intrinsically complementary. Nelson and Phelps (1967), Welch
(1970), Schultz (1975) and Tinbergen (1975) also argued that technological developments
increase the demand for skills. Events since then support this notion. Personal comput-
ers, computer-assisted production techniques and robotics appear to complement skilled
workers, replacing many labor intensive tasks. In this light, it is perhaps natural to view
the increase in inequality over the past several decades as a direct consequence of technical
change.
    Although the consensus is now broad, the idea that technological advances favor more
skilled workers is a twentieth century phenomenon. In nineteenth century Britain, skilled
artisans destroyed weaving, spinning and threshing machines during the Luddite and Cap-
tain Swing riots, in the belief that the new machines would make their skills redundant.
They were right: the artisan shop was replaced by the factory and later by interchange-
able parts and the assembly line (e.g., James and Skinner, 1985, Goldin and Katz, 1998).
Products previously manufactured by skilled artisans started to be produced in factories
by workers with relatively few skills, and many previously complex tasks were simpli…ed,
reducing the demand for skilled workers.1 Mokyr (1990, p. 137) describes this process
vividly:

          “First in …rearms, then in clocks, pumps, locks, mechanical reapers, type-
       writers, sewing machines, and eventually in engines and bicycles, interchange-
       able parts technology proved superior and replaced the skilled artisans working
       with chisel and …le.”

Interchangeable parts were in fact very much designed to be skill-replacing. Eli Whitney,
a pioneer of interchangeable parts, described the objective of this technology as

           “to substitute correct and e¤ective operations of machinery for the skill of
       the artist which is acquired only by long practice and experience; a species of
       skill which is not possessed in this country to any considerable extent.” (quoted
       in Habakkuk, p. 22)
   1
    It can be argued that technical change always increases the demand for “skills”, and the artisans who
were hurt as a result of new technology were not “skilled” since they lacked the ‡exibility to adapt to the
required changes. This argument is not totally convincing, since the artisans earned considerably more than
other laborers (for example, James and Skinner, 1985, report over 60 percent wage di¤erentials for building
and printing workers relative to laborers in the 1850s). So the artisans possessed skills that were being
rewarded by the market, and the standardization of the production process destroyed these rewards. On
the other hand, it has to be noted that many of the skill-replacing technologies of the nineteenth century
may have also increased the demand for engineers and managers (see, e.g., Goldin and Katz, 1998).

                                                    2
The experience of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries led Braverman (1974) and
Marglin (1974) to argue that technical change was “deskilling”—a major purpose of tech-
nical change was to expand the division of labor and simplify tasks previously performed
by artisans by breaking them into smaller, less skill-requiring pieces. Braverman (1974,
p. 113), for example, suggested that the …rst principle of management and production
techniques of the period was “dissociation of the labor process from skills of the work-
ers. The labor process is to be rendered independent of craft, tradition, and the workers’
knowledge.”
    A longer view therefore suggests that technological advances do not always increase the
demand for skills. In fact, most nineteenth century innovations appear to have replaced
skilled workers and expanded tasks performed by the unskilled. But then, why have
technological advances been skill-biased in the twentieth century? And, are technological
changes the major cause of the recent increase in inequality?
    This essay attempts to answer these questions. It has two main theses:

   1. The behavior of wages and returns to schooling indicates that technical change has
      been skill-biased during the past sixty years, and probably for most of the twentieth
      century. Furthermore, an acceleration in skill bias during the past few decades is the
      main cause of the increase in inequality.

   2. We can understand the behavior of technical change by recognizing that the develop-
      ment and use of technology is, at least in part, a response to pro…t incentives.2 When
      developing skill-biased techniques is more pro…table, new technology will tend to be
      skill-biased. I suggest that the nineteenth century was characterized by skill-replacing
      developments because the increased supply of unskilled workers in the English cities
      (resulting from migration from rural areas and from Ireland) made the introduction
      of these technologies pro…table. In contrast, the twentieth century has been char-
      acterized by skill-biased technical change because the rapid increase in the supply
      of skilled workers has induced the development of skill-complementary technologies.
      The recent more rapid skill-biased technical change is in turn likely to have been a
      response to the acceleration in the supply of skills during the past several decades.
      However, I also argue that despite the acceleration in skill bias, we are most likely
      not in the midst of a “Technological Revolution”; what has changed is not necessarily
      the overall rate of progress, but the types of technologies that are being developed.
  2
    Precedents of this approach include Schmookler (1966), who emphasized demand pull and the extent
of the market as key determinants of innovations; the endogenous growth theory, e.g., Romer (1990),
Grossman and Helpman (1991), and Aghion and Howitt (1992); the induced innovation theory, including
Ahmad (1965), Kennedy (1964), Samuelson (1970), Hayami and Ruttan (1970), and David (1975); and
recent work including my own, Acemoglu (1998, 1999b, 2000), Acemoglu and Zilibotti (1999), and Kiley
(1999).

                                                 3
    Finally, I conjecture that recent technological developments are likely to have a¤ected
the organization of the labor market—including the way …rms are organized and the form
of labor market institutions— and may have had a large e¤ect on the structure of wages
through this channel.
    In the process of developing this argument, this essay sets out a simple theoretical
framework, in which inequality and returns to skills are determined by supply and demand
forces (technology).3 Using this framework as a unifying device, I critically survey many
of the theories that explain the recent increase in inequality by technological factors, and
discuss how various pieces of evidence can be interpreted within this framework.

1.2     Summary of the Argument
I begin with a roadmap of the argument. Since the e¤ect of new technology on the distri-
bution of wages in the recent past is central to the focus here, I organize this essay around
a number of salient facts from the post-war U.S. economy.4 Brie‡y, these facts are:

   1. The past sixty years have seen a large increase in the supply of more educated workers,
      while returns to education have risen.

   2. Returns to education fell during the 1970s, when there was a very sharp increase in
      the supply of educated workers. Returns to education then began a steep rise during
      the 1980s.

   3. Overall wage inequality rose sharply beginning in the 1970s. Increases in within group
      (residual) inequality—i.e., increases in inequality among observationally equivalent
      workers— account for much of this rise.

   4. Average wages have stagnated and wages of low-skill workers have fallen in real terms
      since 1970.

    I argue that technical change over the past sixty years, or even over the past century, has
been skill-biased. This conclusion follows from fact 1 above: in the absence of substantial
skill bias in technology, the large increase in the supply of skilled workers would have
depressed the skill premium. In 1970, Welch (1970, p. 36) reached the same conclusion,
and argued:
   3
     Precedents of the supply and demand approach include, among others, Becker (1964), Welch (1970)
and Tinbergen (1975).
   4
     I limit the discussion of the major trends to the U.S. economy because of space constraints, and also
because there is notably more research to build upon.




                                                    4
          “With the phenomenal rise in average education, why have rates of return
     failed to decline?...
          It is obvious that changes have occurred to prevent the decline in returns
     to acquiring education that would normally accompany a rise in average educa-
     tional level. Presumably, these changes have resulted in growth in demand for
     ... education... su¢cient to absorb the increased supply with constant or rising
     returns.”

The 30 years after Welch wrote these words witnessed a much more rapid increase in the
supply of education, and a sharp increase in the returns to more skilled workers, suggesting
that skill-biased changes in technology continued throughout the postwar period.
    And yet, if technical change has been skill-biased throughout the recent past, why did
inequality increase during the past 30 years, but not before? There are at least two possible
answers to this question. The …rst, which I call the steady-demand hypothesis, maintains
that demand for skills increases at a constant pace, so changes in inequality must be
explained by the pace of the increase in the supply of skills. According to this hypothesis,
inequality was relatively stable before the 1970s, because the rate of skill accumulation in
the U.S. economy was more rapid than the constant pace of skill-biased technical change
(e.g., Katz and Murphy, 1992). The recent increase inequality is then explained not
by a major technological change, but by a relative slowdown in skill accumulation. The
second possible answer comes from the acceleration hypothesis, which maintains that there
has been an acceleration in skill bias beginning in the 1970s or 1980s. According to this
hypothesis, there has been a notable acceleration in the demand for skills, driven in large
part by advances in information technology, and perhaps even approaching the scale of a
“Third Industrial Revolution”.
    So was there an acceleration in skill bias? This question is di¢cult to answer as we
lack direct measures of the degree of skill bias of technologies. To tackle this question,
one therefore needs to look at a variety of evidence often pointing in di¤erent directions.
I conclude below that skill-biased technical change is likely to have accelerated over the
past several decades. This conclusion is based on the sharp increase in overall inequality
starting in the 1970s and on the fact that returns to schooling rose over the past thirty
years despite the unusually rapid increase in the supply of educated workers.
    Why did the demand for skills accelerate over this period? And why has new technology
favored more skilled workers during the twentieth century, but not during the nineteenth
century? One approach would view technology as exogenous, stemming from advances in
science or from the behavior of entrepreneurs driven by a variety of nonpro…t motives.
Demand for skills increased faster during the past thirty years, this approach would main-
tain, because of a technological revolution led by the microchip, personal computers and



                                             5
the Internet.5 New technologies of the nineteenth century were not skill-biased because the
technological frontier then only enabled the invention of skill-replacing techniques.
    Yet, there are a number of problems with this approach. First, although a number
of papers, including Greenwood and Yorukoglu (1997), Hornstein and Krusell (1997), and
Galor and Moav (2000), show that rapid technical change may lead to slower total factor
productivity (TFP) growth, the slow rates of TFP and output growth of the past several
decades are di¢cult to reconcile with a technological revolution during this time period.
Second, demand for skills appears to have accelerated starting in the late 1970s, precisely
when the supply of skills increased very rapidly. Exogenous technology theories do not
explain the timing of this acceleration.6
    An alternative theory maintains instead that new technologies are endogenous and
respond to incentives. It was the large increase in the supply of skilled workers, this
approach claims, that induced the acceleration in the demand for skills. The reasoning
is as follows. When skill-biased techniques are more pro…table, …rms will have greater
incentives to develop and adopt such techniques. A key determinant of the pro…tability of
new technologies is their market size; machines that can be sold in greater numbers will
be more pro…table. Schmookler (1966), in his pioneering study, Invention and Economic
Growth, placed great emphasis on market size. He argued (p. 206) “invention is largely an
economic activity which, like other economic activities, is pursued for gain;... expected gain
varies with expected sales of goods embodying the invention.” This reasoning implies that
machines complementary to skilled workers will be more pro…table to develop when there
are more skilled workers to use them. New technologies have become more skill-biased
throughout most of the twentieth century because the supply of skilled workers has grown
steadily. This perspective also suggests that a faster increase in the supply of skills can lead
to an acceleration in the demand for skills (Acemoglu, 1998). So the timing of the increases
in supply and demand is not a coincidence—instead, it re‡ects technology responding to
the supply of skills. In this theory, rapid skill-biased technical change is not necessarily
associated with rapid overall technical progress. In fact, an acceleration in skill bias could
   5
     See, among others, Krueger (1993), Berman, Bound and Griliches (1994), and Autor, Katz and Krueger
(1998) for evidence that the rapid spread of computers has increased the demand for skills. See Krusell,
Ohanian, Rios-Rull and Violante (2000), Galor and Tsiddon (1997), Greenwood and Yorukoglu (1997),
Aghion and Howitt (1998, chapter 9), Caselli (1999), Galor and Moav (2000), Violante (1999), Rubinstein
and Tsiddon (1999), Aghion, Howitt and Violante (1999), and Gould, Moav and Weinberg (1999) for
models in which rapid technical change increases the demand for skills and causes a rise in inequality.
   6
     Naturally, supply and demand may have moved together because supply responded to demand. I argue
below that the large increase in the supply of educated workers was not in anticipation, or in response to,
high returns, but driven by a variety of other factors. More generally, I often focus on the e¤ect of the
supply of skills on technology not because I view supply as exogenous, but simply because the e¤ect of
supply on technology is more important in understanding the questions posed above. I discuss below how
supply may respond to changes in skill premia, and how this may account for the joint behavior of the
supply of, and demand for, skills over the past century.


                                                    6
cause a TFP slowdown because it creates an imbalance in the composition of R&D.
    This approach also provides a possible explanation for the skill-replacing technical
change of the nineteenth century. The emergence of the most skill-replacing technolo-
gies of the past two hundred years, the factory system, coincided with a large change in
relative supplies. This time, there was a large migration of unskilled workers from vil-
lages and Ireland to English cities (see, for example, Habakkuk, 1962, Bairoch, 1988, or
Williamson, 1990). This increase in the “reserve army of unskilled workers”, slightly para-
phrasing Marx, created pro…t opportunities for …rms to exploit by introducing technologies
that could be used with unskilled workers. In fact, contemporary historians considered the
incentive to replace skilled artisans by unskilled laborers as a major objective of technolog-
ical improvements of the period. Ure, a historian in the …rst half of the nineteenth century,
describes these incentives as follows:

         “It is, in fact, the constant aim and tendency of every improvement in
     machinery to supersede human labor altogether, or to diminish its costs, by
     substituting the industry of women and children for that of men; of that of
     ordinary labourers, for trained artisans.” (quoted in Habakkuk, 1962, p. 154).

These incentives for skill-replacing technologies, I argue, were shaped by the large in-
crease in the supply of unskilled workers. So, it may be precisely the di¤erential changes
in the relative supply of skilled and unskilled workers that explain both the presence of
skill-replacing technical change in the nineteenth century and skill-biased technical change
during the twentieth century.
    A major shortcoming of the “pure technological” approaches—of both exogenous and
endogenous variety—is that they do not provide a natural explanation for the fall in the
wages of low-skill workers. Although a variety of papers, including Caselli (1999), Green-
wood and Yorukoglu (1997), and Galor and Moav (2000), show that technological revolu-
tions may be associated with a fall in the wages of low-skill workers, it is di¢cult to see
how sustained technological change can be associated with an extended period of falling
wages of low-skill workers and stagnant average wages. This leads to the next question for
this essay.
    Why did the real wages of low-skill workers fall over the past several decades? There are
a number of possible answers. First, labor market institutions, for example labor unions,
have undergone important changes over the past 30 years, and these changes may have
reduced the wages of many manufacturing workers, causing an increase in inequality and
a decline in the real wages of low-skill workers (e.g., Freeman, 1991, DiNardo, Fortin and
Lemieux, 1995, Lee, 1999). Second, international trade between skill-scarce less-developed
countries and skill-abundant rich economies has increased over this period, and this may
have put downward pressure on the wages of low-skill workers in the U.S. (e.g., Wood, 1994,

                                              7
Leamer, 1995). Third, there has been a transformation in the way …rms are organized,
or perhaps in the way that …rms and workers match (see, for example, Acemoglu 1999a,
Kremer and Maskin 1999, Bresnahan, 1997, Bresnahan et al, 1999, and Autor, Levy and
Murnane 2000). I argue that neither one of these factors can by itself be the major cause
of the recent changes in the wage structure. But technical change can also a¤ect the
organization of production and the institutions around it; for example, computers may
lead to the emergence of organizations employing mostly skilled workers, with little need
for unskilled workers, or technological developments may weaken the bargaining power
of unions. In fact I believe that organizational change, labor market institutions and
international trade have all interacted with technical change in a fundamental way; as a
result, they ampli…ed the direct e¤ect of technical change on inequality, and likely caused
the decline in the wages of less skilled workers.
    Therefore, the overall picture that emerges is not necessarily one in which technology
is the only factor a¤ecting the distribution of income. On the contrary, the underlying
thesis of this essay is that technology itself is no more than an endogenous actor. Instead,
I argue that to explain the changes in the distribution of income, and to forecast what
other changes may happen in the future, we need to understand the forces that shape
technological progress, and how technology interacts with the overall organization of the
labor market.
    There is considerable uncertainty on many issues, and both more theoretical and em-
pirical work is needed. Two areas deserve special attention. The …rst is the di¤erential
behavior of residual inequality and returns to schooling during the 1970s. Most economists
view changes in residual inequality as related to changes in labor market prices. It is there-
fore puzzling that during the 1970s, while returns to schooling fell, residual and overall
inequality increased. I argue below that models based on a single skill index (one type of
skill or many types of skills that are perfect substitutes) are unable to explain this pattern.
Instead, we need models with multi-dimensional skills. Moreover, for this type of models
to explain the behavior of residual inequality during the 1970s and 1980s, technological
progress needs to change the demand for di¤erent types of skills di¤erentially. The endoge-
nous technology models discussed above provide a possible explanation for why di¤erent
dimensions of skills may have been a¤ected di¤erentially by technical change. Nevertheless,
the reasons for this type of behavior require much more research. More generally, we know
relatively little about the determinants of residual inequality, and this topic is a major
research area for the future. The second area is cross-country di¤erences in the behavior
of wage inequality. While inequality increased sharply in the U.S., the UK and Canada, it
increased much less in Germany and many Scandinavian economies. Although there are
a number of recent papers addressing these questions, much uncertainty still remains. I
conjecture that cross-country di¤erences in wage inequality may re‡ect, in part, technolog-

                                              8
ical choices made by these countries in response to the di¤erent incentives created by their
labor market institutions, but much more research on this topic is required.


2       Empirical Trends
The objective of this section is to illustrate a number of major inequality trends from the
past several decades. My aim is not to o¤er a comprehensive survey of the empirical
literature, but simply to put the most salient trends on the table to anchor the theoretical
discussion (see, e.g., Gottschalk, 1997, Johnson, 1997, Katz and Autor, 2000, for recent
surveys).
    Figure 1 plots a measure of the supply of college skills between 1949 and 1995, con-
structed along the lines of Autor, Katz and Krueger (1998), as the ratio of college equiva-
lents (those with college plus+0.5£those with some college) to noncollege equivalents (those
with high school or less +0.5£those with some college).7 It also plots returns to college.
This picture summarizes many of the salient trends I want to emphasize.8 In particular,
    1. There has been a remarkable increase in the supply of skills in the U.S. economy
over the past sixty years. In 1939, just over 6 percent of American workers were college
graduates. By 1996 this number had increased to over 28 percent. In 1939, almost 68
percent of all workers did not have a high school degree. In 1996, this number had fallen
to less than 10 percent (see, for example, Autor, Katz and Krueger, 1998, Table 1). The
relative supply of skills plotted in Figure 1 provides a summary of these changes.
    2. There has been no tendency for the returns to college to fall in the face of this large
increase in supply—on the contrary, there is an increase in the college premium over this
time period.
    3. Following an acceleration in the supply of skills, returns to college fell sharply dur-
ing the 1970s, leading Richard Freeman to conclude that “Americans are over-educated”
(Freeman, 1976). Returns to college then rose very sharply during the 1980s. This increase
in the returns to schooling has been one of the major motivating facts for the empirical
inequality literature (e.g. Bound and Johnson, 1992, Katz and Murphy, 1992, etc.).
    There have also been important changes in the overall distribution of wages. Figure 2
plots the 90th, 50th and 10th percentiles of the overall wage (weekly earnings) distribution
for white male workers between 1963 and 1997 (with the 1963 values for all series indexed
to 100).9 This …gure illustrates two more important patterns.
    7
     See the Appendix for data details.
    8
     An important issue is whether changes in wage inequality and returns re‡ect changes in the true returns
to skills, or pure composition e¤ects. In the Appendix, I show that pure composition e¤ects cannot be
responsible for these changes, and here I interpret them as changes in the true price of skills.
   9
     Sample constructed as described in the Appendix. I focus here on wage inequality for white men since
labor market participation of women increased substantially over the sample period, and this would likely


                                                     9
    1. Overall wage inequality started to increase sharply in the early 1970s after a period
of relative stability— prior to the 1970s, the 90th, 50th and 10th percentiles of the wage
distribution followed each other closely, but came apart sharply in the 1970s.
    2. Median wages stagnated from 1975 onwards, while workers at the 10th percentile
of the wage distribution (i.e., “low-skill workers”) saw their earnings fall in real terms to
levels even below those in 1963.10
    Figure 3 plots turns to another measure: residual (within-group) inequality, which shows
inequality among observationally equivalent workers. This …gure displays three measures
of residual inequality among white male workers between 1963 and 1997: 50-10, 90-50 and
0.5 times 90-10 log wage residual di¤erentials (I plot 0.5 times 90-10 wage di¤erentials in
order to …t this on the same scale as the other measures).
    To calculate these measures, I look at the residuals from a standard Mincerian wage
regression of the form

                                          ln wit = Xit0 ¯ t + vit ;                                      (1)

where wit is weekly earnings for individual i observed in year t, and Xit is a set of controls
which here include nine education dummies, a quartic in experience, and region controls
(constructed from the March CPSs; see the Appendix for details of the sample). The
fact that ¯ t is indexed by t indicates that returns to these observed characteristics are
allowed to vary from year-to-year. The measures of residual inequality are calculated as
the di¤erence between the 90th and the 10th (or 50th and 10th, etc.) percentile values
of the residual distribution from this regression, vit . Residual inequality appears to have
increased very much in tandem with overall inequality—it shows a sharp increase starting
in the early 1970s.11 Remarkably, all three measures of residual inequality behave very
contribute to the composition e¤ects. Moreover, male-female wage di¤erence narrowed substantially over
the same time period as well. School quality for black men also underwent signi…cant transformation (e.g.,
Welch, 1973, Card and Krueger, 1992), and this could create signi…cant composition e¤ects.
   10
      Average wages, like median wages, have also stagnated. For example, white men aged 30-49 earned
$409 a week in 1999 dollars in 1949, and $793 in 1969, which corresponds approximately to a 3.4 percent a
year increase in real wages between 1949 and 1969. In contrast, the same age group earned $909 in 1989,
or experienced only a 0.6 percent a year increase between 1969 and 1989 (all numbers author’s calculation
from census data). The behavior of the median and average wage growth depends on the consumption
de‡ator. I have followed the literature here in using the personal consumption expenditure de‡ator. It has
been argued that this de‡ator overstates in‡ation because of di¢culties in measuring quality change (e.g.,
Boskin, et al., 1995). Even in the presence of such measurement problems, unless there is an “acceleration”
in this bias exactly around the 1970s, a large gap remains between the rate of increase of real wages before
and after the 1970s.
   Nevertheless, it has to be noted that part of this gap is due to the increase importance of nonwage income
and bene…ts. In fact, thanks to the increase in bene…ts, the share of labor in national income has not
fallen over this period (see, e.g., Krueger, 1999). So whether average wages have stagnated or continued to
increase in line with output growth depends on how bene…ts are valued relative to earnings.
   11
      DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1995) show that wage inequality appears to increase starting in the


                                                     10
similarly, suggesting that forces a¤ecting the top of the wage distribution (90-50) are also
a¤ecting the bottom of the wage distribution (50-10). Finally, note an important contrast
between Figure 1 and Figures 2 and 3. While returns to schooling fell during the 1970s,
overall and residual inequality increased. I return to this issue later in the essay.


3     Introduction to the Theory of Skill Premia
While, undoubtedly, many factors a¤ect the distribution of wages, a natural starting point
for an economic analysis is that of supply and demand. In the introduction to his pioneering
study of income distribution, Tinbergen (1975, p. 15) wrote

           “...what matters is the di¤erence between qualities available and qualities
      required by the demand side, that is by the organization of production.” (italics
      in the original).

    This is where I begin as well. I introduce a simple framework which links wages to
supply of skills and to demand generated by the technology possibilities frontier of the
economy. In this framework, there are two types of workers, skilled and unskilled (high
and low education workers), who are imperfect substitutes. Imperfect substitution between
the two types of workers is important in understanding how changes in relative supplies
a¤ect skill premia. For now I think of the unskilled workers as those with a high school
diploma, and the skilled workers as those with a college degree. So the focus in this section
is on returns to schooling (or between-group inequality), and I use the terms “skill” and
education interchangeably. In practice, education and skills are only imperfectly correlated,
so it is useful to bear in mind that since there are skilled and unskilled workers within the
same education group, an increase in the returns to skills will also lead to an increase in
within-group inequality.
    Suppose that there are L (t) unskilled (low education) workers and H (t) skilled (high
education) workers, supplying labor inelastically at time t. All workers are risk neutral,
and maximize (the present value of) labor income. Also suppose that labor markets are
competitive.12
    The production function for the aggregate economy takes the form

                                  Y (t) = F [K (t) ; L (t) ; H (t) ; t]
1980s in the May Current Population Survey (CPS) data. In the Appendix, I provide numbers from the
survey by Katz and Autor (2000) showing consistent increases in wage inequality during the 1970s from
March and May CPS data, and from census data.
  12
     Although noncompetitive factors are likely to be important in accounting for wage di¤erentials in Eu-
ropean economies, competitive labor markets seem a good starting place in the analysis of wage inequality
in the U.S. labor market.


                                                   11
where K (t) is capital, and the production function explicitly depends on time to capture
technical change. I have also imposed full employment. Although all the results of interest
hold for a general constant returns to scale F (:) function, to simplify the discussion I
specialize it to the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) form,

                               Y (t) = [(Al (t) L (t))½ + (Ah (t) H (t))½ ]1=½ ;                        (2)

where ½ · 1. I also ignore capital. I drop the time argument when this causes no confusion.
    The elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled workers in this production
function is ¾ ´ 1= (1 ¡ ½). I refer to skilled and unskilled workers as gross substitutes when
the elasticity of substitution ¾ > 1 (or ½ > 0), and gross complements when ¾ < 1 (or ½ <
0). Three noteworthy special cases are: (i) ¾ ! 0 (or ½ ! ¡1) when skilled and unskilled
workers will be Leontie¤, and output can be produced only by using skilled and unskilled
workers in …xed portions; (ii) ¾ ! 1 when skilled and unskilled workers are perfect
substitutes, and (iii) ¾ ! 1, when the production function tends to the Cobb Douglas
case. The value of the elasticity of substitution will play a crucial role in the interpretation
of the results that follow. In particular, in this framework, technologies either increase
the productivity of skilled or unskilled workers, i.e., there are no explicitly skill-replacing
or unskilled-labor-replacing technologies.13 But, as we will see below, depending on the
value of the elasticity of substitution, an increase in Ah can act either to complement or to
“replace” skilled workers.
    The production function (2) admits three di¤erent interpretations.
    1. There is only one good, and skilled and unskilled workers are imperfect substitutes
in the production of this good.
    2. The production function (2) is also equivalent to an economy where consumers have
utility function [Yl½ + Yh½ ]1=½ de…ned over two goods. Good Yh is produced using only
skilled workers, and Yl is produced using only unskilled workers, with production functions
Yh = Ah H, and Yl = Al L.
    3. A mixture of the above two whereby di¤erent sectors produce goods that are imper-
fect substitutes, and high and low education workers are employed in all sectors.
  13
       A more general formulation would replace equation (2) with the production function

                    Y (t) = [(1 ¡ bt )(Al (t) L (t) + Bl (t))½ + bt (Ah (t) H (t) + Bh (t))½ ]1=½ ;

where Bl and Bh would be directly unskilled-labor and skill-replacing technologies, and an increase in bt
would correspond to some of the tasks previously performed by the unskilled being taken over by the skilled
(see, e.g., Johnson and Sta¤ord, 1999, on this). For most of the analysis here, there is little to be gained
from this more general production function (but see Section 5.3).




                                                          12
    Although the third interpretation is more realistic, I generally use one of the …rst two,
as they are easier to discuss. Since labor markets are competitive, the unskilled wage is
                                     @Y
                              wL =      = A½l [A½l + A½h (H=L)½ ](1¡½)=½ :                              (3)
                                     @L
This equation implies @wL =@H=L > 0: as the fraction of skilled workers in the labor force
increases, the wages of unskilled workers should increase. Similarly, the skilled wage is
                                    @Y      £                  ¤(1¡½)=½
                            wH =       = A½h A½l (H=L)¡½ + A½h          ;
                                    @H
which yields @wH =@H=L < 0; everything else equal, as skilled workers become more abun-
dant, their wages should fall.
   Combining these two equations, the skill premium—the wage of skilled workers divided
by the wage of unskilled workers—is14
                                µ        ¶½ µ       ¶¡(1¡½)       µ        ¶(¾¡1)=¾ µ       ¶¡1=¾

Equation (4) can be rewritten in a more convenient form by taking logs,
                                          µ ¶          µ ¶
                                 ¾¡1       Ah      1    H

                                   ¾       Al     ¾      L

       Naturally, the skill premium increases when skilled workers become more scarce, i.e.,
                                             @ ln !    1
                                                    = ¡ < 0:                                            (6)
                                           @ ln H=L    ¾

This is the usual substitution e¤ect, and shows that for given skill bias of technology, as
captured by Ah =Al , the relative demand curve for skill is downward sloping with elasticity
1=¾ = (1¡½). Intuitively, an increase in H=L can create two di¤erent types of substitutions.
First, if skilled and unskilled workers are producing the same good, but performing di¤erent
functions, an increase in the number of skilled workers will necessitate a substitution of
skilled workers for tasks previously performed by the unskilled. Second, if skilled and
unskilled workers are producing di¤erent goods, the greater number of skilled workers will
lead to a substitution of the consumption of the unskilled good by the skilled good. In
both cases, this substitution hurts the relative earnings of skilled workers.
    Figure 4 draws the relative demand for skills as captured by equation (5) against the
relative supply of skills, H=L, which is taken to be given for the purposes of this exercise.
  14
    For some parameter values, skilled workers may have lower wages than the unskilled, i.e. ! · 1. One
                     ³ ´¾¡1
may want to impose A    h
                       Al     >H L , to avoid this. Alternatively, one could assume that skilled workers can
use the technologies normally used by the unskilled, Al , and be more productive at this than the unskilled.

                                                        13
An increase in the relative supply, from H=L to H 0 =L0 , moves the equilibrium point along
the downward sloping relative demand curve, and reduces the skill premium from ! to ! 0 .
    An interesting case study of the response of the returns to schooling to an increase in
the supply of skills is provided by the experience in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during
the 1980s. As Angrist (1995) illustrates, there was a very large increase in the supply of
skilled Palestinian labor as there opened Palestinian institutions of higher education, which
were totally absent before 1972. Angrist shows that premia to college graduate workers
(relative to high school graduates) that were as high as 40 percent quickly fell to less than 20
percent. The extent of substitution was also clear. First, many college graduate workers
could not …nd employment in skilled jobs. Angrist (1995) shows a sharp increase in the
unemployment rate of college graduates, and Schi¤ and Yaari (1989) report that only one
in eight Palestinian graduates could …nd work in his profession, with the rest working as
unskilled laborers, mainly in the construction industry. Second, premia for tasks usually
performed by more educated workers fell sharply. Between 1984 and 1987, the premium
for administrative and managerial jobs (relative to manual laborers) fell from .32 to .12,
while the premium for clerical workers fell from .02 to -.08 (see Angrist, 1995, for details).
    As equation (6) shows, the elasticity of substitution, ¾, is important for the behavior of
the skill premium when supply changes. The elasticity of substitution is also crucial for
the response of the skill premium to changes in technology. Unfortunately, this parameter
is rather di¢cult to estimate, since it refers to an elasticity of substitution that combines
substitution both within and across industries. Nevertheless, there are a number of esti-
mates using aggregate data that give a range of plausible values. The majority of these
estimates are between ¾ = 1 and 2 (see, for example, Freeman, 1986).15 The response of
college premium for Palestinian labor reported in Angrist (1995), for example, implies an
elasticity of substitution between workers with 16 years of schooling and those with less
than 12 of schooling of approximately ¾ = 2.
    Given the focus of this essay, it is useful to know how the skill premium responds
to technology. Di¤erentiation of (5) shows that the result depends on the elasticity of
substitution. If ¾ > 1 (i.e., ½ 2 (0; 1]), then
                                               @!
                                                    > 0;
                                             @Ah=Al
i.e., improvements in the skill-complementary technology increase the skill premium. This
can be seen in Figure 4 as a shift out of the relative demand curve, which moves the skill
premium from ! to ! 00 . The converse is obtained when ¾ < 1: that is, when ¾ < 1,
an improvement in the productivity of skilled workers, Ah , relative to the productivity of
  15
    These estimates are obtained from time-series or from cross-sectional data. The estimation strategies
rely on a variety of assumptions, such as constant time trends in the demand for skills as in the work by
Katz and Murphy (1992), so need to be interpreted with caution.

                                                   14
unskilled workers, Al , shifts the relative demand curve in and reduces the skill premium.
This case appears paradoxical at …rst, but is, in fact, quite intuitive. Consider, for exam-
ple, a Leontie¤ (…xed proportions) production function. In this case, when Ah increases
and skilled workers become more productive, the demand for unskilled workers, who are
necessary to produce more output by working with the more productive skilled workers,
increases by more than the demand for skilled workers. In some sense, in this case, the in-
crease in Ah is creating an “excess supply” of skilled workers given the number of unskilled
workers. This excess supply increases the unskilled wage relative to the skilled wage. This
observation raises an important caveat. It is tempting to interpret improvements in tech-
nologies used by skilled workers, Ah , as “skill-biased”. However, when the elasticity of
substitution is less than 1, it will be advances in technologies used with unskilled workers,
Al , that increase the relative productivity and wages of skilled workers, and an increase in
Ah relative to Al will be “skill-replacing”.
     Nevertheless, the conventional wisdom is that the skill premium increases when skilled
workers become relatively more—not relatively less—productive, which is consistent with
¾ > 1. In fact, as noted above, most estimates show an elasticity of substitution between
skilled and unskilled workers greater than 1.
     It is also useful to compute average wages in this economy. Without controlling for
changes in the educational composition of the labor force, the average wage is

                           LwL + HwH   [(Al L)½ + (Ah H)½ ]1=½
                        w=           =                         ;                          (7)
                             L+H              1 + H=L

which is also increasing in H=L as long as the skill premium is positive (i.e., ! > 1 or
A½h (H=L)½ ¡ A½l > 0). Intuitively, as the skill composition of the labor force improves,
wages will increase.
     Our results so far imply that in response to an increase in H=L:
     1. Relative wages of skilled workers, the skill premium ! = wH =wL , decreases.
     2. Wages of unskilled workers increase.
     3. Wages of skilled workers decrease.
     4. Average wages (without controlling for education) rise.
     These results can be easily generalized to the case in which physical capital also enters
the production function, and the same comparative statics hold even when the economy
has an upward sloping supply of capital. It is also useful to highlight the implications of an
increase in Ah on wage levels. First, an increase in Ah , with Al constant, corresponds to
an increase in Ah =Al ; the implications of this change on the skill premium were discussed
above. Moreover if Ah increases, everything else being equal, we expect both the wages
of unskilled and skilled workers (and therefore average wages) to increase: technological
improvements always increase all wages. This observation is important to bear in mind

                                             15
since, as shown in Section 2, the wages of low-skill workers fell over the past 30 years.
    The most central result for our purposes is that as H=L increases, the skill premium,
!, should fall. In terms of Figure 4, the increase in supply corresponds to a rightward
shift in the vertical line from H=L to H 0 =L0 , which would move the economy along the
downward sloping demand curve for skills. But this tendency of the skill premium to fall
could be counteracted by changes in technology, as captured by ¾¡1  ¾
                                                                       ln(Ah =Al ). Therefore,
this simple formulation encapsulates the essence of the two forces that Tinbergen (1975)
emphasized;
          “The two preponderant forces at work are technological development, which
      made for a relative increase in demand and hence in the income ratio... and
      increased access to schooling, which made for a relative decrease”, (p. 35, italics
      in the original).

    As discussed in the empirical trends section, the past 60 years, and particularly the past
30 years, have witnessed a rapid increase in the supply of skills, H=L, but no corresponding
fall in the skill premium. This implies that demand for skills must have increased—as a
result of Tinbergen’s “technological development”—to prevent the relative wages of skilled
workers from declining. Although in richer models there could be other factors leading
to such a steady increase in the demand for skills, the cause highlighted by this simple
framework, skill-biased technical change, is the most natural candidate. More explicitly,
the relative productivity of skilled workers, (Ah =Al )(¾¡1)=¾ , must have increased.
    The increase in (Ah =Al )(¾¡1)=¾ can be interpreted in a number of di¤erent ways. In a
two-good economy, such skill-biased technical change corresponds to an increase in Ah =Al
and ½ > 0 (¾ > 1)—i.e., skilled workers become more productive. Skill-biased technical
change could also take the form of a decrease in Ah =Al and ½ < 0 (¾ < 1). In this case
the “physical” productivity of unskilled workers would increase, but their relative wages
would fall due to relative price e¤ects. Alternatively, with the one-good interpretation,
skill-biased technical change simply corresponds to an increase in (Ah =Al )(¾¡1)=¾ .
    Some back-of-the-envelope calculations provide a sense of the rise in Ah =Al implied by
the changes in the structure of wages and employment. Autor, Katz and Krueger (1998)
report employment and wage bill shares for di¤erent groups of workers in their Appendix
Table A1. If we assume a speci…c value for ¾, we can translate these numbers into changes
in Ah =Al . In particular, notice that the relative wage bill of skilled workers is given by
                                         µ ¶(¾¡1)=¾ µ ¶(¾¡1)=¾
                                wH H       Ah             H
                          SH =         =                              :                     (8)
                                 wL L      Al             L
Hence, we have
                                               ¾=(¾¡1)
                                       Ah  S
                                          = H    :                                          (9)
                                       Al    H=L

                                              16
    In Table 1, I calculate the implied Ah =Al values for ¾ = 1:4 and for ¾ = 2 using
workers with some college, college graduates, and college equivalents de…nitions of Autor,
Katz and Krueger (1998)—see their paper for more a detailed analysis that controls for
potential composition e¤ects. In all cases, there is a very large implied increase in Ah =Al
and (Ah =Al )(¾¡1)=¾ . For example, the numbers indicate that, assuming an elasticity of
substitution of 1:4, the relative productivity of college graduates, Ah =Al , was approximately
0:030 in 1960, increased to 0:069 in 1970, and to 0:157 in 1980. Between 1980 and 1990, it
increased by a factor of almost three to reach 0:470. As equation (5) shows, changes in the
                               ¾¡1
demand index D = (Ah =Al ) ¾ may be more informative than changes in Ah =Al , so Table
1 also gives the evolution of D.
    The view that the post-war period is characterized by skill-biased technical change also
receives support from the within-industry changes in employment patterns. With constant
technology, an increase in the relative price of a factor should depress its usage in all sectors.
Since the college premium increased after 1979, with constant technology, there should be
fewer college graduates employed in all sectors—and the sectoral composition should adjust
in order to clear the market. The evidence is very much the opposite. Berman, Bound
and Griliches (1994) and Murphy and Welch (1993) show a steady increase in the share of
college labor in all sectors.
    This discussion leads to my …rst conclusion, which I highlight for future reference.

Conclusion 1 The past sixty years must have been characterized by skill-biased technical
change.

    Furthermore, Goldin and Katz (1998) provide evidence of technology-skill complemen-
tarity during the 1910s and 1920s. In light of this evidence, one might consider the bulk of
the twentieth century to be characterized by skill-biased technical change, though whether
technical change during the early twentieth century was skill-biased or not is not central
for the focus of this paper.


4     Steady-Demand and Acceleration Hypotheses
The previous section highlighted the importance of skill-biased technical change over the
past several decades. But why has technical change been skill-biased? And is there any
pattern to the rate at which new technologies become more skill-biased? These are the
questions I address in the rest of this essay. A …rst hypothesis is that the skill-biased
technical change takes place steadily—at a constant pace—over time. Alfred Marshall
begins the Principles of Economics by arguing that “Nature does not make jumps.” It
is then perhaps natural to begin with a hypothesis in which skill-biased technical change


                                               17
does not make jumps, but progresses steadily. The alternative would be a process which
is at times more skill-biased than others—or even labor-biased during some episodes. In
this section, I contrast the steady-demand hypothesis, which maintains that skill-biased
technical change has progressed at a constant pace over the post-war period, against the
acceleration hypothesis, which sees a break with past trends during recent decades.

4.1     Steady-Demand Hypothesis
According this hypothesis, there has been no major change in the structure of demand
for skills. Versions of this story have been suggested by Freeman (1976), and it has been
proposed as an explanation for the changes in the wage structure during the 1970s and the
1980s by Katz and Murphy (1992).
    In a simple form, this hypothesis can be captured by writing
                                      µ        ¶
                                        Ah (t)
                                   ln            = ° 0 + ° 1 t;                      (10)
                                        Al (t)
where t is calendar time. Substituting this equation into (5), we obtain
                                                           µ ¶
                                ¾¡1       ¾¡1          1     H
                         ln ! =      °0 +       ° 1 t ¡ ln       :                               (11)
                                 ¾           ¾         ¾     L
    It is useful to link this equation to the two forces discussed above, and emphasized by
Tinbergen (1975). According to equation (11), “technological developments” take place at
a constant rate, but the supply of skilled workers could grow at di¤erent rates. Therefore,
changes in the returns to skills are caused by uneven growth in the supply of skills. When
H=L grows faster than the rate of skill-biased technical change, (¾ ¡ 1) ° 1 , the skill premium
will fall, and when the supply growth falls short of this rate, the skill premium will increase.
The story has obvious appeal since the 1970s, when returns to schooling fell sharply, were
a period of faster than usual increase in the supply of college graduate workers as Figure
1 and Table 1 show. In contrast, the 1980s were a period of slow increase in the supply of
skills relative to the 1970s. Katz and Murphy (1992) estimate a version of equation (11)
above using aggregate data between 1963-1987.16 They …nd
                                                             ¡ ¢
                                ln ! = 0:033 ¢ t ¡0:71 ¢ ln H  L
                                        (0:01)    (0:15)
This approach does fairly well in capturing the salient features of the changes in the college
premium between 1963 and 1987.17 In fact, Katz and Murphy show that the predicted
  16
     They use the relative supply of college equivalent workers. This is de…ned as college
graduates+0.29£some college-0.05£high school dropouts divided by high school graduates+0.69£some
college+0.93£high school dropouts.
  17
     More recently, Murphy, Riddle and Romer (1998) have argued this for Canada and the U.S., and Card
and Lemieux (2000) for the U.S., Canada and the U.K..

                                                 18
values from the above equation are quite close to the observed movements in the college
premium. This implies that we can think of the U.S. labor market since 1963 as char-
acterized by an elasticity of substitution between college graduate workers and noncollege
workers of about ¾ = 1=0:71 ¼ 1:4, and an annual increase in the demand for skills at the
rate of about 3.3 percent. The increase in the college premium during the 1980s is then
explained by the slowdown in the rate of growth of supply of college graduates.
    Nevertheless, there are a number of reasons for preferring a cautious interpretation of
this regression evidence. The regression uses only 25 aggregate observations, and there is
signi…cant serial correlation in the college premium (as also noted by Katz and Murphy).
If the true data were generated by an acceleration in skill bias and a larger value of the
elasticity of substitution, this regression could estimate a smaller elasticity of substitution
and no acceleration in the demand for skills (see below on this). For example, Katz and
Murphy show that if the true elasticity of substitution is ¾ = 4, a signi…cant acceleration in
the skill bias of technical change is required to explain the data. Moreover, from the wage
bill share data reported above, Autor, Katz and Krueger (1998) conclude that even for
the range of the values for the elasticity of substitution between ¾ = 1 and 2, skill-biased
technical change is likely to have been more rapid during the 1980s than the 1970s. This
                                                                                            ¾¡1
can also be seen in Table 4 above, where, for most measures, the increase in (Ah =Al ) ¾
appears much larger between 1980 and 1990 than in other decades. I therefore do not
consider this regression evidence as conclusive, and turn to discuss more detailed evidence
on this issue.

4.2     Evidence on Steady-Demand versus Acceleration
The …rst piece of evidence often put forth in support of an acceleration relates to the role
of computers in the labor market. Krueger (1993) has argued that computers have changed
the structure of wages, and showed that workers using computers are paid more, and this
computer wage premium has increased over time. Although this pattern is striking, it
is not particularly informative about the presence or acceleration of skill-biased technical
change. It is hard to know whether the computer wage premium is for computer skills, or
whether it is even related to the widespread use of computers in the labor market. For
example, DiNardo and Pischke (1997), and Enhorf and Kramartz (1998) show that the
computer wage premium is likely to be a premium for unobserved skills.18
    The second set of evidence comes from the cross-industry studies of, among others,
Berman, Bound and Griliches (1994), Autor, Katz and Krueger (1998), and Machin and
  18
    Equally, however, it would be wrong to interpret the …ndings of DiNardo and Pischke (1997) and
Enhorf and Kramartz (1998) as evidence against and acceleration in skill-biased technical change, since,
as argued below, such technical change would increase the market prices for a variety of skills, including
unobserved skills.


                                                   19
Van Rennan (1998). These papers document that almost all industries began employing
more educated workers during the 1970s and the 1980s. They also show that more com-
puterized industries have experienced more rapid skill upgrading, i.e., they have increased
their demand for college-educated workers more rapidly. For example, Autor, Katz and
Krueger run regressions of changes in the college wage-bill share in three digit industries
on computer use between 1984 and 1993. They …nd, for example, that

                             ¢Sc80¡90 = .287   + .147¢cu84¡93
                                        (.108)   (.046)


                             ¢Sc90¡96 = -.171 + .289¢cu84¡93
                                        (.196)  (.081)

where ¢Sc denotes the annual change in the wage bill share of college graduates in that
industry (between the indicated dates), and ¢cu84¡93 is the increase in the fraction of
workers using computers in that industry between 1984 and 1993. These regressions are
informative since the college wage bill share is related to the demand for skills as shown by
equation (9). The results indicate that in an industry where computer use increases by 10
percent, the college wage bill share grows by about 0.015 percent faster every year between
1980 and 1990, and 0.03 percent faster in every year between 1990 and 1996.
    Although this evidence is suggestive, it does not establish that there has been a change
in the trend growth of skill-biased technology. As pointed out in Conclusion 1 above, the
only way to make sense of post-war trends is to incorporate skill-biased technical change
over the whole period. Moreover, Goldin and Katz (1998) present evidence suggesting that
capital-skill complementarity may have been as high during 1910s as during the recent
period because of increased demand for skills coming from the introduction of electricity
in most manufacturing processes. Similarly, even though there were few computers in
workplaces before the 1970s, other technological developments may have increased demand
for skills as rapidly as —or more rapidly than—computers. Therefore, the question is
whether computers and the associated information technology advances have increased the
demand for skills more than other technologies did during the 1950s and 1960s, or even
earlier. This question cannot be answered by documenting that computerized industries
demand more skilled workers.
    Cross-industry studies also may not reveal the true impact of computers on the demand
for skills, since industries that are highly computerized may demand more skilled workers
for other reasons as well.19 In fact, when Autor Katz and Krueger (1998) run the above
  19
     Doms, Dunne, and Troske (1997) show that new technologies (but not computers) are adopted by
plants that have more skilled and more highly paid workers, and these plants do not increase their wages
or demand for skills after the implementation of these technologies.


                                                  20
regressions for 1960-1970 college wage bill shares, they obtain

                               ¢Sc60¡70 = .085   + .071¢cu84¡93
                                          (.058)   (.025)

Therefore, industries investing more in computers during the 1980s were already experienc-
ing more skill upgrading during the 1960s, before the arrival of computers (though perhaps
slower, since the coe¢cient here is about half of that between 1980 and 1990). This suggests
that at least part of the increase in the demand for skills coming from highly computerized
industries may not be the direct e¤ect of computers, but re‡ect an ongoing long-run shift
towards more skilled workers. In this light, faster skill upgrading by highly computerized
industries is not inconsistent with the steady-demand hypothesis.
    The third, and probably most powerful, piece of evidence also comes from Autor, Katz
and Krueger (1998). They document that the supply of skills grew faster between 1970
and 1995 than between 1940 and 1970—by 3.06 percent a year during the latter period
compared to 2.36 percent a year during the earlier 30 years. In contrast, returns to college
increased between 1970 and 1995 by about 0.39 percent a year, while they fell by about
0.11 percent a year during the earlier period. If demand for skills had increased at a steady
pace, the skill premium should have also fallen since 1970.20 Moreover, Autor, Katz and
Krueger (1998) document greater within-industry skill upgrading in the 1970s, 1980s and
1990s than in 1960s, which is also consistent with more rapid skill-biased technical change
during these later decades.
    A simple regression analysis also con…rms this point. I combined the data from the
March CPSs and decennial censuses used in Figure 1 above. Using these data, a regression
similar to that of Katz and Murphy for the period 1939-1996 yields similar results:
                                                            ¡ ¢
                              ln ! = 0:025 ¢ t ¡0:56 ¢ ln H  L
                                                                ;
                                       (0:01)     (0:20)

with an R2 of 0.63 and an implied elasticity of substitution of 1.8, which is somewhat
larger than the estimate of Katz and Murphy. However, adding higher order terms in
time (i.e., time squared, time cubed, etc.) improves the …t of the model considerably, and
these higher-order terms are signi…cant. In Figure 5, I plot the implied time trends from
  20
     Returns to college fell between 1940 and 1970 because they are estimated to be very high in the 1940
census. There may be reasons to be suspicious of data quality from this census, because (i) the education
variable was di¤erent, (ii) there may have been an overstatement of years of schooling, possibly by as much
as a factor of 1.5 or 2 for some cohorts, and (iii) there was no self-employment income in this census. But it
is not clear whether any of the measurement problems will cause an upward bias in the college premium. In
any case, the level of the college premium from this census is not out of line with other historical evidence
(see, e.g., Goldin and Katz, 2000). Moreover Autor, Katz and Krueger show that even ignoring data from
the 1940 census, there is evidence for an acceleration in the skill bias of technical change. For example, for
the range of the values for the elasticity of substitution between ¾ = 1 and 2, skill-biased technical change
appears more rapid during the 1980s than in the 1970s and 1960s.

                                                     21
regressions with higher-order terms as well as the linear trend (all numbers were rescaled to
…t in one graph). All three of these more ‡exible time trends show an acceleration in the
relative demand for skills during the 1970s or 1980 (the quadratic and cubic time trends
are almost identical, hence practically indistinguishable in the …gure).
    A fourth piece of evidence comes from Greenwood and Yorukoglu (1997) and Krusell,
Ohanian, Rios-Rull and Violante (2000). These authors argue, based on the work of
Griliches (1969), that equipment capital is more complementary to skilled workers than
unskilled workers. This premise may be reasonable since advances in equipment often ap-
pear to substitute machines for tasks previously performed by unskilled workers. Following
the work by Gordon (1990) and Greenwood, Hercowitz and Krusell (1997), these papers
document that the post-war period has witnessed a secular decline in the relative price of
equipment capital, and argue that the associated increase in the stock of equipment capital
has led to skill-biased technical change. Moreover, they argue that this relative decline
accelerated in the early 1970s, and the associated acceleration in the stock of equipment
capital increased the demand for skills.
    Krusell, Ohanian, Rios-Rull and Violante (2000) formalize their approach by assuming
the following production function
                        h                 ¡                       ¢¹=¸ i(1¡®)=¹
                 Y = Ks® b1 L¹ + (1 ¡ b1 ) b2 Ke¸ + (1 ¡ b2 ) H ¸

where Ks is structures capital (such as buildings), and Ke is equipment capital (such
as machines). The parameter ¾ 1 = 1= (1 ¡ ¸) is the elasticity of substitution between
equipment and skilled workers, and ¾ 2 = 1= (1 ¡ ¹) is the elasticity of substitution between
unskilled workers and the equipment-skilled worker aggregate. If ¾ 1 > ¾ 2 (i.e., ¹ > ¸),
equipment capital is more complementary to skilled workers than unskilled workers, and as
a result, an increase in Ke will increase the wages of skilled workers more than the wages
of unskilled workers. More formally, the skill premium in this model is
                                               ¡                       ¢(¹¡¸)=¸
                 wH   (1 ¡ b2 ) (1 ¡ b1 ) H ¸¡1 b2 Ke¸ + (1 ¡ b2 ) H ¸
              !=    =                                                           :        (12)
                 wL                            b1 L¹¡1
Di¤erentiation of (12) shows that as long as ¹ > ¸, @!=@Ke > 0. So provided that
equipment capital is more complementary to skilled workers than unskilled workers, an
increase in the quantity of equipment capital will increase the demand for skills. Since the
post-war period has been characterized by a decline in the relative price of equipment goods,
there will be an associated increase in the quantity of equipment capital, Ke , increasing
the demand for skills steadily.
    Figure 6, which plots the log of this relative price series, shows the faster proportional
decline after the 1970s. The behavior of the relative price series then suggests that there


                                               22
may have been an acceleration in the substitution of equipment capital for labor, causing
more rapid skill-biased technical change.
    Nevertheless, there are serious di¢culties in adjusting capital prices for quality. This
suggests that we may want to be cautious in interpreting this evidence. Another problem
comes from the fact that, as I will discuss in more detail below, a variety of other evidence
does not support the notion of faster technological progress since 1974, which is a basic
tenet of this approach. Finally, one would presume that if, in fact, the decline in the
relative price of equipment capital is related to the increase in the demand for skills, then
in a regression of equation (11) as in the work by Katz and Murphy (1992), it should
proxy for the demand for skills and perform better than a linear time trend. Table 2
reports a series of regressions which show that, on the contrary, the level or the log of the
relative price of equipment capital is not signi…cant in such regressions. Column 1 shows
the equivalent of the regression by Katz and Murphy (1992) with only a time trend and the
relative supply of skills. Columns 2 and 3 show regressions that replace the time trend with
the level and log of the relative price of equipment capital. These terms are signi…cant,
but the …t of the regression is worse than the one in Column 1. The remainder of the
table shows that once these terms are entered simultaneously with a time trend, the time
trend is signi…cant, while there is no evidence that the relative price of equipment capital
matters for the demand for skills. This evidence casts some doubt on the view that the
relative price of equipment capital is directly linked to the demand for skills and that its
faster decline since 1970s indicates an acceleration in skill bias.
    A …nal piece of evidence comes from the behavior of overall and residual inequality over
the past several decades. As Section 2 documented, overall wage inequality was fairly
stable until the 1970s. Since 1970, both overall and residual wage inequality have risen
sharply. This increase in inequality weighs in favor of a marked change in labor market
prices and demand for skills. This argument is based on the interpretation of changes in
residual inequality as re‡ecting changes in labor market prices, a thesis put forth by Juhn,
Murphy and Pierce (1993).21 A concrete example might clarify why residual inequality is
linked to the demand for skills. Suppose that two otherwise identical individuals di¤er in
terms of their unobserved skills (for example, in terms of interpersonal skills, motivation,
speci…c skills for their job, or IQ).22 Denote the unobserved skill of individual 1 by a1 and
  21
      Of course, and alternative—and more cynical— view would be to interpret residual inequality as “a
measure of our ignorance”. When a standard wage regression such as (1) provides a good …t, the residuals
will be less disperse. Nevertheless, given the variety of skills that we are unable to measure in standard
data sets, much of the residual will plausibly re‡ect rewards to some unobserved skills.
   22
      By unobserved skills, I mean skills that are not observed by the econometrician. These skills could
be—and are likely to be— observed by employers. This type of skills are often referred to as “unobserved
ability”. This does not imply that these unobserved skills are necessarily synonymous with IQ or other
single dimensional skill indices.



                                                   23
that of individual 2 by a2 > a1 , and assume that wages are given by

                                         ln wit = 2µt ai + ° t hi ;                                   (13)

where ° t is the price of h skills at time t, while µt is the price of a skills. Since these
individuals are identical in all respects other than their unobserved skills, a, we have that
the variance of log wages (or of residual wages) among these two individuals is

                                     V ar(ln w) = µ2t (a2 ¡ a1 )2 :

Now if at a later date, t0 , this variance increases to V ar(ln w)0 , and we know that these
two individuals are still identical in all other respects and that a2 ¡ a1 has not changed, we
can interpret the increase in V ar(ln w) as re‡ecting an increase in the price of unobserved
skills, µt . The discussion in the Appendix shows that the bulk of the increase in overall
and residual inequality cannot be explained by composition e¤ects, so this increase is most
likely due to a rise in the price of and demand for unobserved skills during the 1970s.
    Overall, there is a variety of evidence suggesting an acceleration in skill bias over the
past 25 or 30 years. Although not all evidence is equally convincing, the rise in the returns
to schooling over the past 30 years, despite the very rapid increase in the supply of skills,
and the behavior of overall and residual inequality since the 1970s suggest a marked shift
in the demand for skills over the past several decades. I therefore tentatively conclude:23

Conclusion 2 The behavior of returns schooling and residual inequality over the past
three decades suggest an acceleration in the demand for skills beginning in the 1970s or
1980s.


5      Acceleration in Skill Bias
What explains the more rapid increase in the demand for skills over the past several
decades? There are a number of alternatives. The …rst is a change in labor market in-
stitutions. The second is the role of increased international trade. The third is more rapid
skill-biased technical change. I argue in Section 6 that changes in labor market insti-
tutions and the increased importance of international trade cannot explain the change in
labor market prices by themselves. Moreover, the evidence discussed in Section 4 is con-
sistent with new technologies playing an important role in changing the wage structure. So
here I begin with changes in technologies, and in particular discuss “pure technological”
approaches where technology is the only factor determining the demand for skills.
  23
    It should be noted that the pace of skill-biased technical change may have been slower during the 1990s
(see Autor, Katz and Krueger, 1998).


                                                    24
5.1     “Technological Revolutions” and Acceleration in Skill Bias
The …rst group of technological theories link the acceleration in skill bias to exogenous
technological developments, and argue that a “technological revolution” led to more rapid
skill-biased technical change beginning in the 1970s or 1980s. In terms of the model de-
veloped above, this corresponds to a more rapid increase in Ah =Al during this period,
translating into greater skill premia. Many of the proponents of this view argue that the
acceleration in skill bias is, at least in part, related to information technology and com-
puters (for example, Krueger, 1993, Berman, Bound and Griliches, 1994, Autor, Katz and
Krueger, 1998, Berman, Bound and Machin, 1998).
    An interesting version of this story is the one developed by Krusell, Ohanian, Rios-Rull
and Violante (2000). As pointed above, these authors argue, based on the work of Gordon
(1990) and Greenwood, Hercowitz and Krusell (1997), that the demand for skills accelerated
as a result of the more rapid decline in the relative price of capital equipment. They argue
that this relative decline accelerated beginning in the early 1970s.24 The Krusell et al
theory is attractive since it provides a uni…ed framework in which we can identify both
the cause of the steady increase in the demand for skills, and the source of the more rapid
skill-biased technical change, though the evidence provided in the previous section casts
some doubt on the link between the relative price of equipment and demand for skills.
    The main idea of these approaches is that new technologies are more complementary to
skilled workers than to unskilled workers—for example, there are more rapid advances in the
technologies used by skilled workers, as captured by Ah above. Rapid technological progress
then corresponds to an acceleration in skill bias. An alternative perspective, building on
an idea originally suggested by Nelson and Phelps (1966), emphasizes the ability of skilled
workers to deal with the introduction of new technologies. According to this view, demand
for skills will automatically increase during periods of rapid technological change. Welch
(1970) gave an early succinct summary of these two views. The …rst view—the acceleration
hypothesis—would maintain that

             “technical change may not be neutral between skill classes. It may be
       that increments in technology result in increments in the relative productivity
  24
     I classify this approach as one of exogenous technology, since the driving force, the decline in the
relative price of equipment capital, is assumed exogenous.
   An alternative interpretation of the approach by Krusell Ohanian, Rios-Rull and Violante (2000) is that
the main determinant of the demand for skills is not technology-skill complementarity, but capital-skill
complementarity. I believe that the distinction between technology-skill versus capital-skill is not very
useful. Capital-skill complementarity could play an important role only in a model as in Greenwood et
al (1997) or Krusell et al (2000), where new capital embeds superior technologies. In this sense, it would
be a combination of new capital and new technologies that is increasing the demand for skills. Moreover,
Autor, Katz and Krueger (1998) show that demand for more educated workers across industries is a¤ected
by high-tech capital (e.g., computers), but not by equipment capital, suggesting further that it is new
technologies, not simply capital-intensity, that matters for inequality.

                                                   25
       of labor that are positively related to skill level.” (p. 38).

In contrast, the second view—the Nelson-Phelps hypothesis—argues that

             “...the productivity of education would be positively related to the rate
       of change in useful technology (the ability to change) and to the size of the
       technological gap (room for innovation). In this case, if the rate of utilization
       of technology is accelerating, or if the technology gap is growing, the return to
       education will rise relative to other inputs.” (p. 38).

    Studies building on the Nelson-Phelps insight include Galor and Tsiddon (1997), Green-
wood and Yorukoglu (1997), Caselli (1999), Aghion and Howitt (1998, chapter 9), Galor
and Moav (2000), Violante (1999), Rubinstein and Tsiddon (1999), Aghion, Howitt and
Violante (1999), and Gould, Moav and Weinberg (1999).25 These papers argue that there
has been a technological revolution in the U.S. economy starting in the 1970s, and relate the
rise in inequality to the increased demand for skills resulting from the technological revolu-
tion. For example, Greenwood and Yorukoglu (1997) draw a parallel between the …rst and
the second industrial revolutions and what has been happening in the U.S. economy since
1974. Caselli (1999) develops a similar theory where a technological revolution increases
the demand for workers who can switch to the sectors that bene…t from the introduction
of new technologies.26
    To get a basic understanding of these approaches, it is useful to consider a simpli…ed
version of the model by Galor and Moav (2000) adapted to the above framework. Suppose
that

                                     Al = Ál (g)a and Ah = Áh a                                     (14)

where a is a measure of aggregate technology, and g is the growth rate of a, i.e., g ´
a=a.
_     The presumption that skilled workers are better equipped to deal with technological
progress can be captured by assuming that Á0l < 0. Galor and Moav (2000) refer to this
assumption as the “erosion e¤ect,” since it implies that technical change erodes some of the
established expertise of unskilled workers, and causes them to bene…t less from technological
advances than skilled workers do. Substituting from (14) into (4), the skill premium is
                          µ ¶(¾¡1)=¾ µ ¶¡1=¾ µ                ¶(¾¡1)=¾ µ ¶¡1=¾
                  wH       Ah            H              Áh              H
             !=        =                          =                            :        (15)
                  wL       Al            L             Ál (g)           L
  25
     See Aghion (2000) for an approach that combines the Nelson-Phelps insights with the Schumpeterian
notion of creative-destruction to discuss the impact of the di¤usion of computers on inequality.
  26
     The explanation o¤ered by Violante (1999), Rubinstein and Tsiddon (1999), and Aghion, Howitt and
Violante (2000) is somewhat di¤erent. They argue that there is increased uncertainty at times of rapid
technological change, and more skilled workers are better able to cope with uncertainty. This idea is
also related to a thesis …rst put forth by Piore and Sabel (1984) that the oil price shocks increased the
uncertainty faced by producers, and induced them to change the organization of production.

                                                   26
Therefore, as long as Á0l < 0, more rapid technological progress, as captured by a higher
level of g, will increase the skill premium.27
    Theories that explain the increase in inequality as a result of rapid technological progress
have a number of attractive features.28 First, many economists and commentators view the
advances in computer and information technology as a break with the technologies of the
past, and so are open to the idea that we might be in the midst of a technological revolution.
Second, a variety of evidence supports the notion that skilled workers have a comparative
advantage in coping with rapid technical change. Bartel and Lichtenberg (1987) show that
…rms introducing new technologies hire more skilled workers. Bartel and Sicherman (1998)
document that returns to unobserved ability appear to be higher in industries with more
rapid technical change. Foster and Rosenzweig (1996) provide evidence from developing
countries that more educated workers are better placed to take advantage of advances in
agricultural technology.
    The main di¢culty with both the theories based on the acceleration and the Nelson-
Phelps hypotheses is that they rely very explicitly on rapid technical change in recent
decades. There is little direct evidence that the decades between 1970 and 1995 have been
a period of rapid technical change. First, this period has experienced sluggish TFP and
output growth relative to earlier periods. Greenwood and Yorukoglu (1997) and Hornstein
and Krusell (1996) argue that the slow TFP growth itself may be an outcome of the more
rapid technical change. According to this argument, new revolutionary technologies …rst
reduce productivity growth as …rms and workers spend their time learning to use these
technologies. Moreover, following a suggestion by Griliches, many have argued that our
ability to measure TFP growth may have deteriorated following a change in technological
regime. Neither of these arguments are very convincing, however.
    It is di¢cult to imagine how a new and radically more pro…table technology will …rst lead
to twenty …ve years of substantially slower growth. Although, in an in‡uential paper, Paul
David (1990) argues that the spread of electricity to American manufacturing was also slow
and productivity gains from electri…cation were limited until the 1920s, the parallel with
the recent productivity slowdown should not be overstated. First, though productivity
growth from electri…cation was sluggish during the early 1900s, the U.S. economy overall
had a much higher level of output growth than growth levels experienced over the past
three decades. Data from Table A-XVIII of Kendricks (1961) imply that output growth
  27
     Galor and Moav (2000) discusse in detail the response of workers of di¤erent ability to technological
change, which I ignore, since this issue is not essential to the argument here.
  28
     These theories also predict that inequality should increase when new technologies are being introduced,
but should decline when these new technologies are standardized and being used routinely by many …rms
(see, for example, Galor and Tsiddon, 1997, or Aghion, Howitt and Violante, 2000). So far, there seems
to be no evidence of a decline in inequality in the U.S., but perhaps the years to come will see a return to
the levels of inequality experienced during the 1960s, vindicating this approach.


                                                    27
between 1899 and 1909 in the U.S. economy was 4.2 percent a year, while between 1909
and 1919, it was 3 percent, and between 1990 and 1929, output grew by 3.6 percent a
year. Second, as noted by Oliner and Sichel (1994), computers and other advanced o¢ce
equipment have only been a trivial part of the aggregate capital stock of the U.S. economy
until the mid 1990s. It is therefore unlikely that the whole of the U.S. economy has been
adapting to the changes in this relatively small part of the capital stock Finally, as shown
by Brendt, Morrison and Rosenblum (1994), more computerized sectors did not perform
any better in terms of labor productivity growth over this period, and this pattern is also
di¢cult to reconcile with a computer-led technological revolution.
    It is also useful to note that although computers have no doubt increased our standards
of living and quality of life over the past thirty years, it seems (at least to me) that they are
much less radical innovations than certain previous new technologies. To gain perspective,
consider the di¤erence that the telegraph makes to a world in which the fastest medium of
communication were pigeons. Mokyr (1990, p. 124) describes this as follows:
           “The telegraph had an enormous impact on 19th-century society—possibly
      as great as that of the railroad. Its community and political value was vast, as
      was its e¤ect in coordinating international …nancial and commodity markets.
      Unlike the railroad, it had no close substitutes, the closest being homing pigeons
      and semaphore.”

Or consider the di¤erence that the automobile and air conditioning made to the quality of
life, and electricity and interchangeable parts made to the manufacturing sector. As also
pointed out by Gordon (1998), compared to these improvements, the switch from main-
frames to PCs, or from telephone to e-mail, or from the typewriter to the word processor
seem more modest.
     The argument that we have become worse at measuring productivity growth is also not
totally compelling. As Bailey and Gordon (1992) document, productivity slowdown has
been concurrent in many sectors, some of them with little problems in measuring output or
output quality. It is interesting to note, however, that evidence in favor of this hypothesis
may yet emerge, especially since productivity growth has been quite rapid during the past
three years (but see Gordon 1998, and more recently, Jorgensen and Stiroh, 2000, on this).
     In any case, historical evidence is not necessarily in line with a view that times of
rapid technical change increase inequality. As discussed in the introduction, the major
technological changes of the nineteenth century appear to have been largely unskilled-biased
and to have reduced inequality, even though they seem as radical as computer technology.
This suggests that it is the skill bias of technology, not merely its rapid arrival, that is
important for the demand for skills.
     A …nal problem for all of the approaches based exogenous technological developments is
the coincidence in the timing of this change, and the rapid increase in the supply of skilled

                                               28
workers. Recall that there was a very large increase in the supply of college graduate workers
during the late 1960s and early 1970s (Figure 1 and Table 1 show the large increase in the
employment share of college workers between 1970 and 1980). So the acceleration in skill
bias is either concurrent with, or immediately follows, this large increase in the supply of
skills. There is no a priori reason to expect the acceleration in skill bias to coincide with
the rapid increase in the supply of skills. Those who want to subscribe to the exogenous
technological progress view have to explain this as a chance event.29

5.2     Endogenous Skill-Biased Technical Change
The theories discussed so far presume technical change to be skill-biased by nature (or, at
the very least, recent technical change to have been skill-biased). A di¤erent perspective is
to link the type of technologies that are developed and adopted to (pro…t) incentives, or to
demand pull as emphasized by Schmookler (1966). This is also the approach taken by the
endogenous growth theory, which determines the overall rate of technical change—but not
the degree of skill bias—from pro…t incentives (e.g., Romer, 1990, Grossman and Helpman,
1991, Aghion and Howitt, 1992).
    Historical evidence is consistent with the notion that pro…t incentives and opportunities
are important for the development and introduction of new technologies. Braudel (1984,
p. 566) took a strong position on this:

             “the e¢cient application of technology lags, by de…nition, behind the
       general movement of the economy; it has to be called on, sometimes several
       times, to meet a precise and persistent demand.”

    An interesting example of the timing of technological development responding to pro…t
incentives is given by the introduction of the electric street car in U.S. cities during the late
nineteenth century. In his history of electricity in the U.S., Nye (1990) describes this as
follows: “Cities grew larger, better transportation was needed, so the [electric] trolley was
invented, called into being by the crowded late nineteenth century cities....By the 1870s
large cities had ceased to be accessible by foot, or built to the scale of pedestrians, and
tra¢c congestion was terrible.” (p. 85). This created the pro…t opportunities to develop
  29
     One could argue that the supply of skilled workers increased because, during the 1960s, workers antic-
ipated that there was going to be a technological discontinuity in the decades to come, and responded to
this by increasing their education. This story appears quite unreasonable, however. There is no evidence
that anyone, let alone teenagers, foresaw the technological developments of the 1970s and the 1980s as
early as the 1960s. Moreover, the increase in the supply of skills can be explained by two factors. First,
the Vietnam era draft laws encouraged young males to stay in college longer (and indirectly also in‡uence
female enrollments). Second, college enrollments were on an upward trend since the early 1950s, and much
of the increased supply of college graduate workers is accounted for by the interaction of this upward trend
and the very large relative size of the baby boom cohorts.


                                                    29
and introduce the electric trolley. The technological requirements had been met long before,
and awaited these pro…t opportunities. Nye writes “However great the need for the electric
trolley after 1870, it was hardly a new idea; it had been the object of experiment during
four decades.” (p. 86).
    Another example of the type of innovation responding to pro…t incentives is provided by
the cotton gin. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Britain imported most
of its cotton from the West Indies, Brazil and India, whereas only green seed cotton, which
was more di¢cult to clean, could be grown in most of the American South. A machine to
remove the seeds was essential for the success of American cotton. In contrast to almost
all other textile innovations that were taking place in England and Europe, such a machine,
the cotton gin, was developed in the U.S. in 1793 by Eli Whitney in response to this need.
The impact of the cotton gin on the South was nothing short of spectacular. In the court
case over the patent rights, Judge Johnson wrote:

          “[...as a result of the cotton gin]... individuals who were depressed with
     poverty, and sunk with idleness, have suddenly risen to wealth and respectabil-
     ity. Our debts have been paid o¤, our capital increased; and our lands are
     treble in value.” (Quoted in Green, 1956, p. 92).

Within a short time, Eli Whitney’s gin turned the U.S. from a cotton importer into the
largest cotton exporter.
    Schmookler (1966) provides a famous argument for the importance of demand pull in the
development of many technologies. He documents rapid innovations in railroads following
increased purchases of railroad equipments, and more generally argues that industries with
greater investments experience faster technological progress because the returns to such
progress are greater. A natural next step is then to argue that the degree of skill bias in
technical change is also determined by pro…t opportunities and by the demand for di¤erent
types of technologies. Here, by endogenous (skill bias) technology approach I mean the
view that the degree of skill bias in technical change is in‡uenced by pro…t incentives.
    A key determinant of pro…tability is market size. As Schmookler (1966) stated in
the title of two of his chapters: “The amount of invention is governed by the extent of
the market.” The most successful businessmen have always been aware of this. For
example, Matthew Boulton wrote to his business partner, James Watt, “It is not worth
my while to manufacture your engine for three countries only, but I …nd it very well worth
my while to make it for all the world” (quoted in Scherer, 1984, p. 13). Schmookler
(1966) similarly provided many examples where market size was crucial in determining
the directions of technical change. The horseshoe is perhaps the most interesting one.
Schmookler documented that there was a very high rate of innovation throughout the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in this very ancient technology, invented in the

                                            30
second century B.C., and no tendency for inventors to run out of additional improvements.
On the contrary, inventions and patents increased because demand for horseshoes was high.
Innovations came to an end only when “the steam traction engine and, later, internal
combustion engine began to displace the horse...” (p. 93).
    According to this reasoning, the development of skill-biased technologies will be more
pro…table when they have a larger market size—i.e., when there are more skilled work-
ers. Therefore, the equilibrium degree of skill bias could be an increasing function of the
relative supply of skilled workers. An increase in the supply of skills will then lead to
skill-biased technical change. Furthermore, an acceleration in the supply of skills can lead
to an acceleration in the demand for skills. It is useful to link this approach to technolog-
ical development to the above framework: this framework explained the prices of skills by
supply and technology, while the perspective of endogenous skill bias relates technology to
the supply of skills.30 Tinbergen in his pioneering study of this supply-demand framework,
in fact, foresaw this possibility, and wrote (1975, p. 61): “...an inequality-furthering phe-
nomenon is technological development. But need it be? Increasingly we get the feeling
that technological development is not simply something given, but that it may be guided,
within limits.”
    At some level, the idea that there will be more technologies developed, created and
adopted for skilled workers—“within limits”— when there are more skilled workers around
is quite appealing. An extreme form of this view would be that captured by my model
in Acemoglu (1998). There, forward looking pro…t maximizing …rms create new tech-
nologies anticipating the pro…tability of these di¤erent investments. According to this
view, it would be the Vietnam War draft laws and the high college enrollment rates of
the baby boom cohorts that induced the development of computers. Obviously such an
interpretation is not literal. A more plausible interpretation is that new technological
platforms—macroinventions to use Joel Mokyr’s term or General Purpose Technologies to
use Bresnahan and Trajtenberg’s term —stem from advances in basic science or from labs
with little pro…t maximizing incentives. The development of the microchip would be such a
macroinvention. But what matters for most workers in the labor force is how this new tech-
nological platform is developed, i.e. the microinventions that follow the macroinvention.
At the expense of oversimplifying, we can say that the microchip could have been used
to develop advanced scanners that would increase the productivity of unskilled workers,
or advanced computer-assisted machines that would be used by skilled workers to replace
unskilled workers. The theory of endogenous skill bias requires that the extent of the ad-
vances in these two technologies are a¤ected by pro…t opportunities. When there are more
college graduates, computers become relatively more pro…table to develop than scanners,
 30
      Naturally, it is also possible to link the supply of skills to skill premia. See below for a discussion.



                                                       31
and this explains the acceleration in skill bias.31
    The endogenous response of …rms to the increase in supply will raise the demand for
skills. In fact, supply may not simply create its own demand, but the response of …rms
could be so pronounced that demand could overshoot the supply. In this theory, therefore,
the increased supply may be the cause of the increased skill premia (see Acemoglu, 1998,
and also Kiley, 1999). Here I outline a simpli…ed version of this theory based on the above
framework.
    Suppose that consumers have a utility function de…ned over Y = [Yl½ + Yh½ ]1=½ , and that
Yh = Nh H and Yl = Nl L where Nh and Nl can be interpreted as the number of specialized
machines used with skilled and unskilled workers, respectively. This is equivalent to the
above setup with Ah = Nh and Al = Nl . An increase in Nh relative to Nl will correspond to
skill-biased technical change as long as ¾ = 1= (1 ¡ ½) > 1. From consumer maximization,
the relative price of skill-intensive goods is
                                               ·      ¸
                                         ph      Nh H ½¡1
                                     p´      =            ;                              (16)
                                         pl      Nl L

where once again ph denotes the price of good Yh and pl is the price of Yl .
    Suppose now that these specialized machines are created and sold by pro…t maximizing
monopolists. Creating a new machine costs B units of the …nal good Y , and the marginal
cost of producing these machines, once created, is zero. The marginal willingness to pay
for an additional machine in the two sectors are given by the derivatives of ph Yh and pl Yl
with respect to Nh and Nl , i.e.,

                                              ph H and pl L:                                            (17)

I assume that the creator of each new machine obtains this “market” marginal willingness
to pay. Equation (17) therefore highlights two e¤ects that encourage the creation of new
technologies.

   1. The price e¤ect: technologies producing more expensive goods will be improved faster.
      Since goods using the scarce factor will command a higher price (see equation (16)),
      this e¤ect implies that there will be more innovation directed at the scarce factor—
      i.e., directed at unskilled workers during the 1970s and 1980s.
  31
    There is in fact some evidence that the composition of R&D has shifted towards more skill-biased
technologies during the period of the rapid increase in the supply of college-educated workers. From the
R&D expenditure data reported by the NSF, in 1960 company funded R&D for o¢ce computing was 3
percent of the total company funded R&D expenditure. This ratio has increased to 13 percent by 1987,
suggesting that during this period of rapid increase in the supply of skills, there has been signi…cantly more
R&D directed to one of the technologies most complementary to skills.



                                                     32
   2. The market size e¤ect: a larger clientele for a technology leads to more innovation.
      Since the clientele for a technology is e¤ectively the workers who use it, the market
      size e¤ect encourages innovation for the more abundant factor, and encourages more
      technologies for skilled and highly educated workers during the 1970s and 1980s.

    The creation of new machines will stop when the marginal increase in pro…ts is equal
to the marginal cost of innovation in both sectors. This implies that in equilibrium
                                                 ph H
                                                      = 1;                                               (18)
                                                 pl L
i.e., the price and market size e¤ects have to be balanced in equilibrium. How can equation
(18) be satis…ed? Since H=L is …xed, equation (18) can only hold if the relative price of
skill-intensive goods, p = ph =pl , adjusts. From equation (16), this can only happen if Nh =Nl
change. Therefore, in this economy, the skill bias of technology has to adjust in order to
“clear the technology market”. Combining (18) and (16), we obtain equilibrium skill bias
as
                                                 µ ¶½=(1¡½)
                                     Nh    Ah      H
                                        =      =             :                            (19)
                                     Nl    Al      L
This equation shows that when ½ > 0, i.e., when skilled and unskilled good are gross
substitutes, the market size e¤ect will dominate the price e¤ect, and a greater relative
supply of skilled workers will lead to more skill-biased technologies— higher Nh =Nl .
   Finally, the skill premium in this economy is given by
                                             µ ¶(2½¡1)=(1¡½)
                                    ph Nh     H
                                !=         =
                                     pl Nl     L
where the …nal expression is obtained by substituting from equation (19).
    The most important result is that if ½ > 1=2, i.e., if the elasticity of substitution ¾
is greater than 2, the skill premium will be an increasing function of the relative supply
of skills.32 This is because an increase in H=L encourages so much skill-biased technical
change that the demand for skills increases more than enough to o¤set the increase in the
supply of skills. As a result, the (long-run) relative demand for skills is an upward sloping
curve as drawn in Figure 7, and an increase in the supply of skilled workers increases the
skill premium.
    There are a number of implications that follow from this approach. First, as the rela-
tive supply of skilled workers has been growing throughout the past sixty years, we expect
  32
     The result that the elasticity of substitution needs to be greater than 2 for the long-run relative demand
to slope upwards is a feature of the simple model here, and does not generalize to richer environments. In
any case, there are a number of estimates above 2, and a somewhat upward sloping relative demand curve
for skills is an empirical possibility.

                                                      33
technology to endogenously respond by becoming more skill-biased over time. If the elas-
ticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled workers is greater than 2, i.e., ½ > 1=2,
the increase in the demand for skilled workers would be more than enough to o¤set the
increase in the supply of skilled workers, and the economy would be moving steadily along
an upward sloping relative demand curve for skills. This would explain why returns to
college have been increasing over the past half century.
    A new theory for the acceleration in skill bias also emerges from this simple model.
According to this theory, the rapid increase in the supply of college educated workers during
the 1970s created a more pronounced shift towards skill-biased technologies, increased
the demand for skills further, and raised the college premium. This story becomes more
interesting once we recognize that the equilibrium skill bias of technologies, Nh =Nl , is a
sluggish variable determined by the slow buildup and development of new technologies. In
this case, a rapid increase in the supply of skills would …rst reduce the skill premium as the
economy would be moving along a constant technology (constant Nh =Nl ) curve as drawn
in Figure 7. After a while the technology would start adjusting, and the economy would
move back to the upward sloping relative demand curve, with a very sharp increase in the
college premium. This theory therefore gives an interpretation for both the decline in the
college premium during the 1970s and the subsequent large surge, and relates both to the
large increase in the supply of skilled workers.
    For the key insights of this theory, that increases in the relative supply of skills induce
skill-biased technical change, we do not need the long-run relative demand curve to be
upward sloping. When ½ < 1=2, increases in the supply of skills still induce skill-biased
change, but this technical change would not be enough to prevent the skill premium from
falling. Further “exogenous” skill-biased technical change is also necessary to explain why
returns to schooling have risen over the past 60 years. With a downward sloping long-run
demand curve, the story for the 1970s and 1980s would be di¤erent as well. The large
increase in the supply of skills again moves the economy along a steeply downward sloping
constant technology demand curve. The response of technology then moves the economy
to a less steep long-run demand curve as drawn in Figure 8, raising the skill premium.
    There are also other historical episodes in which a large increase in the supply of skills
appears to have a¤ected the direction of technical change. High school enrollment and
graduation rates doubled in the 1910s. Goldin and Katz (1995) argue that increased
enrollments were mostly driven by supply side factors; changes in the location and curricula
of schools and improvements in transportation technology. The skill premium fell sharply
in the 1910s. But, despite the even faster increase in the supply of high school skills during
the 1920s, the skill premium levelled o¤ and started a mild increase. Goldin and Katz
(1995) conclude that the demand for high school graduates must have expanded sharply
starting in the 1920s, presumably due to changes in o¢ce technology and higher demand

                                              34
from new industries such as electrical machinery, transport and chemicals (see also Goldin
and Katz, 1998).33
    Another interesting case study comes from the response of the Israeli labor market to the
in‡ux of large numbers of highly educated immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The
size of this in‡ux was enormous: migration increased the Israeli population by 12 percent
in the …rst half of the 1990s. A theory with exogenous technology would predict a large
decline in the relative wages of educated workers, very much as in the case of Palestinian
labor discussed above.34 In practice, the education premium did not fall (e.g., Friedberg,
1997). This seems to be mainly because most industries increased their employment of
more skilled workers during this large in‡ux (Gandal, Hanson, and Slaughter, 2000, and
Cohen and Hsieh, 2000). This response suggests a change in the production structure
towards more skilled workers, consistent with the theories outlined in this section.35
    Despite this evidence showing simultaneous increases in the supply of, and demand for,
skills in a number of episodes, it is di¢cult to distinguish exogenous and endogenous tech-
nical change. The exogenous technical change theory maintains that technical change is
often skill-biased. Endogenous technical change theory instead suggests that new technolo-
gies should be skill-biased when the supply of skills increases. Since the supply of skills has
increased most of the time over the past one hundred or so years, the implications of the
two theories are quite similar. The increase in the supply of unskilled labor in the English
cities during the early nineteenth century provides an interesting contrasting event for the
two approaches. Bairoch (1988, p. 245) describes this rapid expansion as follows: “...be-
tween 1740 and 1840 the population of England...went up from 6 million to 15.7 million.
...while the agricultural labor force represented 60-70% of the total work force in 1740,
by 1840 it represented only 22%.” Habakkuk (pp. 136-137) also emphasizes the increase
in the supply of unskilled labor in English cities, and attributes it to …ve sources. First,
enclosures released substantial labor from agriculture. Second, “population was increasing
  33
     As Goldin and Katz (2000) show using data from Iowa Prairies, returns to education were most likely
higher in 1915 than in 1950. Although this evidence suggests that the long-run relative demand curve for
skills was downward sloping over this period, it is consistent with the notion of skill-biased technical change
induced by increased supply skilled workers. Speci…cally, during this period, demand for skills expanded
very rapidly to accommodate the very large increase in the supply of high school graduates (see Goldin
and Katz, 1995, 2000).
  34
     The key di¤erence between the two episodes is that Palestinian labor was a relatively small fraction
of the Israeli work force, so we expect much less of a technology response to changes in the educational
composition of Palestinian labor. Furthermore, Palestinian college graduates are not a close substitute for
Israeli college graduates, and only a limited range of occupations are open to them.
  35
     Since Israel can be approximated by a small open economy, another possibility is a change in the
output mix and trade patterns. Gandal, Hanson, and Slaughter (2000) and Cohen and Hsieh (2000) …nd
no evidence for this, and show that demand for skills increased in all Israeli sectors. Cohen and Hsieh
(2000) also argue that because many Russian immigrants initially worked in low-skill occupations, the
supply of skills to the Israeli economy may not have increased by much.



                                                      35
very rapidly” (p. 136). Third, labor reserves of rural industry came to the cities. Fourth,
“there was a large in‡ux of labor from Ireland” (p. 137). Finally, “technical changes in
agriculture increased the supply of labor available to industry” (p. 137). Habakkuk fur-
ther argues that this increase in the supply of labor was an important inducement to the
development of factory methods. He quotes an American historian, Handlin, to explain
why the adoption of factory methods in the U.S. were somewhat delayed. Handlin wrote:

            “no matter what degree of standardization technical process of manufac-
       turing reached, the absence of a cheap labor supply precluded conversion to
       factory methods” (p. 146)

Habakkuk naturally placed much more importance on wage levels in determining innova-
tion decisions, a view that later became known as the “Habakkuk thesis.” But he also
emphasized the di¤erent availabilities of skilled labor in Britain and the U.S.. He wrote:

            “in both countries this provided manufacturers with an incentive to adopt
       and devise methods which replaced skilled by non-skilled...[but ]...the English
       had a stronger incentive than the Americans to replace skilled by unskilled
       labor.” (p. 152)

    With a similar reasoning to Habakkuk and Schmookler, the endogenous technology view
suggests that businessmen took advantage of the rapid increase in the supply of labor in
the cities by developing the factory system. According to this view, there is an intimate
link between the skill-replacing technologies of the nineteenth century and the change in
the factor supplies faced by employers—“the reserve army of unskilled labor”. Although
these historical examples are informative, they do not reveal whether endogenous technol-
ogy choices are important in understanding more recent skill-biased technical change. A
systematic study of how technologies respond to large changes in the relative supply of
skills is clearly a worthwhile future research project.36
    An important aspect of the endogenous technology theory is that it makes relatively
tight predictions regarding the future path of technical change. While with exogenous skill
bias theories, there is no clear reason to expect a further acceleration or deceleration in
the skill bias of new technologies, according to this endogenous skill bias theory, the future
path of technical progress should be closely tied to the future path of the supply of skills.
  36
    It is also useful to note that the skill bias of technology probably responds not only to changes in the
relative supply of skills, but to a variety of other factors. Recent work by Mobius (2000) and Thesmar and
Thoning (2000) shows how the size of the product market, the degree of competitive pressure and instability
facing …rms may a¤ect the way …rms choose to organize, and therefore the demand for skills. Moreover,
Mobius suggests that these changes reduced the demand for skills during the nineteenth century as there
was greater standardization of products, but increased this demand during the past several decades as the
need for ‡exibility increased. How the organization of product markets and the extent of competition
a¤ect technology choices and the demand for skills is a very promising area for future research.

                                                    36
If the relative supply of skills continues to increase, we should expect further skill-biased
technical change.37
    A major problem for the “technological revolution” models was the slowdown in TFP.
Since the endogenous technology approach places the emphasis on which type of technolo-
gies are developed, it is not inconsistent with the slow growth in TFP during the past 30
years: an acceleration in the skill bias of new technologies does not require faster technical
progress. The evidence presented in Newell, Ja¤ee and Stavins (1999) is consistent with
the notion that changes in the direction of technical change can happen without an increase
in the overall rate of productivity growth. They show that innovation in air condition-
ers responded to changes in energy prices by becoming more energy-e¢cient, but …nd no
increase in the rate of productivity growth. In fact, Acemoglu (1998) and Kiley (1999)
show that the increased e¤ort of …rms to develop more skill-biased technologies could run
into decreasing returns, and hence may cause a slowdown in TFP growth. Intuitively, the
overall productivity growth in the economy is maximized with a balanced distribution of
resources towards developing skill-complementary and labor-complementary technologies
(due to decreasing returns to each activity). During periods of rapid skill-biased technical
change, all resources go into developing skill-complementary machines, and cause a sharp
decline in advances in labor-complementary technologies. Because of the decreasing returns
to scale, improvements in the other sector will not fully o¤set this decline, and overall TFP
growth will fall.38
    Finally, it is useful to discuss brie‡y the response of skills to technology. The analysis
so far treated the supply of skills as exogenous, and investigated the implications of the
supply on the demand for skills. Naturally, the supply of skills will also respond to economic
incentives. In particular, more workers are likely to acquire skills when skill premia are
higher. Such supply choices can be easily incorporated into this framework. Suppose,
for example, that the relative supply of skills, H=L, is an increasing function of the skill
premium, !. In this case, if the long-run demand curve for skills is upward sloping, we can
have an equilibrium path in which both the relative supply of skills and the skill premium
increase together over time (see Acemoglu 1998). This equilibrium con…guration gives us
  37
     Although evidence from the 1990s suggests that skill-biased technical change is now slower, there is
not yet su¢cient evidence to decide whether the rapid skill-biased technical change of the 1980s has come
to an end. It also has to be noted that the increase in the relative supply of college educated workers the
1990s may have been less than expected (see Figure 1), and this may have a¤ected the technology choices
of …rms. In particular, with the increased labor force participation of less skilled workers, there may now
be a su¢cient number of unskilled workers supplying labor at low wages to make the further development
of unskilled-labor-complementary technologies quite pro…table.
  38
     Interestingly, the view that too much e¤ort towards improving the most skill-biased technologies may be
related to the TFP slowdown is consistent with the pattern of sectoral TFP growth observed recently. As
Gordon (1998) documents, there has been rapid TFP growth in computer producing sectors, but mediocre,
or even disappointing, TFP growth in other sectors.



                                                    37
an attractive interpretation for the joint behavior of college skills and the college premium
in the U.S. economy over the past sixty years (see Figure 1): large returns to schooling
encourage education, which in turn induce more skill-biased technical change, increasing
returns to schooling again.

5.3     A Puzzle: The Decline in the Wages of Low-Skill Workers
A common shortcoming of all the pure technology approaches discussed in this section is
that they do not naturally predict stagnant average wages and/or falling wages for unskilled
workers.39 In the basic framework of Section 3, average wages should always increase when
the supply of educated workers increases, and all wages should rise in response to an increase
in the productivity of skilled workers, Ah . Yet, over the past 30 years the wages of low-skill
workers have fallen in real value during, which contrasts with their steady increase in the
30 years previous.
    Models of faster technological progress would naturally predict that unskilled workers
should bene…t from this faster progress. The endogenous technology approach discussed
in the previous subsection, on the other hand, predicts that there may be no improvements
in the technologies for unskilled workers for an extended period of time because skill-biased
innovations are more pro…table than labor-complementary innovations. Yet in that case,
their wages should be stagnant, but not fall.
    Some of the studies mentioned above have suggested explanations for the fall in the
wages of low-skill workers. For example, recall that Galor and Moav (2000) argue that
faster technological change creates an “erosion e¤ect”, reducing the productivity of un-
skilled workers. Using equation (3) from above, in the simpli…ed version of their model dis-
cussed in Section 5.1, the wages of unskilled workers is wL = Ál (g) a [1 + Á½h (H=L)½ ](1¡½)=½ ,
so the rate of growth of unskilled wages will be w_ L =wL = g (1 + "Á ), where "Á is the elastic-
ity of the Ál function which is negative by the assumption that Á0l < 0. If this elasticity is
less than -1, an acceleration in economic growth can reduce the wages of low-skill workers
due to a powerful erosion e¤ect.
    Acemoglu (1999a) and Caselli (1999) derive a fall in the wages of less skilled workers
because the capital-labor ratio for low education/low-skill workers falls as …rms respond to
technological developments. In Caselli’s model this happens because the equilibrium rate
of return to capital increases, and in my paper, this happens because …rms devote more of
their resources to opening specialized jobs for skilled workers.
    Consider the following simple example to illustrate this point. There is a scarce supply of
an input K, which could be capital, entrepreneurial talent or another factor of production.
  39
    However, recall that if the increase in nonwage bene…ts are taken into account, average wages increased
over this period. So the more robust fact might be the fall in the real wages of low skill workers.


                                                    38
Skilled workers work with the production function
                                            Yh = A®h Kh1¡® H ®                                          (20)
while unskilled workers work with the production function
                                            Yl = A®l Kl1¡® L® ;                                         (21)
where Kl and Kh sum to the total supply of K, which is assumed …xed. For simplicity, Yl
and Yh are assumed to be perfect substitutes. In equilibrium, the marginal products of
capital in two sectors have to be equalized, hence
                                           Kl     K ¡ Kl
                                                =
                                           Al L    Ah H
Therefore, an increase in Ah relative to Al will reduce Kl , as this scarce factor gets
reallocated from unskilled to skilled workers. The wages of unskilled workers, wL =
(1 ¡ ®) A®l Kl1¡® L®¡1 , will fall as a result.
    An innovative version of this story is developed by Beaudry and Green (2000). Suppose
that equation (21) above is replaced by Yl = A´l Kl1¡´ L´ , with ´ < ®, and K is interpreted
as physical capital. This implies that unskilled workers require more capital than skilled
workers. Beaudry and Green show that an increase in H=L can raise inequality, and depress
the wages of low-skill workers. Although this is related to the e¤ects of the increase in
the relative supply of skills on the path of technological progress discussed in the last
subsection, the mechanism in Beaudry and Green’s paper is quite di¤erent. The increase
in H=L increases the demand for capital, and pushes the interest rate up. This increase in
the interest rate hurts unskilled workers more than skilled workers because, given ´ < ®,
unskilled workers are more “dependent” on capital.
    A potential problem with both the Beaudry and Green and Caselli stories is that they
explicitly rely on an increase in the price of capital. Although the interest rates were higher
during the 1980s in the U.S. economy, this seems mostly due to contractionary monetary
policy, and related only tangentially to inequality. Perhaps, future research will show a
major role for the increase in the interest rates in causing the fall in the wages of low
education workers over the past twenty-…ve years, but as yet, there is no strong evidence
in favor of this e¤ect.40
    Overall, a potential problem for models based on technical change is to account for
the decline in the wages of low-skill workers.41 I argue in the next section that the e¤ect
  40
     Acemoglu (1999a), which is more in the spirit of the organizational theories discussed below, obtains
the decline in the wages of unskilled workers through a change in the organization of production, which
also entails a reallocation of capital away from them, but no increase in the rate of return to capital.
  41
     Another possibility is that some of the technological developments of the past two decades have been
“truly labor-replacing”, for example, corresponding to an increase in Bl (t) or bt in terms of the production
function in footnote 13. Autor, Levy and Murnane (2000), for example, suggest that computers have
replaced unskilled routine tasks. This possibility has not been extensively researched yet.

                                                     39
of technical change on the organization of the labor market both ampli…es the e¤ect of
technology on wage inequality, and provides an explanation for this decline.


6     Rami…cations of Technical Change
This section discusses how technical change can a¤ect labor market prices by transforming
the organization of the labor market. The idea that technology a¤ects the organization of
production, and the institutions around it, is an old one. Marx put it in a dramatic fashion:
“The hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lords; the steam-mill, society with the in-
dustrial capitalist.” The argument here is not as extreme, but related: recent technological
developments may have led to important changes in the organization of production.
    My focus here is on three sets of changes that could account for the fall in the wages of
low-skill workers: the transformation of the organization of …rms; change in labor market
institutions, particularly the decline in unionization; and the interaction between interna-
tional trade and technical change. Organizational change often destroys the types of jobs
that pay high wages to low-skill workers. Deunionization reduces the bargaining power of
low-skill workers. And international trade with less developed countries (LDCs) increases
the e¤ective supply of unskilled labor and depresses the marginal value product of less
skilled workers in the U.S. economy. Therefore, all three changes could be responsible for
the decline in the wages of low-skill workers, and for the changes in the U.S. wage structure
in general. Nevertheless, I argue that these factors by themselves are not the major cause
of the increase in inequality. Instead they have become powerful actors only by interacting
with technical change and have ampli…ed the direct e¤ect of technical change on inequality.
They may even have caused the decline in unskilled wages.

6.1    Organizational Change and Inequality
A variety of evidence suggests that important changes in the structure of …rms have been
taking place in the U.S. economy over twenty-…ve years. Moreover, it seems clear that a
major driving force for this transformation is changes in technologies (hence the view that
technical change is essential for the changes in the organization of …rms).
   For example, team production and other high-performance production methods are
now widespread in the U.S. economy (e.g., Ichinowski, Prennushi, and Show. 1997, or
Applebaum and Batt, 1994). Similarly, Cappelli and Wilk (1997) show that there has
been an increase in the screening of production workers, especially from establishments that
use computer technology and pay high wages. Murnane and Levy (1996) report case study
evidence consistent with this view. From their interviews with human resource personnel at
a number of companies, they describe the change in the hiring practices of U.S. companies.


                                             40
A manager at Ford Motor company in 1967 describes their hiring strategy as follows: “If
we had a vacancy, we would look outside in the plant waiting room to see if there were
any warm bodies standing there. If someone was there and they looked physically OK and
weren’t an obvious alcoholic, they were hired” (p. 19). In contrast, comparable companies
in the late 1980s use a very di¤erent recruitment strategy. Murnane and Levy discuss the
cases of Honda of America, Diamond Star Motors and Northwestern Mutual Life. All three
companies spend substantial resources on recruitment and hire only a fraction of those
who apply. Kremer and Maskin (1999) provide evidence of more segregation of workers
across establishments. It seems that high wage workers are now much more concentrated
in certain establishments. Similarly, in Acemoglu (1999a) I documented a change in the
composition of jobs over the past 20 years. Figure 9 here replicates a pattern found in
that paper, and plots the total percentage of workers employed in the top 25 percent and
bottom 25 percent industry-occupation cells (what I called Weight-at-the-tails of the job
quality distribution). These are the cells (job types) that pay relatively high or relatively
low wages. In 1983, 35 percent of employment was in the top and bottom 25 percent job
categories. By 1993, this number had risen to just under 38 percent. So, approximately
2.5 percent more workers now have either higher or lower quality jobs rather than medium
quality jobs. The actual changes in the distribution of jobs may be much larger than this,
since substantial changes in the types of jobs often take place within given occupations.
    The view that changes in the organization of …rms have had a fundamental e¤ect on the
labor market is often expressed in the popular press, and in the organizational literature
(e.g., Zubo¤, 1988). The …rst paper to formalize this organizational approach is Kre-
mer and Maskin (1999), followed by Acemoglu (1999a), Mobius (2000) and Thesmar and
Thoning (2000). Kremer and Maskin consider a production function which distinguishes
between managers and workers. They show that a change in technology or an increase
in the dispersion of skills may encourage high skill workers to match with other high skill
workers, rather than work as managers in establishments employing low-skill workers.
    Here I outline a simple model, inspired by Kremer and Maskin (1999) and Acemoglu
(1999a), that captures the e¤ect of the changes in technologies on the organization of pro-
duction. The basic idea is simple. As the productivity of skilled workers increases, it
becomes more pro…table for them to work by themselves in separate organizations rather
than in the same workplace as unskilled workers. This is because when the skilled and
unskilled work together, their productivities interact, and unskilled workers may put down-
ward pressure on the productivity of skilled workers.
    Speci…cally, suppose that …rms have access to the following production functions

               the old-style production function :    Y = Bp [(Al L)½ + (Ah hO )½ ]1=½ ;
      the new-organization production function :      Y = Bs A¯h hN .

                                             41
Intuitively, skilled and unskilled workers can either be employed in the same …rm as with
the old-style function, hO , or high skill workers can be employed in separate …rms, hN .
The fact that when they are employed in the same …rm, these two types of workers a¤ect
each other’s productivity is captured by the CES production function. This formulation
implies that if the productivity (ability) of unskilled workers, Al , is very low relative to Ah ,
they pull down the productivity of skilled workers. In contrast, when they work in separate
…rms, skilled workers are una¤ected by the productivity of unskilled workers. Moreover,
¯ > 1, which implies that improvements in the productivity of skilled workers has more
e¤ect on the productivity of new style organizations. The parameters Bp and Bs capture
the relative e¢ciency of old and new style production functions.
    The labor market is competitive, so the equilibrium organization of production will
maximize total output, given by Bp [(Al L)½ + (Ah hO )½ ]1=½ + Bs A¯h (H ¡ hO ), where hO 2
[0; H] is the number of skilled workers employed in the old-style organizations. For all
cases in which hO > 0, the solution to this problem will involve
                                                 ½ ½ (1¡½)=½
                         wH = Bp A½h h½¡1 ½ ½
                                      O [Al L + Ah hO ]      = Bs A¯h ;                               (22)

i.e., skilled workers need to be paid Bs A¯h to be convinced to work in the same …rms as the
unskilled workers. The unskilled wage is

                           wL = Bp A½l L½¡1 [A½l L½ + A½h h½O ](1¡½)=½ < wH                           (23)

    Now consider an increase in Ah . Di¤erentiating (22) yields @(Ah hO )=@Ah < 0, which,
from (23), implies that @wL =@Ah < 0. Therefore, skill-biased technical change encourages
skilled workers to work by themselves, and as a result, unskilled wages fall. Intuitively, since,
in the old-style organizations, the productivity of skilled workers depends on the ability
of unskilled workers, when the skilled become even more productive, the downward pull
exerted on their productivity by the unskilled workers becomes more costly, and they prefer
to work in separate organizations. This reduces the ratio hO =L and depresses unskilled
wages. As a result, improvements in technology, which normally bene…t unskilled workers
as in Section 3, may actually hurt unskilled workers because they transform the organization
of production.
    An increase in Bs =Bp , which raises the relative pro…tability of the new organizational
form, also leads to further segregation of skilled and unskilled workers in di¤erent organi-
zations. This last comparative static result is useful since Bresnahan (1999) and Autor,
Levy and Murnane. (2000) argue that by replacing workers in the performance of routine
tasks, computers have enabled a radical change in the organization of production.42 This is
  42
    A related perspective is o¤ered by Aghion (2000), who also argues that computers replace unskilled
tasks. He suggests that computers are a “general-purpose technology”, so their di¤usion follows an inverted
S shaped pattern, and as more and more …rms adopted computers, demand for unskilled workers fell rapidly.

                                                    42
reminiscent to a technological change that makes the new-organization production function
more pro…table.
    These organizational stories are attractive since they provide a uni…ed explanation for
the changes in the wage structure and the apparent changes in the organization of …rms. An
interesting recent paper by Caroli and Van Rennan (1999) provides evidence suggesting that
changes in wages have been accompanied by changes in organizational forms. Acemoglu
(1999a) and Kremer and Maskin (1999) also provide evidence suggesting a number of
organizational changes in the U.S. economy during the past 25 years. Nevertheless, this
evidence does not yet enable an assessment of whether changes in organizational forms have
been an important contributor to the changes in labor market prices, and future research
is required to determine the role of organizational change.

6.2     Institutional Change
Two major changes in labor market institutions over the past twenty …ve years are the
decline in the real value of state and federal minimum wages and the reduced importance
of trade unions in wage determination. Many economists suspect that these institutional
changes may be responsible for the changes in the structure of the U.S. labor market (see
Freeman, 1991, DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux, 1995, Lee, 1999).
    The real value of the minimum wage eroded throughout the 1980s as nominal minimum
wages remained constant for much of this period. Since minimum wages are likely to
increase the wages of low paid workers, this decline may be responsible for increased wage
dispersion. DiNardo et al. (1995) and Lee (1999) provide evidence in support of this
hypothesis. Although the contribution of minimum wages to increased wage dispersion
cannot be denied, minimum wages are unlikely to be a major factor in the increase of
overall inequality. First, only a very small fraction of male workers are directly a¤ected
by the minimum wage (even in 1992, after the minimum wage hike of 1990-91, only 8
percent of all workers between the ages of 18 and 65 were paid at or below the minimum
wage). Although minimum wages may increase the earnings of some workers who are not
directly a¤ected, they are highly unlikely to a¤ect the wages above the median of the wage
distribution. But as Figure 3 shows, the di¤erence between the 90th percentile and the
median mirrors the behavior of the di¤erence between the median and the 10th percentile.43
This implies that whatever factors were causing increased wage dispersion at the top of
the distribution are likely to have been the major cause of the increase in wage dispersion
throughout the distribution. Second, the erosion in the real value of the minimum wage
started in the 1980s, whereas, as shown above, the explosion in overall wage inequality
  43
   Except during the early 1980s when there is a more rapid increase in inequality at the bottom of the
wage distribution, most likely due to the falling real value of the minimum wage.


                                                  43
began in the early 1970s.
    The declining importance of unions may be another important factor in the increase
in wage inequality. Unions often compress the structure of wages and reduce skill premia
(see, for example, Reynolds, 1951, or Freeman and Medo¤, 1984). Throughout the post-
war period in the U.S. economy, unions negotiated the wages for many occupations, even
indirectly in‡uenced managerial salaries (see DiNardo, Hallock and Pischke, 2000). Unions
also explicitly tried to compress wage di¤erentials. This suggests that the decline of unions
may have been a leading cause of the changes in the structure of wages.
    Although deunionization could in principle be an important factor in the structure of
wages, the extent and timing of deunionization suggests that it is not the major driving
force of the increase in inequality. First, wage inequality increased in many occupations
in which prices were never a¤ected by unions (such as lawyers and doctors). Moreover, in
the U.S., deunionization started in the 1950s, a period of stable wage inequality. During
the 1970s, though unionization fell in the private sector, overall unionization rates did not
decline much because of increased unionization in the public sector. Overall union density
was approximately constant, around 30 percent of the work force, between 1960 and 1975.
It was the anti-union atmosphere of the 1980s and perhaps the defeat of the Air-tra¢c
Controllers’ Strike that led to the most major declines of the unions, dating the sharp
declines in unionization after the rapid increase in inequality during the early 1970s.44
Evidence from other countries also paints a similar picture. For example, in the UK, wage
inequality started its sharp increase in the mid 1970s, while union density increased until
1980 and started the rapid decline only during the 1980s (Gosling, 1998). In Canada, while
unionization rates increased from around 30 percent in the 1960s to over 36 percent in
the late 1980s (Riddell, 1993, table 4.1), wage inequality also increased (see, for example,
Freeman and Needels, 1993, …gure 2.4).
    Although the timing of deunionization is inconsistent with this institutional change
being the major cause of the change in wage inequality, deunionization could clearly a¤ect
the wages of unskilled workers. One possibility is that deunionization is a contributing
factor. But why did the unions decline while technology was rapidly becoming more skill-
biased? Acemoglu, Aghion and Violante (2000) suggest that deunionization may have
been caused by the technological developments of the past decades. According to this
perspective, technical change is the driving force of the changes in the wage structure,
but it also causes deunionization, and the resulting deunionization can have a very large
indirect e¤ect on wage inequality, and cause the wages of less skilled workers to fall.
    To see the basic argument suppose that production can be carried out either in union-
ized or nonunionized …rms. In nonunionized …rms, workers receive their marginal products,
  44
     An interesting recent paper Farber and Western (2000) date the major decline in union activity to the
early 1980s, a few months before the Air-tra¢c Controllers Strike.


                                                   44
which I denote by Ah and Al for skilled and unskilled workers. Assume that unions always
compress the structure of wages—i.e., they reduce wage di¤erentials between skilled and
unskilled workers. This wage compression could be driven by a variety of factors. Ace-
moglu, Aghion and Violante (2000) argue that unions encourage productive training, and
such training is incentive compatible for …rms only when the wage structure is compressed
(see also Acemoglu and Pischke, 1999). Alternatively, collective decision making within
a union may re‡ect the preferences of its median voter, and if this median voter is an un-
skilled worker, he will try to increase unskilled wages at the expense of skilled wages. It is
also possible that union members choose to compress wages because of ideological reasons
or for social cohesion purposes. The empirical literature supports the notion that unions
compress wages, though it does not distinguish among the various reasons (see Freeman
and Medo¤, 1984). I capture this in a reduced form way here using the equation

                                           wH   Ah
                                     !=       ·Ã ;                                       (24)
                                           wL   Al
where Ã < 1. Unions could never attract skilled workers unless they provide some bene…ts
to them. Here I simply assume that they provide a bene…t ¯ to all workers, for example,
because unions increase productivity (e.g., Freeman and Medo¤, 1984, and Freeman and
Lazear, 1995), or because they encourage training. Alternatively, ¯ could be part of the
rents captured by the union. The zero pro…t constraint for …rms would be: (wH ¡ ¯)H +
(wL ¡ ¯)L · Ah H + Al L (in the case where ¯ stands for rents, the zero pro…t ensures that
the …rm does not wish to open a non-union plant). Combining this equation with (24),
and assuming that both hold as equality, we obtain

                                   (Ah + ¯) H + (Al + ¯) L
                            wH =                           Ah :                          (25)
                                       Ah H + Ã ¡1 Al L

Skilled workers will be happy to be part of a union as long as wH given by (25) is greater
than Ah . As Ah /Al increases—i.e., as there is further skill-biased technical change—, wH
will fall relative to Ah . Therefore, skill-biased technical change makes wage compression
more costly for skilled workers, eventually destroying the coalition between skilled and
unskilled workers that maintains unions.
    The important point is that deunionization causes a decline in the wages of unskilled
workers from wL = (AhA+¯)H+(A    ¡1
                                    l +¯)L
                                           ÃAl to Al . Unskilled workers, who were previously
                           h H+Ã    Al L
bene…ting from wage compression imposed by unions, experience a fall in real earnings as
a result of deunionization. Therefore, in this model, technical change not only a¤ects wage
inequality directly, but also induces a change in labor market institutions. The e¤ect of
this change in institutions on inequality can be potentially larger than the direct e¤ect of
technical change, and explain the decline in the real wages of less skilled workers.


                                             45
    Although Acemoglu, Aghion and Violante (2000) provide some evidence consistent with
these patterns, whether deunionization was important in the decline of the wages of low-skill
workers, and whether technical change is responsible for deunionization are open questions.
It might also be interesting to investigate whether changes in technology may have also
a¤ected the coalition supporting minimum wages, and hence played a role in the decline
in the minimum wage during the 1980s. For example if unions, which have traditionally
supported minimum wages, were weakened by the technological developments of the decade
as argued in this subsection, technological developments may have indirectly contributed
to the weakening of the coalition in support of minimum wages.45

6.3     Trade, Technical Change and Inequality
Finally, I discuss another major change a¤ecting the U.S. economy: the increased volume
of international trade. Increased international trade by itself is not the cause of the changes
in the U.S. wage structure, but trade could be a very important factor in determining wage
inequality if it also a¤ects the direction of technical change. Therefore, this subsection is
somewhat di¤erent from the previous two, since it is not about the e¤ect of technology on
the organization of the labor market, but on the e¤ect of a major change in regulations on
technological development. I group it with the other changes since it is about interactions
between technical change and the organization of the labor market, and since it provides a
possible explanation for the fall in the wages of the less skilled workers.
    Standard trade theory predicts that increased international trade with less developed
countries (LDCs), which are more abundant in unskilled workers, should increase the de-
mand for skills in the U.S. labor market. Therefore, the increase in international trade
may have been the underlying cause of the changes in U.S. wage inequality.
    To discuss these issues, consider the two good interpretation of the model in Section 3.
Consumer utility is de…ned over [Yl½ + Yh½ ]1=½ , with the production functions for two goods
being Yh = Ah H and Yl = Al L. Both goods are assumed to be tradable. For simplicity, let
me just compare the U.S. labor market equilibrium without any trade to the equilibrium
with full international trade without any trading costs.
    Before trade, the U.S. relative price of skill intensive goods, ph =pl , is given by
                                                     ·      ¸½¡1
                                         US     ph     Ah H
                                       p      =    =             :                                      (26)
                                                pl     Al L
  45
    Finally, both the decline in the role that unions play and in the value of minimum wages may have
been caused by changes in social norms, which could also be responsible for the increase in inequality (e.g.,
the emergence of the winner-take-all society as claimed by Frank and Cook, 1996). Unfrotunately, there is
currently little research on the e¤ect of social norms on inequality and on why inequality norms may have
changed over the past 30 years.



                                                     46
The skill premium is then simply equal to the ratio of the marginal value products of the
two types of workers, that is, ! U S = pU S Ah=Al . Next, suppose that the U.S. starts trading
with a set of LDCs that have access to the same technology as given by Ah and Al , but
are relatively scarce in skills. Denote the total supplies of skilled and unskilled workers in
the LDCs by H   b and Lb where H= b Lb < H=L, which simply reiterates that the U.S. is more
abundant in skilled workers than the LDCs.
   After full trade opening, the product markets in the U.S. and the LDCs are joined, so
there will be³ a unique
                      ´ world ³  relative´price. Since the supply of skill and labor-intensive
goods is Ah H + H   b and Al L + L      b , the relative price of the skill intensive good will be

                                      2  ³       ´ 3½¡1
                                              b
                                       Ah H + H
                               pW   =4   ³      ´ 5     > pU S :                             (27)
                                              b
                                       Al L + L

The fact that pW > pU S follows immediately from H=    b L
                                                         b < H=L. Intuitively, once the U.S.
starts trading with skill-scarce LDCs, demand for skilled goods increases and pushes the
prices of these goods up.
    Labor demand in this economy is derived from product demands. The skill premium
therefore follows the relative price of skill-intensive goods. After trade opening, the U.S.
skill premium increases to
                                                 Ah
                                      ! W = pW      > !U S                                   (28)
                                                 Al
where the fact that ! W > ! U S is an immediate consequence of pW > pU S . Therefore,
trade with less developed countries increases wage inequality in the U.S..
    The skill premium in the LDCs will also be equal to ! W after trade since the producers
face the same relative price of skill-intensive goods, and have access to the same tech-
nologies. Before trade, however, the skill premium in the LDCs was !        b = pbAh =Al , where
     ³           ´½¡1
         b lL
pb = Ah H=A    b      is the relative price of skill-intensive goods in the LDCs before trade.
The same argument as above implies that pb > pW , i.e., trade with the skill-abundant U.S.
reduces the relative price of skill-intensive goods in the LDCs. This implies that ! W < !
                                                                                         b;
after trade wage inequality should fall in the LDCs.
    Although in theory increased trade with the LDCs can be the cause of the rapid in-
crease in the demand for skills, most evidence suggests that the direct e¤ect of increased
international trade on the U.S. labor market has been relatively minor.
    First, as equation (27) shows, the e¤ect of international trade works through a unique
intervening mechanism: more trade with the LDCs increases the relative price of skill-
intensive goods, p, and a¤ects the skill premium via this channel. In fact, in this simple
framework, the percentage increase in the skill premium is directly proportional to the

                                               47
percentage increase in the relative price of skill-intensive goods. Perhaps the most damaging
piece of evidence for the trade hypothesis is that most studies suggest the relative price
of skill-intensive goods did not increase over the period of increasing inequality. Lawrence
and Slaughter (1993) found that during the 1980s the relative price of skill-intensive goods
actually fell. Sachs and Shatz (1994) found no major change or a slight decline. A more
recent paper by Krueger (1997) criticized the methods and data used by these studies, and
found an increase in the relative price of skill intensive goods. Nevertheless, the increase
in these prices is relatively small, so would not be able to account for the large increase in
the skill premium experienced in the U.S. economy (recall that the change in the relative
price of skill-intensive goods needs to be of the same order of magnitude as the change in
the skill premium).
    Second, with trade as the driving force, increased production of skill-intensive goods
should be drawing workers away from other sectors. In contrast, as documented by Murphy
and Welch (1993), Berman, Bound and Griliches (1994) and Autor, Katz and Krueger
(1998), all sectors, even those producing less skilled goods, increased their demands for
more educated workers. This pattern is not consistent with trade being the main driving
force of the increase in the demand for skilled workers (though one has to bear in mind
increased outsourcing in interpreting this fact, see Feenstra and Hanson, 1999).
    Third, a direct implication of the trade view is that, as shown above, while demand
for skills and inequality increase in the U.S., the converse should happen in the LDCs
that have started trading with the more skill abundant U.S. economy. The evidence,
however, suggests that more of the LDCs experienced rising inequality after opening to
international trade (see Hanson and Harrison, 1994, or Robbins, 1995). Although the
increase in inequality in a number of cases may have been due to concurrent political and
economic reforms, the preponderance of evidence is not favorable to this basic implication
of the trade hypothesis.
    Finally, a number of economists have pointed out that U.S. trade with the LDCs is
not important enough to have a major impact on the U.S. product market prices and
consequently on wages. Krugman (1995) illustrates this point by undertaking a calibration
of a simple North-South model. Katz and Murphy (1992), Berman, Bound and Griliches
(1994) and Borjas, Freem and and Katz (1997) emphasize the same point by showing that
the content of unskilled labor embedded in the U.S. imports is very small relative to the
changes in the supply of skills taking place during this period.46
  46
     This is probably the weakest criticism against the trade view, and many studies have pointed out how
international trade could have a larger e¤ect on U.S. labor market prices in the presence of labor market
rents. For example, Borjas and Ramey (1995), Rodrik (1996) and Dube and Reddy (1999) have argued
that the threat of international trade may reduce wages, especially in sectors with substantial rents, and
this change in bargaining power may a¤ect the earnings of unskilled workers more, increasing inequality.



                                                   48
    Although the above arguments suggest that increased international trade with LDCs is
not the major cause of the changes in the wage structure by itself, they do not rule out a
powerful e¤ect of international trade when it interacts with technical change. In particular,
in a world with endogenous technical change, increased international trade could a¤ect the
types of technologies developed and adopted by …rms, and have a large e¤ect through
this channel. This possibility was …rst raised by Adrian Wood (1994) who argued that
trade with the LDCs will lead to defensive skill-biased innovations. Wood, however, did
not develop the mechanism through which such defensive innovations could occur. I now
illustrate how trade causes skill-biased technical change using the endogenous technology
model developed in Section 5.2 (this analysis draws on Acemoglu, 1999b).
    Suppose that the U.S. starts trading with the LDCs as discussed above, and assume that
the LDCs always use U.S. technologies. Therefore, the supply of skilled and unskilled goods
in the LDCs is Yh = Ah H  b and Yl = Al L
                                        b where as before H=
                                                           b Lb < H=L. The immediate e¤ect
will be an increase in the relative price of skill-intensive goods as illustrated by equation
(27). Now, recall from the analysis in Section 5.2 that there is a relative price e¤ect on
the direct technical change: developing technologies to produce the more expensive good
is more pro…table. Trade, by making the skill-intensive goods more expensive, encourages
more skill-biased technical change.
    To determine exactly how the direction of technical change will be a¤ected by trade, we
need to know the market sizes for new technologies after trade opening. It is plausible to
assume that trade opening with the LDCs will not have a major e¤ect on the enforcement
of intellectual property right in the South. In that case, trade opening will induce skill-
biased technical change in the U.S.. Speci…cally, as long as after trade opening the U.S.
does not start producing technologies for unskilled workers in the LDCs, the relative market
sizes for the two types of technologies remain at H=L. This implies that the technology
market clearing condition, equation (18), no longer holds. In particular, since pW         W
                                                                                   h H > pl L
from equation (27), there will now only be incentives for skill-biased technical change.
                                                                                           ¡1
This process will continue until equation holds again, i.e., until pW = pW      W
                                                                            h =pl = (H=L) .
Therefore, the direction of technical change is still determined by equation (18) from Section
5.2, i.e., by U.S. domestic relative supplies alone. Intuitively, the relative price of skill-
intensive goods plays two roles in this model. The …rst is to clear the market for goods
(i.e., equation (27)), and the second is to ensure equilibrium in the technology market,
as captured by equation (18). Since the technology market clearing condition relates the
relative price of skill-intensive goods to the relative supplies in the U.S. market, which do
not change, the long-run equilibrium price of skill-intensive goods cannot change either.

where AUh S =AUl S is the pretrade skill bias of technology in the U.S..
     The implication is that when the direction of technical change in endogenous, trade
between the U.S. and the LDCs will induce skill-biased technical progress. The result is
not only that trade leads to an increase in skill premia, but that this can happen without
the counterfactual implications of the standard trade models discussed above
     The criticisms levied against the standard trade model do not apply in this model with
endogenous skill bias, mostly because trade with the LDCs induces skill-biased technical
change. The …rst implication of this induced skill bias is that the impact of trade on labor
markets may be much larger than predicted by the standard trade models, which helps
against the criticism that the amount of trade the U.S. undertakes with the LDCs is not
large enough. Second, because trade causes skill-biased technical change, the fact that all
sectors have increased the employment of skilled workers is consistent with trade being
the underlying cause of the increase in inequality. Third, for the same reason, there is a
force counteracting the decline in inequality in the LDCs implied by trade: these economies
use U.S. technologies, which are becoming more skill-biased. Finally, and quite strikingly,
trade leaves the relative price of skill-intensive goods in the U.S. unchanged in the long-run.
Recall that changes in relative prices are the usual intervening mechanism in trade models,
so a number of studies have concluded that trade has not been an important factor in the
increase in inequality because the relative price of skill-intensive goods has not increased
much (e.g., Lawrence and Slaughter, 1994, Sachs and Shatz, 1995). In this model, however,
we should expect no such changes; the long-run relative price of skill-intensive goods in
the U.S. is una¤ected by trade. More generally, induced skill-biased technical change in
the U.S. implies that trade will increase the price of skill-intensive goods by only a limited
amount, but will still have a major e¤ect on the U.S. labor market.
     Notice …nally that the interaction between international trade and technical change may
help to explain the decline in the wages of low-skill workers. Increased international trade
acts as an increase in the supply of unskilled workers, and as shown in our basic framework
in Section 3, puts downward pressure on unskilled wages. Borjas, Freeman and Katz
(1987), for example, provide evidence that increased international trade during the 1980s
reduced the wages of high school graduate workers (though they also suggest that the e¤ect
of the immigration of less skilled workers was greater). So overall, international trade could
still be a major driving force of the changes in the wage structure. However, for increased
trade to have such a large e¤ect on the structure of wages—and to avoid the aforementioned

                                              50
counterfactual implications— it must cause a change in the path of technological progress.
Therefore, what we have here is an alternative theory of acceleration: skill-biased technical
change accelerates, neither exogenously nor in response to the changes in the supply of
skilled workers, but in response to change in relative prices due to trade opening.


7     Changes in residual inequality
The previous sections highlighted that there are major unanswered questions regarding the
causes of the increase in inequality, the reasons for the faster skill-biased technical change
in the past few decades, and the determinants of the fall in the wages of low-skill workers.
These big questions awaiting further research not withstanding, we have a reasonably simple
and useful framework, and the beginnings of consistent answers. In contrast, in this and
the next section, I discuss areas where answers are much more tentative, and there is much
uncertainty and need for further research.
    I begin with residual inequality. A major issue that most models discussed so far failed
to address is the di¤erential behavior of returns to schooling and residual inequality during
the 1970s. I argue in this section that an explanation for this pattern requires models with
multi-dimensional skills.

7.1    A single index model of residual inequality
The simplest model of residual inequality is a single index model, in which there is only one
type of skill, though this skill is only imperfectly approximated by education (or experience).
Expressed alternatively, in a single index model observed and unobserved skills are perfect
substitutes. Consider, for example, the model developed above, but suppose that instead
of skills, we observe education, e.g. whether the individual is a college graduate, which is
imperfectly correlated with skills. A college graduate has a probability Ác of being highly
skilled, while a noncollege graduate is high skill with probability Án < Ác . Suppose that
the skill premium is ! = wH =wL . The college premium in this case is
                          wC  Á wH + (1 ¡ Ác ) wL   Á ! + (1 ¡ Ác )
                   !c =      = c                   = c               ;
                          wN  Án wH + (1 ¡ Án ) wL  Án ! + (1 ¡ Án )
while within-group inequality, i.e., the di¤erence between high wage college graduates (or
noncollege graduates) and low-wage college graduates (or noncollege graduates), is ! within =
!. It is immediately clear that both ! c and ! within will always move together—as long as
Ác and Án remain constant. Therefore, an increase in the returns to observed skills—such
as education— will also be associated with an increase in the returns to unobserved skills.
    This framework provides a natural starting point, linking between and within-group
inequality, but it predicts that within and between-group inequality should move together.

                                              51
However, as discussed above, during the 1970s, returns to schooling fell while residual group
inequality increased sharply. We can only account for this fact by positing a decline in Ác
relative to Án of a large enough magnitude to o¤set the increase in !; this would ensure
that during the 1970s the college premium could fall despite the increase in within group
inequality. A large decline in Ác relative to Án would predict a very di¤erent behavior of
the college premium within di¤erent cohorts, but the Appendix shows little evidence in
favor of this. I therefore conclude that the single index model cannot explain the changes
in residual inequality during the 1970s and 1980s.

7.2    Sorting and residual inequality
Another approach would combine educational sorting with an increase in the demand for
skills. Suppose, for example, wages are given by ln wit = µt ai + ° t hi + "it where hi is
a dummy for high education, ai is unobserved ability, and "it is a mean zero disturbance
term. Here ° t is the price of observed skills, while µt is the price of unobserved skills. The
education premium can be written as

            ln ! t ´ E (ln wit j hit = 1) ¡ E (ln wit j hit = 0) = ° t + µt (A1t ¡ A0t )

where A1t ´ E (ln wit j hit = 1) and A0t is de…ned similarly. Residual (within-group) in-
equality can be measured as V ar (Ait j h = 0) and V ar (Ait j h = 1).
    Under the assumption that there is perfect sorting into education, i.e., that there exists
a threshold a such that all individuals with unobserved ability a obtain education, within-
group inequality among high and low education workers will move in opposite directions
as long as the price of observed skills, µ, is constant. To see this, note that when µ is
constant and a declines (i.e., average education increases), V ar (Ait j h = 1) will increase,
but V ar (Ait j h = 0) will fall. Intuitively, there are more and more “marginal” workers
added to the high education group, creating more unobserved heterogeneity in that group
and increasing within-group inequality. But in contrast, the low education group becomes
more homogeneous. Therefore, without a change in the prices for unobserved skills, this
approach cannot account for the simultaneous increase in inequality both among low and
high education groups.
    A natural variation on this theme would be a situation in which ° and µ move together.
However, this will run into the same problems as the single index model: if ° and µ always
move together, then such a model would predict that within-group inequality should have
fallen during the 1970s. Therefore, models based on sorting also require a mechanism for
the prices of observed and unobserved skills to move di¤erently during the 1970s.




                                                52
7.3     Churning and residual inequality
Another approach emphasizes that workers of all levels of education may face di¢culty
adapting to changes. This has been argued by Aghion, Howitt and Violante (1999) and
Gould, Moav and Weinberg (2000). According to this approach, an increase in inequality
also results from more rapid technical change, not because of skill bias but because of
increased “churning” in the labor market. Aghion, Howitt and Violante (1999), for example,
suggest that only some workers will be able to adapt to the introduction of new technology,
and this will increase wage inequality.
    An advantage of this approach is that it is in line with the increased earnings instability
pointed out by Gottschalk and Mo¢t (1994). However, there is relatively little evidence
other than this increase in earnings instability that supports the notion that there is more
churning in the labor market. The data on job creation and job destruction reported by
Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996) shows no increase in job reallocation during the 1980s
or early 1990s, and most evidence does not indicate much of a decline in job stability over
this period (e.g. Diebold et al., 1997, or Farber, 1995).47 Also theories based on churning
do not naturally predict a divergence between returns to educations and residual inequality
during the 1970s. Therefore, a mechanism that could lead to di¤erential behavior in the
prices to observed and unobserved skills is still necessary.48

7.4     A two-index model of residual inequality
Since models based on a single index of skill (or models where di¤erent types of skills are
perfect substitutes) are inconsistent with the di¤erential behavior of returns to schooling
and within-group inequality during the 1970s, an obvious next step is to consider a two-
index model where observed and unobserved skills are imperfect substitutes (see Acemoglu,
1998). In particular, suppose that there are four types of workers, di¤erentiated by both
  47
      More recent evidence indicates that there may have been a decrease in job tenure during the later parts
of the 1990s (see, Neumark, et al, 1999).
   48
      An interesting theory similar to the churning models that could lead to such a di¤erential behavior
is advanced by Galor and Tsiddon (1997). They draw a distinction between ability and education, and
argue that returns to ability increase faster during periods of rapid technological change (see also Galor
and Moav, 2000). If we view the 1970s as a period of rapid technological change, as suggested above, this
theory would imply an increase in the returns to ability (unobserved skills) during this period. Nevertheless,
this interesting explanation is still not consistent with the facts since it predicts that returns to education
should have also increased during the 1970s, though less than residual inequality. This is because high
ability individuals are more likely to be high education, so rapid technological progress should also increase
returns to schooling. Perhaps a combination of this mechanism with di¤erential sorting into education,
or with imperfect substitution between high and low education workers, might be able to account for the
divergence between returns to schooling and residual inequality during the 1970s, but such a model has
not been developed yet.




                                                      53
education and unobserved skills. The economy has an aggregate production function

                       Y = [(Alu Lu )½ + (Als Ls )½ + (Ahu Hu )½ + (Ahs Hs )½ ]1=½ ;

where Lu is the supply of low-skill low education workers, and other terms are de…ned
similarly. Within-group inequality corresponds to the ratio of the wages of skilled low
education workers to those of unskilled low education workers, and/or to the ratio of the
wages of skilled high education workers to those of unskilled high education workers. A
natural starting point is to presume that the fraction of high skill workers in each education
group is constant, say at Ál = Ls =Lu and Áh = Hs =Hu > Ál , which implies that there are
more high ability workers among high education workers. With this assumption, within-
group inequality measures will be
                            µ     ¶                      µ      ¶
                    wLs       Als ½ ¡(1¡½)       wHs       Ahs ½ ¡(1¡½)
                         =          Ál      and       =            Áh     :               (29)
                    wLu       Alu                wHu       Ahu

      The college premium, on the other hand, is
                                                   µ            ¶½ µ       ¶¡(1¡½)
                                Á½h A½hs + A½hu        1 + Ál          H
                              != ½ ½                                                 :
                                Ál Als + A½lu          1 + Áh          L

Using this framework and the idea of endogenous technology, we can provide an explanation
for the di¤erential behavior of returns to schooling and within-group inequality during the
1970s. Recall that according to the endogenous technology approach, it is the increase
in the supply of more educated workers that triggers more rapid skill-biased technical
change. Because technology adjusts sluggishly, the …rst e¤ect of an increase in the supply
of educated workers, as in the 1970s, will be to depress returns to schooling, until technology
has changed enough to o¤set the direct e¤ect of supplies (see Figure 7). This change in
returns to schooling has no obvious implication for within-group inequality in a multi-skill
set up since it is the education skills that are becoming abundant, not unobserved skills—
in fact in equation (29) within-group inequality is invariant to changes in the supply of
educated workers unless there is a simultaneous change in Áh and Ál .
    Under the plausible assumption that more skilled workers within each education group
also bene…t from skill-biased technical progress, technical change spurred by the increase
in the supply of educated workers will immediately start to bene…t workers with more
unobserved skills, raising within-group inequality. Therefore, an increase in the supply of
educated workers will depress returns to schooling, while increasing within-group inequality.
After this initial phase, technical change will increase both returns to schooling and within-
group inequality.49
 49
      If the 1960s are also characterized by steady skill-biased technical change, equation (29) suggests that


                                                       54
    Overall, although single index models are not capable of explaining the changes in
residual inequality over the past thirty years, we do not know how important other factors
are. Analysis of the determinants of residual inequality and the reasons why there was an
explosion in overall inequality beginning in the 1970s remains a major research area.


8     Cross-country patterns
So far, I have focused on U.S. wage inequality patterns and incentives to develop new
technologies coming from the U.S. supply of skills. The cross-country dimension presents a
number of challenges. First, it is di¢cult to explain why inequality increased much more in
some countries than others. Second, when there are many countries in the world economy,
is it the relative supply of skills in each country or in the world as a whole that determines
the direction of technical change? I now brie‡y discuss these issues.

8.1     Di¤erences in inequality patterns
Although the tendency towards greater inequality has been a feature in many developed and
LDCs (see Freeman and Katz 1995, and Berman and Machin, 2000), there are also marked
di¤erences in the behavior of within and between-group inequality across these countries.
Katz, Blanch‡ower, and Loveman (1995) and Murphy, Riddell, and Romer (1998) show
that the di¤erential behavior of the supply of skills can go a long way towards explaining
the di¤erences in the returns to schooling, especially between the U.S., Canada and the
U.K. Nevertheless, it is puzzling that wage inequality increased substantially in the U.S.
and the UK, but remained fairly stable in many continental European economies (see, for
example, Davis, 1995, Gottschalk and Smeeding, 1999).
   The standard explanation for this divergent behavior, succinctly summarized by Krug-
man (1994) and OECD (1994), and sometimes referred to as the Krugman hypothesis,
maintains that inequality did not increase as much (or not at all) in Europe because labor
market institutions there encourage wage compression, limiting the extent of inequality.
This can be captured in the competitive framework of Section 3, where …rms are always
along their relative demand curve, by assuming that labor market institutions impose an
there should have been a steady increase in residual inequality during this decade as well. The data
presented in Section 2 do not support this prediction. Therefore, it seems that to explain the basic trends,
one needs to posit that improvements in technology take the form ln Aj (t) = ° 0j + ° j ¢ t with ° hs = ° hu >
° ls = ° lu during regular times, but when there is an acceleration in skill bias, the pattern changes to
favor workers with more unobserved skills, i.e., ° hs > ° hu and ° ls > ° lu . Although this assumption can
generate stable residual inequality before 1970s, and an increase in residual inequality during the 1970s, it
is largely ad hoc—it is reverse engineered to …t the facts.




                                                     55
exogenous skill premium ! = wH =wL . This implies:
                                      µ        ¶½=(1¡½)
                                H         Ah

where the level of employment of unskilled workers, l, will generally be less than their labor
supply L because of the wage compression. A more compressed wage structure—i.e., a
lower !— will therefore increase the unemployment of unskilled workers, given by L ¡ l.
    The view that wages are more compressed in Europe clearly has some merit. Blau and
Kahn (1995) show that the major di¤erence in overall inequality between the U.S. and
many continental European economies is not in the 90-50 di¤erential, but in the 50-10
di¤erential. This suggests that the minimum wage, strong unions, and generous transfer
programs in Europe are in part responsible for the relative wage compression in Europe.
    Nevertheless, the Krugman hypothesis runs into two di¢culties. First, unless there are
extremely rigid institutions that …x the skill premium exogenously, skill-biased technical
change should increase wage inequality irrespective of the degree of exogenously imposed
wage compression. In contrast, in many continental European economies, most notably in
Germany, wage inequality was very stable (see, e.g., Freeman and Katz, 1995).
    Second, the Krugman hypothesis makes an explicit prediction: to the extent that wage
compression is preventing the increase in the inequality of wages, pro…t maximizing em-
ployment decisions of …rms should lead to a large decline in the employment of unskilled
workers relative to that of skilled workers. In fact, skill-biased technical change might even
reduce the unemployment rates of skilled workers. Yet, in Europe, the unemployment of
skilled and unskilled workers increased together (e.g. Nickell and Bell, 1996, Krueger and
Pischke, 1997), and unskilled employment did not grow faster in the U.S. than in European
economies (Card, Kramartz and Lemieux, 1996, Krueger and Pischke, 1997).
    It is possible that bargaining arrangements in Europe between …rms and unions, imply
not only wage compression, but deviations from the relative demand curve for skills given by
(30). This can be because European institutions may be forcing …rms to pay uniform wages
to all educated workers irrespective of their exact contribution, making the employment
of skilled workers less pro…table as well. Alternatively, if unions represent both skilled
and unskilled workers, and are committed to wage compression, they may not want to
su¤er a large decrease in the employment of unskilled workers. So they may be willing to
make certain concessions in wage levels in order to induce …rms to employ more unskilled
workers at a compressed wage structure. Although such deviations from equation (30) are
a possibility, we have no direct evidence to assess how far o¤ the relative demand curve
European economies may be, and how they would respond to skill-biased technical change
in this situation. It is also useful to bear in mind that European economies, as the U.S.,
are likely to have experienced skill-biased technical change not only during the past thirty

                                                 56
years, but for much longer. So how continental European economies responded to the more
recent wave ofskill-biased technologies cannot be analyzed in a vacuum.
    An alternative view suggested by Nickell and Bell (1996) explains the di¤erences in the
wage structure across countries by di¤erences in the skill distribution. According to this
view, because of the relative weakness of the U.S. high school system, American noncollege
workers are less skilled than their European counterparts. However, recent work by Devroye
and Freeman (2000) shows that di¤erences in skill distribution have little to do with cross-
country di¤erences in wage dispersion. They document that dispersion of internationally
comparable test scores among native born Americans are very similar to those in Europe,
but wage inequality among native born Americans is much higher. Moreover, the Nickell-
Bell approach also fails to explain the di¤erential changes in inequality: the U.S. was
roughly as unequal as France in the 1970s, and the relative test scores of American youth
have not deteriorated since then.
    My preferred approach to explaining cross-country di¤erences is to consider the e¤ect
of labor market institutions on technology choices. In particular, the European labor
market institutions, which compress the structure of wages, will give greater incentives to
adopting labor-complementary technologies, and will reinforce wage compression. I give a
simple example to illustrate the point here. Suppose the productivity of a skilled worker
is Ah = a´, whereas the productivity of an unskilled worker is Al = a, where a is a
measure of aggregate technology in use, and ´ > 1. Suppose that wages are determined
by rent sharing, unless they fall below a legally mandated minimum wage, in which case
the minimum wage binds. Hence, wj = min f¯Aj ; wg, where j = l or h, and ¯ is worker’s
share in rent sharing. Note that the cost of upgrading technology does not featuring in this
wage equation, because rent sharing happens after technology costs are sunk. To capture
wage compression, suppose the minimum wage is binding for unskilled workers in Europe.
Now consider technology adoption decisions. In particular, …rms can either produce with
some existing technology, a, or upgrade to a superior technology, a0 = a + ®, at cost °. The
pro…t to upgrading the technology used by a skilled worker is (1 ¡ ¯)®´ ¡ °, both in the
U.S. and Europe. The new technology will therefore be adopted as long as

                                   ° · ° S ´ (1 ¡ ¯)®´.

Note that there is a holdup problem, discouraging upgrading: a fraction ¯ of the produc-
tivity increase accrues to the worker due to rent sharing (Grout, 1984, Acemoglu, 1996).
    The incentives to upgrade the technology used by unskilled workers di¤er between the
U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., this pro…t is given by (1 ¡ ¯)® ¡ °. So, the new technology
will be adopted with unskilled workers if

                                   ° · ° U ´ (1 ¡ ¯)®.

                                            57
Clearly, ° U < ° S , so adopting new technologies with skilled workers is more pro…table.
In contrast, the return to introducing the new technology is di¤erent in Europe because
minimum wages are binding for unskilled workers. To simplify the discussion, suppose that
even after the introduction of new technology, the minimum wage binds, i.e., w> ¯ (A + ®).
Then, the return to introducing the new technology in Europe with unskilled workers is
® ¡ °, and …rms will do so as long as ° < ®. Since ® > ° U , …rms in Europe have
greater incentives to introduce advanced technologies with unskilled workers than in the
U.S.. Intuitively, the binding minimum wage in Europe makes the …rm the full residual
claimant of the increase in productivity of unskilled workers. This highlights that in an
economy with a compressed wage structure, …rms may have a greater incentive to increase
the productivity of unskilled workers (see Acemoglu and Pischke, 1999, for this argument
in the context of training).
    As long as the cost of upgrading technologies, °, is small, i.e., less than ° U , new tech-
nology will be used both with skilled and unskilled workers in the U.S. and Europe. In
this case, cross-country inequality levels will be stable. This corresponds to the situation
in the 1950s and 1960s. In contrast, if ° is high, for example, because the technological
improvements of the 1980s are more expensive to implement, there may be a divergence in
                                                                 ¡     ¢
inequality between the two economies. For instance, if ° 2 ° U ; ® , then new technology
will not be adopted with unskilled workers in the U.S., but it will be used with unskilled
workers in Europe. As a result, while wage inequality increases in the U.S., it will remain
stable in Europe. Therefore, a simple story for cross-country di¤erences in inequality trends
emerges from this model: wage compression encourages the use of more advanced technolo-
gies with unskilled workers, and acts to reinforce itself in Europe. In contrast, technological
developments can harm the earnings of low-skill U.S workers who are not protected by this
type of compression. Whether the interaction between wage compression and technology
choice could be important in explaining European inequality and unemployment patterns
is an area for future study.

8.2    International determinants of technology
The endogenous technology framework developed above links the skill bias of technology to
the relative supply of skills. There are a number of interesting and di¢cult issues that arise
when we consider the international dimension. Here I simply mention some preliminary
approaches, but clearly much theoretical and empirical work remains to be done.
    A …rst extension of the endogenous technology idea to an international context might
be to suppose that skill bias in each country is determined by the country’s relative supply
of skills. However, there are reasons to expect that new technologies will spread across
countries. In this case, it may be the incentives in the technologically most advanced


                                              58
country (the technological leader) that determine the skill bias of world technologies. This
description may be adequate for understanding the skill bias of technologies used by less
developed countries (see for example Acemoglu, 1999b). It is also possible for other techno-
logically advanced economies to pursue a di¤erent path of technological development than
the leader, in which case domestic incentives may be important in shaping skill bias.
    What determines the skill bias of technologies developed by the technological leader?
This depends on the market sizes for di¤erent types of technologies, hence on the interna-
tional enforcement of intellectual property rights. For example, in the discussion on the
e¤ect of trade on technology, I supposed that there were no intellectual property rights for
U.S. companies enforced in less developed economies. In this case, incentives to develop
new technologies are shaped by the U.S. domestic supplies. This may be a good starting
point, since even when property rights are enforced, there will be a number of di¢culties
facing U.S. companies marketing their technologies in other countries. For example, tech-
nologies may need to be adapted to conditions in local markets, or producers in LDCs may
be unable to pay for these technologies because of credit problems.
    It is also worth noting that even when a country is using U.S. technologies, its e¤ective
skill bias may be in‡uenced by its domestic skill supply. This is because U.S. technologies
need to be adapted to local conditions, and …rms will have a greater incentive to do this
when there is a larger supply of workers to use these technologies. So it may be not only
technological change that is endogenous to relative supplies, but also technology adoption.
    Finally, another interesting cross-country dimension comes from looking at wage in-
equality trends in LDCs. As discussed in Section 6.3, the …rst order predictions of the
standard trade theory are not borne out: instead of a decline in inequality, which would
have been expected due to the greater integration of these economies into world trade,
inequality increased in most LDCs. The recent paper by Berman and Machin (2000) shows
an interesting pattern: while there has been rapid skill upgrading in many middle income
countries, there is much less evidence for rapid skill upgrading in the poorest economies.
A possible explanation for these patterns is that middle income countries are adopting
advanced technologies much more rapidly than the poorest countries, and since these tech-
nologies are more skill-biased, these economies are undergoing rapid skill upgrading and
increases in inequality. Furthermore, if, as claimed by Acemoglu and Zillibotti (1999),
new technologies developed in the rich economies are typically “too skill-biased” for LDCs,
the recent acceleration in skill bias could have negative implications for the LDCs. More
generally, the impact of technologies developed in the advanced economies on LDC labor
markets is an area that requires further research.

9.1    Data sources
 The samples are constructed as in Katz and Autor (2000). I thank David Autor for pro-
viding me with data from this study. Data from 1939, 1949 and 1959 come from 1940, 1950
and 1960 censuses. The rest of the data come from 1964-1997 March CPSs. The college
premium is the coe¢cient on workers with a college degree or more relative to high school
graduates in a log weekly wage regression. The regression also includes dummies for other
education categories, a quartic in experience, three region dummies, a nonwhite dummy,
a female dummy, and interactions between the female dummy and the nonwhite dummy
and the experience controls. The sample includes all full-time full-year workers between
the ages of 18 and 65, and except those with the lowest 1 percent earnings. Earnings for
top coded observations are calculated as the value of the top code times 1.5. The rela-
tive supply of skills is calculated from a sample that includes all workers between the ages
of 18 and 65. It is de…ned as the ratio of college equivalents to non-college equivalents,
calculated as an Autor, Katz and Krueger (1998) using weeks worked as weights. In partic-
ular, college equivalents=college graduates+0.5£workers with some college, and noncollege
equivalents=high school dropouts+high school graduates+0.5£workers with some college.
    Samples used for overall and residual wage inequality include only white male full-time
full year workers between the ages of 18 and 65, and excludes those earnings less than
half the real value of the 1982 minimum wage converted from nominal dollars using the
personal consumption expenditure de‡ator (see Katz and Autor, 2000). Earnings for top
coded observations are calculated as the value of the top code times 1.5.

9.2    The behavior of overall inequality during the 1970s
In an important paper on the e¤ect of labor market institutions on inequality, DiNardo,
Fortin and Lemieux (1995) provide evidence suggesting that in the May CPSs, there is no
increase in inequality during the 1970s. In Table 1, I display numbers from the survey by
Katz and Autor (2000), who report changes in residual inequality for the past four decades
from three di¤erent sources; decennial censuses, and March CPSs and May CPSs (and
later Outgoing Rotation Group …les–ORGs). These numbers show no signi…cant change in
residual or overall inequality during the 1960s, and consistent increases in inequality from
all sources during the 1970s and the 1980s. For example, the data from the Census and
the March CPSs indicate that the 90-10 di¤erential increased about .01 a year between
1970 and 1979, while the 90-50 di¤erential increased by about .011 a year during the same
period. The May CPS data show a smaller increase in the 90-10 di¤erentials during this
period, but a comparable increase in the 50-10 di¤erential. Overall, although there is less
uniformity among data sources regarding the behavior of residual inequality than returns
to schooling (see Katz and Autor, 2000), there is considerable evidence that residual and
overall inequality started to increase during the 1970s.




                                            60
9.3    Can composition e¤ects explain inequality changes?
A possible explanation for the patterns we observe could be changes in the distribution
of unobserved skills—or more concretely, composition e¤ects. For example, the average
ability of workers with high education may have increased relative to that of workers with
low education over time. Here, I document that the increase in the returns to education and
residual inequality are not simply due to composition e¤ects. Note …rst that composition
e¤ects cannot by themselves explain the recent changes in inequality: as noted in subsection
7.2, composition e¤ects suggest that inequality among educated and uneducated workers
should move in opposite directions. This suggests that changes in the true returns to skills
have played at least some role in the changes in inequality.
    More generally, to get a sense of how important composition e¤ects may be, consider a
variant of equation (13) above with two education levels, high h = 1 and low h = 0, and
suppose wages are given by

                                    ln wit = ai + ° t hi + "it                              (31)

where hi is a dummy for high education, ai is unobserved ability, and "it is a mean zero
disturbance term. De…ne the (log) education premium—the di¤erence between the average
wages of high and low education workers—can be written as

              ln ! t ´ E (ln wit j hi = 0) ¡ E (ln wit j hi = 0) = ° t + A1t ¡ A0t

where A1t ´ E (ai j hi = 0) and A0t is de…ned similarly. The increase in the education
premium can be caused by an increase in ° t (a true increase in the returns to skills) or
an increase in A1t ¡ A0t . There are basically two reasons for an increase in A1t ¡ A0t : (1)
changes in cohort quality, or (2) changes in the pattern of selection into education.
    Consider changes in cohort quality …rst. If, as many claim, the U.S. high school system
has become worse, we might expect a decline in A0t without a corresponding decline in
A1t . As a result, A1t ¡ A0t may increase. Alternatively, as a larger fraction of the U.S.
population obtains higher education, it is natural that selection into education (i.e., the
abilities those obtaining education) will change. It is in fact possible that those who are
left without education could have very low unobserved ability, which would translate into
a low level of A0t , and therefore into an increase in A1t ¡ A0t .
    Although these scenarios are plausible, theoretically the opposite can happen as well.
For example, many academics who have been involved in the U.S. education system for
a long time complain about the decline in the quality of universities, while the view that
American high schools have become much worse is not shared universally (e.g., Krueger,
1998). The selection argument is also more complicated than it …rst appears. It is
true that, as long as those with high unobserved abilities are more likely to obtain higher
education, an increase in education will depress A0t . But it will also depress A1t . To
see why assume that there is perfect sorting—i.e., if an individual with ability a obtains
education, all individuals with ability a0 > a will do so as well. In this case, there will exist
a threshold level of ability, a, such that only those with a > a obtain education.Ra        Next
                                                                              1              a+b0
consider a uniform distribution of ai between b0 and b0 +b1 . Then, A0 = a¡b       b0
                                                                                      ada =   2
               1
                    R b0 +b1       b0 +b1 +a
                                                                                0

and A1 = b1 ¡b0 ¡a a         ada =     2
                                             . So both A0 and A1 will decline when a decreases

                                               61
to a0 . Moreover, A1 ¡ A0 = b1 =2, so it is una¤ected by the decline in a. Intuitively, with
a uniform distribution of ai , when a increases, both A0 and A1 fall by exactly the same
amount, so the composition e¤ects have no in‡uence on the education premium. Clearly,
with other distributions of ability, this extreme result will no longer hold, but it remains
true that both A0 and A1 will fall, and whether this e¤ect will increase or decrease the
education premium is unclear. Overall, therefore, the e¤ects of changes in composition on
education premia is an empirical question.
    Empirically, the importance of composition e¤ects can be uncovered by looking at in-
equality changes by cohort (see Blackburn, Bloom and Freeman, 1992; Juhn, Murphy and
Pierce,1993). To see this, rewrite equation (31) as

                                      ln wict = aic + ° t hic + "cit                              (32)

where c denotes a cohort—i.e., a group of individuals who are born in the same year. I have
imposed an important assumption in writing equation (32): returns to skills are assumed
to be the same for all cohorts and ages; ° t —though clearly they vary over time. We can
now de…ne cohort speci…c education premia as

             ln ! ct ´ E (ln wict j hi = 0) ¡ E (ln wict j hi = 0) = ° t + A1ct ¡ A0ct

where A1ct ´ E (aic j hi = 0) and A0ct is de…ned similarly. Under the additional assumption
that there is no further schooling for any of the cohorts over the periods under study, we
have ln ! ct = ° t + A1c ¡ A0c , which implies

                             ¢ ln ! c;t0 ¡t ´ ln ! ct0 ¡ ln ! ct = ° t0 ¡ ° t ;                   (33)

i.e., changes in the returns to education within a cohort will reveal the true change in
the returns. The assumption that returns to skills are constant over the lifetime of an
individual may be too restrictive. Murphy and Welch (1992), for example, show quite
di¤erent age earning pro…les by education. Nevertheless, a similar argument can be applied
in this case too. For example, supposeln ! cst = ° st + A1c ¡ A0c for cohort c of age s in
year t, and that ° st = ° s + ° t (this assumption is also not necessary, but simpli…es the
discussion). Then ¢ ln ! c;t0 ¡t = ° s0 ¡ ° s + ° t0 ¡ ° t , where obviously s0 ¡ s = t0 ¡ t. Now
consider a di¤erent cohort, c00 that is age s0 in the year t and age s in the year t00 . Then
¢ ln ! c00 ;t¡t00 = ° s0 ¡ ° s + ° t ¡ ° t00 . So, the true change in the returns to skills between the
dates t00 and t0 is

                        ¢2 ln ! ´ ¢ ln ! c;t0 ¡t ¡ ¢ ln ! c00 ;t¡t00 = ° t0 ¡ ° t00 :             (34)


    Using data from the 1950-1990 censuses, Table A2 gives some of the single and double
di¤erences of cohort inequality for white men aged 26-55. The single di¤erences show
increases in the returns to college within most cohorts, with the exception of the years
between 1970 and 1980. Therefore, these increases are likely to re‡ect di¤erential age e¤ects
by education. In contrast, the numbers in Panel C for the 1950-70 period show no increases,
suggesting that the double di¤erence does a good job of controlling for composition e¤ects.
The numbers for the 1960-80 period are negative, which likely re‡ect the decline in the

                                                     62
college premium between 1960 and 1980. The …nal row gives the most important results of
this table. The 1970-90 double di¤erences are large and positive, suggesting that the true
returns to education increased over this time period. Interestingly, despite the well-known
evidence that the college premium increased faster for younger workers over the 1980s, the
results in Table A2 show that the true increase in returns to skills between 1970 and 1990
are comparable for cohorts born between 1936 and 1955. These results therefore indicate
that the major component of the increase in that college premium during the 1980s and
90s was changes in skill prices, not composition e¤ects.
    Table A3, which replicates Table 3 from Juhn, Murphy and Pierce (1993), shows that
the increase in overall and residual inequality cannot be explained by composition e¤ects
either. Panel A shows that the 90-10 di¤erential for cohorts entering the market between
1935 and 1964 is approximately constant between 1964 and 1970, but increases sharply for
each cohort between 1970 and 1976, and then increases further in 1982 and 1988. Panel B
shows a similar picture for log wage residuals. These results suggest that the changes in the
structure of wages observed over the past 30 years cannot be explained by pure composition
e¤ects, and re‡ect mainly changes in the true returns to observed and unobserved skills.

     Note: The …rst panel gives the ratio of the employment of skilled relative to unskilled, and
 the wage bill of skilled to unskilled workers for the corresponding skill categories. These data
 are taken from Autor, Katz and Krueger (1998). Some college refers to those with more than a
 high school (hence the measure is those with more than high school divided by those with high
 school or less). College graduate refers to all of those with a college degree, and college equivalent
 is de…ned as in Autor et al. It is those with a college degree+ 0.5 £those with some college
 (correspondingly, the unskilled are de…ned as those with high school and less +0.5 £those with
 some college). The bottom panel gives the implied technology shifts using equations (8) and (9)
 above for di¤erent values of the elasticity of substitution. The demand index D is de…ned as

90-10 is the di¤erence between the 90th and 10th percent of the log wage or residual distribution,
and 50-10 is the di¤erence between the median and 10th percent of the corresponding distribu-
tion. The residuals are estimated from log earnings regressions with nine education dummies, a
quartic in experience and their interactions. See notes to Tables 3 and 4 in Katz and Autor (2000).

    Note: The top panel gives the college premium from the Census indicated at the beginning
of the row for cohorts born in the …ve year intervals indicated at the head of the column. For
example, the …rst number is for individuals born between 1906-10 from the Census of 1950. The
college premium is de…ned as the wages of workers from that cohort with a college degree or more
divided by the wages of workers from that cohort with twelve years of schooling. The bottom
panel gives the change in the college premium for a given cohort between the two indicated dates
and the di¤erence between the wage growth of two neighboring cohorts as indicated by equations
(33) and (34). All data are from the decennial censuses for white males born in the U.S..
