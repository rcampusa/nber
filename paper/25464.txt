                                           ABSTRACT

One of the most successful empirical relationships in international trade is the gravity equation,
which relates bilateral trade flows between an origin and destination to bilateral trade frictions,
origin characteristics, and destination characteristics. A key decision for researchers in estimating
this relationship is the level of aggregation, since the gravity equation is log linear, whereas
aggregation involves summing the level rather than the log level of trade flows. In this paper, we
derive an exact Jensen's inequality correction term for the gravity equation in a nested constant
elasticity of substitution (CES) import demand system, such that a log-linear gravity equation
holds exactly for each nest of this demand system. We use this result to decompose the effect of
distance on bilateral trade in the aggregate gravity equation into the contribution of a number of
different terms from sectoral gravity equations. We show that changes in sectoral composition
make a quantitatively relevant contribution towards the aggregate effect of distance, particularly
for more disaggregated definitions of sectors.

1     Introduction
One of the most successful empirical relationships in international trade is the gravity equation, which relates bilateral
trade between an origin and destination to bilateral frictions, origin characteristics, and destination characteristics. A
key decision for researchers in estimating this relationship is the level of aggregation, since the gravity equation is log
linear, whereas aggregation involves summing the level rather than the log level of trade flows. Therefore, Jensen’s
inequality would appear to imply that if a log-linear gravity equation holds at one level of aggregation, it cannot in
general also hold at another level of aggregation. In such circumstances, estimating the gravity equation at another
level of aggregation can be interpreted at best as providing a log-linear approximation to the true relationship at
this other level of aggregation. This problem is compounded, because there is little consensus in existing theoretical
research about the appropriate level of aggregation at which the gravity equation holds. Some models derive this
relationship at the aggregate level, while others predict that it holds at the sectoral level, and yet others imply that
is holds at an even more disaggregated level below sectors. Mirroring this theoretical ambiguity, researchers have
estimated the gravity equation using aggregate, sector and even firm-level data, and find that it provides a reasonable
approximation to the data at each of these levels of aggregation.
    In this paper, we use the nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES) demand system to show that a log-
linear gravity equation holds exactly at each nest of utility. In particular, we use the independence of irrelevant
alternatives (IIA) properties of CES to derive an exact Jensen’s inequality correction term for aggregation across the
nests of utility. Choosing the aggregate economy and sectors as our nests of utility, we estimate gravity equations
at both the sectoral and aggregate level, and show how to aggregate exactly from the sectoral to the aggregate level.
We decompose the effect of distance on bilateral trade in the aggregate gravity equation into the contribution of a
number of different terms from the sectoral gravity equations: (i) origin fixed effects; (ii) destination fixed effects;
(iii) distance; (iv) our Jensen’s inequality or composition term; and (v) the error term. We show that our composition
term makes a quantitatively relevant contribution towards the aggregate effect of distance. Although we choose the
aggregate economy and sectors as our two nests of utility, our theoretical results hold for any definition and number
of nests with the CES demand system. Therefore, our analysis also encompasses, for example, regions and firms as
other possible levels of aggregation.1 Finally, although for brevity we focus on the gravity equation for international
trade, our analysis also goes through for other applications of gravity equations in economics with a nested demand
structure, including but not limited to migration, commuting and financial flows.
    Our paper is related to a voluminous theoretical literature on the gravity equation in international trade, as re-
cently surveyed in Anderson (2011) and Head and Mayer (2014). In early empirical research following Tinbergen
(1962), the gravity equation was found to be empirically successful in explaining observed trade data, but lacked rig-
orous theoretical microfoundations. More than fifty years later, we have an abundance rather than a scarcity of these
theoretical microfoundations, with an entire class of models that are isomorphic in terms of their gravity equation
predictions, as emphasized in Arkolakis, Costinot, and Rodriguez-Clare (2012) and Allen, Arkolakis, and Takahashi
(2018). This class of models includes neoclassical theories with perfect competition and constant returns to scale
(e.g. Deardorff 1998 and Eaton and Kortum 2002), Armington models with differentiation by country of origin (e.g.
   1 Whereas we focus on gravity equation estimation for sectoral and aggregate trade, Redding and Weinstein (2018) develop a theoretical frame-

work for aggregating from millions of trade transactions on individual firms and products to national trade and welfare using data on the value of
trade and unit values.



                                                                        2
Anderson and van Wincoop 2003), “new trade” theory models with monopolistic competition and increasing returns
to scale (e.g. Krugman 1980), “new new trade” theory models with heterogeneous firms, monopolistic competition
and increasing returns to scale (e.g. Melitz 2003 with an untruncated Pareto productivity distribution, as in Chaney
2008 and Arkolakis, Demidova, Klenow, and Rodriguez-Clare 2008), and models of buyer-seller networks (e.g. Chaney
2018). Our main theoretical contribution relative to this literature is to show that a log-linear gravity equation holds
exactly at each level of aggregation in a nested CES demand system and to characterize the properties of the error
term at each of these levels of aggregation.
   Our paper also contributes to an equally-large body of empirical research that has found the gravity equation
to provide a good approximation to observed bilateral trade data. Much of this research has estimated the gravity
equation using data on aggregate bilateral trade between countries, exploring a whole range of different bilateral trade
frictions, including distance, common borders and common currencies along many others (as in Redding and Venables
2004 and the survey by Head and Mayer 2014). Another influential line of research has estimated the gravity equation
using more disaggregated data, including sectors, regions within countries, and even firms (e.g. Davis and Weinstein
1999, Head and Ries 2001, Feenstra, Markusen, and Rose 2001, Combes, Lafourcade, and Mayer 2005, Bernard, Redding,
and Schott 2011, Berthelon and Freund 2008 and Bas, Mayer, and Thoenig 2017).
   Great progress has been made in this empirical literature in addressing a number of challenges in estimating the
gravity equation, including the presence of zeros in international trade flows (e.g. Santos Silva and Tenreyro 2006), the
role of the extensive versus the intensive margins of trade (e.g. Helpman, Melitz, and Rubinstein 2008) and the need
to control for changes in multilateral resistance in undertaking counterfactuals for changes in bilateral trade frictions
(e.g. Anderson and van Wincoop 2003). One remaining empirical challenge is the choice of the appropriate level
of aggregation at which to estimate the gravity equation, as considered in the context of aggregating from regions
to countries in Ramondo, Rodríguez-Clare, and Saborio (2016) and Coughin and Novy (2018), and in the context of
Ricardian models of trade in Lind and Ramondo (2018). This empirical challenge is an example of the more general
Modifiable Area Unit Problem (MAUP) in the statistics literature following Gehlke and Biehl (1934) and Fotheringham
and Wong (1991), whereby the results of statistical analyses need not be invariant to the scale at which these analyses
are undertaken. This empirical challenge is particularly severe for gravity equation estimation, because different
theories yield different predictions as to the scale at which the gravity equation holds, including for example the
aggregate economy in Eaton and Kortum (2002) and sectors in Costinot, Donaldson, and Komunjer (2012). Our main
empirical contribution relative to this literature is to develop a metric for assessing the impact of aggregation on
gravity equation estimates.
   Finally, as noted above, our results also apply for other applications of the gravity equation in economics with a
nested demand structure, including for example migration (e.g. Kennan and Walker 2011), commuting (e.g. Ahlfeldt,
Redding, Sturm, and Wolf 2015, Monte, Redding, and Rossi-Hansberg 2018 and Heblich, Redding, and Sturm 2018),
and capital flows (e.g. Martin and Rey 2004).
   The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we first develop our main theoretical result
that there is an exact Jensen’s inequality correction term such that a log-linear gravity equation holds at each level
of aggregation in a nested CES demand system. In Section 3, we estimate gravity equations at both the sectoral and
aggregate level. We use these estimates to decompose the effect of distance on bilateral trade in the aggregate gravity
equation into the contributions of different terms from the sectoral gravity equations. Section 4 concludes.

2     Theoretical Framework
We consider a simple model of international trade across countries and sectors based on differentiation by origin
following Armington (1969). Although we choose this formulation for simplicity, our results hold for any international
trade model with a nested CES import demand system, including for example the multi-sector Ricardian model of
Costinot, Donaldson, and Komunjer (2012), a multi-sector version of Krugman (1980), and a multi-sector version of
Melitz (2003) with an untruncated Pareto productivity distribution.

2.1    Preferences

The world economy consists of a number of countries indexed by d, o ∈ Ω, where we use d as a mnemonic for
destination and o as a mnemonic for origin. The preferences of the representative consumer in each destination are
defined over consumption indexes (Cds ) for a number of sectors indexed by s ∈ Ξ, where we use s as a mnemonic
for sector. The utility function is assumed to take the following constant elasticity of substitution (CES) form:
                                             "                      σ
                                                                 # σ−1
                                               X             σ−1
                                       Ud =       (Θds Cds ) σ         ,    σ>1                                         (1)
                                                 s∈Ξ

where σ > 1 is the elasticity of substitution between sectors and Θds > 0 is the taste of the representative consumer
in destination d for sector s. Under our assumption that Θds > 0, the representative consumer in each country
consumes goods from all sectors.
    The consumption index for destination d in sector s (Cds ) is defined over the consumption of the output of each
origin o within that sector (cdos ) and also takes the CES form:
                                            "                         # ν ν−1
                                                                           s
                                                                         s
                                               X                νs −1
                                     Cds =          (θdos cdos ) νs           ,    νs > 1                               (2)
                                               o∈Ωds

where νs > 1 is the elasticity of substitution across countries within sectors; we allow this elasticity of substitution to
differ between sectors s; θdos ≥ 0 is the taste of the representative consumer in destination d for the goods produced
by origin o within sector s; and Ωds ⊆ Ω is the set of origins from which destination d consumes goods in sector s in
positive amounts.
    We allow the tastes of the representative consumer for the goods within each sector to have a destination compo-
nent (ϕds ), an origin component (ϕos ), and a origin-destination component (ϕods ) such that:

                                                       θdos = ϕds ϕos ϕods .                                            (3)

    Using the properties of these CES preferences, equilibrium expenditure by destination d on the goods produced
by origin o within sector s (xdos ) can be written as:
                                                           1−νs
                                                       pdos            νs −1
                                            xdos =                Xds Pds    ,                                          (4)

                                                                                                   P             
where pdos is the price in destination d of the goods produced by origin o in sector s; Xds =         o∈Ωds   xdos is total
expenditure by destination d on sector s; and Pds is the price index dual to the consumption index in equation (2) for
destination d in sector s:                             "                 # 1
                                                           X  pdos 1−νs 1−νs
                                             Pds =                             .                                        (5)
                                                               θdos
                                                           o∈Ωds


                                                                   4
    In empirical gravity equation estimation, it is common to use datasets in which only data on trade with foreign
countries is reported. Therefore, we focus on the model’s predictions for trade with foreign countries, and use the
independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) property of CES to partition expenditure in each sector into expenditure
on domestic goods and expenditure on foreign goods. In particular, using this property of CES preferences, we have
the following equivalent expression for expenditure by destination d on the goods produced by origin o 6= d within
sector s (xdos ):
                                                                 1−νs

total expenditure by destination d on foreign origins o 6= d within sector s; we allow for the possibility that destination
d need not import from all foreign origins o 6= d within sector s, such that {Ωds : o 6= d} ⊆ Ω; and Pds is a price
index for foreign consumption for destination d in sector s that is defined as:

2.2    Production

The good produced by each country in each sector is supplied under conditions of perfect competition and constant
returns to scale. Zero profits implies that the “free on board” (fob) price of each origin’s good in each sector is equal
to its unit cost of production:
                                                            pos = ηos ,                                                                 (9)

where ηos is a composite measure of unit cost, which could depend on the price of intermediate inputs and the prices
of multiple primary factors of production (left implicit here).
    Trade between countries is subject to iceberg variable trade costs, such that τdos > 1 units of a good must be
shipped from origin o to destination d 6= o in order for one unit to arrive, where τdds = 1. Under these assumptions,
the “cost inclusive of freight” (cif) price in destination d of the good produced by origin o in sector s is:

                                                  pdos = τdos pos = τdos ηos .                                                         (10)

2.3    Sectoral Gravity

We now show that this multi-sector Armington model implies a log-linear sectoral gravity equation for bilateral trade
between destination d and origin o in each sector s for which there is positive trade. Combining CES import demand
from equation (6) with the pricing rule from equations (9) and (10), we obtain the following sectoral gravity equation
for the value of foreign trade between countries d and o 6= d within sector s:
                                                                    1−νs
                                                          τdos ηos                   νs −1
                                            xdos =                              Xds Pds    .                                           (11)
                                                           θdos

                                                                  5
   From this sectoral gravity equation, zero bilateral flows (xdos = 0) can arise for two reasons in the model. First,
destination d may not import in sector s from origin o if bilateral trade costs are prohibitive (τdos → ∞). Second,
even if bilateral trade costs are non-prohibitive (τdos < ∞), destination d need not import in sectors s from origin o
if there is no demand for the goods produced by that origin in those sectors (θdos → 0).
   Taking logarithms in equation (11) for all origin-destination-sector observations for which there is positive trade,
this sectoral gravity equation can be written as:

                                     ln xdos = γos + λds − (νs − 1) ln τdos + udos ,                                    (12)

where γos is a fixed effect for origin o in sector s; λds is a fixed effect for destination d in sector s; and udos is a
stochastic error. The origin fixed effect (γos = (1 − νs ) [ln ηos − ln ϕos ]) controls for the unit cost of production and
the common origin-sector component of tastes across all destinations; the destination fixed effect (λds = ln Xds +(νs −
1) [ln Pds + ln ϕds ]) controls for destination sectoral import expenditure (Xds ), the destination sectoral import price
index (Pds ), and the common destination-sector component of tastes across all origins; and the stochastic error (udos =
ln ϕdos ) captures the idiosyncratic component of tastes (ϕdos ) that is specific to an individual origin-destination-sector
observation, as defined in equation (3).
   If bilateral trade is positive for all pairs of origins and destinations in all sectors (xdos > 0 for all d, o, s) and
bilateral trade costs (τdos ) are observed, equation (12) can be estimated with a conventional fixed effects or least squares
dummy variables (LSDV) estimator. Under the identifying assumption that the stochastic error udos is orthogonal to
observed bilateral trade costs, this fixed effects estimator consistently estimates the sectoral trade elasticity (νs − 1).
More generally, if bilateral trade costs are not observed, they can be modelled as a function of a number of observed
bilateral characteristics and a stochastic error. Finally, if zero bilateral trade flows occur, they could be correlated with
bilateral trade costs, and the presence of these zero trade flows can be addressed using for example the Poisson fixed
effects estimator of Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) or a Heckman selection correction as in Helpman, Melitz, and
Rubinstein (2008).

2.4    Aggregate Gravity

We now show that this multi-sector Armington model also implies a log-linear aggregate gravity equation between
each destination d and origin o. Aggregate foreign imports in destination d from origin o 6= d are the sum across
sectors s of imports from that origin in each sector:
                                                    X
                                           Xdo =            xdos ,        o 6= d,                                       (13)
                                                    s∈Ξdo

where Ξdo ⊆ Ξ is the set of sectors in which destination d has positive imports from origin o 6= d.
   At first sight, equations (12) and (13) appear inconsistent with the existence of a log-linear aggregate gravity
equation. The sectoral gravity equation (12) is log linear, whereas aggregate trade in equation (13) is the sum of the
level rather than the sum of the log level of sectoral trade. Therefore, Jensen’s inequality appears to imply that a log-
linear gravity equation cannot simultaneously hold at both the sectoral and aggregate level. However, we now use the
independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) properties of CES to derive an exact Jensen’s inequality correction term,
such that a log-linear gravity equation holds exactly at both the sectoral and aggregate levels, but the interpretation
of the error term in these equations differs across these two different levels of aggregation.

                                                                6
   As a first step, we rewrite destination d’s aggregate imports from origin o 6= d (Xdo ) as equal to the sum across
sectors of the share of these imports in its total expenditure on all foreign imports (xdos /Xd ) multiplied by its total
expenditure on all foreign imports (Xd ):
                                                                "     P                    #
                                                                         s∈Ξdo xdos
                                 X                   X xdos

                                                        Xd        j∈{Ωd :j6=d}  r∈Ξdj xdjr
                                 s∈Ξdo                s∈Ξdo

where recall that Ξdo ⊆ Ξ is the set of sectors in which destination d has positive imports from origin o 6= d;
{Ωd : j 6= d} ⊆ Ω is the set of foreign origins j 6= d from which destination d imports; and destination d’s total
                                                   hP              P            i
imports from all foreign origins are given by Xd =    j∈{Ωd :j6=d}  r∈Ξdj x djr   .
   As a second step, we define a measure of the importance of destination d’s imports from origin o 6= d in sector s
as a share of its imports from that origin across all sectors (Zdos ):
                                                                     "       #
                                            xdos                       X        xdos
                              Zdos ≡ P                      ⇒            xdor =      .                                                   (15)

This expression must hold for each sector s for which destination d has positive imports from origin o 6= d. Therefore,
taking logarithms of this relationship, and averaging across all these sectors s with positive imports from origin o to
destination d, we obtain:                      "                  #       "              #

                                                                        Ndo          Zdos

         S
where   Ndo   = |Ξdo | is the number of sectors with positive trade between origin o and destination d.
   As a third step, we define a measure of the importance of destination d’s imports from country o 6= d in sector s
as a share of its imports across all foreign origins and sectors (Ydos ):
                                                                                                                       
                                        xdos                                                   X         X                      xdos

Again this expression must hold for each sector s for which destination d has positive imports from origin o. Hence,
taking logarithms in this relationship, and averaging across all origins o and sectors s with positive imports to desti-
nation d, we obtain:
                                                                                                                             

                                                                          NdO                    S
                                                                                               Ndo                    Ydos

where NdO = |{Ωd : o 6= d}| is the number of origins o with positive trade for destination d.
   In a fourth step, we take logarithms in equation (14) for destination d’s imports from origin o 6= d (Xdo ) and use
equations (16) and (18) to substitute for the two summation terms, which yields:
                         "                                                                   

              ln Xdo =       S

Using our sectoral gravity equation (12) to substitute for xdos in equation (19), we obtain the following log-linear
expression for aggregate bilateral trade between origin o and destination d:

                                               ln Xdo = Γdo + Λdo − Tdo + Jdo + Udo ,                                                    (20)


                                                                              7
where Γdo is an average of the origin-sector fixed effects (γos ); Λdo is an average of the destination-sector fixed effects
(λds ); Tdo captures the average effect of sectoral bilateral trade frictions ((νs −1) ln τdos ); Jdo is our Jensen’s inequality
or composition term, which includes Zdos and Ydos , and controls for the difference between the mean of the logs and
the log of the means; and Udo is an average of the sectoral error terms (udos ).
    Each of these averages is taken across the sectors with positive trade between origin o and destination d and hence
varies bilaterally. In particular, Γdo equals the average origin-sector fixed effect (γos ) across the set of sectors with
positive trade between destination d and origin o minus the average origin-sector fixed sector (γos ) across all origins
and sectors for that destination:
                                                                                                      

Each of the other averages is defined analogously. Therefore, Λdo equals the average destination-sector fixed effect
(λds ) across the set of sectors with positive trade between between destination d and origin o minus the average
destination-sector fixed sector (λds ) across all origins and sectors for that destination:

Similarly, Tdo captures the average effect of sectoral trade costs ((νs − 1) ln τdos ) across the set of sectors with positive
trade between destination d and origin o minus the average effect of these sectoral trade costs ((νs − 1) ln τdos ) across

In contrast, our Jensen’s inequality or composition term (Jdo ) depends on the average across sectors of the log import
share ln Zdos for origin o and the average across origins and sectors of the log import share ln Ydos :

Finally, Udo equals the average error term (udos ) across the set of sectors with positive trade between destination d
and origin o minus the average error term (udos ) across all origins and sectors for that destination:
                                                                                        

                           Udo ≡  S          udos − O                     S
                                                                                    udos  .                               (25)
                                    Ndo s∈Ξ            Nd                Ndo  s∈Ξ
                                                   do                  o∈{Ωd :o6=d}            do



Therefore, in each case, a destination’s trade with a given origin depends on the average value of a variable with that
origin relative to its average value across all origins.
    In a fifth and final step, we absorb the bilateral variation in the components Γdo , Λdo , Jdo and Udo into the
error term of our log-linear expression for aggregate bilateral trade, such that equation (20) can be re-written as the
following conventional aggregate gravity equation:

                                           ln Xdo = ηoX + µX
                                                           d −V
                                                                X           X
                                                                  ln τdo + wdo .                                           (26)



                                                                   8
In this specification, we define the origin fixed effect (ηoX ) as the average across destinations of the bilateral component
Γdo from equation (21):
                                                         1         X
                                                ηoX =                        Γdo ,                                       (27)

which only varies by origin o. Similarly, we define the destination fixed effect (µX
                                                                                   d ) as the average across origins of

Λdo from equation (22):
                                                         1         X
                                                µX
                                                 d =                         Λdo ,                                       (28)

which only varies by destination d.
    Additionally, we include an aggregate measure of bilateral trade costs (τdo ) together with a constant coefficient
V X on this aggregate measure in equation (26). In our empirical work below, we proxy both sectoral and aggregate
bilateral trade costs using bilateral distance, which takes a common value across all sectors, although we allow the
coefficient on this variable to vary across sectors in our sectoral gravity equations.
                                                                              X
    Both equations (20) and (26) hold simultaneously, because the error term wdo includes (i) bilateral variation in Γdo ;
(ii) bilateral variation in Λdo ; (iii) heterogeneity in the average effect of sectoral trade costs ((νs − 1) ln τdos ) across
origin-destination pairs depending on the set of sectors with positive trade; (iv) the Jensen’s inequality or composition
term; and (v) the error term Udo :

In general, the properties of this composite error term (wdo ) can be quite different from those of the average sectoral
error term (Udo ). Therefore, even if this average sectoral error term (Udo ) is orthogonal to the true measure of bilat-
                                                                                                       X
eral trade costs (Tdo ) in equation (20), there is no necessary reason why this composite error term (wdo ) should be
orthogonal to the aggregate measure of trade costs (ln τdo ) in equation (26).
    We are thus in a position to establish our main theoretical result:

Proposition 1 In a nested CES demand system, both sectoral and aggregate bilateral trade flows can be expressed as
gravity equations that are log linear in origin characteristics, destination characteristics, a measure of bilateral trade
costs, and a stochastic error.

Proof. The proposition follows immediately from equations (12) and (26).

    Therefore, although Jensen’s inequality implies that the log of a sum is not equal to the sum of the logs, there exists
an exact Jensen’s inequality correction term for the nested CES demand system, such that bilateral trade flows at each
level of aggregation can be expressed as a log-linear function of origin characteristics, destination characteristics,
bilateral trade frictions, and a stochastic error.

2.5    Components of Aggregate Gravity

Returning to our log-linear expression for aggregate bilateral trade between origin o and destination d in equation
(20), we can use the additive separability of this relationship in the bilateral components of aggregate trade (Γdo , Λdo ,
Tdo , Jdo , Udo ) to provide further evidence on the mechanisms through which bilateral trade costs affect aggregate


                                                               9
bilateral trade flows. In particular, as well as estimating an aggregate gravity equation (26) for aggregate bilateral
trade (Xdo ), we can estimate aggregate gravity equations for each of its components (Γdo , Λdo , Tdo , Udo ):

                                              Γdo = ηoΓ + µΓd − V Γ τdo + wdo
                                                                           Γ
                                                                              ,                                         (30)

                                              Λdo = ηoΛ + µΛ    Λ       Λ
                                                           d − V τdo + wdo ,

                                                                          T
                                                                             ,

                                               Jdo = ηoJ + µJd − V J τdo + wdo
                                                                            J

                                              Udo = ηoU + µU    U       U
                                                           d − V τdo + wdo .


where we can compute Γdo , Λdo , −Tdo , Jdo , and Udo from estimates of the sectoral gravity equations (12) using the
observed data on bilateral trade.
    Estimating equations (26) and (30) using ordinary least squares (OLS), the estimated coefficient on bilateral trade
costs for aggregate trade (V X ) is the sum of those for each bilateral component (V Γ , V Λ , V T , V J , V U ). Therefore,
the relative magnitude of these estimated coefficients reveals the extent to which the effect of bilateral trade costs on
aggregate bilateral trade (V X ) captures the direct effect of these trade costs on sectoral bilateral trade (V T ) versus
indirect effects through changes in the composition of sectors with different origin fixed effects (V Γ ), destination fixed
effects (V Λ ), import shares (V J ), and error terms (V U ).


3    Data and Empirical Results
In our empirical analysis, we use the BACI CEPII world trade database, which reports the bilateral value of trade by
Harmonized System (HS) 6-digit product, origin and destination. To abstract from considerations that are specific to
the agricultural sector, we focus on mining and manufacturing products (HS 2-digit sectors 16-96), excluding arms
and ammunition (HS 2-digit sector 93). We model bilateral trade costs as a constant elasticity function of bilateral
distance between the most-populated cities of each origin and destination. We allow this elasticity of bilateral trade
costs with respect to bilateral distance to differ across sectors. We report results using bilateral trade data for 2012,
but find similar results for other years.
    We begin by estimating both an aggregate gravity equation and gravity equations for each sector. We do so for a
range of different definitions of sectors, including HS 1-digit, HS 2-digit, HS 3-digit and HS 4-digit categories. As we
include exporter and importer fixed effects in our gravity equations, we drop exporter-sector cells with less than 3
importers and importer-sector cells with less than 3 exporters, which results in slightly different samples of exporters
and importers for each definition of sector.
    As a first step, we sum bilateral trade flows across sectors, and estimate the aggregate gravity equation (26) for each
of our samples. As reported at the bottom of Table 1 (row (vi)), we estimate a similar aggregate distance coefficient
across these four samples. We find a elasticity of aggregate trade with respect to bilateral distance of around −1.65,
which is in line with existing studies, and is statistically significant at conventional critical values.
    As a second step, we estimate separate gravity equations for each sector for our alternative definitions of sectors.
We find substantial heterogeneity in the estimated distance coefficients across sectors. These estimated distance coef-
ficients range from −1.9011 to −1.2794 using 1-digit sectors, −1.9428 to −0.8692 using 2-digit sectors, −1.9480 to
−0.7242 using 3-digit sectors, and −2.0576 to 1.5683 using 4-digit sectors. By itself, this heterogeneity in estimated

Note: Gravity equation estimates of aggregate bilateral trade from equation (26) (row (vi)) and the components of aggregate bilateral trade from
equation (30) (rows (i)-(v)) using the CEPII BACI trade database. Coefficients in rows (i)-(v) sum to the coefficient in row (vi). Columns correspond
to different definitions of sectors. Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors in parentheses.


distance coefficients across sectors suggests that the average distance coefficient will vary across origin-destination
pairs with the set of sectors in which there is positive trade. We find that the extent of these differences in average
distance coefficients generally increases as we move from less to more disaggregated definitions of sectors. For ex-
ample, using 4-digit sectors, the unweighted average distance coefficient varies across origin-destination pairs from
−1.3995 at the 10th percentile to −1.0970 at the 90th percentile, and the trade-weighted average distance coefficient
ranges from −1.5012 to −0.9885 between these same percentiles.
    As a third and final step, we compute each of the components of aggregate bilateral trade (Γdo , Λdo , Tdo , Jdo ,
Udo ) in equation (20), and estimate separate gravity equations for each component, as in equation (30) above. In rows
(i)-(v) of Table 1, we report the estimated distance coefficient for each component for alternative definitions of sectors
(across the columns). The sum of the coefficients for each component across rows (i)-(v) equals the coefficient for
aggregate bilateral trade in row (vi).
    Perhaps unsurprisingly, we find that much of the effect of distance on aggregate trade (row (vi)) occurs through
the average effect of distance on sectoral trade (row (iii)). Nonetheless, we find a substantial negative and statistically
significant coefficient on our composition term (row (iv)), which ranges from −0.5188 using 1-digit sectors to −1.2846
using 4-digit sectors. We also find positive and statistically significant correlations with distance for the origin-sector
fixed effects (row (i)), the destination-sector fixed effects (row (ii)), and the error term (row (v)). This pattern of results
is consistent with Alchian-Allen type effects, in which trade relationships over longer distances are a selected sample
of relationships with superior characteristics. The net effect of all of these forces is that the ratio of the aggregate to
the sectoral distance coefficients ranges from 1.05 to 1.40, depending on the level of aggregation, which highlights the
importance of compositional differences for aggregate trade over long versus short distances.

4      Conclusions
Although the gravity equation is one of the most successful empirical relationships in economics, existing research
provides relatively little guidance as to the appropriate level of aggregation at which to estimate this relationship. In
this paper, we make two main contributions to this question.
     First, we derive an exact Jensen’s inequality correction term for the nested CES demand structure, such that a
log-linear gravity equation holds exactly for each nest of utility. Second, we use this result to decompose the effect
of distance on bilateral trade in the aggregate gravity equation into the contribution of a number of different terms
from gravity equations estimated at a more disaggregated level: (i) origin fixed effects; (ii) destination fixed effects;
(iii) distance; (iv) our Jensen’s inequality or composition term; and (v) the error term.
     Second, using the aggregate economy and sectors as our two nests of utility, we show that sectoral composition
makes a quantitatively relevant contribution to the overall effect of bilateral distance on international trade in the
aggregate gravity equation.
