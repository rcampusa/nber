        Empirical research on gender pay gaps has traditionally focused on the role of gender-specific

factors, particulmly gender differences in qualifications and differences in the treatment of otherwise

equally qualified male and female workers (i.e., labor market discrimination).      This paper explores

the determinants of the gender pay gap and argues for the importance of an additional factor, wage

structure, the array of prices set for labor market skills and the rewards received for employment in

favored sectors.   Drawing on joint work with Lawrence Kahn, I illustrate the impact of wage

structure by presenting empirical results analyzing its effect on international differences in the gender

gap and trends over time in the gender differential in the U.S.

        While the gender pay gap has been an important focus of modem economists concerned

with the economics of gender, it was not necessarily the primary concern of early commentators

on gender inequities.          For example, in the 19th century, with few married women employed

outside the home, observers like American feminist, Charlotte Perkins Gillman (1898), and

Marxist, FriedrichEngels(1884),           focused on the gender division of labor itself and espoused the

emancipating       effects of women’s participation in market work. Among economists as well as

the general public, interest in gender issues including the gender pay gap has proceeded hand-in-

hand with the gro~h        in women’s labor force participation.      As women have come to comprise a

larger share of the paid labor force and as market work has loomed larger in the typical woman’s

life, interest in the determinants of gender differences in labor market outcomes has also grown.

        Of these labor market outcomes, the wage is of fundamental importance as a maj or

determinant of economic welfare for employed individuals, as well as of the potential gain to

market employment         for those not currently employed.      Further it serves as a significant input into

a myriad of decisions ranging from labor supply to marriage and fertility, as well as a factor

influencing bargaining power and relative status within the family. Thus, I focus here on wages

in cotidence       that I am examining a question of considerable interest to economists and of

considerable importance to women’s economic well-being.               However, I readily acknowledge that

wages are by no means the whole story even as a measure of economic well-being.

        Research on the gender pay gap has traditionall y focused on the role of what might be

termed, gender-specific         factors, particularly gender differences in qualifications   and differences

in the treatment of otherwise equally qualified male and female workers (i.e., labor market

discrimination).      An innovative feature of recent research on gender and race differentials has

been to integrate the analysis of the gender pay gap as well as other demographic             differentials

into the stud y of wage structure in general. ] Wage structure describes the array of prices set for

various labor market skills (measured and unmeasured) and rents received for employment in

particular sectors of the economy.

         Wage structure is potentially of considerable importance in determining the relative

earnings of groups like women who tend on average to have lower skills or to be located in lower

paying sectors of the economy.       In this paper I will first consider the determinants of gender

differentials, highlighting    the role of wage structure. 1 will then illustrate the impact of wage

structure by summarizing       some of my recent work with Lawrence Kahn on international

differences in male-female wage differentials (Blau and Kahn 1992a, Blau and Kahn 1995, and

Blau and Kahn 1996), and on trends over time in gender differentials in the U.S. (Blau and Kahn

1994, Blau and Kahn forthcoming).         I will then offer some concluding thoughts and suggest

some implications for public policy.




   DETERMINANTS               OF THE GENDER        PAY GAP:     GENDER      SPECIFIC     FACTORS




        An initial early impetus to the study of wage differentials was provided by the British

experience in World War I. Pursuant to the war effort, there was some substitution of women

into traditionally   male civilian jobs, although not nearly to the degree that there would be during

World War II. Questions of the appropriate pay for women under these circumstances            arose and

stimulated a number of economic analyses of the sources of the gender pay differential—all            of

which gave a prominent causal role to occupational segregation (e.g., Edgeworth 1922, Fawcett

1918, Webb 1919). Modem efforts to understand the gender pay gap have generally rested on
                                                   3


WO strong pillars: the human capital explanation and models of labor market discrimination.

These are gender sDecific explanations in that they focus on gender differences in qualifications

or treatment as the cause of the pay gap.

        Human capital explanations developed by Mincer andPolachek(1974),           Polachek (1 981 )

and others explain gender differences in economic outcomes on the basis of productivity

differences between the sexes. This explanation is based on the gender division of labor within

the family which, as we have seen, was the focus of the 19th century commentators,       and traces

the impact of this division on the wages and occupations of men and women.        Anticipating

shorter and more discontinuous     work lives as a consequence of their role within the family,

women will have less incentive to invest in market-oriented    formal education and on-the-job

training than men. Their resulting smaller human capital investments will lower their earnings

relative to men’s. Similar considerations   are also expected to produce gender differences in

occupations, as women choose occupations where such investments are less important and where

the wage penalties for work force interruptions are smaller. In the absence of parental leave

policies, women will especially avoid jobs requiring large investments in firm-specific skills

because the returns to such investments are reaped only as long as one remains with the firm.

Since the costs of firm-specific training are shared by employers and employees, employers are

reluctant to hire women for these j obs due to their shorter expected tenure on average. The

difficulty of distinguishing   more career-oriented women from less career-oriented women means

that the former may be the victims of such “statistical discrimination”   as well (see below).

        Thus, the human capital model provides a logically consistent explanation for gender

differences in economic outcomes based on the traditional division of labor in the family. Not
                                                    4



only will women earn less, but they will tend to be located in different occupations.      Gender

differences in industrial distribution could also occur if industries vary in their skill requirements,

Thus the human capital model provides a rationale for the pay gap based on the voluntary

decisions of women and men. Working in a similar direction is Becker’s (1 985) model in which

the longer hours women spend on housework lowers the effort they put into their market jobs

compared to men’s and hence reduces their wages. But these models may also be viewed as

shedding light on how the traditional division of labor in the family disadvantages women in the

labor market. Thus, in this sense, they provide some support for the claim of the 19th century

observers that the traditional division of labor is of fundamental importance in determining

women’s status within the larger society. To the extent that gender differences in outcomes are

not fully accounted for by productivity differences derived from these and other sources, models

of labor market discrimination    offer an explanation.

        Theoretical work on discrimination     was initiated by Becker’s (1957) examination of race

discrimination.    Becker conceptualized   discrimination   as a taste or personal prejudice against

members of a particular group. Models of statistical discrimination       were later developed, in part

to explain the persistence of discrimination   in the long run in the face of competitive labor

markets (e.g., Phelps 1972, Aigner and Cain 1977, and Lundberg and Startz 1983). Such models

assume a world of uncertainty and imperfect information and focus on differences between

groups in the expected value of productivity or in the reliability with which productivity may be

predicted.   Since the real or perceived average gender differences that underlie statistical

discrimination    against women in the labor market tend to stem from the traditional division of

labor in the family, this constitutes another route by which traditional gender roles within the
                                                        5


family adversely effect women’s labor market outcomes.               Another aspect of interest is the

relationship between occupational segregation and a discriminatory              wage gap formulated in

Bergmam’s      (1974) overcrowding model. Discriminatory             exclusion of women from “male” jobs

results in an excess supply of labor in “female” occupations, depressing wages there for

otherwise equally productive workers,

        These two explanations,         gender differences in qualifications and differences in treatment

of otherwise similar men and women, do not necessarily constitute mutually exclusive sources of

gender wage differentials.         Both may play a role and empirical studies based on cross-sectional

data within countries provide considerable empirical support for each, One problem here is that

evidence for discrimination        relies on the existence of a residual gender pay gap which cannot be

explained by gender differences in measured qualifications.            This accords well with the definition

of labor market discrimination,        i ,e., pay differences between groups that are not explained by

productivity   differences, but may also reflect group differences in unmeasured qualifications          or

compensating      differentials.    If men are more highly endowed with respect to these omitted

variables then we would overestimate discrimination.           Alternatively,   if some of the factors

controlled for (e.g., occupation, tenure with the employer) themselves reflect the impact of

discrimination,    then discrimination     will be underestimated.

        Another challenge to empirically decomposing the gender pay gap into its constituent

parts is the existence of feedback effects. The traditional division of labor in the family may

influence women’s market outcomes through its effects on their acquisition of human capital and

on rationales for employer discrimination        against them. But it is also the case, that by lowering

the market rewards to women’s human capital investments and labor force attachment,
                                                    6


discrimination   may reinforce the traditional division of labor in the family (e.g., Blau 1984, Blau

and Ferber 1992, Weiss and Gronau 1981, and Lundberg and Startz 1983). Even small initial

discriminatory   differences in wages may cumulate to large ones as men and women make human

capital investment and time allocation decisions on the basis of them. Another 19th century

observer, JohrI Stuart Mill, touched on this very relationship over 100 years ago when he

advocated women’s “admissibility     to all the finctions   and occupations hitherto retained as the

monopoly of the sti-onger sex,” claiming that “their disabilities elsewhere are only clung to in

order to maintain their subordination   in domestic life” (1878: 94).




DETERMINANTS           OF THE GENDER         PAY GAP:        THE ROLE OF WAGE STRUCTURE




        Thus, we see that the clear determination of the impact of qualifications    VS,

discrimination   in the gender pay gap is difficult for both empirical and conceptual reasons.

However, both explanations share a common focus of being gender specific explanations of the

pay gap. Analyses of trends over time in the gender differential within countries as well as

intercountry comparisons of gender earnings ratios have traditionally tended to emphasize these

types of gender-specific   factors. The last 15 to 20 years have been a time of ferment in the labor

market with rapid changes in skill differentials and thus wage inequality in much of the

industrialized   world. Nowhere have these changes been more dramatic than in the U.S. It has

been a natural extension of the study of these types of realignments to examine their

consequences     for various demographic groups. Moreover, upon further reflection it is clear that

the traditional gender specific factors imply an important role for wage structure.
                                                     7


         The human capital model suggests that men and women tend to have different levels of

labor market skills (especially work experience) and to be employed in different occupations and

perhaps in different industries.   Discrimination   models too suggest that women may be

segregated in different sectors of the labor market. This implies a potentially important role for

wage structure in determining the pay gap. All else equal, the larger the returns to skills and the

larger the rents received by individuals in favored sectors, the larger will be the gender gap.

Similarly, labor market discrimination      and/or actual female deficits in unmeasured skills result in

employers treating women as if they have lower unmeasured as well as measured skills, Thus,

the higher the rewards to unmeasured skills, the larger will be the gender gap, other things being

equal.

         The notion of a “high” or a “low” return is intrinsically a relative concept, Thus, the

framework provided by wage stracture requires some frame of reference and is particularly

useful in analyzing changes over time in gender differentials or differences across countries in

gender gaps. Such intertemporal and cross-country comparisons enable us to measure the effects

of wage structure comua rativelv with reference to the situation that existed at an earlier point in

time or that prevails in another country.

         Consider the following examples.      Suppose that in two countries, women have lower

levels of labor market experience than men but that the gender difference in experience is the

same in the two countries.   If the return to experience is higher in one country, then that nation

will have a larger gender pay gap. Similarly, an increase in the return to experience within a

country will, all else equal, raise the gender gap. Or, as another example, suppose that the extent

of occupational   segregation by sex is the same in two countries but that the wage premium
                                                     8


associated with employment in “male” jobs is higher in one country, Then, again, that nation

will have a higher pay gap. In like manner, an increase over time in the wage premium for

“male” jobs will increase the gender gap, ceteris paribus.     This second example suggests that a

clear-cut distinction between gender-specific factors and wage structure may be difficult to

achieve. A gender-specific      policy like comparable worth which mandates pay adjustments

across male and female jobs to provide for equal pay for work of equal value within the firm, can

obviously affect wage structure. Nonetheless, as I hope to show below, the notion of wage

structure is quite usefil and can shed considerable light on international differences in the gender

gap as well as trends over time within countries.

         Wage structure itself is determined by a variety of factors, including relative supplies of

labor of various skill levels, technology, the composition of demand, and wage setting

institutions.    In recent years, there has been an increase in wage inequality within most of the

industrialized    countries (Gottschalk and Joyce 1995). Juhn, Murphy and Pierce (1993), in their

work on the U.S. trends, make a strong case that this trend reflects a rising return to skills, both

measured and unmeasured.        We do not have fill consensus regarding the reasons for this increase

in the return to skill, but technological   change and the impact of international trade are two of the

chief candidates in the United States (e.g., Katz and Murphy 1992, Bound and Johnson 1992,

Borjas and Ramey 1995). In addition, institutional factors, including declining union density and

a falling value of the minimum wage, appear to have also contributed to rising inequality

(Freeman 1994, Card forthcoming).

         With respect to international comparisons, Kahn and I have emphasized in our work that

systems of centrally-determined      pay are likely to entail less wage inequality and smaller gender
                                                      9


wage differentials for a number of reasons. First, in the U. S., a significant portion of the male-

female pay gap has been found to be associated with interindust~        or interfirm wage differentials

(Blau 1977, Johnson and Solon 1986, Sorensen 1990, and Groshen 1991). The relatively large

pay variation across industries and firms in the U.S. is to some extent an outgrowth of our

relatively decentralized pay-setting institutions.    Therefore, centralized systems which reduce the

extent of wage variation across industries and firms are likely to lower the gender differential, all

else equal. Second, since in all countries the female wage distribution lies below the male

distribution,   centralized systems that raise minimum pay levels regardless of gender will also

tend to lower male-female wage differentials.        In Blau and Kahn (forthcoming a), we find

considerable evidence consistent with the view that, compared to the U. S., the more centralized

wage setting institutions of other industrialized countries not only reduce overall wage

inequality, but that this reduction is primarily due greater compression at the bottom of the wage

distribution in these countries rather than at the top. This tendency to bring up the bottom of the

wage distribution    in turn reflects not only the impact of conscious government and union policies

in some countries, but, more generally, wage setting institutions in both the union and nonunion

sector which lead to greater wage compression in each sector compared to the U.S. Of particular

interest, is the greater prevalence in other countries of contract extension and other informal

mechanisms which extend union-detemined          wages (and thus the more compressed union wage

structure) to the nonunion sector.

      INTERNATIONAL           DIFFERENCES       IN THE GENDER          GAP:    A U.S.-SWEDEN
                                               COMPARISON



         My work with Lawrence Kahn on international differences in the gender gap addresses a

puzzle    While the relative qualifications of American women are high compared to women in

other countries and the U.S. has had a longer and ofien stronger commitment to anti-

discrimination   laws than most industrialized nations, the U, S. has traditionally been among the

countries with the largest gender gaps. Our results based on comparisons of the U.S. to nine

other industrialized   nations (Blau and Kahn 1995 and Blau and Kahn 1996) suggests that the

resolution of this paradox lies in the enormous importance of overall wage structure in explaining

the lower ranking of U.S. women. That is, the gender gap in the U, S. is relatively high, not

because of the traditional gender-specific   factors but rather due to the relatively large penalty that

the U.S. wage structure imposes on groups that have below average skills (measured and

unmeasured) or are located in less favored sectors. We find that the U.S. gap would be similar

to that in countries like Sweden and Australia (the countries with the smallest differentials) if the

U.S. had their level of wage inequality.

         I illustrate the role of wage structure in influencing international differences in the gender

pay gap in more detail by presenting some of our findings for the U.S.-Sweden comparison (Blau

and Kahn 1996). This comparison is of interest because the U.S. and Sweden represent cases at

the extremes of an international ranking of gender ratios with Sweden having among the highest

gender ratios of the advanced industrialized countries, and the U. S. having among the lowest.

This was particularly the case for the year from which we draw our data, 1984, since the gender

gap has been narrowing in the U.S. and widening in Sweden. An additional reason why our
                                                  11


results for these two countries are especially interesting is that our data sources, the Michigan

Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) for the U.S. and the Household Market and Nonmarket

Activities Survey (HUS) for Sweden, contain information on actual labor market experience and

thus permit us to control for this important variable in our wage regressions and corresponding

decompositions.

     Sweden Differences in the Ge rider GarI

       The extent of the U.S ,-Sweden difference in gender ratios maybe seen in Figure 1 which

shows unadjusted and adjusted gender log wage ratios for each country in 1984,2 The unadjusted

ratios of 66,9 percent for the U.S. and 82.7 percent for Sweden, indicate that the ratio was nearly

16 percentage points higher in Sweden—a considerable difference.       Swedish women also fare

better afier adjusting for all variables, including education and experience, as well as major

industry and occupation:   the adjusted wage ratio3 was 82.2 percent for the U.S. and 90,9 percent

for Sweden.   Thus, while adjusting for measured characteristics raises the ratio in each country

and reduces the gap between the two countries, a substantial differential in gender ratios of

almost 9 percentage points relmains.




       Interpreting these findings in terms of the conventional gender-specific    explanations

would lead us to view the smaller unexplained gender gap in Sweden as indicating that,

compared to U.S. women, Swedish women encounter less discrimination           or have more favorable

levels of unmeasured characteristics compared to men or both. The reduction in the U. S.-

Sweden difference in the gender gap when controls are added for measured characteristics would

imply that Swedish women, on net, also have more favorable levels of measured characteristics
                                                    12


compared to their male counterparts than do U.S. women, These conclusions make intuitive

sense in some respects.     With regard to measured characteristics,   Sweden’s considerably more

generous family leave policy may result in Swedish women being more firmly attached to their

employers and to the labor market than U.S. women.4 With respect to discrimination,         the results

are somewhat surprising in that, as noted above, the U.S. has a considerable y longer commitment

to anti-discrimination    laws than Sweden. However, it could be that Sweden’s long term

commitment to attacking traditional gender roles through a variety of policies is responsible for

the smaller unexplained pay gap in Sweden.

The Role of Waqe St ructure

         Despite the apparent reasonableness    of the conclusions based on the conventional

approach, our examination of the role of wage structure suggests that they are incorrect.      It is not

differences in women’s qualifications or labor market treatment that are responsible for the larger

U.S. gender gap, rather it is differences in overall labor market prices in the two countries.    To

illuminate the role of wage structure, Kahn and I adapted a framework developed by Juhn,

Murphy and Pierce (199 1) to analyze trends over time in race differentials in the U.S. Gender-

specific factors, including differences in qualifications and the impact of labor market

discrimination,   are regarded as determining the percentile ranking of women in the male wage

distribution, while the overall wage structure (as measured by the magnitude of male wage

inequality) determines the wage penalty or reward associated with this position in the wage

distribution.

         The basic premise here is that males at the same percentile ranking as women may be

viewed as comparable in the eyes of employers.       Thus, the same set of factors will determine the
                                                    13


relative rewards of women and of these comparable males. The portion of the gender differential

associated with women’s lower ranking in the distribution in country A as compared to country B

is ascribed to differences between the two countries in gender-s~e cific factors (i.e., qualifications

and treatment), while the portion that is due to the wage penalty associated with that position

(i.e., greater wage inequality) in country A than in country B is attributed to wage structure.

Some indirect evidence for the assumption that the same factors determine the relative rewards of

women and of these male comparable,        is that wage inequality is higher in the U.S. than in the

other countries among ~         men and women (Blau and Kahn 1995 and Blau and Kahn 1996).s

Similarly, wage inequality in the U, S. has been increasing among both men and women (Katz

and Murphy 1992, Blau and Kahn forthcoming b), This suggests that the same sets of factors--

the prices of measured and unmeasured skills and wage-setting institutions--affect         the wages of

both men and women in a similar way.

        It should be noted, however, that the possibility of discrimination      complicates this

division into gender-specific    factors and wage structure because what we have labeled as the

impact of wage structure may also include a component which is due to the interaction between

wage structure and discrimination.     That is, discrimination    pushes women down in the

distribution of male wages, while wage structure determines how large the penalty is for that

lower position in the distribution.

Emp irical Findinp s for the Effect of Wag e Structure

        Figure 2 presents the mean percentile rankings of women in each country’s overall male

wage distribution   and residual male wage distribution.7        Our reasoning suggests that the female

percentile rankings may be taken as overall indicators of gender-specific       factors, that is the
                                                     14


relative qualifications    and treatment of women in each country. The placement of women in the

overall male wage distribution represents the combined effects of gender differences in

qualifications     and treatment (or unmeasured characteristics).   The ranking of women in the male

residual wage distribution represents the effect of gender differences in treatment (or unmeasured

characteristics)    only, Differences between the rankings of the two countries in Figures 1 and 2

represent the role of wage structure or the wage penalty associated with being below average in

the distribution in each country.




         Looking first at the findings for the unadjusted gender wage difference, we see that,

despite the large U.S.-Sweden difference in the unadjusted gender gap, the mean percentile

rankings of women in the male wage distribution in Sweden and the U. S, are virtually identical.

On average in each country women rank at about the 30th percentile in the male wage

distribution.     This implies that the large difference in the gender gap between the two countries is

entirely due to differences in wage structure, i.e., the larger wage penalty placed on women’s

lower position in the male wage distribution in the U.S. This means that at the same mean

percentile ranking, the resulting U.S. gender ratio is much lower than in Sweden.

         As discussed above, the overall mean female percentile rankings in Figure 2 show the

combined effect of both sets of gender-specific factors: qualifications and labor market

discrimination.     It would be interesting to compare the U.S, and Sweden with respect to the

latter, that is their treatment of otherwise equally qualified men and women. We have seen that

the traditional estimate which involves computing adjusted earnings ratios, indicates that

Swedish women fare considerably better. As noted above, such estimates are subject to bias; and
                                                   15


the adjusted ratios presented in Figure 1 are no exception.   On the one hand, we may lack data on

some factors which influence wages, although our inclusion of actual labor market experience at

least surmounts this particular problem.    On the other hand, we control for broadly defined

industry and occupation even though these variables may reflect the impact of labor market

discrimination.   What is primarily of interest here, however, is the contrast between the

traditional measure, the adjusted ratio shown in Figure 1, and the female residual percentile

ranking shown in Figure 2.

        For each country, we drop each woman’s residual from the male wage regression into the

distribution of male wage residuals and find the female mean of the resulting percentiles.      This is

an indicator of the relative wages of women in each country &        controlling for gender

differences in personal characteristics, industry and occupation.   Unlike the traditional measure,

it is not contaminated   by differences in wage structure between the two countries,   The caveat of

course remains that, as with any analysis of this type, differences in the female rankings may also

represent cross-country differences in the unmeasured characteristics of women relative to men,

Indeed, in the absence of discrimination,   one way to think of the rewards @enalties) associated

with a higher (lower) position in the residual wage distribution would be as a return to

unmeasured skills or characteristics.

        Looking at Figure 2, we again find that while there are simble U.S.-Sweden      differences

in the adjusted gender ratios, the mean percentile rankings of women in the residual wage

distribution are vitiually identical; in each country women rank at about the 37th percentile, on

average. This implies that the observed differences in the adjusted gender ratios in Figure 1 are

entire] y due to differences in wage structure between the two countries, i.e., the larger wage
                                                    16


penalty placed on women’s lower position in the male residual wage distribution in the U.S.

Putting this somewhat differently, the extent of labor market discrimination     against women (or

unmeasured productivity        differences between men and women) appears to be no greater in the

U.S. than in Sweden.

        Our detailed decomposition      of the U.S.-Sweden gender log wage differentials (Blau and

Kahn 1996) sheds additional light on the specific factors underlying these general results. Our

finding that gender differences in observed characteristics do not contribute to the U.S.-Sweden

difference in the gender gap reflects off-setting effects. On the one hand, there is a somewhat

smaller gender difference in actual experience in Sweden (5 years) than in the U.S. (6 years) and

a slightly more favorable relative occupational distribution of Swedish than of U. S. women.       On

the other hand, this is offset by smaller gender differences in the U.S, in educational attainment

and industrial distribution.    At a common set of prices (or rewards for measured characteristics)

for both countries, the gender differences observed characteristics contribute about the same

amount to the male-female pay gap in each country. As we saw in our discussion of Figure 1,

however, using the conventional approach, differences characteristics contribute to a larger

gender differential in the U. S. than in Sweden. This is because the conventional approach uses

own-country prices; that is Swedish prices for Sweden and U.S. prices for the U.S. In general,

the prices of skills are higher in the U.S. and this means that the female deficits (i.e., the Iow-er

qualifications   of women compared to men) are more heavily penalized in the U.S.

        Breaking this price factor out separately, we find that the impact of differences in

observed prices between the U.S. and Sweden strongly favors Swedish women.            The Swedish-

U.S. differences in relative rewards to employment by industry is the most important factor,s
                                                   17


although less favorable (for women) prices of education and experience in the U.S. also play a

role, Overall, the effect of wage structure, including the impact of prices of both measured and

unmeasured characteristics,    is more than sufficient to account for the considerably larger gender

gap in the U.S.

        Finally, Figure 3 presents the female percentile comparisons of the U.S. and Sweden in

greater detail. It shows the female cumulative distribution finctions that results from placing

women in male wage deciles on the basis of the male log wage cutoffs. 9 So, for example, in

the U. S., approximately   20 percent of women fall in the first decile of the male distribution of

log wages; almost 44 percent in or below the second male decile; etc. The results indicate that

our conclusions based on a comparison of the mean female percentiles in the male distribution

are full y supported by the more detailed comparison,    Specificallyy, the U.S. female cumulative

distribution finction is quite similar to that of Sweden. Particularly notable is the larger

proportion of women in the lowest male wage decile in Sweden (29 percent) than in the U.S. (20

percent).   This suggests an important role for labor market institutions which tend to “bring up

the bottom” in reducing the gender pay gap in Sweden relative to the U.S. That is, although the

percentage of women who fall in the bottom male decile in Sweden generally exceeds that in the

U. S,, the gender pay gap is smaller in Sweden. This suggests that formal or de facto wage floors

in Sweden lessen the wage penalty for those in the bottom male decile.




        I would argue that the rankings in Figure 2 and the distributions in Figure 3 provide an

informative basis for comparing the economic status of women in the two countries.        The fact

that, on average, women in both the U.S. and Sweden “out-earn” about 30 percent of male
                                                  18


workers tells us a great deal about the relative qualifications and treatment of women compared

to men in each country. What makes the rankings so informative in this respect, is that they are

not affected by differences in wage structure between the two countries.    Moreover, our finding

that U.S. and Swedish women have similar rankings, on average, in the male wage distribution

is quite surprising given the large disparities in gender earnings ratios shown in Figure 1.

However, what this similar ranking in the male wage distribution in each of the two countries

buys in terms of relative wage levels is of course also extremely important.   The wage is an

important indicator of economic well-being in and of itself and also, as noted above, a significant

input into decision-making.    So I would suggest that both measures, conventional earnings ratios

and percentile rankings, are of interest.




  SWIMMING         AGAINST THE TIDE: TRENDS IN THE GENDER GAP IN THE U.S.




        While these findings on international differences in the gender gap help to resolve one

paradox, they generate another. Wage inequality has been increasing in the U.S. Our analysis

implies that in the face of rising wage inequality, American women are essentially swimming

upstream in a labor market growing increasingly unfavorable for workers with below average

skills. In the face of rising rewards to labor market skills (measured and unmeasured) as appears

to have occurred over the last 15 to 20 years, women’s relative skills and labor market treatment

have to improve merely for the pay gap to remain constant; still larger gains are necessary for it

to be reduced.   Yet the gender pay gap has actually been falling in the U.S. since the late 1970s,

How can we explain this apparent contradiction?
                                                     19


        Kahn and I have examined this issue (Blau and Kahn 1994, Blau and Kahn, forthcoming

b) and found that women were able to swim against the current during the 1970s and 1980s and

narrow the gender gap because gains in gender specific factors were large enough to

counterbalance    the negative effect of the trends in wage structure on their relative earnings.

Women gained from improvements          in their relative qualifications, particularly their relative

             10
experience     and occupational distribution.    A larger negative impact of de-unionization      on male

than female workers also contributed to a narrowing of the differential.       Women also benefited

from a substantial decline in the “unexplained” portion of the gender gap, particularly when the

adverse effects of widening residual inequality are netted out. These reductions in the

unexplained gap may reflect improvements         in unmeasured characteristics or reductions in

discrimination.   Both explanations are credible for this period. Since women improved the

relative level of their measured characteristics, it is plausible that they also enhanced the relative

level of their unmeasured characteristics.      Further, as women increased their commitment to the

labor market and their other job skills, it is possible that the rationale for statistical discrimination

against them diminished,     Moreover, while government efforts to enforce the anti-discrimination

laws appear to have been reduced during the 1980s (Leonard 1989), it is possible that women’s

relative wage gains indirectly reflect the impact of government enforcement efforts in earlier

years which had the effect of encouraging women to train for and enter traditionally male fields.

        Another insight that may be derived from a focus on wage structure relates to the

possibility that shifts in skill prices may have impacted men and women differently.          In particular

men and women appear to be viewed by employers as imperfect substitutes in the labor market.

This is suggested by the considerable differences in the occupations and industries in which they
                                                   20


work, as well as the substantial pay differences that exist for men and women with the same

measured characteristics     (e.g., Blau and Ferber 1992), Thus, while rising skill prices may be

expected to widen the gender pay gap, such changes need not affect men and women in precisely

the same way. We examined this issue in Blau and Kahn (forthcoming b) and found that, over

the 1980s, shifis in demand for output across industry-occupation     cells favored women over men

for low and medium skilled workers, but men over women among high skilled workers.             The

growth in the supply of women was also considerably larger at high skill levels.

        Such a “gender twist” in the net supply of skill may have affected the relative gains of

women within skill groups. We find evidence that this is indeed the case, ~ile       the unadjusted

pay gap closed slightly faster for high skill women over the 1980s, industry and union

representation   effects strongly favored women at the bottom and middle of the skill distribution

relative to those at the top. High skill women nonetheless advanced at a roughly similar pace as

the other groups due to the large improvement in their human capital characteristics and

occupational distribution.    Further, wage gains for low skilled women would have been greater

had the minimum wage not declined in real value over this period. The progress of high skilled

women during the 1980s is particularly impressive given the relatively unfavorable demand and

supply shifis they faced.




                                            CONCLUSION




        As wage inequality has been increasing in recent years in many of the industrialized

countries, labor economists have increasingly turned their attention to understanding    its
                                                      21


determinants andthereasons        forchanges    overtime.   Inthistalk   Ihaveendeavored    tohighlight

the role of wage structure in determining the size of the gender pay gap both across countries and

within a particular country, in this case the United States, where wage inequality is especially

large, In addition to bringing a useful new construct to bear on analyses of male-female pay

gaps, such a focus serves to integrate analyses of demographic differentials into the study of

wage structure in general. This in itself is an interesting new development in labor economics.

         From the perspective of our consideration of the determinants of the gender gap, the

analysis of the trends in the pay gap over time in the U.S. provides an interesting comparison to

our consideration     of international differences in the gender gap. With respect to the puzzle of the

relative] y high U.S. gender pay gap compared to other countries, wage structure provides the

whole story—the traditional gender-specific factors do not appear to play a role. In contrast,

with respect to the narrowing of the gender gap over time in the U. S., the traditional gender

specific factors, i.e., improvements    in women’s relative qualifications and declines in labor

market discrimination      as conventionally   measured, are an extremely important part of the story,

The insight which wage structure contributes is nonetheless also important; that is, the notion

that women were indeed swimming against the tide. In the absence of substantial improvements

in the gender-specific    factors, the gender gap would have widened not narrowed.         A comparison

of these findings also serves to illustrate the more general point that the relative importance of

gender-specific     factors vs. wage structure in any particular situation is an empirical question.

With hindsight it is perhaps not surprising that wage structure proved to be a more significant

pti   of the story in the international comparison than in the intertemporal one, Differences across

countries in wage inequality, particularly between the U.S. and other industrialized nations, are
                                                    22


of considerably greater magnitude than the changes in the level of inequality that have occurred

in the U.S. over time, as significant as those changes have been.

        The points made here about the potential importance of wage structure for the gender pay

gap can readily be expanded to encompass the relative wages of other demographic groups, such

as racial or ethnic minorities or immigrants, which have below average skills andor face

discrimination   in the labor market. Thus, the well-being of particular demographic groups

depends not only on group-specific factors like relative qualifications and the extent of

discrimination   against them, but also on the market factors and institutional arrangements which

determine the return to skills in general and the relative rewards to employment in the particular

sectors of the economy.      This insight has a number of policy implications.   While I will

particularly address policies aimed at women, these point can readily be generalized to other

demographic groups.

        First, in evaluating the effectiveness of “gender-specific” policies, that is polices which

are specifically designed to impact economic outcomes for women, it is important to net out the

effects of wage structure.    On the one hand, policies may be erroneously deemed ineffective, or

their impact may be underestimated,      because the positive effect of the policies are disguised by

adverse shifts in wage structure.    So, for example, cross-national comparisons of the gender gap

could lead one to conclude that gender-specific policies in the U.S. have been relativel y

ineffective in comparison to those in other countries.    On the contrary, my work with Kahn

implies that U.S. gender specific policies have been quite successful.     U.S. women have lagged

behind those in other countries because of the high level of wage inequality in the U.S. which

heavily penalizes workers with below average wages, regardless of gender. On the other hand,
                                                   23


gender-specific   policies could be incorrectly judged successful, or the extent of their success

exaggerated, if they happen to be accompanied by changes in wage stmcture which benefit

women as a group.

        A second potential policy implication that follows from our work is that outcomes for

women are affected not only by policies specifically targeted at them, but also by wage structure

in general. This means that policies designed to alter wage structure, such as the promotion of

more centralized wage determination     or the establishment   of relatively high minimum wages,

constitute an alternative approach to improving wage outcomes for women.         While this

constitutes a potential benefit of such policies, it is important to bear in mind that they also have

costs which need to be balanced against this benefit. These costs may be substantial.

        First there is the concern that minimum wages, particularly the imposition of relatively

high wage floors, may create unemployment. 1] Second, centralized wage setting may allow

firms too little flexibility to respond to differences in market conditions across industries or at the

local level. Moreover, the compression of wage premia for skills may dampen workers

incentives to acquire appropriate training. 12 Finally, overly ambitious attempts to regulate the

labor market may result in the growth of an uncovered sector, as appears to be the case, for

example, in Italy.

       The substantial potential costs to direct government intervention in wage setting suggest

caution in using this approach to attack gender (or other demographic) differentials.    An

additional issue is that developments in the 1980s and 1990s have led to the decentralization       of

bargaining in virtually every industrialized country (see, Katz 1993, Edin and Holmlund 1995,

and Edin and Topel 1994). As the protection of centralized wage structures fall away, women
                                                   24


who continue to have less human capital on average and to encounter labor market

discrimination   are Iefi exposed to downward pressures on their relative wages. Thus, the

fundamental answer to the gender pay gap may well with gender-specific policies designed to

increase women’s human capital and reduce discrimination        against them. In a way, this

conclusion is not entirely surprising in that it is these ge nder-s~ecific differences in qualifications

and treatment that constitute the basic cause of women’s lower labor market outcomes.          Were

their no such differences, men and women would be similarly affected by the overall wage

structure and by changes in it,

] Work engender isdescribed below. Wage structure hasalso been found toplayarolein  U.S.
trends in black-white andimigrmt-native wage differentials (Juh, Mu~hy and Pierce 1991,
LaLonde and Topel 1992).

2 Wages are equal to average hourly earnings.

3 That is, for each country j, we estimate a male wage equation:


(1)      Yim = Xim~m + eim

where Yi is the log of wages; Xi is a vector of explanatory variables including education,
experience and its square, and major industry and occupation, ~ is a vector of coefficients and ei
is a residual.   The adjusted wage ratio is:

(2)      Ra = exp {-(em - ef)} - exp (ef)   ❑   ~@f)/(X@m)

where em and ef are the mean residuals from the male wage regression for men (m) and women
(f), Xf is a vector of means of the explanatory variables for women, and fim and J3fare vectors of
estimated coefficients from wage regressions estimated for men and women separately.

4 The expected impact of family leave (disproportionately taken by women even when it is
available to men) is unclear a priori. On the one hand, it is possible that such policies raise the
relative earnings of women by encouraging the presemation of their ties to particular firms and
hence increasing the incentives of employers and women to invest in firm-specific training. On
the other hand, the existence of such policies could increase the incidence and/or duration of
temporary labor force withdrawals among women, raising the gender gap, Fufiher, the
incremental costs associated with mandated leave policies may increase the incentives of
employers to discriminate against women.

5 Similarly, across our fill sample of countries, male and female wage and residual wage
variation are highly correlated (Blau and Kahn 1995 and Blau and Kahn 1996).

b We assign each woman in country j a percentile ranking in country j’s male wage distribution.
The female mean of these percentiles by country is presented in Figure 2 as the “female
percentile.”

7 We find the percentile ranking of each woman’s wage residual from the male wage regression
(eif) in the distribution of male wage residuals from the male wage regression (eim), The mean
female percentile for each country is presented in Figure 2 as the “female residual percentile.”

8 This is not surprising given Edin and Zetterberg’s (1992) finding that interindustry wage
differentials are much smaller in Sweden than in the U.S.

9 Befiardt,  Morris and Handcock (forthcoming) use a similar methodology to examine the
distribution of women’s wages relative to the male distribution over time in the U.S.

10O’Neill and Polachek ( 1993) and Wellington ( 1993) also provide evidence of the importance
of women’s gains in relative experience in narrowing the gender gap.

1] For example, Katz, Loveman andBlanchflower(1995)         report that in France, where the
minimum wage increased from 45.7 to 53.3 percent of median earnings from 1967 to 1987, the
problem of youth unemployment has been more severe and the duration of unemployment has
tended to be longer than in other OECD countries. And Edin and Topel (1994) find that the
solidarity wage policy followed in Sweden in the 1960s and 1970s disproportionately raised pay
and lowered relative employment in low wage industries. On the other hand there is evidence for
the U.S. that suggests that relatively small increases in the minimum wage do not have adverse
employment effects, See Card and Krueger (1995); for responses to their research see, ILRR
(1995).

12Both complaints have been voiced about Sweden’s “solidarity” wage policy by employers, and
that count~’s generous student stipends and subsidized loans for higher education may be
viewed in part as a means of off-setting the distortions caused by wage compression (Edin and
Holmlund 1995).
