                                           ABSTRACT

This paper compares the economic questions addressed by instrumental variables estimators with those
addressed by structural approaches. We discuss Marschak's Maxim: estimators should be selected
on the basis of their ability to answer well-posed economic problems with minimal assumptions. A
key identifying assumption that allows structural methods to be more informative than IV can be tested
with data and does not have to be imposed.

1        Introduction

The primary question regarding the choice of an empirical approach to analyzing economic data

should be What economic question does the analyst seek to answer? Explicit economic models

make it easier to formulate and answer economic questions. Advocates of atheoretical approaches

to analyzing economic data appeal to randomization as an ideal and invoke IV (or matching or

regression discontinuity designs) as a surrogate for randomization. However, even perfectly executed

randomizations do not answer all questions of economic interest. There are important examples

where structural models produce more information about preferences than experiments.1

        A valid instrument is not guaranteed to identify parameters of economic interest when responses

to choices vary among individuals, and these variations inﬂuence choices taken.2 Diﬀerent valid

instruments answer diﬀerent questions.3 The sign of the IV estimator can be diﬀerent from that of

the true causal eﬀect.4

        No one trained in economics can doubt the value of credible, explicit economic models in

interpreting economic data. They are designed to answer a variety of well-posed economic questions

and to be invariant to classes of policy interventions.5 The problem with this approach is that

after 60 years of experience with ﬁtting structural models on a variety of data sources, empirical

economists have come to appreciate the practical diﬃculty in identifying, and precisely estimating,

the full array of structural parameters that answer the large variety of policy questions contemplated

by the Cowles Commission economists — the fathers of structural estimation.6

        Proponents of IV are less ambitious in the range of questions they seek to answer. The method

often gains precision by asking narrower questions. The problem that plagues the IV approach is

that the questions it answers are usually deﬁned as probability limits of estimators and not by well-

formulated economic problems. Unspeciﬁed “eﬀects” replace clearly deﬁned economic parameters

selection on unobservables. Regression discontinuity estimators identify, at best, local eﬀects.

      Building on this point, Heckman, Schmierer, and Urzua (2008) develop and apply nonparametric tests for the
presence of heterogenous responses to treatment on which agents make choices.

      Pencavel (1986) summarizes structural estimates of taxes on labor supply and reports absurd estimates, including
one due to Jerry Hausman, which implied a negative marginal propensity to consume goods out of income. These
and other estimates, reported in the literature some 20 years ago, fueled the ﬂight of many empirical economists from
structural models.

as the objects of empirical interest.

    As noted by Marschak (1953), there is a middle ground. Marschak’s Maxim emphasizes that

one should solve well-posed economic problems with minimal assumptions. Marschak noted that

for many problems of policy analysis, it is not necessary to identify fully speciﬁed structural models

with parameters that are invariant to classes of policy modiﬁcations — the goal of structural analysis

as conceived by the Cowles pioneers and successor generations of structural economists.7 All that

is required to conduct many policy analyses or to answer many well-posed economic questions are

combinations of the structural parameters that are often much easier to identify than the individual

parameters themselves.8

    Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2005) bridge the structural and IV literatures. They develop

an economically interpretable parameter — the marginal treatment eﬀect (MTE) — which is a

marginal willingness to pay for the beneﬁt of treatment for persons at well-deﬁned margins of

choice. It is invariant to a class of policy modiﬁcations. They show how diﬀerent instrumental

variables weight the MTE diﬀerently. These weights need not be positive for all values of the

argument of the MTE.9 For classes of well-posed economic questions, it is possible, under the

conditions given in Heckman and Vytlacil (2005), to fashion functions of instruments that answer

well-posed economic questions. This approach is unusual in the standard IV literature, which

traditionally deﬁnes the parameter of interest to be an “eﬀect” identiﬁed by an instrument.

    Many economists follow Imbens and Angrist (1994) and interpret IV as identifying a weighted

average of the gains to persons induced to change their choice (or state) by a change in the instru-

ment. Imbens and Angrist work with a two choice model. Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006,

2008) and Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b) extend this analysis to an ordered choice model and to

general unordered choice models.10 This paper develops the unordered case further and gives a

      Heckman and Vytlacil (2007a) deﬁne structural models precisely following the seminal deﬁnition of Hurwicz
(1962). These discussions formalize ideas in Marschak (1953).

      See the discussion in Heckman (2008) and Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b).
    9
      MTE was introduced into the literature in the context of a selection model by Björklund and Moﬃtt (1987). The
Local Average Treatment Eﬀect (LATE) (Imbens and Angrist, 1994) is a discretized version of the MTE. The weights
for special cases were derived by Yitzhaki (1989) and applied by Imbens and Angrist (1994). Those weights are always
non-negative. Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2005, 2007b) and Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006) generalize the
Imbens-Angrist-Yitzhaki analysis to the case of multiple instruments without restrictions and show how IV weights
can be non-positive over certain intervals, but that they must integrate to one.
  10
      Angrist and Imbens (1995) propose an ordered choice version of their 1994 paper. As shown by Heckman,
Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006), their proposed extension has unsatisfactory features which can be removed by a careful
reformulation of the IV method applied to the ordered choice model. See also Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b).

precise characterization of the generalization of the MTE that is appropriate for this case.

    The original Imbens-Angrist intuition applies, but in general unordered choice models, agents

attracted into a state by a change in an instrument come from many origin states, so there are many

margins of choice. Structural models can identify the gains arising from these separate margins.

This is a diﬃcult task for IV without invoking structural assumptions. Structural models can also

identify the fraction of persons induced into a state coming from each origin state. IV alone cannot.

    For some economic questions, these are unimportant distinctions. For others, they are crucial.

For speciﬁcity, consider an analysis of the GED program. The GED is a test by which high school

dropouts can exam certify to be the equivalents of ordinary high school graduates. Heckman,

LaFontaine, and Rodrı́guez (2008) show that the presence of a GED program induces some persons

to drop out of high school. It also induces some persons who would remain dropouts to exam

certify. Within this context we ask: What are the wage beneﬁts for those induced to take the GED

from the dropout state? For those induced to drop out of high school? What proportion of persons

induced to take a GED come from each of the other states?

    IV cannot answer these questions except under structural assumptions. It can identify the mean

gross gain to the GED for those induced to take it, compared to the next best alternative. This is

a weighted average of the eﬀects from each possible origin state that the structural approach can

separately identify. In the IV approach, when there are multiple origin states, the weights on the

individual eﬀects cannot be estimated without using structural methods. As shown in Heckman

and Vytlacil (2007b), IV needs to be supplemented with explicit choice theory to answer many

interesting questions, including questions of economic welfare regarding introduction of policies as

well as distributional questions such as the percentage of persons harmed by a policy.

    This paper demonstrates these points. We ﬁrst establish a precise framework for discussing IV,

and relating it to economic models.



2    The Choice Model and Assumptions

Following Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006, 2008) and Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b), consider

the following model with multiple choices and associated multiple outcome states. Let J denote

the agent’s choice set, where J contains a ﬁnite number of elements. For example, J enumerates


                                                 4
possible schooling states (e.g., GED, high school dropout, high school graduate). The value to the

agent of choosing j ∈ J is

                                            Rj (Zj ) = ϑj (Zj ) − Vj ,                                      (2.1)

where Zj are the agent’s observed characteristics that aﬀect the utility from choosing j, and Vj is

the unobserved shock to the agent’s utility from choice j. We sometimes write Rj for Rj (Zj ) to

simplify notation. Let Z denote the random vector containing all unique elements of {Zj }j∈J . We

write Rj (Z) for Rj (Zj ), leaving implicit the condition that Rj (·) only depends on the elements of

Z that are contained in Zj . Let Dj be a variable indicating whether the agent would choose j if

confronted with choice set J :11
                                            ⎧
                                            ⎪
                                            ⎨1
                                            ⎪      if Rj ≥ Rk          ∀k∈J
                                     Dj =
                                            ⎪
                                            ⎩0
                                            ⎪      otherwise.


Array the Dj into a vector D. Let Y be the outcome that would be observed if the agent faced

choice set J , deﬁned as
                                                       �
                                                 Y =         Dj Yj ,
                                                       j∈J

where Yj is a potential outcome observed only if option j is chosen. Yj is determined by


                                               Yj = µj (Xj , Uj ),


where Xj is a vector of the agent’s observed characteristics and Uj is an unobserved random vector.

Let X denote the random vector containing all unique elements of {Xj }j∈J . (Z, X, D, Y ) is assumed

to be observed by the analyst.12

                                                             � k, occur with probability zero.
     Below, we invoke conditions so that ties, Rj = Rk for j =
  12
     Depending on the choice model, Z may or may not include the X. For example, in a Roy model of schooling under
perfect certainty (e.g. Willis and Rosen, 1979), X would be among the Z. In models of schooling under uncertainty
(e.g. Cunha, Heckman, and Navarro, 2005, Cunha and Heckman, 2007 and Urzua, 2008) innovations in X unknown
at the time schooling decisions are made would not be in Z. The key condition on Z is given in Assumption (A-2)
below.

       Deﬁne RJ as the maximum obtainable value given choice set J :


                                              RJ    = maxj∈J {Rj }
                                                      �                                                          (2.2)
                                                    =  j∈J Dj Rj .


This is the traditional representation of the decision process that if choice j is optimal, choice j is

better than the “next best” option:


                                             Dj = 1 ⇐⇒ Rj ≥ RJ \j .


Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006, 2008) and Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b) show that this

simple, well-known, representation is the key intuition for understanding how instrumental variables

estimate the eﬀect of a given choice versus the “next best” alternative. IV is a weighted average

of the eﬀects for people induced into a choice from diﬀerent margins. Analogous to the deﬁnition

of RJ , we deﬁne RJ (z) to be the maximum obtainable value given choice set J when instruments

are ﬁxed at Z = z,

                                              RJ (z) = max{Rj (z)}.
                                                         j∈J


       Following the analysis in Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006, 2008) and Heckman and Vytlacil

(2007b), we assume:

(A-1) The distribution of ({Vj }j∈J ) is continuous.13

(A-2) {(Vj , Uj )}j∈J is independent of Z conditional on X.

(A-3) E | Yj | < ∞ for all j ∈ J .

(A-4) Pr(Dj = 1 | X) > 0 for all j ∈ J .

       In addition, we assume an exclusion restriction that requires some additional notation.14 Let

Z [−l] denote all elements of Z except for the lth component. We assume
  13                                                              �
     Absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure on j∈J �.
  14
     We work here with exclusion restrictions in part for ease of exposition. By adapting the analysis of Cameron
and Heckman (1998) and Heckman and Navarro (2007), one can modify our analysis for the case of no exclusion
restrictions if Z contains a suﬃcient number of continuous variables and there is suﬃcient variation in the ϑk function
across k.




                                                          6
(A-5) For each j ∈ J , their exists at least one element of Z, say Z [l] , such that the distribution of

           ϑj (Zj ) conditional on (X, Z [−l] ) is continuous.


         With these assumptions, one can generalize the analysis of Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2001,

                                                                       � Rk (with probability
2005) to the unordered case. Assumptions (A-1) and (A-2) imply that Rj =

1) for j �= k, so that argmaxj∈J {Rj } is unique (with probability 1). Assumption (A-2) assures the

existence of an instrument. Assumption (A-3) is required for mean treatment parameters to be well

deﬁned. It also allows one to integrate to the limit and to produce well-deﬁned means. Assumption

(A-4) requires that at least some individuals participate in each choice for all X. Assumption

(A-5) imposes the requirement that one be able to independently vary the index for the given value

function. It imposes a type of exclusion restriction, that for any j ∈ J , Z contains an element

                                                                               � j, and (iii) ϑj (·) is a
such that (i) it is contained in Zj ; (ii) it is not contained in any Zk for k =

nontrivial function of that element conditional on all other regressors.15

         In a series of papers, Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2001, 2005, 2007b), develop the method of

local instrumental variables (LIV) to estimate the marginal treatment eﬀect (MTE) for the case of

binary choices. We now deﬁne and interpret the MTE and LIV in the case of general unordered

choices.



3         Interpreting Local Instrumental Variables in the Unordered Case

We deﬁne local instrumental variables (LIV) using a variable that shifts people toward (or against)

choice j by operating only on Rj (Zj ). LIV identiﬁes an average marginal return to j vs. the next

best alternative across persons.16 However, without further assumptions, LIV will not decompose

the average marginal return into its component parts corresponding to the eﬀects for persons

induced into j from each of the possible origin states.

         To see this, consider a three outcome case, J = {1, 2, 3}. For concreteness, we pursue the

education example previously stated and let 1 be GED, 2 be high school dropout, and 3 be high

school graduate. Our results are more general but the three outcome case is easy to exposit.

         In this section, we assume that Z1 , Z2 , Z3 are disjoint sets of regressors so Z = (Z1 , Z2 , Z3 )

but they are not necessarily statistically independent. We can easily relax this assumption but it

simpliﬁes the notation. We condition on X and keep it implicit throughout the analysis of this

paper.17 In this notation,

E(Y |Z) and its components can be estimated from data on (Y, Z). IV is based on (3.1). From

(2.2), choices are generated by the following inequalities:


                                         D1 = 1 (R1 ≥ R2 , R1 ≥ R3 )

                                         D2 = 1 (R2 ≥ R1 , R2 ≥ R3 )

                                         D3 = 1 (R3 ≥ R1 , R3 ≥ R2 ) .


      We deﬁne the marginal change in Y with respect to Z1 . IV methods are based on such types

of variation. The local instrumental variable estimator using Z1 as an instrument is the sample

    Agents induced into 1 come from 2 and 3. There are two margins:


               (R1 = R2 ) and (R1 ≥ R3 )                         (margin of indiﬀerence between 1 and 2),

Unaided, IV does not enable analysts to identify the returns at each of the diﬀerent margins.

Instead, it identiﬁes a weighted average of returns. It does not identify the density of persons at

the various margins, i.e., the proportion of people induced into (or out of) 1 from each possible

alternative state by a change in the instrument.

This is a weighted return to alternative 1 for persons coming from two separate margins: alternative

1 versus alternative 2, and alternative 1 versus alternative 3, i.e., the return to people induced into

1 from their next best choice. The weights are the proportion of people induced into 1 from each

margin. This combination of parameters can be identiﬁed from IV. The components of the sum

cannot be identiﬁed by IV without further assumptions. Note that it is possible that a group at one

margin gains while a group at another margin loses. IV only estimates a net eﬀect, which might

be zero.

    Notice that from representation (2.1) and the assumption that the Zj (j�J ) are distinct, pairwise

monotonicity, an extension of the monotonicity assumption invoked by Imbens and Angrist (1994)

for the binary choice case, is satisﬁed.20 In the context of a model with multiple choices, pairwise

monotonicity means the same pattern of ﬂow between any two states is experienced by everyone.

Thus, as Zj increases, there is a ﬂow from i to j but not from j to i (or vice versa). From (2.1),

changing Z1 induces all persons to move in the same direction (i.e. from 1 to 2 or 2 to 1 but

not both, and from 1 to 3 or 3 to 1 but not both). Pairwise monotonicity does not rule out the

The weights can be identiﬁed from a structural discrete choice analysis.21 They cannot be identiﬁed

by an unaided instrumental variable analysis. Thus it is not possible to identify the component

     Conditions for nonparametric identiﬁcation of the multinomial discrete choice model are presented in Matzkin
(1993, 1994). Conditions for nonparametric identiﬁcation of the full choice model with outcomes are given in Heck-
man and Vytlacil (2007a, Appendix B). Conditions for identiﬁcation of general dynamic discrete choice models are
presented in Abbring and Heckman (2007).

unless one invokes “identiﬁcation at inﬁnity” arguments.22

    Using a structural model, one can estimate the components of (3.5) and determine the ﬂow into

(or out of) state 1 from all sources. We illustrate this point in Section 5. First we consider what

standard IV estimates.



4     What does standard IV estimate?

To see what standard IV estimates, consider the following linear-in-schooling model of earnings

that receives much attention in the literature in labor economics.23 Let Y denote log earnings and

write S as years of schooling. The model writes


                                                 Y = α + βS + U                                                  (4.1)


where
                                                         3
                                                         �
                                                   S=          jDj ,                                             (4.2)
                                                         j=1

and Y is deﬁned as in Section 2. It is interpreted in this section as an approximation to the general

model presented in Section 2. S is assumed to be correlated with U , and β is a random variable

that may be statistically dependent on S. The model of Section 2 does not, in general, imply (4.1).
  22
     See Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b) who show how to vary Z3 or Z2 to eﬀectively shut down one margin of
choice. Speciﬁcally, for any ﬁxed Z1 = z1 , if limZ2 →Z˜2 R2 (Z2 ) → −∞ and limZ3 →Z˜3 R3 (Z3 ) → −∞ where Z̃2 and Z̃3
represent limit sets, then we can identify, respectively, the gains at the 3 → 1 margin in the limit set, and the gains
in the 2 → 1 margin in the limit set. These assumptions require that one can vary Z2 and Z3 to shut down one or
the other margin of choice. Under these assumptions and some additional mild regularity assumptions, the structural
approach can identify distributions of (Y1 − Y2 ) and (Y2 − Y3 ) as we demonstrate in the example in Section 5 of this
paper.

     We keep conditioning on X implicit.

Indeed, there is much empirical evidence against model (4.1).24 An analysis of what IV estimates

when linearity in S is imposed as an approximation, even though it may be inappropriate, is an

interesting exercise because linearity is so often invoked.

    Suppose Z1 is a valid instrument. We now interpret what

                                                           Cov(Z1 , Y )

                                      Z1 into components analogous to the decomposition pro-

duced by Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006, 2008) and Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b). The

    IV identiﬁes a weighted average of gains to state 1 compared to the next best alternative which

may be 2 or 3. The two terms of the decomposition are deﬁned as generalized MTEs and are

weighted averages of the gain of moving from state 2 to state 1 for persons on the margin of

     See Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2006) for discussions of this model and various justiﬁcations for it. Heckman,
Layne-Farrar, and Todd (1996) present evidence against linearity of the earnings function in terms of years of
schooling.

indiﬀerence between 1 and 2 and for whom 2 is a better choice than 3 (the ﬁrst term) and the gain

of moving from 3 to 1 for persons on the margin of indiﬀerence between 1 and 3 and for whom 3

is a better choice than 2 (the second term).25

       In the Appendix, we derive the weights on the generalized MTEs and show that they do not

sum to 1 even when normalized by the denominator. The mathematical reason for this result is

simple. The weights in the numerator do not sum to the weights in the denominator. The second

term in the denominator receives twice as much weight as the corresponding term in the numerator.

This is a consequence of the deﬁnition of S (4.2), which plays no role in the numerator term. Thus,

IV applied to the general model produces an arbitrarily weighted sum of generalized MTEs with

weights that do not sum to 1, and which, in general, places more weight on the ﬁrst generalized

MTE term than on the second term, compared to the weights placed on the corresponding terms

in the denominator.26 Using IV alone, we cannot decompose (4.4) into its component parts, even

though the weights can be identiﬁed from discrete choice analysis.27,28
  25
     Since Z1 only aﬀects R(Z1 ), it has no direct eﬀect on the margin 2 → 3.
  26
     Thus “2” appears only in the denominator and not in the numerator.
  27
     The structural model is nonparametrically identiﬁed under the conditions in Appendix B of Heckman and Vytlacil
(2007a).
  28
     Decomposition (4.4) is not unique. It arises from decomposing Y into

                                              Y = D1 Y1 + D2 Y2 + D3 Y3
where we solve out D1 = 1 − D2 − D3 , to obtain

                                        Y = Y1 + D2 (Y2 − Y1 ) + D3 (Y3 − Y1 ).

We could also solve out D2 = 1 − D1 − D3 to obtain

                                        Y = Y2 + D1 (Y1 − Y2 ) + D3 (Y3 − Y2 )
or D3 = 1 − D1 − D2 to obtain

                                        Y = Y3 + D1 (Y1 − Y3 ) + D2 (Y2 − Y3 ).
Each decomposition can be used to represent ΔIV        Z1 . For each decomposition, the leading terms on the right-hand
side, (Y1 , Y2 , Y3 ), respectively, are uncorrelated with Z1 by virtue of (A-2). Corresponding generalized MTEs can be
deﬁned for each decomposition. Z1 aﬀects the lower boundary of the opportunity set in

                                      E(Y2 − Y3 |R(z2 ) ≥ R(z1 ), R(z3 ) ≥ R(z1 )).

We choose the decomposition reported in the text for its greater interpretability.

4.1      The Mincer Model

The Mincer (1974) model is a specialization of the general model discussed in Section 2 of this

paper that justiﬁes the precise functional form of equation (4.1).29 For this case, the weights in

(4.4) in the numerator and denominator are the same. The Mincer model is formulated in terms

of log earnings for Y1 , Y2 , and Y3 :


                                     Y2 = ln (1 + g) + Y1 ,

                                     Y3 = ln (1 + g) + Y2 = 2 ln(1 + g) + Y1 ,


where g is a growth factor for income that varies in the population. Earnings at each schooling
level depend on two parameters: (g, Y1 ). In this case, letting α = ln(1 + g),

 In this case, the weights now sum to 1. The weights for the numerator term now are the same

as the weights for the denominator term. But again, unaided IV does not identify the component

parts of the term bundled in IV — the mean gains at each margin.30,31

     See Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2006) for a discussion of the Mincer Model and the powerful body of evidence
against it. Card (2001) provides one justiﬁcation for functional form 4.1.
  30
     An anonymous referee has correctly expressed the concern that in the case of an income-maximizing Mincer
model under perfect certainty, the general unordered model would not apply. Indeed, the decision problem is not well
deﬁned. If g > r, the opportunity cost of funds, agents would choose the maximum amount of schooling. If g < r,
the agent chooses no schooling. If g = r, the agent is indiﬀerent to all levels of schooling. Thus, for our analysis to
apply to the Mincer earnings equation, we have to assume that choices involve some combination of psychic costs,
tuition, uncertainty or the like. The model of Keane and Wolpin (1997) is one of many frameworks that would justify
an unordered choice model but could be consistent with a Mincer earnings equation. See Heckman, Lochner, and
Todd (2006). We thank the referee for emphasizing this point to us.

5         An Example

It is instructive to summarize our analysis with an example. Consider a 3 choice model with as-

sociated outcomes. This corresponds to the GED, high school dropout and high school graduate

example that we have used throughout the paper. Under conditions presented in Heckman and Vyt-

lacil (2007a, Appendix B), the structural model is nonparametrically identiﬁed. A key assumption

in their proof is the “identiﬁcation at inﬁnity” assumption previously discussed.32 This assumes

the ability to vary (Z1 , Z2 , Z3 ) freely and the existence of limit sets such that ﬁxing any two of

(Z1 , Z2 , Z3 ), one makes the Rj associated with Zj arbitrarily small.33

         Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b) show that if one augments the IV assumptions with the same

identiﬁcation at inﬁnity assumptions used in structural models, one can use IV in the limit to

identify the components of (3.5). In the limit sets, one can identify


                                         E(Y1 − Y2 |R1 (z1 ) = R2 (z2 ))                                      (5.1)


and

                                         E(Y1 − Y3 |R1 (z1 ) = R3 (z3 ))                                      (5.2)

by setting Z3 and Z2 respectively to limit set values. Essentially one can use the limit sets to make

a three choice model into a two choice model, and the standard results for the two choice model

apply.34 Under these assumptions, and additional mild regularity assumptions, using structural

methods, one can identify the distributions of (Y1 , Y2 ) and (Y1 , Y3 ) so that one can identify distri-

butions of treatment eﬀects, Y2 − Y1 and Y3 − Y1 , in addition to the mean parameters identiﬁed

by IV.35 One can also identify the proportion of people induced into 1 from each alternative state

using variation in the instrument.

         Consider the model with the parameters presented in Table 1. This is a discrete choice model

with associated outcome variables. The Zj , j = 1, . . . , 3, are assumed to be scalar and mutually

independent. They are normally distributed so they satisfy large support (“identiﬁcation at inﬁn-

     Alternatively, one can make functional form assumptions about the distribution of the error terms.

  35
     The literature on “quantile treatment eﬀects” uses IV to identify the quantiles of Y1 and Y2 separately but not
the quantiles of Y1 − Y2 . See Abbring and Heckman (2007).

ity”) conditions. Table 2 shows how a change in Z1 , which increases it by .75 standard deviations,

shifts people across categories. This corresponds to making GED attainment easier.36 The esti-

mates reported in Table 2 can be obtained from a structural discrete choice model. The percentage

initially in 1 (GED) increases from 33.17% to 38.8%. The percentage in 2 (dropout) decreases from

29.11% to 25.91%. The percentage in 3 (graduating high school) declines from 37.72% to 35.29%.

         The IV estimate is -.032. (See the base of Table 3) This is the only number produced by an IV

analysis using Z1 as an instrument that changes within the speciﬁed range. The structural analysis

in Table 3 shows that the net eﬀect produced by the change in Z1 is composed of 2 terms. It arises

from a gain of .199 for the switchers 2 → 1 (dropout to GED) and a loss of .336 (3 → 1) (graduate

to GED).

         Figure 1 shows what can be identiﬁed from the structural model. It plots the distributions of

gains for persons going from 2 to 1 and from 3 to 1 as well as the overall distribution of gains to

the switchers. Persons switching from 3 to 1 are harmed in gross terms by the policy that changes

Z1 , while those who switch from 2 to 1 gain in gross terms. In utility terms, (Rj ), people are

better oﬀ.37 In terms of gross gains, about 56.8% of the people who switch from 2 to 1 are better

oﬀ while 39.3% of the people who switch from 3 to 1 are better oﬀ. Overall, 49.2% are better oﬀ

in gross terms even though the IV estimate is slightly negative. If one seeks to understand the

distributional eﬀects of the policy associated with a change Z1 , the structural analysis is clearly

much more revealing. The IV estimate, which is a mean gross gain aggregating over origin states,

does not capture the rich information about choices aﬀorded by a structural analysis. However, it

does identify the average gain to the program compared to the next-best alternatives. If that is

the object of interest, linear IV is the right tool to use.



6         Summary and Discussion

The choice between using IV or a more structural approach for a particular problem should be

made on the basis of Marschak’s Maxim: use minimal assumptions to answer well-posed economic

questions. Most IV studies do not clearly formulate the economic question being answered by the

school and causes some dropouts to become GEDs.

     This is imposed in a discrete choice model.

IV analysis. The probability limit of the IV estimator is deﬁned to be the object of interest. In

the binary outcome case, even if Z is a valid instrument, if Z is a vector, and analysts use only one

component of the vector as an instrument, and do not condition on the other components of Z,

the weights on the MTE can be negative over certain ranges. The practice of not conditioning on

the other instruments is common in the literature.38 IV can estimate the wrong sign for the true

causal eﬀect.39 Recent analyses show how to improve on this practice and to design functions of

standard instrumental variables that answer classes of well-posed economic questions.40

      We have discussed a model with three or more choices where there is no particular order among

the choices. Such examples arise routinely in applied economics. In this case, under conditions

speciﬁed in this paper, IV estimates a weighted average of the mean gross gain to persons induced

into a choice state by a change in the instrument (policy) compared to their next best alterna-

tive.41 It averages the returns to a destination state over all origin states. It does not produce the

distribution of gains overall or by each origin state. Again, as in the binary choice case, for vector

Z, using one component of Z as an instrument, and not conditioning on the other components can

produce negative weights so that the sign of an IV can be opposite to that of the true causal eﬀect

which can be identiﬁed by a structural analysis.

      Structural methods provide a more complete description of the eﬀect of the instrument or the

policy associated with the instrument. They identify mean returns as well as distributions of returns

for agents coming to a destination state from each margin. They also identify the proportion of

people induced into a state from each origin state.

      Structural methods come at a cost. Unless distributional assumptions for unobservables are

invoked, structural methods require some form of an “identiﬁcation at inﬁnity” assumption.42

However, in the general case in which responses to treatment are heterogeneous, IV requires the

same assumption if one seeks to identify average treatment eﬀects.43 An identiﬁcation at inﬁnity

assumption can be checked in any sample so it does not require imposing a priori beliefs onto the

data. Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua (2006) present an example of how to test an identiﬁcation at

inﬁnity assumption. See also the discussion in Abbring and Heckman (2007).44

       Many proponents of IV point to the strong distributional and functional form assumptions

required to implement structural methods. They ignore recent progress in econometrics that iden-

tiﬁes and empirically implements robust semiparametric and nonparametric approaches to struc-

tural analysis.45 Recent developments respond to arguments against the use of explicit econometric

models made by a generation of applied economists that emerged in the 1980s. Those arguments

are more properly directed against 1980s versions of structural models that were based on linearity

and normality. Structural econometricians in the 21st century have listened to the critics and have

perfected their tools to response to the criticism.

       The appeal to standard IV as a preferred estimator is sometimes made on the basis of “sim-

plicity and robustness”. Standard IV is certainly simple to compute although problems with weak

instruments can make it empirically unstable.46 Since, in the general case, diﬀerent instruments

identify diﬀerent parameters, IV is not robust to the choice of instrument.47 Since the sign of an

IV can be diﬀerent from the true causal eﬀect, IV may even produce a misleading guide to policy

or inference, so it is not robust.

       The meaning of “simplicity” is highly subjective. How simple is the economic interpretation

of IV? Certainly decomposition (4.4) is not simple. The fact that simple IV can estimate wrong

signs for true causal eﬀects should give pause to those who claim that it is “robust”. The weak

instrument literature cautions us against uncritical claims about the sturdiness of IV estimators.

       The ability of diﬀerent statistical estimators to answer questions of economic interest, or to show

why they cannot be answered, should drive the choice of empirical techniques for analyzing data.

Consider a worst case for structural estimation. Suppose that application of recently developed

procedures for testing for structural identiﬁcation reveal that a structural model is not identiﬁed

or is only partially identiﬁed. Does this conclusion suggest that IV is a better choice for an

estimator? That disguising identiﬁcation problems by a statistical procedure is preferable to an

honest discussion of the limits of the data? For underidentiﬁed structural models, it is possible to

     However, this assumption is not yet routinely checked in many structural analyses.

conduct sensitivity analyses guided by economic theory to explore the consequences of ignorance

about features of the model. With IV, unaided by structural analysis, this type of exercise is not

possible. Problems of identiﬁcation and interpretation are swept under the rug and replaced by

“an eﬀect” identiﬁed by IV that is often very diﬃcult to interpret as an answer to an interesting

economic question.

Using D1 = 1 − D2 − D3 , we obtain

These terms can be identiﬁed from a structural analysis using the joint distribution of (Z, D1 , D2 , D3 ).

Collecting results, we obtain decomposition (4.4) in the text if we multiply both the numerator and

denominator by -1.
