          The Response of Interest Rates to the Federal Reserve's
       Weekly Money Announcements: The "Puzzle" of Anticipated Money




                                  ABSTRACT




     Researchers, using the survey conducted by Money Market Services,

Inc., have found that the anticipated component in the Federal Reserve's

weekly money supply announcement is negatively correlated with the post-

announcement change in market yields. We prove that eliminating a

(downward) bias in the measure of anticipated money can, in theory,

eliminate this puzzle, but that improving the efficiency of an already

unbiased measure cannot. We find, using Canadian as well as U.S.

interest rate data, that correcting the downward bias in the survey

measure reduces, but does not eliminate, the role of anticipated money.

    I.   Introduction

         En recent years, researchers have examined in detail the impact of

 the Federal Reserve's weekly money supply announcement on interest rates.

 (See, for example, Grossman (1981), Urich (1982), Urich and Wachtel

 (1981), Roley (1983, l986a,b,c), Cornell (1983), and Roley and Walsh

 (1985)). These researchers have established that both short-term and

long-term interest rates tend to rise when the change in the money supply

exceeds the change anticipated by market participants, and conversely.1

In conducting their empirical tests, researchers have relied heavily on

the survey data on the expected announced change in the money supply

compiled by Money Market Services, Inc. Indeed, the availability of

these data has served as perhaps the most important catalyst to this

research program.

         There is, however, an anomalous finding in this empirical

literature. When the post-announcement change in the interest rate is

regressed on both the unanticipated and the anticipated change in the

money supply, the coefficient of the anticipated change is consistently

negative and often statistically significant. This must be seen as a

puzzle, for the following reason. The interval over which the post-

announcement change in the interest rate is calculated is very short,

typically not more than 24 hours and occasionally as short as one-and-

one-half hours.2 If the change in an interest rate is measured over a

very short interval relative to its maturity, the predictable component

in the change should be minimal, and increasingly so as the length of the

interval is reduced (Pesando (1979)). Intuitively, if one could predict

-    on the basis of known information - changes in an interest rate over so
                                         2

 short an interval, arbitrage activities should quickly eliminate this

 dependence and so eliminate the attendant opportunity to earn sizeable

 trading profits.

     The purpose of this paper is to address the puzzle posed by this

anomalous finding. There are four main tasks. First, we confirm the

existence of the puzzle, using data on Canadian as well as U.S. interest

rates. Second, we show that the estimated coefficients of the

anticipated change in the money supply imply arbitrage opportunities that

are important in an economic sense. There j a puzzle. Third, we prove

that eliminating a (downward) bias in the measure of anticipated money

could, in theory, eliminate the puzzle, but that improving the efficiency

of an already unbiased measure could not. Fourth, we investigate the

extent to which eliminating the downward bias in the median response to

the survey conducted by Money Market Services, Inc. serves, in fact, to

eliminate the significance of anticipated money.

     To anticipate our findings, we confirm the negative - and frequently

significant -   coefficient   of anticipated money. We illustrate, using the

crucial subperiod from October 1979 to October 1982, that exploiting the

estimated relationship would have significantly improved the returns

earned by economic agents. We show that there is a downward bias in the

median response to the survey forecast, and that this bias is often

significant or marginally so. Correcting the survey measure for this

bias reduces the importance of, but does not eliminate, the significance

of anticipated money. We include a brief discussion of alternative

explanations for the puzzle, and then summarize our findings.

 II. The Impact of Anticipated Money on Interest Rates: Canadian and
        U.S. Evidence


      In Table 1, we present regressions of the post-announcement change

 in interest rates on unanticipated and anticipated changes in the money

 supply, for U.S. and Canadian 90-day Treasury bills and for 20-year U.S.

government and Government of Canada bonds. The anticipated (percentage)

change in the money supply is calculated from the median response to the

surveys conducted by Money Market Services, Inc.

     We examine the sample period from October 11, 1979 to September 5,

1985. We thus omit from consideration the period from September 1977

(the beginning of the survey) to October 1979, since the literature

suggests that anticipated money did not matter prior to this time. (See,

for example, Grossman (1981) and Roley (1983).) The window for the long-

term bonds and for U.S. Treasury bills is from 3:30 pm. on the day of

the announcement to 3:30 p.m. on the following business day; for Canadian

Treasury bills, from 3:30 p.m. on the day of the announcement to 10:30

a.m. the following business day.3 Following Roley (1986a,b,c), we look

at three subsamples, which correspond to dates of apparent shifts in the

U.S. monetary regime. These are October 1979 to October 1982, when the

Federal Reserve replaced the federal funds rate with nonborrowed reserves

as its operating instrument; October 1982 to October 1984, when the

Federal Reserve replaced nonborrowed reserves with borrowed reserves as

its operating instrument and probably de-emphasized Ml targeting; and

from February 1984, when the Federal Reserve adopted contemporaneous

reserve requirements and (probably) further de-emphasized Ml targeting,

to the end of our sample in September 1985.
                                      4

      The U.S. results confirm those of prior researchers. The

coefficient of unanticipated money is always positive and significant,

while the coefficient of anticipated money is always negative and often

significant.4 The results using Canadian interest rates are similar.

There is some evidence that the Bank of Canada smoothed the response of

bill rates on announcement days, especially in the first subperiod. For

long-term bonds, the Canadian and U.S. results are remarkably similar.5

From the perspective of the "puzzle," the first subperiod, from October

1979 to October 1982, is the most troublesome. Anticipated money is

significant in explaining the post-announcement change in all interest

rates except for Canadian Treasury bills.



III. Economic Significance of the Coefficients of Anticipated Money


     To illustrate that the significance of the coefficients of

anticipated money does indeed constitute a "puzzle," it is useful to

identify the profit opportunities associated with a simple trading rule.

Because the coefficients of anticipated money are the largest, we focus

below on the U.S. results for the October 1979 to October 1982 subsample.

     Consider two strategies. The first, the benchmark strategy, is to

buy bills or bonds on the day of the announcement, and to sell on the

following business day. The second is to buy hills or bonds on the day

of the announcement if the expected change in the money supply is

positive, since yields will on average fall, and to close the position on

the following business day. If the expected change is negative, the

bills or bonds will he sold short and the position closed on the

following day.   (We make no explicit allowance for transactions costs.
                                     5

One can, however, think of the second strategy as characterizing the

strategy of a buyer whose decision is to purchase before or after the

announcement, and a seller whose decision is to liquidate before or after

the announcement.)

     If applied to Treasury bills, the benchmark strategy produces an

annualized holding-period return, averaged over the 156 observations in

the subsample, of minus 185 per cent. For this same interval, from 3:30

p.m. on the announcement day to 3:30 p.m. on the following business day,

the benchmark strategy produces a holding-period return that averages

minus 86 per cent when applied to U.S. government bonds.   (These negative

returns reflect the tendency, on average, for the post-announcement

charge in interest rates to be positive during this subsample, as

evidenced by the constant terms in the regressions reported in Table 1.)

If an investor followed the second or informed strategy, exploiting the

predictive content of anticipated money, he would have earned an average

annual return of 162 per cent on Treasury bills, and 123 per cent on U.S.

government bonds. The increase in the holding-period return is

significant at the 5 per cent level for Treasury bills, and at the 1 per

cent level for the U.S. government bonds.6

    We could, of course, simulate the use of the predictive content of

anticipated money in different ways. For example, the investor might

implement the informed strategy only if the absolute value of the

anticipated change in money exceeds its mean. In essence, the investor

applies a filter and only acts if the information contained in the

anticipated money change is larger than average. If this filter is

applied, then the mean return (for the 66 "active" observations) rises to
                                             6

254 per cent for Treasury bills, and to 166 per cent for long-term bonds.

     In short, an investor who could postpone or accelerate a purchase,

or do likewise for a sale, could have significantly improved his returns

by acting on the information contained in the known value of anticipated

money. The fact that this information was jQ       fully   reflected in prices

and yields, and thus of no value in predicting subsequent changes, j a

puzzle.



IV. The Non-Rationality of the Survey Forecasts: A Clarifying Theorem


     Can non-rationality of the (widely-used) median response to the

survey conducted by Money Market Services, Inc. "explain" the puzzle of

anticipated money? We prove below two important propositions: first,

eliminating a (downward) bias in the measure of anticipated money             in
theory, solve the puzzle; and second, improving the efficiency of an

already unbiased measure cannot.

     Let       denote the change in the interest rate subsequent to the

announcement, let EM denote the anticipated change in the money supply

conditional upon all known information, and let UM denote the

corresponding measure of the unanticipated change in the money supply.

We are interested in the following model:

                         *    *
           R t =b 0 +bUM
                       it +hEMt +        2
                                                  ut                         (1)


Our maintained hypothesis is that positive money surprises serve to raise

interest rates (b1 >   0),   and that anticipated changes in the money supply

exert no impact on interest rates (b2 = 0)       Je thus              that

LR is uncorrelated with all information known to economic agents prior
                                                7

 to the announcement. This accords with the predisposition of most

observers to believe that the market will efficiently assimilate all

relevant information into the pre-announcement structure of interest

rates.

      Suppose, however, that the researcher has access to a measure of

anticipated money which does            fully exploit all known information and

which has a bias as shown below:



            EM            EM        +
                                            v                                       (2)


If 3 > 1,    then the measure available to the researcher is biased

downward, and conversely if    j9 <     1.      The researcher estimates the

equation:


                   c0 +    c1UM
                                        +
                                             c2EM
                                                    +
                                                        e                           (3)


      In the true model given by equation (1), the coefficient (b2) of

anticipated money is equal to zero. We prove below that the coefficient
                           >
c2
     in (3) is    0 as         1.


     Note first that   c2 can be expressed as follows:


             var(UM).cov(LR,EM) - cov(TJM,EM).cov(1R,UM)

     C2                                                                             (4)

                 var(UM).var(EM) - (cov(UM,EM))2

 -   The denominator of (4) must be positive, so that the sign of
                                                                               c2
must be the same as the sign of the numerator. Further,
                                                                   cov(LR,EM)
must be zero since EM is known and, by hypothesis, tR is
                                             8

uncorrelated with all known information. Thus the sign of c2 will

reflect only the sign of the second term in the numerator.

     The actual change in the money supply (EM) must, by construction,
         *          *
equal EM plus UM as well as EM plus UM. We can thus rearrange
(2) to obtain:


                TiM   =        + a + (/3l)EM + Vt
                          UM                                                         (5)

                 *                                           *
Note that cov(UM ,EM.
                 c    t
                       )        must equal zero since UM          is uncorrelated with
                                                             t

any information available to agents prior to the announcement. Thus

cov(UM,EM) equals (/3..l)var(EM).                Note also that cov(R,UM)

equals cov(R,UM) since UM = UMt*+ (EMEM) and (EMEM) is
uncorrelated with              by hypothesis since it represents known

information. Thus, from (1), we have cov(Rt,UM) b1var(UM). These
results imply that the second term in the numerator of (4) is:


     -cov(UM,EM).cov(R,UM) =
                                            (l)var(EM).b1var(UMk)                    (6)


     Our first proposition is that
                                            c2
                                                  0 as           0, which follows

immediately from (6).          If, for example, the measure of anticipated money

used by the researcher is biased downward (3 > 1), then the coefficient

of anticipated money in (3) will be negative.

     Our second proposition also follows immediately from (6). If the

measure of anticipated money is unbiased (           = 1),   then c2      0.   The

degree of inefficiency of an unbiased forecast, equal to var(v) in

(2), cannot cause the coefficient of anticipated money in (3) to be
            7
negative.
                                     9

     These two propositions provide the following perspective on the

puzzle of anticipated money. If the measure of anticipated money used by

the researcher has a downward bias, then correcting this bias may

eliminate the negative coefficient if the true coefficient of anticipated

money is zero. However, an attempt to improve the efficiency of an

already unbiased measure, perhaps by incorporating additional information

that becomes available between the date of the forecast and the date of

the announcement, should have no such effect.

     This point has not been made previously in the literature. Indeed,

it appears to be the source of some confusion. Roley (1983), for

example, adjusts the raw survey forecasts beginning with the money

announcement on February 8, 1980 to reflect the fact that the survey is

no longer taken on the day previous to the Friday announcement, but three

days before (Tuesday). Roley assumes that movements in the Treasury bill

yield over the intervening three days capture the change in the market's

expectation of the money supply announcement. He finds that replacing

the raw survey forecast with an adjusted forecast, which uses this

information, eliminates the significance of the coefficient of

anticipated money. Hem (1985) points out that Roley's correction

implicitly eliminates a downward bias in the survey forecast. Hem re-

estimates Roley's correction, no longer constraining it to eliminate

bias, and finds that the coefficient of anticipated money remains

significant.8 Hem does not appear to appreciate the precise nature of

this result. For example, he refers interchangeably (page 268) to

Roley's "implicit correction for inefficiencies in the survey forecast"

and the fact that Roley has corrected for the tendency of the survey
                                                   10

forecasts "to underestimate, in absolute value, nonzero money stock

changes.

     Clark, James and Phillips (1985) argue that the survey expectation

does not appear to incorporate fully the information contained in "social

security weeks." While it may be genuinely useful to incorporate this

information into the proxy for anticipated money, our result shows that

this suggestion to improve the survey forecast cannot be considered an

explanation of the puzzle.1°



V.   Some Empirical Evidence


     In this section, we first perform standard tests for the

unbiasedness of the median response to the survey conducted by Money
                        11            E
Market Services, Inc.          Let AMt denote the forecast change in the

money supply according to this survey, and let                        denote the actual

change that is subsequently announced. The standard test for

unbiasedness is an F-test of the null hypothesis                        0   and        1 in

the following regression:


                =                      E
                             + 131LM       +   e                                            (7)



Our estimates of this equation, for the full sample and for each of the

subsamples, are presented in Table 2.                   In the subsample from February

1984 to September 1985, as well as for the full sample, there is a

significant downward bias in the forecasts. In the subsample October

1979 to October 1982, where the coefficients of anticipated money are the

largest, the median survey forecast has a downward bias, but                  it   is not

significant.
                                    11

     We utilize, for each subsample, the fitted values from the

regressions presented in Table 2 as our revised measure of anticipated

money. By construction, the bias in the survey measure of anticipated

money is thus eliminated for each subsample.

     We next rerun the regressions of the post-announcement change in

interest rates on both anticipated and unanticipated money. Substituting

the revised measures of anticipated and unanticipated money will affect

only the coefficients (and the standard errors) of anticipated money and

the constant term.12 Thus we present, in Table 1, the estimates of

the coefficients (c) of anticipated money after we have corrected the

median response for bias. As we expect, in light of the downward bias in

the survey median for all subperiods, the t-statistics for anticipated

money decline in all of the twelve regressions. In the subsample

February 1984 to September 1985, where the downward bias is the

strongest, the coefficient of anticipated money ceases to be significant

in the regression for Canadian Treasury bills. For the subsample October

1979 to October 1982, the significance of anticipated money in the

regressions for U.S. Treasury bills, and for U.S. government and

Government of Canada bonds, remains, although at a somewhat reduced

level. For these regressions, the solution to the puzzle of anticipated

money must be sought elsewhere.

     We can provide, however, no alternative explanation that meets with

our satisfaction. In terms of an economic explanation, we can only note

that the subperiod October 1979 to October 1982 was characterized by the

unprecedented level and volatility of interest rates, and followed an

abrupt and dramatic shift in the operating procedures of the Federal
                                         12

 Reserve. In spite of the significant arbitrage profits to be earned from

 exploiting the predictive content of anticipated money, agents may have

 been too risk averse to act upon this information.

         There exists, as well, the possibility that these results may be a

 statistical artifact. If we systematically delete observations from the

 October 1979 to October 1982 subsample, we find that the significance of

 anticipated money is extremely sensitive to four observations. If these

 four observations are deleted from the regression for U.S. Treasury

bills, the t-statistic for anticipated money declines from 2.24 to
         13
1. 36.




VI. Summary and Conclusions


         Data on the anticipated change in the money supply compiled by Money

Market Services, Inc. have served as a catalyst to the rapidly-expanding

literature on the impact of money "surprises" on financial markets.

Somewhat paradoxically, researchers have found that the anticipated

component in the Federal Reserve's weekly money supply announcement

exerts a persistently negative effect on the post-announcement change in

market yields.

      In this paper, we have clarified the extent to which the non-

rationality of the (widely-used) median response to the survey may

underlie this puzzle. We prove that eliminating a (downward) bias in the

measure of anticipated money can, in theory, eliminate this puzzle, but

that improving the efficiency of an already unbiased measure cannot. We

find, using Canadian as well as U.S. interest rate data, that correcting

the downward bias in the survey measure reduces, hut does not eliminate,

 1. There is, however, disagreement in the interpretation to be assigned

     to the market's response to the news contained in the announcement.

     Cornell (1983), for example, has suggested that it may be only the

     nominal interest rate that rises in response to a positive surprise,

     to reflect a higher inflation premium. Urich and Wachtel (1981) and

     Roley and Walsh (1985), for example, argue that it is the real

     interest rate that rises in response to a positive surprise, to

     reflect the anticipation that the Federal Reserve will counteract -

     not   accommodate -   the   surprise.

2.   Roley (1983) uses the one-and-one-half hour interval (from 3:30 p.m.

     to 5:00 p.m. on the day of the announcement). Urich and Wachtel

     (1981) utilize a half-day interval, from the afternoon before the

     announcement to the morning after.

3.   For Canada, the Treasury bill data are from the Bank of Canada's

     data bank or quote sheets. The data for long-term bonds are the

     yields on individual and heavily-traded bonds with a maturity of

     approximately 20 years (the 9 1/2's of 2001 for October 1979 to

     October 1982, and the 10 1/4's of 2004 for October 1982 to September

     1985), from daily quote sheets provided by R. Hannah of the

     Securities Department of the Bank of Canada. For the United States,

     the bond yields are for the 20-year constant maturity bond from the

     Federal Reserve's H.15 release, made available to us through DRI

     Canada, and the bill data are from the Bank of Canada. The source

     of the money supply data is the Federal Reserves H.6 release. The

     data on the anticipated change in narrowly-defined money compiled by
                                     15

     Money Market Services, Inc. were made available to us through the

     courtesy of Vance Roley. In our empirical work, we use the

     percentage change in narrowly-defined money. To construct this

     percentage change, we use the preliminary (flQ the revised) data on

     the money supply.

4. The results also support the choice of subsamples. For the U.S.

     Treasury bills, the test statistics for structural change in the

     response to unanticipated money are significant (at least) at 10 per

     cent. We use the Wald test statistic which is asymptotically

     distributed as x2(l) because the standard F-test is inappropriate

     in the presence of heteroscedasticity. The values of our test-

     statistic are 3.67 (for the break between the first and second

     subperiods) and 5.98 (for the break between the second and third).

     There is, of course, abundant evidence of a structural change in

     October 1979. See, for example, Loeys (1985).

5.   The Bank of Canada (1980) sought, in 1980, to attenuate the response

     of short-term interest rates in Canada to movements in U.S. rates,

     given the increased volatility of the latter after the October 1979

     shift in the monetary regime. The results in Table 1 provide

     evidence of this smoothing, at the short end of the maturity

     spectrum, in light of the increased volatility of interest rates on

     announcement days. Any smoothing of the response of short-term

     interest rates by the Bank of Canada will, of course, have

     repercussions on the foreign exchange value of the Canadian dollar.

     An analysis of the (perhaps) changing reaction function of the Bank

     of Canada is beyond the scope of the present paper.

6. The relevant t-statistics, with 155 degrees of freedom, are 2.32 for

    Treasury bills and 3.30 for U.S. government bonds.

7. Note that var(v) does not appear explicitly in (6). We can,

    however, readily rearrange (6) to obtain:

                      *                      *
                (var(EM) -
            2                var(v)).b1var(IJM)                          (Fl)


    From (Fl), it follows explicitly that c2 = 0      if       fi
                                                                    =1
    regardless of the value of var(v).

8. For the period February 8, 1980 to October 15, 1982, Roley estimates

    the following "revision" (bracketed figures are standard errors):


                   0.2768 + l.2Ol6(ME) + l.2624(RF -RT ) +          ut
                  (0.1872) (0.1216)     (0.3472)
                                                           t                (F2)



    where   LM is the actual change in the money supply, M1 is the

    forecast change in the Tuesday survey, and RF and RTt are the

    three-month bill yields on Friday and Tuesday, respectively. Roley

    uses the fitted values from (F2) to proxy the market's expectation,

    and finds that anticipated money no longer exerts a significant

   negative impact on the post-announcement change in three-month bill

   yields. Hem (1985) shows that when he reruns (F2) with the

   coefficient of         constrained to unity, then anticipated money

   remains a significant determinant of the post-announcement change in

   yields. Note, as anticipated by the theorem we derive in the text,

   Roley's "correction" does involve the elimination of a downward bias

   in the median response to the survey conducted by Money Market

   Services, Inc.

9. Roley (1985), in his reply to Hem, raises arguments similar to the
                                                   17

     ones made in this paper.

10. We have assumed throughout that the coefficients a and                               in (2) are

     constant. With time varying values of a and , the interpretation

     of the coefficients in (3) may be sample-specific. It is difficult

     to say anything about the impacts of bias and inefficiency in this

     case without being very specific about the nature of the time

     variation in the parameters.

11. Many researchers have examined the rationality of these forecasts.

     See, for example, Grossman (1981), Hafer (1983), Urich and Wachtel

     (1984), and Engel and Frankel (1984).

12. Let LIt = 0     + IM
                      1     t
                                 ,   where               denotes the OLS estimate. We

    have two fitted   regressions:

                      +              -         +
                                                    2LME
                                                            +
                                                                ei
           LRt =       +   *(AM          -
                                             I)     +
                                                        2*I     +
                                                                    e2
     Using the definition of L , we see that the regressors in the two

     equations span the same space. Therefore, elt =                       e2      .   Also,   since

     the difference between (M -                        and its orthogonal projection
                                             LM)
     onto the constant and iM is exactly (Mt -
                                                                         £I)   ,   the
     coefficients          and                are numerically identical as are their

     estimated standard errors.

13. These results are from regressions of the post-announcement change

     in the interest rate on anticipated money and a constant. Note that

     if the true coefficient of expected money is zero, excluding

    unanticipated money from the regression is tantamount to eliminating

    any bias. Belongia, Hafer and Sheehan (1986) partition the sample

    1978-1983 into 6-month subsamples, and then run regressions of the
                                18

post-announcement change in U.S. Treasury bills on both expected and

unexpected changes in money. Belongia et.      find that anticipated

money is significant (and negative) at the 5 per cent level only for

the subsample corresponding to the first half of 1981. They find

that by dropping the observation for May 1, 1981 (one of the four

observations deleted after our search), the significance of

anticipated money is eliminated for this subsample. In conducting

their analysis, Belongia     al. employ a variation of the

correction suggested by Roley (1983)
