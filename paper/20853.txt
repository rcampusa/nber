                                               ABSTRACT

Endogenous growth models raise fundamental questions about the nature of human creativity, and
the sorts of resources, skills, and knowledge inputs that shift the frontier of technology and production
possibilities. Many argue that the nature of early British industrialization supports the thesis that economic
advances depend on specialized scientific training or the acquisition of costly human capital. This
paper examines the contributions of different types of knowledge to British industrialization, by assessing
the backgrounds, education and inventive activity of the major contributors to technological advances
in Britain during the crucial period between 1750 and 1930. The results indicate that scientists, engineers
or technicians were not well-represented among the British great inventors until very late in the nineteenth
century. Instead, important discoveries and British industrial advances were achieved by individuals
who exercised commonplace skills and entrepreneurial abilities to resolve perceived industrial problems.
For developing countries today, the implications are that costly investments in specialized human
capital resources might be less important than incentives for creativity, flexibility, and the ability to
make incremental adjustments that can transform existing technologies into inventions that are appropriate
for prevailing domestic conditions.

    I. INTRODUCTION

Endogenous growth models are based on the premise that knowledge and ideas comprise a

significant source of economic progress. These models raise fundamental questions about the

nature of human creativity, what sorts of resources, skills, and other personal characteristics are

conducive to extraordinary achievements, and how those factors vary over time and with the field

of endeavour. They imply that our understanding of early economic progress requires an

assessment of the types of knowledge inputs which were in elastic supply, and were responsive to

economic incentives. Walt Rostow, for instance, contended that one of the preconditions for

economic and social advance is additions to scientific knowledge and technical applications, inputs

which typically are scarce in many developing countries.1 Nathan Rosenberg similarly highlights

the determining role of science and the growth of specialized knowledge.2 Others regard scientists

as disinterested individuals who are motivated by intangible rewards such as enhanced reputations

and honour, the desire to benefit mankind, or the pursuit of timeless truths, rather than material

benefits. If highly specialized skills and scientific knowledge are prerequisites for generating

productivity gains, but such inputs are in scarce or inelastic supply, this has important implications

for development policy measures. These issues bear on the general question of whether creativity

is induced by expansions in market demand, or depends on the acquisition of costly human capital

that are largely unresponsive to perceived need.

        These concerns have been widely debated, especially in the context of industrialization in

Britain and explanations for its subsequent loss of competitiveness. Still, little consensus has

emerged from the plethora of contributions to this topic, in part because of a lack of systematic

evidence. According to some, the theoretical elitist biases of the European scientific establishment

 Rosenberg emphasizes that if we wish to understand economic progress "we must pay close attention to a special
supply side variable: the growing stock of useful knowledge," and further states that "a large part of the economic
history of the past 200 years" was due to science and specialized knowledge. Nathan Rosenberg, "Science, Invention
and Economic Growth," Economic Journal, vol. 84 (333) 1974: 90-108 (p. 98, 104).

help to explain why Britain and not (say) France, was the first industrial nation. They point to

anecdotal examples of formal and informal links between scientific discoveries and technological

change, and conclude that Britain's industrial lead depended on its scientific standing.3 A classic

but contested example of such ties is the influence of scientist Joseph Black on James Watt's

improvement on the steam engine.4 Similarly, John Roebuck and Charles Tennant applied

chemical knowledge to produce sulphuric acid through a lead-chamber process that increased

output and reduced prices, and improved inputs into textile bleaching.5 The eighteenth-century

Lunar Society is consistently cited as proof-by-association of the relationship between natural

philosophy and practical discoveries that increased industrial productivity.6 Related institutions in

the nineteenth century included the Surrey and London Institutions, as well as the "X-Club," a

small number of influential scientists who attended social and professional monthly dinners.7

More general enthusiasm for scientific studies was manifested in the rapid growth of less-eminent

scientific and natural philosophy societies, whose number increased from fewer than fifty at the

end of the eighteenth century, to over 1000 by the 1880s.8 Extreme versions of the "science

  “Contrary to long accepted ideas, the Industrial Revolution was not simply a product of illiterate practical craftsmen,
devoid of scientific training. In the development of steam power, in the growth of the chemical industry, and in various
other industries, scientists made important contributions and industrialists with scientifically trained minds also
utilised applied science in their manufacturing processes.” A.E Musson and E. Robinson, Science and Technology in

matters" thesis go so far as to propose that "virtually all" inventors in Britain during the industrial

revolution were influenced by scientific advances.9

         David Landes is the most prominent proponent of the opposing thesis that science did not

influence early British advances in technology, and researchers in this tradition concur that the

industrial revolution "owed virtually nothing to science."10 British innovations toward the end of

the eighteenth century and at the start of the nineteenth century were largely produced by artisans

with little formal education, who benefited from apprenticeships and on-the-job learning.

Significant problems such as the mechanical measurement of longitude at sea were resolved by

relatively uneducated artisans, rather than through the application of abstract or formal scientific

observation. A number of other studies highlight the reciprocal nature of interactions between

industry and academic science.11 For instance, Neil McKendrick's guarded conclusion was that

science "played a necessary but not sufficient role."12 Many such researchers emphasize that until

the middle of the nineteenth century even the frontier of science and engineering was closer to

organized intuition. More formal scientific endeavours of the day owed to skittish dons or

aristocratic amateurs, whose efforts were directed to impractical pursuits and general principles in

astronomy, magnetism, mathematics, botany and chemistry, rather than to useful knowledge that

   See A.R and M.B Hall, A Brief History of Science, Signet Library Books, 1964, p. 219: “The beginnings of modern
technology in the so-called Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century owed virtually nothing
to science, and everything to the fruition of the tradition of craft invention.”
11
    Donald Cardwell, The Development of Science and Technology in Britain, p. 483, refers to "the two-way
relationship between science and technology," but implies that science benefited more from prior flows of technical
insights. Paul Elliot, "The Birth of Public Science in the English Provinces: Natural Philosophy in Derby, c. 1690-
1760," Annals of Science, Vol. 57 Issue 1, 2000: 61-100, considers such Derby luminaries as John Whitehurst FRS,
Thomas Simpson FRS and Benjamin Parker. He concluded that their experience pointed to the possibility that
technology likely influenced scientific discovery and education as much as the reverse.

   “The major pull came from the demand side of the economy rather than from the push of scientifically induced
advance on the supply side. Indeed, in the hierarchy of causal significance, science would not rank very high, but that
does not mean that it would not rank at all as a dependent variable, the latent potential of which was released by more
commanding variable, it played a necessary but not sufficient role in easing the path of industrial success and
economic progress.” N. McKendrick, "The Role of Science in the Industrial Revolution," p. 319.

could enhance technological productivity.13 Joel Mokyr, for instance, highlights the impact of the

rational scientific revolution in the seventeenth century, but his emphasis is on the general

influence of the intellectual and methodological developments of Bacon, Hooke and Newton,

rather than on specific applications of their scientific results to industry.14 Such proposals are

largely untestable, but a recent study of French industrialization uses the proxy of book

subscriptions to measure “upper tail knowledge,” and concludes that their results indicate that

human capital and scientific education were critical for growth during industrialization.15 As these

diverse propositions suggest, significant aspects of the relationship between knowledge, science

and technology in the industrial revolution still remain unresolved.

         This paper focuses on the role of different types of knowledge in British industrialization,

and offers a systematic estimation that defines scientific inputs specifically in terms of individuals

with demonstrable scientific credentials. Clearly this approach has its drawbacks, but it also

allows us to present empirical patterns, which can be compared to the more detailed and anecdotal

historical accounts. The analysis is based on a sample of "great inventors" who were included in

biographical dictionaries because of their contributions to technological progress. I traced the

inventors who received formal training in science and engineering, as well as wider dimensions of

achievement such as membership in the Royal Society, scientific eminence, publications, and the

receipt of prizes and nonmonetary rewards. The variables from the biographical entries were

further supplemented with information from patent records on the numbers of patents filed over
13
   According to William Ashworth, An Economic History of England, 1870-1939, 1960, p. 27, "heroic inventions"
were predominantly made by craftsmen, and the alleged scientists were "enthusiastic amateurs with, at best, a very
modest knowledge of scientific theory."
14
   Joel Mokyr, The Gifts of Athena: Historical Origins of the Knowledge Economy, Princeton, NJ: Princeton
University Press, 2002, argues that the Industrial Revolution was due to an "Industrial Enlightenment." According to
this perspective, those who focus simply on pure scientific discoveries miss much of the point, since valuable
knowledge was drawn from a combination of tatonnement and conscious insight. However, Mokyr would likely agree
that ultimately developments in science and engineering on the European continent led to advances in chemicals, steel,
electricity, whereas the scientific and technical backwardness of British institutions and education contributed to its
relative decline.

the individual's lifetime, the length of the inventor's patenting career, the industry in which he was

active, and the degree of specialization at invention.16 This approach allows us to examine the

backgrounds, education and inventive activity of the major contributors to technological advances

in Britain during the crucial period between 1750 and 1930, and to determine the extent to which

such advances owed to specialized human capital and knowledge. More generally, the results have

the potential to enhance our understanding of the determinants of shifts in the frontiers of

technology during early economic development.



II.THE GREAT INVENTORS SAMPLE

The sample of "great inventors" was compiled from biographical dictionaries, including the 2004

Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (DNB), and the Biographical Dictionary of the History

of Technology (BD), among others.17 The objective was to compile a sample of individuals who

had made significant contributions to technological products and productivity. This accorded

more with the intent of the BD, whose contributing authors were specialists in the particular

technological field that they examined. The DNB's objective was somewhat different, for its

editors intended to incorporate "not just the great and good, but people who have left a mark for

any reason, good, bad, or bizarre."18 The volume employed inconsistent terminology in the

occupational titles of its biographies, and the mention of inventors or inventions either in the title

or text did not necessarily imply that the person in question had made a significant contribution to


16
   The discussion of broad scientific culture is informative and yields insights into the role of social capital in
economic development. However, I chose to focus here on the evolution of contributions to useful knowledge, which
are defined as additions to the social information set that have the potential to directly expand the production
possibility frontier. Patent counts are used as a proxy for advances in such knowledge. Patents have well-known
flaws that suggest that results should be interpreted with a sensitivity to their drawbacks, but they do offer the
opportunity to adopt a more systematic approach to the relationship between science and technology in British
economic growth.

the course of technical change.19 A number of inventors are variously described as pioneers,

developers, promoters or designers, and Edward Sonsadt is omitted altogether although elsewhere

he is regarded as an "inventive genius."20 I therefore supplemented these two volumes with other

biographical compilations, and numerous books that were based on the life of a specific inventor.21

Although a few of the entries in any such sample would undoubtedly be debatable, this

triangulation of sources minimizes the possibility of egregious error.22

        One way to determine the extent of systematic sample bias is to estimate the probability

that an inventor drawn from a particular biographical source (e.g. the DNB) was selected on

different criteria relative to inventors from other sources. I computed a simple logistic regression

model where the dependent variable was the probability that an inventor from our sample was

included in the DNB, and the independent variables included all characteristics that we intended to

investigate in this study, such as birth cohort, occupation, education, science background, patenting

and publications records, and so on. The response function Y| Xi (Xi= X1, X2, ... Xn) is assumed to

have the form E(Y|Xi) = exp(ß0 + ß1x + ...) / (1 + exp( ß0 + ß1x + ...)), where ßi are regression

coefficients that represent the intercept and slopes with respect to the particular independent

variable. The resulting function is linear in the log of the odds, loge(p / 1 - p). Maximum

likelihood methods were used to estimate the parameters. We can reject the hypothesis of bias for

   For instance, their listings included Walter Wingfield ("inventor of lawn tennis"); Rowland Emett (cartoonist and
"inventor of whimsical creations"); as well as the inventors of Plasticine, Pimm's cocktail, self-rising flour and
Meccano play sets. At the same time, Henry Bessemer is described as a steel manufacturer, Henry Fourdrinier as a
paper manufacturer, and Lord Kelvin as a mathematician and physicist. A large fraction of the technological inventors
are featured in the DNB as engineers even though the majority had no formal training.

   These include the Encyclopaedia Britannica; David Abbott (ed), Biographical Dictionary of Scientists: Engineers
and Inventors, London: Blond Educational, 1985; Dictionnaire des Inventeurs et Inventions, Larousse: Paris, 1996;
and other compilations. Approximately 15 percent of the sample from these sources were missing altogether from the
DNB.
22
   The entries from the DNB were significantly more likely to have earned prizes, and their residence at time of
invention was more likely to have been in London and outside England. However, since this finding is not
inconsistent with the secondary literature, the overall results from these regressions bolster one's confidence in the
representativeness of the great inventors' sample.

 almost all variables of interest, including time of first invention, educational status, science

 background, and occupation.

          The resulting British great inventors sample is comparable to the data set Kenneth Sokoloff

 and I compiled of important inventors and their patenting activity in the United States during the

 same period.23 The current British sample is based on 434 men and one woman who made

 significant contributions to technological products and productivity, and who produced at least one

 invention between 1790 and 1930. These British inventors include such well-known icons as Sir

 Humphry Davy, Sherard Osborn Cowper-Coles, John Dunlop, Charles Macintosh, Charles

 Babbage, Edmund Cartwright, Lord Kelvin, Guglielmo Marconi and George Stephenson. The

 lone woman inventor, Henrietta Vansittart (1833-1883), is referenced in the DNB as an engineer

 whose educational background is unknown.24 She improved upon her father's screw propeller

 invention, for which she obtained two British patents and awards from a number of countries.

          As Table 1 shows, the majority of great inventors were born in the South of England, and

 London stands out especially as the birthplace of a fairly constant share of the scientist inventors

 who were born in the nineteenth century. The birth cohort before 1780 contributed to the onset of

 industrialization, and it is striking that almost a quarter of the great inventors during this critical

 Innovation among `Great Inventors' During Early American Industrialization, 1790-1865," Journal of Economic
 History, vol. 53 (2) 1993: 289-307. Other economic historians have used biographical information to explore the
 patterns and sources of important and exceptional innovation. For example, in his studies of painters, novelists and
 Nobel prize winners in economics, David Galenson has proposed a life cycle approach to creativity, and discerns two
 different types of innovators : "conceptual artists" or theorists who primarily make their most significant discoveries
 early in their careers ; whereas "experimental artists" or empiricists are those whose "genius" emerges later in the life-
 cycle after a long gestation period during which they accumulate the skills and knowledge to realize better and better
 contributions or creations.
 24
    A potential second candidate is Eleanor Coade (1733-1821), who is listed as the owner of an innovative stone-
 making factory. However, her status as an inventor is completely speculative: there is no evidence that she was
 responsible for the innovations her factory produced, and they might well have been the product of her employees.
                                                             9
period originated from Scotland and other locations outside of England. For instance, Sir Isaac

Holden, a prominent contributor to wool-combing technology, was born in 1807 near Glasgow,

Scotland. Other noted inventors who were born in other areas outside England include Lord

Kelvin (Ireland), Richard Roberts (Wales), and Warren de la Rue (Guernsey). The famous Marc

Isambard Brunel was born in Normandy, France, and such foreign-born inventors increased among

the birth cohorts after 1820, including Gugliemo Marconi, Gisbert Johann Kapp, and Sir John

Gustav Jarmay. It is noticeable that inventors who were born outside of England tended to be

disproportionately trained in science, as indicated by the fraction of scientists (approximately 37

percent) relative to nonscientists (26 percent.)

       Table 2 presents the distribution of inventors in terms of their science background and

indicates the changes over the course of industrialization. There is some ambiguity about what a

"scientist" connotes, so the table examines three alternative measures of scientific orientation:

formal education; eminence as gauged by listing in biographical dictionaries of scientists; and

membership in the Royal Society. Approximately 20 percent of the great inventors were educated

at the post-secondary level in the sciences, mathematics or medicine. Similarly, 16.6 percent could

be considered as eminent scientists. A significant number (20.7 percent of all inventors) were

Fellows of the Royal Society. The data suggest that a change in the nature of important

technological innovations occurred after 1870, since scientists accounted for a significantly higher

proportion of inventors after this period. For instance, the percentage of inventors with formal

scientific training increased from 20 percent in 1852-1870 to 33.3 percent between 1871-1890.

These patterns are even more marked for great inventors with formal education in engineering,

who comprised 11.1 percent of all inventors. Inventors with formal engineering qualifications

increased from a mere 1 percent before 1820, to 25.4 percent of all great inventors by 1871-1890.

Since part of our concern is with the contribution of this sort of specialized knowledge to

                                                   10
innovation, the following section further explores the extent of formal training among the great

inventors, and the role of education in science and engineering over the course of industrialization.



III. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GREAT INVENTORS

Economic studies have shown the importance of appropriate institutions in promoting self-

sustaining growth, and imply that the rate and direction of useful knowledge could be hampered, if

not retarded, by flaws and inefficiencies in key institutions. As Sir Henry Sumner Maine

suggests, Britain long remained an oligarchic society that was convinced that merit was causally

related to inherited social class.25 The United States arguably was able to assume economic

leadership in part because institutions such as its educational and political systems offered

inducements to all classes of society to contribute to the growth process, and allocated rewards that

were commensurate with an individual's productivity rather than his social provenance. The

British educational system, in particular, failed to match up to institutes of higher learning in

Germany and the United States and has been portrayed as a hindrance to economic advancement. 26

However, the costs of such policies are a function of the degree to which productive economic

activities depended on the acquisition of these sorts of human capital.

         Figure 1 examines the distributions of great inventors by birth cohort in terms of their

educational background. The great inventors were more educated than the general population, but

these data make it is clear that formal training was not a prerequisite for important invention in the


25
   According to Maine, “All that has made England famous, and all that has made England wealthy, has been the work
of minorities, sometimes very small ones. It seems to me quite certain that, if for four centuries there had been a very
widely extended franchise ... the threshing machine, the power loom, the spinning jenny, and possibly the steam-
engine, would have been prohibited,” Sir Henry Maine, Popular Government: Four Essays, London: J. Murray, 1886,
p. 98.
26
   David Landes (1969) supports this position. The 1870 Elementary Education Act extended state support for
education if private school funds were insufficient. Compulsory education was introduced in 1880 and limited free
public education was made available in 1891. For an excellent study of the role of the state in promoting literacy, see
David Mitch, The Rise of Popular Literacy in Victorian England: The Influence of Private Choice and Public Policy,

early period of industrialization. The majority of great inventors had no formal education beyond

the primary or secondary school levels, even as late as the 1821-1845 birth cohort. Thus, these

patterns refute the claim that "virtually all of the inventors" had exposure to scientific training, and

is more consistent with the notion that the industrial revolution drew on traditional institutions that

enhanced individual abilities such as apprenticeships and on the job training.27 The route of

apprenticeship was taken by an impressive roster of great inventors, including some who came

from quite privileged backgrounds. Apprenticeship was a flexible source of human capital

acquisition, which did not preclude social mobility or further education. The skills that the

inventor obtained could be combined with night-school or attendance at lectures offered by

mechanics' institutes, or even a university degree later in life. Sir Joseph Wilson Swan was

apprenticed at 14 to a pharmacy store, but attended lectures at the Athenaeum in Sunderland that

helped him to become a prominent chemist and electrical inventor. Both the Fairbairn brothers

(Sir Peter Fairbairn (1799-1861) and Sir William Fairbairn (1789-1874)) were apprenticed as

millwrights in a colliery at an early age, but were able to achieve distinction in a number of arenas.

William Fairbairn, in particular, although he was self-taught, was appointed a member of the

Academy of Science in France, a Fellow of the Royal Society, and President of the British

Association. The military academies also allowed inventors to combine apprenticeships with more

formal but somewhat diffuse training.

        A fairly constant fraction of the great inventors obtained college degrees in general subjects

such as divinity or the arts, which were unlikely to have contributed to their technological

productivity. Over time, the importance of further education in science steadily increased.

Engineering proficiency was more discontinuous, and was associated with a jump in the technical

orientation of 1821-1845 birth cohort; and 60 percent of all 27 inventors who received further

27
 According to Cronin (2001), p. 241, "throughout much of the 19th-century the craft-apprenticeship mode of training
was the only form of technical education."
                                                        12
education in engineering first produced inventions between 1871 and 1890. This is consistent with

the earlier finding that scientific and technical invention became more prevalent after 1870. By the

beginning of the twentieth century, a science or technical educational background was typical of

the majority of great inventors and many even received advanced doctoral degrees in science.

However, it is not clear whether university attendance or degrees in science and engineering

prevailed among inventors because such qualifications enhanced their skill at invention, or because

a college degree was correlated with other arbitrary factors that gave these individuals preferment.

         Donald Cardwell claimed that there were few institutional obstacles to innovation in

England, for it was "a remarkably open society," and many of the inventive "heroes" in both

science and technology were from humble origins.28 Our data suggest otherwise. Table 3 shows

that the common perception that the heroes of the British industrial revolution were primarily from

modest backgrounds is somewhat overstated. Instead, an examination of the family backgrounds

of the great inventors is more consistent with the notion that in the area of technological

achievement elites were over-represented relative to the population. A third of the inventors did

indeed come from farming, low-skilled or undistinguished (likely most of the unknown category)

backgrounds. However, the majority of the great inventors were born to families headed by skilled

artisans, manufacturers, white collar workers, or well-off families in the elite and professional

classes. A striking feature of the table is that the inventors with science training were twice as

likely to belong to these elite and professional families, and this pattern is invariant over the entire

period.29

   Employers were averse to hiring college-educated workers. As the Times opined in 1897, "technical education is
not needed for the masses of people. Indeed they are better without it ... [it] only teaches the workman to think that he
is as good as his master" (cited in Cronin, p. 222). Another perspective on this finding is to compare the social
backgrounds of great inventors who attended college, across the two leading industrial nations of Britain and America.
If it were true that elites prevailed because their privileged background and subsequent advantages in obtaining a
college degree gave them an objective edge in technological creativity, we might expect little difference across
                                                           13
         An increasing fraction of inventors were educated at elite schools such as Oxford or

Cambridge (Table 4), institutions which were unlikely to offer much in the way of knowledge or

skills that would add to either scientific or technological prowess. Advancement at these

institutions primarily depended on excellence in liberal classical subjects, and the engineer John

Perry even declared that "Oxford fears and hates natural science."30 Cambridge had offered the

Natural Science Tripos since 1848, but for much of the nineteenth century the impact was

nominal.31 The anti-pragmatism of Oxbridge was reflected even in the "red-brick" institutions that

were established toward the end of the nineteenth century to remedy the lapses in the scientific and

technical curricula of the older schools.32 It is not surprising that serious British students of

science and technology chose to pursue graduate studies in the German academies which were

acknowledged as the world leaders in higher education in such fields as chemistry, physics and

countries. In the period before 1820 college attendees in both countries predominantly belonged to elite families.
However, after 1820 the share of elites shrinks noticeably in the United States, and the vast majority of graduates come
from nonelite backgrounds, whereas the pattern in Britain remains for the most part unchanged. The United States had
sent in place policies that facilitated human capital acquisition among the working class and led to social mobility
through educational institutions, such as the Land Grant Act that subsidized universities. In Britain, and in England in
particular, until the middle of the nineteenth century access to higher education was primarily available to the wealthy
and those who adhered to the religious standards of the Establishment. Even though Dissenters were allowed to read
for Oxbridge degrees after the 1850s, until 1873 they were precluded from holding fellowships at Cambridge.

   See Janet Howarth, "Science Education in Late-Victorian Oxford: A Curious Case of Failure?" The English
Historical Review, Vol. 102, No. 403. (Apr., 1987), pp. 334-371. R. H. Tawney (Equality, 1931) wryly commented
that the English "frisk into polite obsolescence on the playing fields of Eton." Along the same lines, Margaret Gowing
(1978, p. 9) characterized English efforts at reforming its educational institutions at the end of the 19 th century as "too
little and too late." She attributes this to inadequate funding, the influence of social class and the Church, and poor
administration.

Reflections on the Anatomy of an Elite, 1851-1914," Oxford Review of Education, vol. 6 (2) 1980: 177-195. As late as
1880 only 4 percent of Cambridge undergraduates read for the NSTs and most were destined for occupations such as
the clergy and medicine. The method of teaching eschewed practical laboratory work; and there was a general disdain
among the Dons for the notion that science should be directed toward professional training; so it is not surprising that
only 4 percent of the NST graduates entered industry. Students who did take the NSTs tended to perform poorly
because of improper preparation and indifferent teaching, especially in colleges other than Trinity, Caius and St.
John's. Chairs in Engineering were created in Cambridge in 1875 and in Oxford in 1907, whereas MIT alone had
seven engineering professors in 1891.

   Sarah V. Barnes, "England's Civic Universities and the Triumph of the Oxbridge Ideal," History of Education
Quarterly, Vol. 36, No. 3. (Autumn, 1996), pp. 271-305, finds a tendency for the red-brick universities to be regarded
as second-rate, and for the classical Oxbridge approach to be regarded as a superior model in a "triumph of tradition."
Part of the problem was financial, since most professors had to pay for their research expenditures out of their meagre
salaries. Even at the Scottish universities, which were widely regarded as leaders in science education in Britain, few
nonmedical students had the opportunity to participate in laboratories or research. See Report of the Royal
Commissioners appointed to enquire into the Universities of Scotland: Returns and Documents, Parliamentary Papers
xxxv (1878): 336-340.

engineering. However, it might be expected that opportunities for a foreign education were also

correlated with a secure social and financial background.

         Table 4 shows that the rather privileged background of many of the British great inventors

is reflected in other dimensions of elite standing. Twenty nine percent of the inventors who were

active before 1820 had families who were connected to those in power or who were otherwise

distinguished. An interesting facet of the relationship between privilege, science, and

technological achievement in Britain is reflected in the ninety great inventors who were also

appointed as Fellows the Royal Society. The Royal Society was founded in 1660 as an "invisible

college" of natural philosophers who included Isaac Newton, Christopher Wren, Robert Hooke and

Robert Boyle. Fellows of the Society were elected and many of the members consisted of

individuals who were not professional scientists but who were wealthy or well-connected.33

Although the Royal Society was associated with the foremost advances in science, many of its

projects were absurd and impractical.34 The Royal Society was widely criticized for its elitist and

unmeritocratic policies.35 Great inventors Charles Babbage, William Sturgeon and William

Robert Grove were representative of those who publicly assailed the nepotism and corruption of

scientific institutions in the nineteenth century, and Babbage attributed a large part of the failure of

British science to the Royal Society.36 The Society long retained the character of a gentleman's

   Sir Joseph Banks, the president during the critical years between 1778 and 1820, supported the election of wealthy
patrons who might be persuaded to finance research efforts. See Marie Boas Hall, All Scientists Now: The Royal
Society in the nineteenth century, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984; and Michael Hunter, The Royal
Society and its Fellows, 1669-1700, the morphology of an early scientific institution, Oxford: British Society for the
History of Science, 1994.

   Babbage regretted that "in England, particularly with respect to the more difficult and abstract sciences, we are
much below other nations, not merely of equal rank, but below several even of inferior power. That a country,

club and, despite a series of reforms, did not become a genuine professional scientific organization

until after the 1870s. Even in 1860 more than 66 percent of its membership consisted of

nonscientists and medical practitioners, whose inclusion was not altogether merited on the basis of

their scientific contributions.37 In short, scarce human capital was not a significant factor in

important inventive activity during the period of early industrialization. Moreover, it is also

possible that the prevalence of professional backgrounds at the start of the twentieth century might

owe to the role of elites in British society, rather than to the contributions that specialized

knowledge made to technological innovation.



IV. PATENTS, PRODUCTIVITY AND MARKET INCENTIVES

Rostow had proposed the hypothesis that prospects for growth depended on specialized knowledge

inputs that were inelastic and in scarce supply. The data set of great inventors instead suggests that

science was only weakly related to technology in early industrialization. A more speculative

conclusion is that an elite background might have played some role in promoting distinction

among scientist-inventors in British society, with the possibility that such training did not

necessarily increase productivity at invention relative to other great inventors. Some researchers

further suggest that, especially during the early stages of industrialization, scientists were not

sensitive to market factors, which would imply that they would tend to respond inelastically to

economic conditions. This section therefore uses patent records through 1890 to compare



eminently distinguished for its mechanical and manufacturing ingenuity, should be indifferent to the progress of
inquiries which form the highest departments of that knowledge on whose more elementary truths its wealth and rank
depend, is a fact which is well deserving the attention of those who shall inquire into the causes that influence the
progress of nations." In 1831 disillusioned scientists founded the British Association for the Advancement of Science
as a more open alternative to the Royal Society.
37
   According to Dorothy Stimson, Scientists and Amateurs: A History of the Royal Society, New York: H. Schuman,
1948, p. 236: "The change came by evolution rather than by revolution and took a good many years to become fully
effective. As late as 1860 there were 330 Fellows who were scientists and 300 who were not. Also, in 1860, 117 of
that group of 330 scientist Fellows were physicians and surgeons, an overwhelming proportion of medical men which
had been characteristic of the Society's membership from the first."

productivity at invention among scientists and nonscientists, and the extent to which scientist

inventors were responsive to market incentives.

         Patent records have well-known flaws as a gauge of invention, but they have still proved to

be valuable in identifying the sources of variation over time and place in the rate, organization, and

direction of inventive activity.38 Table 5 shows that approximately 87 percent of the British

sample of great inventors were patentees. Charles Wheatstone reported that "some thought it not

quite consistent with the habits of a scientific man to be concerned in a patent," but it is noticeable

that the proportion of patentees is similar across all science classes, whether proxied by

educational background, scientific eminence, or membership in the premier Royal Society. 39 In

the case of the United States, where patent institutions were extremely favourable to inventors of

all classes, almost all (97 percent) great inventors chose to obtain patent protection for their

inventions. The British great inventors overall exhibit a somewhat lower propensity to patent, but

this seems more related to institutional factors that affected all inventors, rather than to scientific

disdain for material returns.

         In particular, there is a marked increase in the propensity to patent after 1851. This period

stands out because in 1852 the British patent laws were reformed in the direction of the American

system in ways that increased access to patent institutions, and strengthened the security of

property rights in patents. Significant aspects of the institutional overhaul included lower patent

38
   For a pioneering study see Jacob Schmookler, Invention and Economic Growth, Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard
University Press, 1966. Zvi Griliches, “Patent Statistics as Economic Indicators: A Survey,” Journal of Economic
Literature, Vol. 28, No. 4 (December 1990) :1661–1707, discusses the costs and benefits of analyzing patents. The
major problems with patent statistics as a measure of inventive activity and technological change are that not all
inventions are patented or can be patented; the propensity to patent differs across time, industries and activities;
patents vary in terms of intrinsic and commercial value; patents might not be directly comparable across countries or
time because of differences in institutional features and enforcement; and patents are a better gauge of inputs than
productivity or output. Griliches concludes (p. 43) that “In spite of all the difficulties, patent statistics remain a unique
resource for the analysis of the process of technical change. Nothing else even comes close in the quantity of available
data, accessibility, and the potential industrial, organizational, and technological detail.” For an excellent example of
the way in which patent records can be adjusted to yield economically meaningful information, see Adam B. Jaffe and
Manuel Trajtenberg, Patents, Citations and Innovations: a Window on the Knowledge Economy, Cambridge, Mass.:
MIT Press (2002).

fees, the administration was rationalized, and measures were undertaken to enhance the provision

and dissemination of information. In 1883, further improvements in the rules and standards were

introduced and the fees fell again. The reforms provide a natural experiment to determine the

extent of supply elasticity of great inventions and their variation across knowledge inputs. If great

inventors in general, and scientists in particular, differed from ordinary patentees in terms of their

responsiveness or commercial orientation, then we would expect their patterns of patenting to be

largely unaffected by these institutional changes. Instead, Figure 3 supports the view that the great

inventors -- scientists and nonscientists alike -- responded to the decrease in monetary and

transactions costs (and potential rise in net expected returns) by increasing their investments in

patented invention.

        The patent records also enable us to examine whether a science background increased

productivity at invention. Again, the patterns are consistent with the notion that at least until 1870

a background in science did not add a great deal to inventive productivity. If scientific knowledge

gave inventors a marked advantage, it might be expected that they would demonstrate greater

creativity at an earlier age than those without such human capital. Inventor scientists were

marginally younger than nonscientists, but both classes of inventors were primarily close to middle

age by the time they obtained their first invention (and note that this variable tracks inventions

rather than patents). Productivity in terms of average patents filed and career length are also

similar among all great inventors irrespective of their scientific orientation. Thus, the kind of

knowledge and ideas that produced significant technological contributions during British

industrialization seem to have been rather general and available to all creative individuals,

regardless of their scientific training.

Tables 7 and 8 show the relationship between inventive activity and different instruments for

specialized human capital. Table 7 examines variation in industrial specialization, or the fraction

                                                  18
of an inventor’s patents that were filed in a particular industry. The results show that

specialization was higher in the Northern counties such as Yorkshire, but this was largely because

of the concentration of industries. Technical education, or training in engineering and technology,

was associated with higher sectoral specialization. However, elite degrees from Oxford or

Cambridge, degrees in science, or publications of books and articles, all indicated lower tendencies

for specialization, and all of these variables added little to the overall explanatory power of the

model. These results are bolstered by the finding that such industries as agriculture and

construction were less likely to be specialized, whereas patents for textiles and the electrical

industries, as might be expected, went to inventors who were more specialized.

       Total career patents comprise another measure of human capital in inventive activity, since

inventors with greater numbers of patents would be more likely to have accumulated larger stocks

of knowledge through learning by doing. Career patents were higher in the South of England,

where markets were more extensive. The results for the patentee’s science and technology

knowledge are consistent with those for industrial specialization. Elite education, science degrees,

or research and development did not lead to higher patenting over an inventor’s career. Career

patents were higher for inventors who had engineering degrees but, as the descriptive statistics

indicated, engineering qualifications were prevalent only later in the century.

       The overall empirical findings together suggest that, by focusing their efforts in a particular

industry, relatively uneducated inventors were able to acquire sufficient knowledge that allowed

them to make valuable additions to the available technology set. After 1820, as the market

expanded and created incentives to move out of traditional industries such as textiles and engines,

both scientists and nonscientists responded by decreasing their specialization. The patent reforms

in 1852 encouraged the nonscience-oriented inventors to increase their investments in sectoral

specialization, but industrial specialization among the scientists lagged significantly. This is

                                                  19
consistent with the arguments of such scholars as Joel Mokyr, who argued that any comparative

advantage from familiarity with science was likely based on broad unfocused capabilities such as

rational methods of analysis that applied across all industries. The time path of specialization is

especially informative in terms of electrical and telecommunications technology, which required

more technical knowledge inputs than traditional areas such as textiles. Electrical innovation was

also heavily specialized across region, and two thirds of all related patented inventions were filed

by residents of London. The expansion in this industry after the 1870s was associated with a

greater marginal return for those with formal education, and this likely induced the substantive

specialization in this industry among scientist-inventors, as well as college-educated engineers.40

        The experience of the British great inventors also shed light on the reward systems that are

frequently recommended as substitutes for patents.41 Prizes and medals, in particular, might be

more effective inducements than patents if scientists were motivated by the desire simply for the

recognition of their peers and not by financial incentives. Between1826 to 1914 the Royal Society,

for example, awarded 173 medals, 67 of which were given for work in mathematics, astronomy

and experimental physics, and only two to engineers.42 However, many were disillusioned with

this award system, attributing outcomes to arbitrary factors such as personal influence, the

persistence of one's recommenders, or the self-interest of the institution making the award. The

timing also seemed ineffective, since the majority of premia were made later in life to those who

had already attained eminence. The likelihood that an inventor had received prizes and medals

40
   The Society of Telegraph Engineers (later the Institution of Electrical Engineers) was founded in London in 1871 by
eight men, and rapidly became one of the largest societies in Britain. Its membership rose from 352 in 1871 (8.5
percent of all enrollment in engineering institutions) to 2100 (14.0 percent) in 1890 and 4000 (17.2 percent) in 1910.
Even these professional institutions resisted formal education, and apprenticeships remained the favoured mode of
human capital acquisition among the engineering class examinations until the end of the 19 th century. See Buchanan,
1985.

was higher for unspecialized scientific men, moreso for those who had gained recognition as

famous scientists or Fellows of the Royal Society, or who had influential connections. Prizes and

medals tended to be awarded to the same individuals who had already received patents and,

indeed, prizes were associated with higher numbers of patents. The incremental value of these

awards was therefore likely to be somewhat low – not because scientists were unresponsive to

incentives, but because their response was higher for financial motivations. It is not surprising that

by 1900 the Council of the Royal Society decided to change its emphasis from the allocation of

medals to the financing of research.43

V. CONCLUSIONS

The generation of new technological innovations is one of the most crucial processes of economic

growth. What was the role of science, specialized knowledge and knowledge-generating

institutions in the creation of important technological inventions during British industrialization?

The evidence from the backgrounds and patenting of the great inventors in Britain suggest that

such forms of human capital did not play a significant role in the generation of new inventive

activity. Indeed, British science entered its golden age long after the advent of industrialization

and, even as late as 1884, Francis Galton concluded that "an exhaustive list" of scientists in the

British Isles "would amount to 300, but not to more."44 Instead, during early industrialization the

evidence regarding technical knowledge of all kinds comported more with James Nasmyth's

definition of engineering as "common sense applied to the use of materials."45



43
   The Council stated that its experience in the award of medals had revealed that adding to the number of such awards
would be "neither to the advantage of the Society nor in the interests of the advancement of Natural Knowledge."

   See English Men of Science, London: Macmillan, 1874. Galton, p. 6, added that "Some of my readers may feel
surprise that so many as 300 persons are to be found in the United Kingdom who deserve the title of scientific men..."
According to William Ramsay, Presidential Address of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,
(Science, 34 (Sept) 1911: 289-304), "The middle of the nineteenth century will always be noted as the beginning of the
golden age of science."

         These patterns may have owed in part to the character of the British educational system

which largely restricted access to higher education to the privileged classes in the nineteenth

century.46 The evidence on educational institutions is particularly striking when one contrasts the

British experience to the United States. College graduates from elite universities, especially those

in science and technical fields, were generally better represented among great inventors in Britain

than in the U.S. There were stark differences in the distribution of education attainments, as well

as in the class backgrounds of those who were able to go to college, between the two countries.

College education was not so prevalent among the US inventors until quite late in the 19th century,

but graduates were drawn from a much broader range of social classes (judging from the

occupations of the fathers). Thus, it is likely that the proportion of great inventors who were

scientists in the UK actually overstate the importance of a science education for making a

significant contribution to technological knowledge. Despite the advantages that people from their

class backgrounds had at invention, scientists were not well-represented among the great British

inventors nor among patentees during the height of industrial achievements.

         Economic historians of Britain have pointed out that its early economic growth was

unbalanced and productivity advances were evident in only a few key sectors. Moreover,

significant increases in total factor productivity growth were not experienced until the middle of

the nineteenth century. The reasons for these patterns have not been fully elaborated on. Here we

highlighted the generation of knowledge inputs, and the elitist institutions that hampered their full


46
   Donald Cardwell, The Development of Science and Technology in Nineteenth-Century Britain, Ashgate: Variorum
2003 attributes a scarcity of scientists to failures of the educational system. Reports from a number of Royal
Commissions – including the Samuelson (1868 and 1882) and Devonshire (1878) Commissions --- outlined the
inadequacy of British science and its institutions of scientific and technical training. Enrollments in science classes at
the secondary school level were "negligible;" and university science was "seriously deficient in quantity and quality."
Despite the frequent investigations by Commissions of this sort, reform was "miserably slow." (Gowing, 1978)
Sir Eric Ashby, Technology and the Academics, p 7, considered British academic science to be "dogmatic and
dessicated" until after the middle of the nineteenth century. Peter Alter, The Reluctant Patron: Science and the State in
Britain,1850-1920, New York: Berg, 1987, points to the equally limited role of the state in encouraging science. The
state was involved in the establishment of the National Physical Laboratory, the Imperial College of Science and
Technology, and the Medical Research Committee, but a significant role for state funding awaited the first World War.

attainment during the critical period of industrialization. The oligarchic nature of British society

likely limited the size of the market, suppressed the acquisition of human capital through

educational institutions, and arguably encouraged rules and standards that discriminated against

the efforts of disadvantaged members of society. Technological inventiveness and progress

responded to incentives, and were likely inhibited by such factors. Whatever the underlying

reasons, the transformations that made science and technical backgrounds crucial to the creation of

important inventions were not achieved until the end of the nineteenth century.

       More generally, the experience of the First Industrial Nation indicates that creativity that

enhances economic efficiency is somewhat different from additions to the most advanced technical

discoveries. The sort of creativity that led to spurts in economic and social progress comprised

insights that were motivated by perceived need and by institutional incentives. In the twenty-first

century, specialized human capital and scientific knowledge undoubtedly enhance and precipitate

economic growth in the developed economies. However, for developing countries with scarce

human capital resources, such inputs at the frontier of “high technology” might be less relevant

than the ability to make incremental adjustments that can transform existing technologies into

inventions that are appropriate for the domestic conditions. As Thomas Jefferson pointed out, a

small innovation that can improve the lives of the mass of the population might be more

economically important than a large technological discovery that benefits only the few.

Notes: The observations include all patents filed by the great inventors through 1930, and therefore
understates the number of patents in the final period. The dependent variable measures the highest
percentage of an inventor’s patents that were filed in a single sector. The excluded region comprises
the Southern counties of England. Prizes indicate whether or not the inventor received an award for
technological achievements. Publications include academic articles and books. Post-patent reforms
is a dummy variable for the period after 1852.

Notes: The observations include all patents filed by the great inventors through 1930, and therefore
understates the number of patents in the final period. The dependent variable measures the total
stock of patents filed by an inventor during his lifetime. The excluded region comprises the
Southern counties of England. Prizes indicate whether or not the inventor received an award for
technological achievements. Publications include academic articles and books. Post-patent reforms
is a dummy variable for the period after 1852.
