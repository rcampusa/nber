Introduction

       The nation‚Äôs spending for prescription drugs has grown dramatically in recent
years (see Figure 1). Even when controlling for general inflation, there has been a
dramatic increase in drug spending, especially since the mid-1980s.
       A recent study by the Barents Group for the National Institute for Health Care
Management (1999) attempted to measure the relative importance of different
factors in the growth of drug spending. In general, the study split inflation into two
categories: ‚Äúutilization‚Äù effects and ‚Äúprice‚Äù effects. Each of these effects were further
split between older drugs (drugs that entered the market before 1992) and new drugs
(drugs that entered the market in 1992 or later).
       As Table 1 indicates, the study reported that increased utilization accounted for
about one third of spending growth.1 If price levels and the mix of prices had not
changed between 1993 and 1998, 36 percent of the total spending growth would still have
occurred as a result of the increased number of prescriptions. Increased utilization of
newer drugs contributed almost twice as much as utilization of older drugs to this
increase.
       The study found that about two thirds of spending growth from 1993 to 1998 was
attributable to price. Of this portion, 22 percentage points were attributable to pure price
increases for older drugs. Another 42 percentage points reflected the fact that newer
drugs cost more than older drugs: the study estimated that the average 1998 price for
drugs introduced in 1992 or later was $71.49 per prescription, compared to $30.47 for
previously existing drugs. This difference reflects higher initial introduction prices as
well as price increases after introduction.
   Thus the Barents study found that the replacement of older drugs by newer, more
expensive, drugs was the single most important reason for rapidly increasing drug
expenditure. But as noted in Report to the President: Prescription Drug Coverage,
Spending, Utilization, and Prices (Department of Health & Human Services, April 2000),
                                                                                              3


the Barents study ‚Äúdid not attempt to measure how much of this difference [between new
and old drug prices] reflects changes in quality as better, newer drugs replace older, less
effective medications.‚Äù
     This paper seeks to fill that gap, i.e. to provide evidence about differences in quality
between new and old drugs (prescribed for given conditions). We hypothesize that, in
general, new drugs within a class or for a given diagnosis are of higher quality than old
drugs, and that this increase may have a number of impacts, including reduced mortality,
reduced morbidity, and reduced expenditure on other medical services, such as inpatient
stays and emergency room visits
     The hypothesis that drug quality is inversely related to drug age is consistent with
‚Äúquality ladder‚Äù models of innovation. Grossman and Helpman (1991, p. 84) describe
the key features of these models2:


       Technological progress stems from costly investments undertaken by profit-
       seeking agents. Entrepreneurs‚Ä¶attempt to develop superior versions of [goods
       that they see on the market]. When successful in the research lab, an innovator
       creates a new ‚Äústate of the art‚Äù that captures market share at the expense of a
       previous generation product. Growth will be sustained if commercial R&D
       remains an economically viable activity so that the average quality of industrial
       products continues to rise‚Ä¶Innovative goods are better than older products
       simply because they provide more ‚Äúproduct services‚Äù in relation to their cost of
       production.


       If the quality of new drugs is higher than that of old drugs, the ‚Äúquality-adjusted
price‚Äù of new drugs may be lower than that of old drugs, even though the unadjusted
price is higher. Cutler et al (1996) found that the average cost of treating heart-attack
patients increased from $11,175 in 1984 to $14,772 in 1991. Most of this increase was
due to a shift from older treatment regimens (medical management and catheterization) to


1
 Part of this increase is due to the aging of the population: as Figure 2 shows,
pharmaceutical consumption is strongly positively related to age, and the share of the
population over the age of 65 increased from 8.1% in 1950 to 12.7% in 1997.
                                                                                                   4


newer, more expensive regimens (angioplasty and bypass surgery). While mean treatment
cost increased at an average annual rate of 4.5%, life expectancy following a heart attack
increased by 8 months‚Äîfrom 62 to 70 months‚Äîduring this period. Cutler et al showed
that if the shift to newer treatment regimens were entirely responsible for the increase in
life expectancy, and the value of a life-year is $25,000, then the shift actually reduced
the ‚Äúcost-of-living index‚Äù‚Äîa far more meaningful measure of inflation than the change
in average treatment price‚Äîby 1.1% per year.
          In this paper, we will analyze prescribed medicine event-level data (linked to
person- and condition-level data) from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
(MEPS) to provide evidence about the effect of drug age‚Äîthe number of years since the
drug‚Äôs active ingredient was first approved by the FDA--on mortality, morbidity, and
total medical expenditure, controlling for a number of characteristics of the individual
and the event.


Methodology


          To assess the effect that the age of the drug prescribed for a given condition has
on mortality, morbidity, and total medical expenditures incurred to treat the condition,
ideally one would like to randomly assign drugs of different ages to patients with that
condition, and observe their outcomes and expenditures. Unfortunately, I was unable to
conduct a large-scale experiment in which drugs of different ages were randomly
assigned to people. Nevertheless, given the nature of the data-generating process and of
the data available, I believe that a properly-specified model will enable me to make valid
inferences about the effects of drug age.
          To evaluate the effect of drug quality, or age, on medical expenditure and
outcomes, there must be a significant amount of exogenous, random variation in
prescribing behavior. The health economics literature suggests that, in general, medical
practice variation is pervasive and sizeable. If 10 doctors saw a patient with given set of
symptoms, conditions, and characteristics, it is highly unlikely that they would prescribe
the same medications for him. Although practice variation may be undesirable from a

                                                                                                      5


medical perspective, it is advantageous econometrically, since it facilitates identification
of the effect of drug choice on the variables of interest.3
        It would surely be a mistake, however, to think that all or perhaps even most of
the variation in drugs prescribed for a given condition is random, i.e. uncorrelated with
attributes of the individual and/or his condition that may influence outcomes and non-
drug medical expenditures. If determinants of outcomes and non-drug expenditure are
correlated with the age of the drug prescribed and we fail to control for them, we will
obtain biased estimates of the effect of drug age on outcomes and expenditures. For
example, if more-educated people tend to receive newer drugs and (for unrelated reasons)
also tend to have fewer hospital stays, if we don‚Äôt control for education we will
overestimate the effect of drug age on hospital stays.
        While omission of some variables (like education) is likely to result in
overstatement of the effect of drug age on hospital stays, the omission of others seems
likely to result in understatement of this effect. Suppose that, among people with a given
medical condition, the most severely ill are both more likely to receive the newest, most
expensive, drugs and more likely to be hospitalized. Failure to control for (untreated)
severity of illness‚Äîwhich is difficult to do, in practice‚Äîwould then bias the drug-age
coefficient towards zero. The net effect of plausible omitted-variables biases appears to
be ambiguous, a priori.
        Fortunately, the MEPS data enable us to control for many important attributes of
the individual, condition, and prescription that influence outcomes and non-drug
expenditures and that may be correlated with drug age. These include sex, age,
education, race, income, insurance status (whether the person is covered by private
insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid), who paid for the drug, the condition for which the
drug was prescribed, how long the person has had the condition, and the number of
medical conditions reported by the person. The first approach we will use to determine



3
  Significant geographical variation in treatment patterns was first documented by Wennberg and his
colleagues (1982), who studied New England hospital markets. Other investigators have corroborated this
finding in many other settings. For example, McPherson et al (1982) documented substantial variation in
the use of common surgical procedures in New England, England, and Norway. As Folland et al (2001, p.
216) observe, ‚Äúdifferences in treatment patterns across small areas may occur because of physicians‚Äô
uncertainty and ignorance over the best medical practice.‚Äù
                                                                                             6


the ceteris paribus effect of drug age on outcomes and expenditure will be to include, in a
very nonrestrictive fashion, all of these factors as covariates in models of the form:


Yij = Œ≤ ln(AGE_DRUGij) + Œ∑ f(INCOMEj) + ¬µ MALEj + Œ£h Œ∏h CONDITIONijh + Œ£y œày

where:


Yij = one of the following variables associated with the ith prescription consumed by
person j


‚Ä¢   Mortality: whether person j died by the end of the survey period
‚Ä¢   Morbidity indicators: whether person j missed work or school days or spent days in
    bed due to the condition for which prescription i was consumed
‚Ä¢   The number of, and expenditure on, non-drug medical events, by type, associated
    with the condition (inpatient hospital stays, emergency-room visits, office-based
    visits, outpatient department visits, dental visits, home health visits, other medical
    expenditure events)


AGE_DRUGi = the number of years prior to 1996 that the active ingredient in
prescription i consumed by person j was first approved by the FDA


INCOMEj = the income of the person consuming the prescription


MALEj = 1 if the person consuming the prescription is male, otherwise zero


CONDITIONijh = 1 if the ith prescription consumed by person j is prescribed for
condition (ICD9 3-digit diagnosis) h (h = 1, 2,‚Ä¶, 496), otherwise zero

COND_DURijy = 1 if the condition for which the ith prescription consumed by person j
began y years ago, otherwise zero


RACEjk = 1 if the person consuming the prescription is of race k (k = 1, 2,‚Ä¶,6),
otherwise zero


INSURANCEjm = 1 if the person consuming the prescription has health insurance status
(e.g. private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, no insurance) m, otherwise zero


AGEjn = 1 if the person consuming the prescription is n years old (n = 0, 1, 2,‚Ä¶,99),

Œµij = the disturbance.


While eq. (1) appears to control for many potentially relevant determinants of Y that may
be correlated with AGE_DRUG, the fact that many individuals in the sample have both
multiple medical conditions4 and multiple prescriptions means that we can control for all
individual characteristics‚Äîboth observed and unobserved‚Äîby pursuing a second
approach. This involves estimating a model that includes ‚Äúindividual effects‚Äù (Œ∑j‚Äòs):


Yij = Œ∑j + Œ≤ ln(AGE_DRUGij) + Œ£h Œ∏h CONDITIONijh
                         + Œ£y Œªy COND_DURijy + Œ£n œÄn + Œµi                          (2)

  Almost 2/3 of the people in the sample have 2 or more conditions. Almost 95% of the
conditions are experienced by people who have more than one condition. Figure 3 shows
the distribution of people in the MEPS sample, by number of reported medical
conditions.
                                                                                                8


Estimates of the parameter of interest (Œ≤) from eq. (2) are based entirely on the within-
individual correlation between Y and AGE_DRUG, not on the between-individual
correlation.5 Suppose a person has two conditions, asthma and hypertension, and is
taking medications for both. He may have above-average numbers of hospital stays for
both conditions, compared to other individuals with the same conditions. And he may be
taking older-than-average drugs for both conditions. But due to the presence of
individual effects in eq. (2), this would not make Œ≤ positive. For Œ≤ to be positive, it
would have to be the case that the condition for which the age of the person‚Äôs
medications were more above average (relative to both individual and condition means)
was the same as the condition for which his hospital stays were more above average.


MEPS data


       We will estimate equations (1) and (2) using data from the 1996 Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a nationally representative survey of health care use,
expenditures, sources of payment, and insurance coverage for the U.S. civilian
noninstitutionalized population. MEPS is co-sponsored by the Agency for Health Care
Research and Quality and the National Center for Health Statistics. This survey is
designed to yield comprehensive data that estimate the level and distribution of health
care use and expenditures, monitor the dynamics of the health care delivery and insurance
systems, and assess health care policy implications.6
       The MEPS Household Component collects extremely detailed data from 22,061
people on use and expenditures for office and hospital-based care, home health care,
dental services, vision aids, and prescribed medicines. MEPS contains three kinds of data,
i.e. data at three different levels of aggregation: the person level, the condition level (77
thousand conditions), and the event level. A person may have several conditions (e.g.,
hypertension, diabetes, and glaucoma); a given condition may be associated with a

 The Œ∑j‚Äòs capture all attributes of the individual that do not vary across prescriptions and
conditions, including sex, age, education, race, income, insurance status, and the number
of medical conditions reported by the person.

number of events. Figure 4 indicates the linkages between events, conditions, and
persons. Table 2 shows the number of events, by type, and their associated average
expenditures.
        As indicated by eqs. (1) and (2), the unit of observation in our analysis is a
prescribed-medicine event. The MEPS Prescribed Medicine Event file contains 171,587
observations. The file reveals the amount paid for the prescription, by source of
payment, and the National Drug Code, from which we determined (by linking to other
pharmaceutical databases) the year in which the active ingredient was first approved by
the FDA. Figure 5 depicts the frequency distribution of MEPS prescriptions, by the date
the active ingredient was first approved by the FDA. About ¬º of prescriptions consumed
were for drugs approved before 1950; more than half of the drugs consumed in 1996
were approved before 1980. Table 3 shows the drug classes with the largest number of
prescriptions in 1996.
        Over 90% of the prescriptions are linked to exactly one medical condition.7 The
1996 Medical Conditions file contains summary information about these medical
conditions, including:


    ‚Ä¢   When the condition began
    ‚Ä¢   Whether the person with the condition died by the end of the survey period
    ‚Ä¢   Whether the person missed any work days due to the condition
    ‚Ä¢   Whether the person missed any school days due to the condition
    ‚Ä¢   Whether the person spent any days in bed due to the condition
    ‚Ä¢   The number of home health events associated with the condition
    ‚Ä¢   The number of dental events associated with the condition
    ‚Ä¢   The number of hospital events associated with the condition
    ‚Ä¢   The number of outpatient events associated with the condition
    ‚Ä¢   The number of office-based events associated with the condition
    ‚Ä¢   The number of emergency room events associated with the condition

The Medical Conditions file does not report the amount of expenditure associated with
each of these event types. However expenditure (and charges) associated with each
condition, by event type, can be computed from the records contained in the respective
medical event files.8 For example, one can compute total hospital expenditure associated
with individual x‚Äôs hypertension. In addition to calculating expenditure, by event type,
we calculated total non-drug expenditure, i.e. the sum of expenditures on the six event
types listed above.


Empirical Results


       Estimates of the parameter Œ≤ from equations (1) and (2) are presented in Table 4.
We discuss first the estimates of Œ≤ from eq. (1), which controls for observed individual
attributes such as age and education but excludes individual effects. The first dependent
variable we consider is the amount paid for the prescription. The coefficient on
ln(DRUG_AGE), Œ≤, is negative and highly significant, confirming the finding of previous
studies (e.g. National Institute for Health Care Management Research and Educational
Foundation (1999)) that new drugs are more expensive than old drugs prescribed for the
same condition. A unit decrease of ln(DRUG_AGE)‚Äîwhich would occur, for example,
if a 15 year-old drug were replaced by a 5.5 year-old drug‚Äîwould increase the cost of
the prescription by about $18.
       The second dependent variable we consider is a mortality indicator: a dummy
variable equal to 1 if the person had died by the end of round 3 of the survey, and
otherwise equal to zero. The mortality rate in this sample is quite low‚Äîonly 0.28% (65)
of the 23,230 persons died by the end of round 3. This would seem to make it very
difficult to detect any effect of drug age on mortality. But recall that the unit of
observation in our analysis is a prescription, not a person, and the fraction of observations
in which mortality occurs is higher than 0.28%. People with more prescriptions and more

  5.3% are linked to more than one condition; 4.4% are not linked to any condition.

  The CLNK file contains the variables needed to link records in the MEPS 1996 event
files to records in the MEPS 1996 condition file.
                                                                                         11


conditions have a higher probability of death. The fraction of conditions in which
mortality occurs is almost twice as high‚Äî0.48% (371 out of 76,602).
       The estimates indicate that people consuming new drugs were significantly less
likely to die by the end of round 3 than people consuming older drugs, controlling for all
of the covariates included in eq. (1). A unit decrease of ln(DRUG_AGE) is estimated to
have decreased the probability of dying by 0.10 percentage points.
       This finding is quite consistent with more aggregate (disease-level) evidence I
presented in an earlier paper (Lichtenberg (2000)). There I analyzed the relationship
across diseases between the long-term reduction in life-years lost before age 75 and the
relative utilization of new pharmaceutical products. I found a highly significant positive
relationship across diseases between the new drug share and mortality reduction in all
three periods I analyzed. Over 45 percent of the variation across diseases in the 1970-91
reduction in mortality was explained by the new drug share. Each new drug approved
during the period 1970-91 was estimated to have saved 11,200 life-years in 1991.
       Next we consider morbidity indicators. The fractions of conditions associated
with any work-loss-, school-loss-, and bed-days, were as follows:


                     Work-loss days       14.7 %
                     School-loss days      9.0 %
                     Bed days             14.0 %
                                                                                            12


The coefficient on ln(DRUG_AGE) is insignificant in the school-loss days equation and
only marginally significant in the bed-days equation. But the estimates of the work-loss
days equation indicate that people consuming new drugs were significantly less likely to
experience work-loss days than people consuming old drugs. This effect is highly
statistically significant, but does not seem very large. A unit decrease in
ln(DRUG_AGE), which would increase the cost of the prescription by $18, would reduce
the probability of any work-loss days by 0.0040. If the increase in prescription cost were
to be justified solely on the basis of reduced work-loss days, the average cost of work-
loss episodes would have to exceed $4500 (=$18/.0040). However we have already
found evidence of one other benefit of newer drugs‚Äîreduced mortality‚Äîand we have
yet to consider another potential benefit: reduced expenditures on other medical inputs.
       We now present estimates of the effect of drug age on utilization of and
expenditure on various non-drug medical events, by type. The first event type we
consider is hospital stays, the single most costly type, accounting for almost 42% of total
medical expenditure. The coefficient on ln(DRUG_AGE) in the equation explaining the
number of hospital stays associated with the condition is positive and highly significant
(t=3.68), indicating that people consuming new drugs had significantly fewer hospital
stays than people consuming old drugs. A unit decrease in ln(DRUG_AGE) would
reduce the expected number of hospital stays by .0059: replacing 1000 old prescriptions
with 1000 new prescriptions‚Äîwhich would increase drug costs by $18,000--would
reduce the number of hospital stays by 5.9. Since average expenditure on a hospital stay
is $7588, one might expect a reduction in hospital expenditure of $44,469 (=5.9 *
$7588). However the regression of a person‚Äôs actual hospital expenditures associated
with a condition indicates an even larger reduction in hospital expenditure from the use of
newer drugs: the implied hospital cost reduction is $55,824. Use of newer drugs is
evidently associated with less expensive (shorter), as well as fewer, hospital stays.
       As before, this finding is quite consistent with more aggregate (disease-level)
evidence I presented in an earlier paper (Lichtenberg (1996)). In that paper I examined
the effect of changes in the quantity and type of pharmaceuticals prescribed by physicians
on rates of hospitalization, surgical procedure, mortality, and related variables. The unit
of analysis was a (ICD9 2-digit) disease or diagnosis, which we argued is analogous to a
                                                                                            13


product (or industry) in industrial organization economics. We controlled for the
presence of "fixed (diagnosis) effects" by analyzing growth rates of the variables, using a
database on diagnosis-level inputs and outcomes at two points in time (1980 and 1991 or
1992). Our principal findings were: (1) The number of hospital stays, bed-days, and
surgical procedures declined most rapidly for those diagnoses with the greatest increase
in the total number of drugs prescribed and the greatest change in the distribution of
drugs. The estimates imply that an increase of 100 prescriptions is associated with 1.48
fewer hospital admissions, 16.3 fewer hospital days, and 3.36 fewer inpatient surgical
procedures. (2) Greater quantity and novelty of pharmaceuticals had a negative impact
on average length of stay in hospitals, as well as on the number of hospital stays. (3) A
$1 increase in pharmaceutical expenditure is associated with a $3.65 reduction in hospital
care expenditure (ignoring any indirect cost of hospitalization).
        The estimates indicate that reductions in drug age tend to reduce all types of non-
drug medical expenditure, although as the following table indicates, the reduction in
inpatient expenditure is by far the largest.


                                   Estimated expenditure

                                   decrease in                expenditure
Event type                         ln(DRUG_AGE)               reduction
Inpatient events                                       $55.82       78.5%
Outpatient department events                               $9.05         12.7%
Office-based events                                        $3.11          4.4%
Emergency room events                                      $2.63          3.7%
Dental events                                              $0.47          0.7%
Total                                                    $71.09          100.0%
The total estimated reduction in non-drug expenditure from a unit decrease in
ln(DRUG_AGE) is $71.09. This reduction in non-drug expenditure is much greater than
the increase in prescription cost ($18.00), so reducing the age of the drug results in a
substantial net reduction in the total cost of treating the condition.
        The estimates in the second column of Table , which are based on models that
include individual effects, are quite similar, broadly speaking, to the estimates in the first
                                                                                                        14


column, which are based on models without individual effects.9 They also suggest that
people consuming new drugs were significantly less likely to experience work-loss days
than people consuming old drugs, although the estimated effect is about 30% smaller.
The estimated effect of ln(DRUG_AGE) on total non-drug expenditure to treat the
condition is almost identical--$72.22‚Äîbut the distribution of cost reduction by event type
is somewhat different. When individual effects are included, the reduction in inpatient
expenditure accounts for an even higher proportion (89%) of the total reduction in non-
drug expenditures.
         To summarize, estimates of both eq. (1), which controls for many observed
characteristics of the person, condition, and prescription, and eq, (2), which controls for
all individual attributes (both observed and unobserved), indicate that people taking
newer drugs are likely to have significantly lower medical expenditures and have fewer
work-loss days than people taking older drugs for the same condition. The first equation
also indicates that mortality is lower among people taking newer drugs.
         It is sometimes suggested that, because generic drugs tend to be less expensive
than branded drugs, allowing people to use only generic drugs might be an effective
means of reducing health expenditure. As the following table shows, generic drugs tend
to be much older than branded drugs.


              % of            mean age (in
              prescriptions years) in 1996
Branded drugs           60.0%              23
Generic drugs                  40.0%                       38
All drugs                     100.0%                       29


Suppose that, instead of consuming the actual mix of 60% branded and 40% generic
drugs, people had to consume only generic drugs. This would increase the mean age of
drugs consumed by 31%, from 29 years to 38 years. Our estimates indicate that denying

  Unlike the morbidity and expenditure variables, the mortality variable does not exhibit any within-
individual variation‚Äîthe cause of death is not indicated‚Äîso we are unable to estimate the mortality
equation with individual effects.

people access to branded drugs would increase total treatment costs, not reduce them,
and would lead to worse outcomes.


Conclusions

   The nation‚Äôs spending for prescription drugs has grown dramatically in recent years.
Previous studies have shown that the replacement of older drugs by newer, more
expensive, drugs is the single most important reason for this increase, but they did not
attempt to measure how much of the difference between new and old drug prices reflects
changes in quality as better, newer drugs replace older, less effective medications.
        In this paper, we analyzed prescribed medicine event-level data (linked to
person- and condition-level data) from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
(MEPS) to provide evidence about the effect of drug age on mortality, morbidity, and
total medical expenditure, controlling for a number of characteristics of the individual
and the event. (Previous researchers have hypothesized that differences in treatment
patterns across individuals and areas may occur because of physicians‚Äô uncertainty and
ignorance over the best medical practice.) The MEPS data enable us to control for many
important attributes of the individual, condition, and prescription that influence outcomes
and non-drug expenditures and that may be correlated with drug age. These include sex,
age, education, race, income, insurance status, who paid for the drug, the condition for
which the drug was prescribed, how long the person has had the condition, and the
number of medical conditions reported by the person. Indeed, the fact that many
individuals in the sample have both multiple medical conditions and multiple
prescriptions means that we can control for all individual characteristics‚Äîboth observed
and unobserved‚Äîby including ‚Äúindividual effects‚Äù.
       The results provide strong support for the hypothesis that the replacement of older
by newer drugs results in reductions in mortality, morbidity, and total medical
expenditure. Although the mortality rate in this sample is quite low‚Äîmaking it difficult
to detect any effect of drug age on mortality‚Äîwe found that people consuming new
drugs were significantly less likely to die by the end of the survey than people consuming
older drugs. As to morbidity, we found that people consuming new drugs were
                                                                                               16


significantly less likely to experience work-loss days than people consuming old drugs,
although the estimated effect was not very large.
        The estimates indicated that reductions in drug age tend to reduce all types of
non-drug medical expenditure, although the reduction in inpatient expenditure is by far
the largest. The total estimated reduction in non-drug expenditure from reducing the age
of the drug is almost four times as large as the increase in drug expenditure, so reducing
the age of the drug results in a substantial net reduction in the total cost of treating the
condition.
        It is sometimes suggested that, because generic drugs tend to be less expensive
than branded drugs, allowing people to use only generic drugs might be an effective
means of reducing health expenditure. However generic drugs tend to be much older
than branded drugs, and our estimates indicate that denying people access to branded
drugs would increase total treatment costs, not reduce them, and would lead to worse
outcomes.
