                                           ABSTRACT

In the 1830s the British and American economies were hit by a series of shared macroeconomic

shocks. This paper investigates the role of markets for Americas State bonds in Britain and the U.S.

during and between the crises in 1837, 1839, and 1842. There is strong evidence that the crises in

1839 and 1842 originated in the U.S. and spread to Britain. There is also strong evidence that credit

markets for American state bonds were tighter in the U.S. than in London between 1839 and 1842.

       During the 1830s and 1840s, the British and American economies experienced a series of

shared macroeconomic fluctuations. A sharp financial crisis in May of 1837 was followed by a

brief recovery in 1838 and 1839. A second financial crisis in October of 1839, while less severe

than the panic in 1837, nonetheless produced a recession and deflation that lasted until 1843. A

third financial crisis, in the winter of 1842, affected primarily the United States, although

conditions continued to deteriorate in Britain through 1842 as well. The two economies were

closely linked by trade and finance, leading historians to speculate about the role of each country

in provoking the crises. Temin’s Jacksonian Economy attributes the Panic of 1837 and the Crisis

of 1839 to the Bank of England and international factors, absolving the Bank of the United

States, Nicholas Biddle (the bank’s president from 1823 to 1839), and President Andrew

Jackson. Biddle himself criticized the Bank of England for its policies in 1839, as did Jenks and

Hammond.1 On the other side, in A Study in Trade-Cycle History, Matthews concluded that ‘... it

is in the nature of things futile to try and draw any hard-and-fast line assigning to either country

causal primacy in the cycle as a whole or in its individual phases. But enough has been said in

the present chapter to indicate the powerful nature of forces making for instability from within

the United States in this period.’2

       The market for American state debts played a central role in financial relationships

between Britain and the United States in the 1830s. In the mid-1830s American states embarked

on a internal improvement boom, raising the amount of state debt outstanding from $81 million

in 1835 to $198 million in 1842. American states authorized and issued bonds worth $13

million in 1836, $21 million in 1837, $35 million in 1838, $22 million in 1839, $19 million in

1840, and $6 million in 1841. By 1841, estimates are that half of the $200 million in state debt
                                                  2

was held abroad, primarily in Britain.3 State bonds provided a critical link between financial

markets in the two countries. By 1836, state bonds were the only long-term American debt

instrument traded in Britain because the United States retired all its federal debt in 1835. The

single American corporation whose stock traded regularly in London was the Second Bank of

the United States, which lost its national charter in 1836. Millions of dollars of identical state

bonds traded in London, New York, and Philadelphia. Movements in bond prices give us a

window into the connections between British and American financial markets.

       The boom in state transportation and banking projects, and the associated wave of new

state bond issues, also play a critical role in our understanding of macroeconomic events. Temin

attributed the quick recovery of the American economy from the Panic of 1837 to state

expenditures for canals and railroads, financed largely by British lending. ‘The recession of

1837-38... was brought to a speedy end by the restoration of the capital flow from Britain to the

United States and by the expansion of demand stemming from the rise in state government

expenditures.’ Temin attributed the 1839 crisis to credit tightening by the Bank of England and

the long recession that followed to tightening markets in Britain for American state debts: ‘The

state projects initiated in the late 1830s had been started in the expectation of external [British]

financing.... Unfortunately, the new inflow of foreign capital did not continue [in 1839]... and

the manifold projects of the states were abandoned.’4 By the summer of 1842, eight states and

the Territory of Florida were in default on their debts, and Mississippi and Florida had

repudiated their bonds outright. The collapse of state credit was the most serious consequence of

the depression that began in 1839.5

       Our purpose here is to determine whether credit markets for American state bonds in and

between the three major financial crisis were tighter in the United States or in Britain, and

whether shocks to the bond markets originated in the United States or in London. We ask three

questions. First, were British and American financial markets well integrated? Not surprisingly,
                                                  3

we find that they were. Financial markets effectively arbitraged the prices of American state

bonds in London and the U.S. within a band attributable to the high transaction costs of trans-

Atlantic commerce in this period. Because markets were integrated we can ask whether the

pattern of bond price movements in the Crisis of 1839 and the Collapse of 1842 were consistent

with shocks originating in the United States, in Britain, or neither country. We find clear

evidence that shocks in both crises originated in the United States. Finally, we ask whether bond

price movements suggest that British investors were unwilling to lend to America after 1839.

We find that yields on American state bonds in 1840 and 1841 tended generally to be lower in

London than they were in the United States, suggesting that British lenders purchased American

state debt on favorable terms relative to lenders in New York and Philadelphia. The crises in

1839 and 1842 began in the United States, and between the two crises credit markets for state

debt in the United States demanded higher yields and paid lower prices on American state bonds

than did markets in London. We find little evidence that the market for state bonds collapsed

because of pressures emanating from Britain. In the final section of the paper we identify the

forces operating in America, neglected in virtually all accounts of this era, that produced the

collapse.

I. The History

       The early 1830s were a period of general economic expansion in both Britain and the

United States, marred by a brief recession in 1834. The expansion turned into a boom in 1835,

driven by a rapid increase in public land sales in the United States. The boom was reflected in

rising prices in both countries, an increase in international trade, and an increase in the flow of

capital from Britain to the United States. Prices stopped rising in early 1837, and a sharp break

in cotton prices combined with tight credit conditions in Britain and the United States to produce

a financial panic in May of 1837. In the United States the panic resulted in the suspension of
                                                   4

specie payments by banks throughout the country, and in Britain the failure or near failure of

several large commercial houses engaged in the American trade. The Bank of England did its

part to bring about the panic by raising the Bank Rate from 4 to 6 percent and, significantly, by

refusing to discount bills arising from the American trade in July of 1836. ‘A part of this action

was the absolute refusal of the Bank’s Liverpool Agent, no doubt under orders, to handle paper

drawn from America on those firms.’6 Figure 1 shows the Bank Rate, short term interest rates in

London and New York, and the New York price of 60 day bills payable in London.

       The effects of financial tightening were compounded in the United States by the decision

of the federal government to distribute the federal fiscal surplus of $36 million to the states in

1837, and by President Jackson’s specie circular requiring that all public land purchases be

redeemed in specie. The two measures together disrupted the normal allocation of gold reserves

within the banking system, further exacerbating the liquidity problems of New York banks

brought on by tightening international markets.7

       The Panic of 1837 was followed by a year of bank specie suspensions in the United

States, financial distress in Britain, deflation in both countries, and a sharp decline in the volume

of trade in 1838. But the recession was shortlived. By the fall of 1838 land sales, international

trade, prices, and capital flows had all turned up again. Banks in the United States resumed

specie payments in the summer of 1838. As Temin stressed, the quick recovery in the United

States was partly the result of fiscal stimulus created by the rapid expansion of state borrowing to

build canals, railroads, and banks. Mid-Atlantic states had been borrowing since the 1820s to

build canal networks, beginning with New York’s Erie Canal in 1817. In 1836 a second wave of

borrowing began, both in the older states – New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio – and

in a new group of states in the west – Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Arkansas, and Mississippi.

Table 1 provides debt authorized by year from 1830 to 1841.8 This was peacetime fiscal
                                                 5

expansion on a scale never witnessed in the young United States.

       The transportation boom, however, died quickly in the Northwest. Indiana, Illinois, and

Michigan all sold bonds on credit to eastern investment banks. These new states issued bonds

for which they were liable for interest payments immediately, but for which they would receive

payments only in installments.9 In July of 1839, the Morris Canal and Banking Company of

New Jersey defaulted on Indiana, and the state quickly was forced to curtail construction on its

network of canals and railroads. By the fall, Illinois and Michigan were forced to slow or stop

construction when investment banks defaulted on their obligations to the states. Land sales and

land values in these northwestern states had been rising steadily through the 1830s. When

transportation construction stopped, land values and property tax revenues began falling and, by

late 1839, it was apparent that these states would soon have trouble servicing their debts.10 In

January of 1841, Indiana was the first state to default on interest payments. Table 2 lists the

states that defaulted on interest payments, the date of default, whether the state resumed

payments or repudiated their debts, and if they resumed, the date of resumption.

       The collapse of internal improvement projects in the Northwest was not the only

economic problem in 1839. The Bank of England, again facing drains on its specie reserves,

began raising the Bank Rate in the summer (Figure 1). A crisis broke out in the United States

when the Bank of the United States of Pennsylvania (the BUSP) suspended specie payments in

October. This was followed by suspensions throughout the western and southern parts of the

United States, but not in New York and New England. As Hammond and Smith emphasize, the

BUSP’s immediate problem in 1839 was domestic, not foreign. Pressure from New York and

Boston banks forced the BUSP to suspend.11

       Although 1839 marked the end of the Northwestern transportation boom, New York,

Ohio, and Pennsylvania continued to authorize new debt issues for their canals (Table 1).

Despite rising interest rates, 1838, 1839, and 1840 were years of substantial state borrowing. We
                                                 6

can test Temin’s conjecture that the end of British willingness to lend to American states after

1839 brought on the crisis and contributed to the depression that followed. Figure 2 shows

average yields to maturity in the London market between 1831 and 1843 for the bonds of New

York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Massachusetts. Figure 3 provides similar

average yields in the United States for the bonds of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and

Illinois.12 Economic historians have tended to focus on the Panic of 1837, to pay some attention

to the Crisis of 1839, and to ignore the Collapse of 1842. The figure suggests we may have

missed the biggest crisis of them all. What happened in 1842?

II. Market Integration

       Figures 2 and 3 are constructed from data collected by Richard Sylla, Jack Wilson, and

Robert Wright (SWW).13 They gathered quotations on debt and equity prices from contemporary

newspapers in London, New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, and other American cities.14

Prices are available for American markets from the early 1790s up to the 1850s. Prices in

London are only available from 1811 to 1843. State government bonds typically traded in New

York, Philadelphia, and London, as well as in the regional market of issue (for example,

Maryland bonds in Baltimore and Massachusetts bonds in Boston). SWW list over 100 bonds

from 18 states trading at some point in London. Trading occurred in new issues and the

secondary market. Bonds traded actively for a few months after they were issued, but perhaps

because bonds were held mostly by long-term investors, relatively few bonds continued to trade

regularly in the secondary market. The most consistent series are available for New York,

Pennsylvania, and Ohio.

        New issues were marketed by the states themselves and through the agency of

investment banking intermediaries. Legislation authorizing bond issues typically required that

bonds be sold at par or better. The par restriction clearly applied to new issues marketed by
                                                    7

states, sometimes applied to issues by intermediaries, and never applied to the secondary

market.15 When prices in the secondary market dropped below par, states and their agents could

not sell new bonds at par. States could accurately claim that new bonds could not be sold in

New York or London, even when simultaneously there was an active secondary market in state

bonds in both markets. What states often failed to say is that there was no market for bonds with

par sales restrictions when the market price fell below par. The inability of states to market their

bonds was usually a function of their unwillingness (or their agents’ inability) to borrow at

higher interest rates. States that were willing to borrow at market rates could always borrow.

        Fortunately, most state bonds are reported with their yield and maturity, e.g., ‘New York

5's 1854.’ This enables us to calculate, for each individual bond, its yield to maturity.16 For each

state we calculate the average yield to maturity for all the bonds traded in each market, e.g.,

‘Ohio Bonds trading in New York.’ This is a simple average because there is no information

available on trading volumes to provide us with weights. There are often significant gaps in the

series, and some of the short-term fluctuation results from changes in the bonds reported in a

particular week. The ‘United States’ yields we quote for Ohio, New York, and Illinois bonds

come from the New York market, and for Pennsylvania bonds the yields are from the

Philadelphia market.

        Visual examination of the bond yields in Figures 2 and 3 suggests that the market for

state bonds in London and in the United States were closely related. To investigate the

relationship more formally, we ran a series of ARCH tests. Yit is log of the average bond yield in

country ‘i’ on date ‘t’, ai is the constant term for country i, and εit is the market specific

disturbance term:

(1) Yit = ai + εit
The errors in equation (1) follow a multivariate normal distribution with auto regressive

conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH):17
                                                  8

(2)    E(εit) = aij + bij E(εit-1εjt-1)
       The dependent variable, Yi is average yield to maturity (YTM) in market i, of bonds that

were commonly traded in both markets. The ai are constant terms measuring the log of the

average bond yield in each market. The aij estimate the constant element of the covariance

between yields in the two markets. In an integrated market the aij should be close to zero. The

bij estimate the effect of the lagged disturbances on the covariance between the prices in the two

markets. The bij measure whether the covariance of the disturbances are related to lagged

disturbances. That is, for example, whether last period’s errors in London affects this period’s

errors in New York. In an integrated market the bij should be close to one. If the errors in the

two markets were related, and they were, this is evidence that the two markets were integrated.

       The calculation of YTM of a bond requires the maturity, coupon rate and the weekly

prices of the bond, and there are missing observations on Y when not all of these data are

available. Missing observations can be dealt with in several ways. First, we linearly interpolate

for the unobserved data, and then run regressions using weekly and monthly data.18 Second,

monthly data contain far fewer missing observations and give us a check on the robustness of the

results using weekly data, but at a loss of significant number of observations. The monthly data

are realistic, however, given the time lags involved in the flow of information between the U.S.

and Britain in the early 19th century. Finally, we estimate a regression using only observed

weekly data, using our own method of analysis (described in the appendix) to account for

missing observations.

       The regression results are provided in Table 3. The first column uses the weekly sample

of linearly interpolated bond yields, the second column the monthly sample of linearly

interpolated yields, and the third column is based only on the observed monthly data using our

adjustment for missing observations. The results indicate strong evidence for integration. The

constant covariance of returns in the two markets, the aij , are very close to zero. The effect of
                                                 9

lagged disturbances on the covariance of returns, the bij, are positive and very close to one,

indicating that shocks to one market are quickly reflected in yields in the other market. These

results are unaffected by the use of linearly interpolated weekly or monthly data, or controlling

for the presence of missing observation in the design of the estimator.

       For comparison, Table 4 performs a similar exercise on stock price indexes in London

and in American markets. Missing observations are not a problem with the market indices. We

have run regressions on weekly prices, the change in weekly prices, and monthly prices. Unlike

the bond markets, where the underlying securities are the same in both markets, the equities

traded in the London market are different from the equities in the American markets. As with

the bond market, however, there is substantial evidence of market integration.

       Although the markets were well integrated, transacting between the two markets were not

costless. Differences in interest rates between London and New York of one half to a whole

percentage point in yields (100 basis points) often persisted for several months, longer than the

one to two-month time it took for news to travel across the ocean. We should not be surprised

by this, for in the 1830s bank notes of Philadelphia banks typically traded at a ¼ to ½ percent

discount in New York in times when there was no default risk. The discount merely reflected

the time and effort involved in presenting the bank note to the issuing bank for redemption. It

was possible for bond yields to be higher in New York than in London, but not too much higher.

III. American State Bonds in London and the United States:

       Figures 2 and 3 show the average yields of state bonds traded in London and the United

States, but disentangling what happened in the three financial crises requires examining states

individually. The five largest state borrowers were Pennsylvania, Louisiana, New York, Ohio,

and Maryland (Table 1). Louisiana and Maryland were not steady borrowers and we do not have

consistent records on their bond yields. New York began borrowing in 1817 and Ohio in 1825.
                                                 10

Both states completed their major canal projects in the early 1830s. Both states resumed

borrowing in 1837, and borrowed heavily and regularly through 1842. Hence, there are long and

fairly complete bond yields for those states before 1834 and after 1837, but only sporadic

information in 1835, 1836, and 1837. Pennsylvania began borrowing in the 1820s and continued

to borrow through the 1830s, so there are long and fairly complete records for Pennsylvania.

Illinois, Indiana, and Massachusetts did not begin borrowing heavily until 1837. We have only

sporadic quotations for those three states. We focus, therefore, our anaylsis on the bonds of New

York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

       Table 5 gives average bond yields to maturity for New York and Ohio bonds in both

London and the United States by year from 1831 to 1836 and by quarter from 1837 to 1843; the

standard deviation of the yields in each year; and the average difference in yields in the two

markets.19 Figures 4 and 6 graph weekly bond yields for New York and Ohio bonds in both

markets, and Figures 5 and 7 graph the contemporaneous U.S.-London difference in yields for

New York and Ohio bonds. Table 6 presents the same information for Pennsylvania bonds, as

well as the difference between the yield of Pennsylvania bonds in Philadelphia and the average

yield of New York and Ohio bonds in New York. Figures 8 and 9 graph Pennsylvania bond

yields in Philadelphia and London, and the U.S.-London difference in yields. Table 7 presents

the infrequently reported yields we have for Illinois, Massachusetts, and Indiana.

       The individual state series show the same pattern as the aggregate series: bond yields rise

gradually in 1837, rise sharply in the fall of 1839, and rise and fluctuate wildy in the winter of

1842. The spread in bond yields between the U.S. and London, however, moved differently in

each crisis. The bond yield spreads reflect how expectations and information differed in the

United States and London. To exploit the yield spreads, however, we first need to appreciate the
                                               11

situation in Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania:

       New York began the Erie Canal in 1817 and completed it in 1825; Ohio began

construction on two canals in 1825 and completed them in 1832; and Pennsylvania began work

on its canal system in 1826 and completed the Main Line in 1835. By 1836, the New York and

Ohio canals were returning revenues to the state Treasury in excess of operating costs and

interest payments, while the Pennsylvania canals were a financial disaster. Financial markets

priced the bonds of the three states accordingly. In the early 1830s, yields on Pennsylvania

bonds were consistently higher than the yields on New York and Ohio bonds, usually 0.5 percent

or more (Table 6, column 5).20

       Pennsylvania’s situation changed in 1836. When Nicholas Biddle lost the Bank War to

Andrew Jackson, the Bank of the United States sought a charter from the state of Pennsylvania.

In 1836, the BUS was rechartered as the Bank of the United States of Pennsylvania. The charter

was very generous to the state, including a promise by the BUSP to underwrite $6 to $8 million

in state bond issues:

       The Bank committed to pay an additional “twenty installments of $100,000 each,
       beginning June 1, 1836 and continuing for the next nineteen years, to pay $500,000 on
       March 3, 1837, to subscribe for various specifically designated public improvement
       stocks amounting to $675,000, to make long term loans to the state up to $6,000,000 for
       which the state agreed to turn over to the Bank bonds redeemable in 1868 (at par if they
       were 4 per cent bonds at one hundred and ten if they were 5's) and to make temporary
       loans up to a maximum of $1,000,000 in any one year at 4 per cent interest.” (Smith,
       Economic Aspects, p. 179)

       In 1837, the yields on Pennsylvania bonds suddenly became fixed within narrow limits.

Between November 1837 and April 1839 the maximum yield on Pennsylvania bonds in

Philadelphia was 4.65 percent, the minimum yield was 4.42 percent (Table 6). The standard

deviation on the Pennsylvania yield in 1838 was .02 percent, the lowest standard deviation for
                                                 12

any state’s bonds in any year in Tables 5, 6, and 7. Deliberately or not, the BUSP pegged the

price of Pennsylvania bonds as a result of its obligations to purchase state bonds over this 18

month period. Other lenders were not so optimistic about Pennsylvania, however. From 1837 to

1840 yields on Pennsylvania bonds in London remained considerably higher than yields in

Philadelphia.21

         The BUSP’s condition worsened in 1839, when its extensive operations in the state bond

market, the cotton market, and the market for international and domestic exchange went sour.22

In October of 1839, the BUSP was forced to suspend convertibility of its demand liabilities into

specie because of a run by New York and Boston Banks. The suspension of payments

precipitated a banking crisis in the United States; with banks in the south and west suspended

until 1842. But the suspension did not release the BUSP from its obligations to the state of

Pennsylvania. Until early 1841, although the BUSP no longer pegged the yield, Pennsylvania

bonds continued to enjoy lower yields in Philadelphia, despite steady borrowing by the state,

than did the bonds of Ohio and New York in New York or London.

         In February 1841, the state attempted to force the BUSP to resume specie payments,

whereupon the bank closed its doors and went out of business. With BUSP out of the market,

yields on Pennsylvania bonds in Philadelphia jumped immediately, from 6.01 percent on January

2 to 9.5 percent on March 7. For the remainder of 1841, Pennsylvania bond yields were above 8

percent in Philadelphia, and prices on Pennsylvania bonds were no longer quoted in London.

Yields on Pennsylvania bonds were now 2 percentage points higher than yields on New York

and Ohio bonds. The BUSP’s artificial support of state credit between 1837 to 1840 makes

problematic the use of Pennsylvania bond prices as a indicator of market conditions in those

years.

         Pennsylvania was in deep financial trouble in 1841. The state’s credit returned to a level
                                                  13

consistent with its financial situation when the failure of the BUSP forced the state back into

regular credit markets. In late 1841, yields on Pennsylvania bonds in Philadelphia began rising

rapidly. Pennsylvania defaulted on its bond obligations in 1842, with devastating consequences

for the state bond market on both sides of the Atlantic.

The Crises of 1837 and 1839:

       The Panic of 1837 occurred in a window of time where bond price data are hard to come

by. First, New York completed work on its canals in the 1820s and Ohio in the early 1830s.

New York paid off most of its debt by 1835. Although both New York and Ohio started new

projects in 1836 (New York authorized a $2,000,000 bond issue in 1836), neither state borrowed

heavily until later in 1837. As a result, there are gaps in the quotation series for both states in

1837, reflecting the absence of marketable bonds in both New York and London. Second,

western states had just begun issuing bonds when the Panic hit, and we do not have usable price

series for Indiana or Illinois in 1837. With the exception of Pennsylvania, not many state bonds

traded in the spring of 1837.

       Between 1831 and 1836, the yield differential between the United States and London was

small on average: .0013, only13 basis points. Yields were slightly lower in London than New

York, consistent with the general idea that credit markets were deeper and interest rates lower in

London, as well as with higher transaction costs of marketing American bonds in Britain.23 The

average difference for Pennsylvania bonds was .003, for New York bonds .001, and for Ohio

bonds -.0008 (on average Ohio bonds had slightly higher yields in London than in New York).

As we saw earlier, these markets were well integrated.

       Bond yields began rising in 1836, a full percentage point in the U.S. and almost 3/4 of a

percentage point in London. Credit markets tightened everywhere in 1836 (Figure 1). Yields

continued to rise through early 1837 in both London and the U.S., but more quickly in the U.S..

When the Panic broke out in May, however, yields moved in opposite directions in the U.S. and
                                                 14

in Britain. In the third quarter of 1837, yields on New York bonds in London rose to 5.46

percent, while in the U.S. they fell to 3.94 percent (Table 5, columns 1 and 2). For the remainder

of 1837, all of 1838, and the first three quarters of 1839, it was more expensive for state

governments to borrow in London than in New York or Philadelphia. Both 1838 and 1839 were

years of heavy new state borrowing and there were frequent quotations in every market. In the

aftermath of the Panic of 1837, credit markets for American state bonds were significantly

tighter in London than in the United States.

       The summer of 1839 was a turning point for the transportation boom in the northwest.

The Morris Bank defaulted on its July installment to Indiana. As the year progressed it became

clear that Indiana, Michigan, and Illinois were in serious trouble, a concern immediately

reflected in yields on their bonds. Indiana bond yields in London rose from 5.92 percent in June,

to 8.76 percent in November (Table 7, there are no quotes in between those dates in London, and

there are no quotes for Indiana bonds in New York before 1840).24 Illinois bonds in New York

went from a yield of 4.9 percent in July to 11.1 percent in November and 13 percent in

December, while in London Illinois bonds went from a yield of 5.98 percent in July to 7.32

percent in January. Financial markets acknowledged that it was primarily the western states

whose credit was threatened. Yields on eastern state bonds rose in 1839, but not nearly to the

extent of yields on western bonds.

       The BUSP once again suspended specie payments in October, 1839. This crisis hit U.S.

markets for state bonds much harder than it hit the London market. In the third quarter of 1839,

the average yield on New York bonds was 5.19 percent in the U.S. and 5.04 percent in London.

In the fourth quarter of 1839, the average yield on New York bonds was 7.76 percent in the U.S.

and 6.19 in London. For the remainder of 1840 and 1841, average yields stayed higher in the

U.S. than in London. The New York-London differential on New York bonds was over 0.5

percent throughout both years (Figure 5); for Ohio bonds, between 0.1 and 0.5 percent (Figure
                                                 15

7); and for Illinois bonds over a full percentage point or more. Unlike the aftermath of the Panic

of 1837, when markets for state bonds were tighter in London than they were in the United

States, after the Crisis of 1839 markets for state bonds were distinctly tighter in the United States

than in London.

        We are now in a position to examine the origin of the shock to bond markets. Figures 5

and 7, the difference in New York and Ohio bond yields in the United States and London, show

distinct spikes in the U.S.-London yield differentials at the end of 1839.25 This is the first spike

in the bond differentials, small compared to what was to come in 1842, but telling nonetheless.

Up to 1839, markets in New York, Philadelphia, and London shared the same information. In

the fall of 1839, news hit the markets in America first. Bond prices dropped and yields rose in

New York about two months before yields rose in London. Unlike 1837, when credit conditions

tightened on both sides of the Atlantic and the news about the Panic of 1837 did not originate in

either country, in 1839 the event that shocked bond markets clearly originated in the United

States.26

        Temin suggested that American states were forced to abandon their internal improvement

projects after the Crisis of 1839 because British capital dried up. His conjecture finds no support

in the financial market data. After the Panic of 1837, it was consistently more expensive for

states to borrow in London than in New York and Philadelphia. After the Crisis of 1839, it was

consistently cheaper for states to borrow in London than in New York and Philadelphia, and this

was true for all states. States, of course, found it harder to borrow everywhere in 1840 and 1841,

when yields on New York and Ohio bonds reached 7 percent, and yields on Illinois and Indiana

bonds went to 8 percent and higher. But it was not relatively harder to borrow in London than it

was in America. The idea that the depression that developed in the United States after October

1839 was due to the tightening of British capital markets is not supported by the bond yields.

        Although yields were more favorable to borrowers in London than in the U.S., states
                                                  16

found it difficult to borrow in both the U.S. and London in 1840. States with par restrictions on

their bonds could not market any bonds at prevailing rates. But they could sell bonds if they

were willing to pay market rates. For example, Illinois had issued bonds to state contractors in

lieu of cash payments, bonds the contractors had accepted at par. When state agents went to

London in July of 1840, they took both new state bonds with par restrictions and contractor

bonds. The contractor bonds were identical to the new bonds in every respect except the par

restriction. ‘None of the state bonds were sold, but an agreement was made to sell $1,000,000 of

the contractors’ bonds to Magniac, Smith and Company of London at a rate of eighty-three.’27

Ohio continued to borrow through 1843, authorizing new bond issues at less than par. The state

was able to sell $400,000 in bonds in July of 1840 to Barings at a price of 95 and an additional

$400,000 in bonds in May of 1842 at ‘the distressingly low price of 60.’28 States could borrow,

but not if they insisted on selling 5 or 6 percent bonds at par.

The Collapse of 1842:

       Financial historians have paid little attention to the Collapse of 1842, but big things were

happening that year in the market for state bonds. The collapse in state debt markets is

traditionally attributed to state defaults (Table 2). The timing of defaults and bond yield

movements shows that the onset of the default crisis cannot account entirely for the collapse of

state debt markets. In 1841, Indiana and Florida defaulted in January, Mississippi in March, and

Michigan and Arkansas in July. Yet yields on New York and Ohio bonds were not noticeably

higher in the first quarter of 1841 than they had been for most of 1840. Although yields rose in

the second and third quarter of 1841, the increase was small compared to the jump that occurred

in the fourth quarter of 1841 and the first quarter of 1842. Something happened in the winter of

1842 that shook American credit markets. And it wasn’t just the defaulting states that

experienced a crisis in the winter of 1842: yields for issues of Ohio and New York bonds, states

that avoided default, spiked in the U.S. market as well.
                                                 17

       The crisis in the winter of 1842 originated in the United States. The news hit American

markets first, American markets quickly increased the risk premium placed on American state

bonds, and London did not digest the news from American markets for several months. In the

first quarter of 1842, the yield on New York bonds was 9.89 percent in New York and 6.62

percent in London; on Ohio bonds, 12.78 percent in New York and 8.86 percent in London; on

Illinois bonds, 43.74 percent in New York and 26.78 percent in London. Figures 10, 11, and 12

focus on bond yield differences between January 1841 and December 1843 (these figures expand

the time scale of the data in Figures 5, 7, and 9). As the default crisis unfolded in 1841, yields in

New York stayed close to yields in London. But in January of 1842, yields moved sharply

higher in the United States, peaking in late March. Yields on New York, Ohio, and

Pennsylvania bonds were at least 8 percentage points higher in New York and Philadelphia than

the contemporaneous prices in London.

       The shock was not transitory. Bond yields remained higher in both markets through

1842. But the disjunction between bond yields in the United States and in London was

transitory. By April 17, 1842, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania bonds were again trading for

the same prices in London, New York, and Philadelphia.29 For the second quarter as a whole,

yields were only 0.0028 (28 basis points) higher in New York than in London. Markets were

well integrated, but the shock hit America first and, given the time it took information to

propagate to Britain, London did not react for over a month.

       What happened? Pennsylvania was the locus of the crisis. As early as 1839,

Pennsylvania was in deep financial trouble, but BUSP loans masked the state’s weakness until

the state was forced back into regular credit markets. After the BUSP failed in February 1841,

the yields on Pennsylvania bonds in Philadelphia began rising: from 5.76 percent in the last

quarter of 1840, to 8.05 percent in the first quarter of 1841, 8.43 percent in the third quarter,

11.42 percent in the fourth quarter, and 17.99 percent in the first quarter of 1842.
                                                18

        State chartered banks were not at liberty to refuse loans to the state government that

chartered them. Throughout 1841, Pennsylvania leaned on its banks. In November of 1841,

Pennsylvania announced that it would require a loan from all banks in the state equal to 5

percent of their capital. The news that hit American markets in December 1841 and January

1842, as the state began gathering loans from its banks, was that Pennsylvania was actually

carrying out its threat to make the banks sustain the state credit through forced loans. In

February of 1842, the state precipitated a banking panic in Philadelphia, when it attempted to

withdraw funds from the Bank of Philadelphia necessary to cover the interest payments due that

month.30 At that point, the state had not yet decided whether it would rescue the state credit by

extorting more money from state chartered banks. When Pennsylvania made it clear that it

would not force more loans from state banks in April of 1842, the crisis was over. As a result of

the state’s decision not to press its banks it became inevitable that Pennsylvania would default on

its August 1842 interest payment, and Pennsylvania bond yields in London and Philadelphia

accordingly rose steadily until the third quarter. Yields on Pennsylvania bonds would not fall

back below 10 percent until April of 1844, and the state resumed interest payments in February

1845.

        Conditions were similar in New York, where the state pressed state chartered banks to

purchase state bonds. New York bank holdings of state ‘stock’ rose from nothing in 1839 to

almost $7 million in 1842. The New York state legislature met in emergency session in March

to consider how to deal with the impending state default. It responded with the ‘Stop and Tax’

law of 1842, stopping borrowing, stopping construction on canals, and reinstituting the state

property tax. These measures ended the crisis in New York bonds.

        Ohio relied heavily on its banks for funds. Ohio raised $900,000 in 1842, $500,000 from

state chartered banks and the $400,000 borrowed through Barings in London.31 As long as Ohio

continued its internal improvement projects, financial markets continued to purchase Ohio bonds
                                                 19

at prices significantly below par. Yields on Ohio bonds in New York and London remained over

10 percent until the second quarter of 1843. Because Ohio could pressure its banks in a way that

it could not pressure financial markets, as interest rates rose the state issued more bonds to its

banks and fewer directly to financial markets. When it did place new bonds, it placed them in

London, not in New York.

       Rising yields on Ohio and New York bonds in late 1841 were not a response to the

default crisis in Mississippi, Florida, Arkansas, Indiana, and Michigan. The Governor of

Mississippi announced that he supported repudiation in early 1841. When Mississippi and

Florida repudiated their bonds by legislative act in February of 1842 this was old news. The

news in the winter of 1842 was the threat that New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania would

cannibalize their banks to keep state finances afloat. Pennsylvania’s announcement of the

forced loan program in November 1841 gave concrete expression to the threat. Throughout the

winter of 1842 it was not clear what additional steps states would take to deal with the crisis.

Fundamental uncertainty drove bond prices down, bond yields up, and brought an end to any

hopes that states would be able to raise large amounts of capital at reasonable rates to continue

their internal improvement projects. News of the threat and an appreciation of its magnitude

took several months to reach Britain.

       The Collapse of 1842 was not brought on by tight credit markets in Britain after the

Crisis of 1839, but by a political crisis in the United States in the winter of 1842. Even so,

financial markets sorted themselves out quickly. Interest rates on all state debts would be higher

in April of 1842 than in October of 1841, but markets in London and New York would pay the

same yields on Ohio and New York bonds.

V. Conclusions

       In 1841, Nicholas Biddle argued that European conditions played an important role in the
                                                  20

economic crisis in 1839, and one need go no further than Leland Jenks’s Migration of British

Capital or Bray Hammond’s Banks and Politics in America to see how much economic

historians have laid the blame for the depression of 1839 to 1842 at the feet of international

conditions. Peter Temin made no bones about the centrality of British credit in bringing on the

Crisis of 1839 and the collapse of state internal improvement projects: ‘The state projects

initiated in the late 1830s had been started in the expectation of external [British] financing....

Unfortunately, the new inflow of foreign capital did not continue [in 1839]... and the manifold

projects of the states were abandoned.’ Three clear findings of this paper challenge this

traditional interpretation.

        First, the conditions that brought on the Panic of 1837 could not have anything to do with

the crisis in American state debts after 1839. The majority of state debt outstanding in 1841 was

incurred after Panic, not before. The vast majority of debt in New York, Ohio, Massachusetts,

Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Arkansas, Maryland, and Mississippi involved in the default crisis

was authorized in 1837 or later and issued long after the Panic of 1837 was over. New York,

Ohio, and Pennsylvania continued to issue and market bonds in 1840 and 1841.

        Second, before 1837 state bonds had marketed for a slightly higher prices (lower yields)

in London than New York and Philadelphia. After the Panic of 1837, London markets for

American state bonds became noticeably tighter than American markets, during the three years

of the heaviest borrowing: 1837, 1838, and 1839. Yet, when the BUSP suspended payments in

October 1839, the economic crisis set in, and bond yields rose sharply in both countries, yields in

London became significantly lower than yields in the U.S.. States such as Ohio and Illinois

could borrow at lower cost in London than in New York, and so they borrowed in London.
                                                21

There is no evidence that British credit markets dried up relative to American markets after

1839. States had more trouble borrowing in both markets, of course, and states were forced out

of the market entirely if they insisted on borrowing at par. The collapse of state transportation

projects in Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan in 1839 had nothing to do with credit markets in

London, and everything to do with the defalcation of American banks such as the Morris Canal

and Banking Company, which failed to pay states for bonds they had already accepted and on

which the states were liable to pay interest immediately.

        Third, the movement of bond yields during the Crisis of 1839 and the Collapse of 1842

indisputably show that the shocks to financial markets originated in the United States and spread

to London, not the other way around. As the economic crisis deepened in 1840 and 1841, New

York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania put greater pressure on their own state chartered banks to buy

state bonds. This was not because the states could not sell bonds in London, but because the

yields on those bonds in London, New York, and Philadelphia were justifiably rising.

Pennsylvania’s forced loan policy, beginning in November of 1841, tipped American markets

into crisis.

        Our focus on the market for state bonds in London and the United States precludes us

from drawing similar conclusions about the course of the overall economies of the United States

and Britain in these years. That would require a great deal more time and space. But we hope

we have given more weight to Matthews’s conclusion that ‘enough has been said in the present

chapter to indicate the powerful nature of forces making for instability from within the United

States in this period.’

1.Leland Jenks, Migration of British Capital, pp. 90-95, and Bray Hammond, Banks and Politics

in America, pp. 500-513, stress the importance of British capital markets and international forces

in bringing on the crises. Nicholas Biddle, in a letter to John Clayton dated April 9, 1841, in

which he defended his actions at the Bank of the United States and attempted to explain why the

bank had failed after his departure as President, Biddle wrote: ‘I have just stated that the winter

of 1838-‘39 was a season of great abundance and ease in moneyed concerns, both in England

and this country; but England was soon after startled by the discovery that the grain crop was

deficient, and a demand arose for specie to export for grain, combined with some continental

loans, that changed the whole surface of affairs. The Bank of England itself, after borrowing ten

millions of dollars from the Bank of France, was still so much drained for coin that it was forced

into very severe restrictive measures, which raised the interest of money to twice or three times

its usual rate. The most injurious effect was on the stocks of this country [the U.S.], which were

no longer convertible in England, accept at great sacrifices. These causes immediately reacted

on this country, producing the usual effects of embarrassment in the community and alarm

among the banks.’ In House Document #226, 29th Congress, First Session, p. 488.

argues that the crises in the United States had a much larger effect on prices than on output.

Also see Temin, ‘The Anglo-American Business Cycle’ where he shows that the American
                                                23

economy experienced greater price fluctuations over these business cycles, while the British

economy experienced greater fluctuations in real economic activity.

6.The quote is from Clapham, Bank of England, p. 153. See Hidy, House of Baring, as well, pp.

7.Whether the Panic of 1837 in the United States was caused primarily by international or

domestic forces is a question with a long pedigree. See Rousseau, ‘Jacksonian Monetary

Policy;’ Temin Jacksonian Economy and ‘The Anglo-American Business Cycle, 1820-60;’ and

Timberlake, ‘The Specie Circular and the Distribution of the Surplus’ and ‘The Specie Standard

and Central Banking in the United States Before 1860;’ and Macesich ‘Sources of Monetary

Disturbances in the United States, 1834-1845.’ Heavy land sales in 1835 and 1836 swelled

federal revenues just as the federal government had paid off the national debt. The fiscal surplus

grew rapidly, and in 1836 plans were made to distribute $36 million to the states in four

quarterly installments in 1837. See Bourne Surplus Revenue Act.

8.Table 1 reports debt outstanding on September 1, 1841. The debt is listed by the year it was

authorized, since it is difficult to determine when individual bonds were sold. The bottom three

rows of the table report the amount outstanding, the total debt authorized, and the total amount

ever issued (some debt had been retired by 1841).

9.The installments were fixed in time and amount. The states were not paid when the banks sold

the bonds, these were not consignment or commission sales.

10.For detailed consideration of land values and property tax revenues in Indiana in these years

see Wallis ‘The Property Tax.’ Only Illinois continued to borrow, at extremely high rates, in an

attempt to maintain its credit and to continue construction. The state was not successful at either

goal. Heavy borrowing in 1840 saddled the state with debts the state would struggle to pay into

the 1850s, without any significant physical accomplishments. The best overall history of state

investments in transportation is Goodrich Government Promotion. Goodrich has recently been
                                                 24

supplemented by Larson Internal Improvements. Details about Indiana can be found in Fatout

Indiana Canals and Illinois in Krenkel Illinois Internal Improvements.

11.By 1839 the BUSP had an extensive operation in Britain headed by Samuel Jaudon, so

attributing the causes of the bank’s demise to domestic and international forces is complicated.

But the causes of the suspension in October of 1839 were a run on the Philadelphia bank by

banks in New York and Boston. Hammond, ‘Chestnut Raid on Wall Street;’ Smith, Economic

Aspects.

12. The data underlying the figures is discussed in the next section.

13.Their database will soon be available at ICPSR: ‘Price Quotations in Early U.S. Securities

Markets.’

14.Price quotations were typically reported weekly, recorded by the date of the newspaper issue.

Prices were not quoted on the same day in each market, and in several cases quotes were

provided for more than one day in each week.      Our analysis focuses on weekly quotations,

except where noted. The Boston market data are not available from June 1841 to September

1843, and the New York series on Massachusetts bonds is incomplete. The Baltimore market

data include complete data on generic ‘Maryland 5s’ and ‘Maryland 6s’ without maturity dates,

and the prices for specific Maryland bonds is spotty.

15.The restrictions states placed on intermediaries are difficult to track. When the state

appointed a state official to sell bonds in New York or London, the official was clearly bound by

the par restriction. When states used investment bankers the situation was less clear. One would

think that once investment bankers had paid for the bonds, they would no longer be bound by the

par restriction. Investment bankers who took consignment of bonds would be bound by the par

restriction. Yet, for example, Nicholas Biddle and the BUSP took almost all of Mississippi’s

1838 issue of $5 million, paid for it on credit over the following year, and then failed to sell the

bonds in London. The BUSP used $3,008,000 in Mississippi bonds as collateral for European
                                                 25

loans, Smith, Economic Aspects, p. 218. Altogether, the BUSP used almost $13,000,000 in state

bonds as collateral for loans in the fall of 1839 and winter of 1840. It is not clear why Biddle

didn’t sell the bonds, unless, perhaps, he could not because of concerns about par restrictions.

16.For simplicity, we assumed that all bonds matured on January 1 and paid a single annual

premium. Bond yields for the last two years proceeding maturity were dropped from the

calculated averages. Yields were calculated for bid and ask prices, and both bid and ask yields

were included in the market averages. Unfortunately, the quotations for Maryland bonds did not

include a maturity.

17.The ARCH estimator is more fully described in an appendix available from the authors. The

appendix also explain the estimation technique used to account for missing observations.

18.This is the first step of an EM algorithm – a popular tool for finding maximum likelihood

estimates in incomplete data problems. See Meng and Rubin ‘Maximum Likelihood

Estimation.’

19.The difference is the arithmetic difference in the average prices for the year or quarter.

20.The near equivalence of New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania yields in 1836 is misleading,

since there were only 4 observations on New York bond yields in New York that year. Most of

the New York bonds were paid off in 1836.

21.Why the price difference was not arbitraged away is something of a mystery. It is possible

that the quoted Philadelphia prices reflect prearranged transactions in new bond issues between

the state and the BUSP. Bond holders in the secondary market were not able to sell bonds to

BUSP at the low yields/high prices. The BUSP held a large stock of Pennsylvania bonds, but

not the entire $30 million issued up to 1839. If this was the case, then the stability of the quoted

price may not reflect the true price of Pennsylvania bonds on the open market. In either case, the

use of the Pennsylvania bond yields for cross country comparisons is problematic.
                                               26

22.Details of the bank’s demise can be found in Smith, Economic Aspects, Hammond, Banks and

Politics in America, and Govan, Nicholas Biddle.

23.The idea that British credit markets were deeper than American goes back at least to

Callender, ‘Early Transportation and Banking Enterprises,’ whose essay lays out the importance

of British capital for American development and the role of American states in tapping foreign

and domestic credit markets to support internal improvements.

24.This may be because the Indiana bonds sold on credit to the Morris Bank were sent to

London, and from there to Amsterdam. The Morris Canal and Banking Company took the

Indiana bonds it purchased on credit and used them to pay off the mortgage held on the canal by

Dutch creditors. By the summer of 1839, the Morris Bank did not hold any Indiana bonds, it had

already sold or hypothecated all of them. There is no published account of the incident that we

are aware of. But the minutes of the Company’s Board of Directors are available at the New

Jersey State Archives, and the story can be tracked through them.

25.This is in the time interval when Pennsylvania bond prices are supported by the BUSP, so the

yield differential between Philadelphia and London becomes more negative. This, however, is a

function of the BUSP support.

26.There is no possibility that a positive shock hit the London markets in October of 1839.

Equity prices in London were falling, not rising in the late 1839, see Gayer, Rostow, and

28.Scheiber, Ohio Canals,pp. 140-158, quote from p. 152. At a price of 60, the yield on a 6 per

cent bond was roughly 10 percent. Ohio did not include a par restriction in the legislation

authorizing bond issues in 1836, so most Ohio bonds could be sold at any price. Ohio did have

problems with price restrictions, however. One issue of bonds had been sold for less than the
                                                27

legislated minimum and at one point markets in New York believed, erroneously, that the state

was about to default on bonds that had been sold in violation the legislated price.

29.Bond prices moved sharply upward in London that week, New York bonds went from yields

of 6.38 percent to 8.05 percent and Ohio bonds from yields of 9.34 percent to 12.5 percent. At

the same time, yields moved down in New York, bring yields in the two markets back into

parity.

30.The funds Pennsylvania withdrew were the funds they had borrowed from other banks in the

state. Pennsylvania did not default on its bonds until 1842, but they were several days late on an

interest payment in February because of the banking crisis. The crisis in Pennsylvania and the

state’s interaction with its banks is described in Kettell ‘Debts and Finances’ and the

Pennsylvania Report in House Document 226, 29th Congress, First Session.

31. Scheiber, Ohio Canals, pp. 140-158. ‘During the remainder of 1842, the fund board

sustained installment payments on the three-year loans by issuing bonds to Ohio banks at prices

of 70 to 75 [yields of roughly 8 percent]. In this manner, nearly $700,000 of bonds were sold for

cash payments of only $500,000.’ p. 152. As noted earlier, Ohio sold its bonds to Barings for a

price of 60.

Appendix to Kim and Wallis:

The Market for American State Government Bonds in Britain and the United States, 1830 to
1843.


       Our multivariate ARCH model for market integration tests int the bond and stock markets is:

                               Yit = X it Bi + ε it           , i = 1,2,L , n
                               ε t | Λ t −1 ~ N (0, Ω t )
                               E (ε it | Λ t −1 ) = 0
                               E (ε it ε jt | Λ t −1 ) = Ω ijt = aij + bij ε it −1ε jt −1

Where Λ t −1 is the information set in time t-1. In the text, X contains only a constant term and n is


equal to two. We maximizing the following log likelihood function to estimate the parameters, a,

b, and B:

                                  T            T              T
                                     n            1              1 ′
                      log L = − ∑ log(2π ) − ∑ log| Ω t | − ∑ ε t Ω t−1ε t
                                t =1 2       t =1 2         t =1 2

                      where
                       Ω t = Ω t (a , b, B) and Ω ijt = aij + bij ε it −1ε jt −1
                       ε t = Yt − X t B

                      ∴ log L = log L(a , b, B| data )


       Because the bond prices are not complete, we have missing data in the dependent

variable. For our bench mark results, we linearly interpolated bond prices on the surrounding

observations. This imputed series is used for the ARCH estimation. For example, if prices are

available in week 3 and week 5 in London, we linearly interpolate between the two prices to

obtain an estimate for week 4.

       This imputation causes a consistency problem in our estimates, since the imputation is

not likely to be the true data generating process. We can get around this problem by iterating an
EM algorithm process. Imputation is the first step of the EM algorithm. The standard second

step is to maximize the likelihood function to get parameter estimates, and then go back to the

first step to reimpute the data using the estimates. By iterating these two steps, the estimates

converges to the true values in the limit. Instead, we develop a new method to estimate the

missing observations directly. It is easier and faster than the EM algorithm iteration.

        Suppose an observation is missing at time t-1. For example, the data are not available in

London in week 4, while the data are available in week 3 and week 5 in both markets. We take

the covariance matrix of time t, conditional on time t-2 disturbance terms, instead of time t-1

disturbance terms. That is, the covariance of week 5 is conditional on week 3 data, not week 4

data:

                        E (ε it ε jt | Λ t − 2 ) = aij + bij E (ε it −1ε jt −1 | Λ t − 2 )
                        E (ε it −1ε jt −1 | Λ t − 2 ) = aij + bij ε it − 2 ε jt − 2
                        ∴ E (ε it ε jt | Λ t − 2 ) = aij (1 + bij ) + bij2 ε it − 2 ε jt − 2

        In this fashion, we can represent the conditional covariance of time t with the time t-2

error terms. Generalizing this method recursively to the case where time (t-s) data are the latest

data observed before t, we get

                                  E (ε it ε jt | Λ t − s ) = aij* + bij*ε it − s ε jt − s
                                 where
                                  aij* = aij (1 + bij + L + bijs−1 )
                                   *
                                   bij = bij
                                             s




        Therefore, (a*, b*) has one-to-one nonlinear relationship to (a, b). Using this relationship,

we can adjust the likelihood function without changing the number of parameters we are

estimating:
                               n            1              1 ′
                log L = − ∑ log(2π ) − ∑ log| Ω t | − ∑ ε t Ω t−1ε t
                          t ∈A 2       t ∈A 2         t ∈A 2

                where
                Ω t = Ω t (a , b, B) and Ω ijt = aij (1 + bij + L + bijs−1 ) + bijs ε it − s ε jt − s
                ε t = Yt − X t B
                A = time periods when the data are observed


               ∴ log L = log L(a , b, B| observed data )


       The covariance matrix is conditional on the latest observations available. The likelihood

function is still determined by a, b and B conditional only on the observed data. There is a

computational problem because the likelihood function is highly nonlinear on a and b, but the

consistency of the estimate is preserved.
