                                             ABSTRACT

Illinois’ public pensions are among the worst funded in the nation. We present evidence that the main
reason for Illinois' underfunding is a history of making inadequate contributions, dating back to the
origins of the state's pensions. We discuss the recent history and legal status of pension reform efforts
in the state. Using a fiscal model of the state's finances, we project how Illinois' fiscal situation may
evolve in the future. A key finding is that with or without pension reform, Illinois will continue to
face significant structural deficits that will require revenue increases and/or additional spending cuts
to address.

1 Introduction

       The State of Illinois is recognized for many positive attributes, as diverse as being the

"Land of Lincoln" and the first state to ratify the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery to being

home of Chicago's "Magnificent Mile." However, the state is also known for its troubled fiscal

status, currently having the worst bond rating of any state (IOC 2015a) as well as several of the

most poorly funded public pensions in the nation (Sielman 2013). Indeed, the poor funding status

of the major state pension plans is often blamed for being the root of the state's fiscal problems.

Some commentators have suggested that "lavish" pension benefits created the current fiscal

situation (Ridell 2014).

       This paper presents a case study of Illinois pensions with an objective of understanding

pension funding in a broader fiscal context. In particular, we seek to shed light on the extent to

which the current fiscal stress is the result of relatively generous public pensions versus the

state's history of making insufficient contributions. Naturally, these two issues are closely

connected, as benefit levels drive required contributions, thus making it impossible to precisely

disentangle the two factors. Nonetheless, we provide suggestive evidence by comparing Illinois

benefits for public employees to those in other states and by examining the history of pension

funding in the state. In general, our findings mirror those of Munnell (2012: 105) who

characterizes Illinois as a state "with moderately expensive plans that [has] assiduously avoided

funding."

       More specifically, we find that public pensions in Illinois are not significant outliers in

terms of expense or generosity. A comparison of initial retirement benefits of a public worker in

Illinois to similar workers in other states places Illinois somewhere in the middle of the pack. On

a lifetime basis Illinois benefits are more generous, and thus more expensive, due to the fixed




                                                  1
nominal "automatic annual increase" (AAI) of three percent (commonly, though inaccurately,

referred to as a COLA). However, the relative generosity of the AAI must be weighed against the

reality that the most Illinois public workers are not part of the U.S. Social Security system. Thus

Illinois pensions need to be more generous than those in the majority of states where workers

have a public pension on top of Social Security in order for total retirement contributions and

benefits to be similar.

       If the generosity of pensions is not the root cause of the state's funding situation, then

what is? We discuss that the state has a very long history of making insufficient contributions,

effectively engaging in borrowing by underfunding the pensions. This has created a large

unfunded pension obligation, the servicing of which now places significant strain on Illinois'

public finances.

       To understand the strain that public pension funding places on the state budget

prospectively, we project state spending and revenues 30 years into the future, using a projection

model from the University of Illinois' "Fiscal Futures Project." We find that even if recent

pension reforms had been held constitutional, the state's long-term fiscal outlook features large

gaps between projected revenues and projected expenditures. In short, many decades of

borrowing against future generations has placed Illinois in a difficult fiscal situation that will be

hard to resolve without significant increases in taxes or cuts in a wide range of spending

programs.

       This paper proceeds as follows: In section 2, we present an overview of the public

pensions in Illinois and discuss the relative importance of benefit generosity and contribution

levels in leading to current low funding ratios. In section 3 we discuss the broader fiscal context,

including using tools from the University of Illinois' "Fiscal Futures Project" to various




                                                  2
analytical problems associated with publicly available state budget documents. We also provide

projections of the state’s long-term fiscal situation. In section 4, we provide a history of the

policy responses to pension funding shortfalls, with a special emphasis on reforms that have

occurred in the past few years. We discuss the major 2013 reform and why it was subsequently

over-turned by the Illinois Supreme Court. In section 5 we discuss the few remaining policy

options on the table for restoring fiscal balance in the State. We conclude in section 6.

2 Public pensions for state workers in Illinois

2.1 Overview of statewide pensions

       There are six major statewide public pension plans in Illinois: The State Employees'

Retirement System (SERS), the Teachers' Retirement System (TRS), the State Universities

Retirement system (SURS), the Judges' Retirement System (JRS), the General Assembly

Retirement system (GARS) and the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund (IMRF). The first five of

these plans all represent financial obligations of the State of Illinois and must be funded out of

the state's revenue. Table 1 represents the official funding status as of June 30, 2014. These

funding ratios, which are calculated using the actuarial value of liabilities and the market value

of assets, show that the overall funding level of the combined Illinois pensions is only 43

percent. Of course, the actual funding situation is much worse than this because the actuarial

value of the liability is computed using expected asset returns rather than a risk-free rate, a point

made forcefully in numerous papers (e.g., Novy-Marx and Rauh 2011; Brown and Wilcox 2008;

Brown and Pennacchi, this volume).

                                         <<Table 1 here>>

       Unlike the five state financed plans, the IMRF is funded by contributions from local

governments for their own employees (including non-teaching employees of school districts) and




                                                  3
the State of Illinois is an agent-administrator, not a contributor. Because the IMRF annually bills

each local government for the actuarially required amount and the state uses its powers to

enforce those contributions, IMRF is the only one of the six systems that is reasonably well

funded. According to IMRF (2014), it was 96.7 percent funded as of December 31, 2013.

2.2 Sources of the funding shortfall

2.2.1 How generous are Illinois public pensions?

       There is no single metric for comparing the generosity of benefits across all public

pension plans. In comparing any two states, one state might offer a higher benefit to teachers but

a lower benefit to general state workers. Or one state might be more generous for a full-career

worker, but be less generous to part-career workers. Numerous other parameters, such as

retirement age or the definition of compensation, also vary from plan to plan and thus can lead to

states being ranked differently for different employee characteristics. Nonetheless, it is

instructive to examine a few examples in to assess whether Illinois benefits are an outlier.

       In Figure 1, we report benefit comparisons from Biggs (2014), who calculates the

benefits received by an average full-career state government employee who retired from each

state's system in 2011 or 2012. He uses data from the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports

(CAFRs) published by public plans, and calculates benefits for general state employees. Note

that when measured on the basis of initial annual benefits, Illinois SERS ranks 25 out of 50

states. In other words, Illinois not an outlier, but rather hovers right around the median.

                                        <<Figure 1 here>>

       Within Illinois, the workers under SERS differ from teachers and university employees in

an important way: most SERS workers are covered by Social Security, whereas most other

public employees are not. Thus, it is also instructive to compare benefits across states for a set of




                                                  4
workers that are not covered by Social Security in Illinois. We focus on teachers, using a public

pension benefit calculator created by the Manhattan Institute (Public Sector Inc. 2015). To

provide an illustration, we use a teacher, born in 1955, who started working at age 30 and who

intends to retire on July 1, 2015 at age 60 after 30 years of service. We assume a final average

salary of $75,000. For this stylized individual, the calculator was able to estimate benefits for 46

states.1 The annual pension benefit available to our stylized retiree ranges from a low of $17,297

in Maryland to a high of $56,250 in five states. The estimated Illinois benefit of $44,850 placed

in 27th out of 46 states. Note this is very similar to the ranking found by Biggs as reported in

Figure 1 above. Again, this measure suggests that the Illinois TRS system is not an outlier in

terms of generosity, especially considering the differences in Social Security coverage.

        The story changes when one accounts for the 3 percent automatic annual adjustment

(AAI). Using the Manhattan Institute calculator, when ranked on the value of the equivalent

price of a lifetime annuity that would replicate the pension benefit, Illinois climbs to 7th out of 46

in generosity. It is no wonder, then, that most recent pension reform proposals have targeted this

AAI for reduction (see below for more discussion).

        Overall, a key take-away from this analysis is that the initial level of benefits offered

from Illinois public plans are not an outlier relative to other public plans. However, Illinois' post-

retirement benefit increase of 3 percent compounded annually is significantly more generous

(and thus more expensive to the state) than those in most other states, at least given recent rates

of inflation. When one considers the combined generosity and expense of public pensions and

benefit levels were such an outlier on the low side that we were concerned that our parameter combination was not
reflective of a Wisconsin worker.

Social Security, there is little evidence that Illinois is more generous than other states with higher

funding ratios.

2.2.2 A history of inadequate contributions

       Although Illinois' public pension problems have received much attention in the media in

recent years, the issue is long-standing. Eric Madiar, until recently the chief legal counsel for the

Office of the Illinois Senate President, recently released a paper documenting the history of

Illinois' fiscal problems dating back as far as the U.S. Civil War (Madiar 2014). As part of this

history, he unearthed a report of the Illinois Pension Laws Commission of 1916 (pub. 1917) that

reported on the financial status of several of the public pensions that existed in Illinois at the time

and concluded (quoted in Madiar 2014: 2): "financial provisions [were] entirely inadequate for

paying the stipulated pensions when due." Thus, it appears that public pensions in Illinois have

suffered funding problems virtually from the start.

       Over four decades later, in 1959, the Public Employees' Pension Laws Commission

issued a report to then-Governor William Stratton, which (as reported in Finke 2013) stated: "Of

principle concern to the Commission is the accumulation of large unfunded accrued liabilities

resulting for the most part from the inadequacy of government contributions in prior years to

meet increases in costs."

       This "inadequacy of government contributions" has continued for more than a half

century after this report was issued. As shown in Figure 2, asset levels of the five statewide

public pension plans has never exceeded 75 percent of liabilities during the 1968-2014 period. In

short, low funding levels are the norm, not the exception.

                                        <<Figure 2 here>>




                                                  6
       The Illinois Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability (CoGFA 2015)

reports that the unfunded liability of the state's pensions grew by over $87 billion from 1984 to

2012. They also note that the single largest cause – comprising just under 50 percent of the total

growth in underfunding – was that the state's contributions fell below the actuarially required

level. No other single factor – investment returns, changes in actuarial assumptions, benefit

increases, etc. – comprised more than 20 percent of the deterioration of funding status.

       Underfunded pensions are just one aspect of Illinois' fiscal situation. The state's other

fiscal issues are interrelated with pension funding and constrain policy options to address one or

the other. Thus, we turn next to this broader context.

3 The broader fiscal context in Illinois

3.1 Structural deficits and budgeting practices in Illinois

       Illinois has had fiscal sustainability problems for decades. The underlying problem has

been identified as a "structural deficit," a lower projected growth rate for sustainable revenue

than for spending (Giertz, McGuire and Nowlan, 1996; Giertz 2007; CTBA 2008). Fiscal crises

reoccur as actions taken to restore balance in one year are eventually eroded by slow revenue

growth.

       Illinois' structural deficit has been compounded by policy actions and budget practices.

The State Budget Crisis Task Force chaired by Paul Volker and Richard Ravitch, attributes the

decline of Illinois' fiscal condition, first to underfunding pension liabilities and (2012: 16),

       Second, during the good economic times of the late 1990s to mid-2000s, Illinois
       expanded government services, but did not raise taxes and did not put away cash
       reserves. The state paid for its excess spending by making even smaller payments to the
       pension systems, borrowing heavily, sweeping special funds, and putting off paying
       Medicaid and employee healthcare bills until the following budget year. This chronic
       shortsightedness and avoidance of tough choices has accumulated to a significant
       structural deficit for Illinois. When the revenue recession hit in 2009, Illinois had no




                                                   7
       cushion. Time-shifting budgeting tricks used persistently in the good years were of much
       less value for temporary use in a downturn.

       Continuing this pattern, Illinois relied on two additional unsustainable revenue sources –

federal stimulus funds in 2009-2011 and an explicitly temporary income tax rate increase from

2011-2014 – without addressing the underlying mismatch between spending and sustainable

revenue (Dye et al. 2015).

       Illinois also engages in a number of budgeting practices that make it difficult to reliably

and consistent measure the state's fiscal status over time. In addition to counting debt proceeds

and asset sales as revenue, the spending side is equally complex. According to the Illinois Office

of the Comptroller (IOC 2015b), there are 602 active state funds in Illinois, while only four of

them constitute the "General Funds" of the state. However, most reporting and public discourse

on fiscal matters concentrates on just the general funds. It is not uncommon for there to be

within-year transfers between funds or cross-year reassignments of spending responsibility

across funds. As a result, the general funds budget reported by the state is not consistently

defined over time, making it difficult to obtain an accurate time series of state revenues and

expenditures. To conduct meaningful analysis in light of these measurement difficulties, it

becomes necessary to essentially reconstruct the entire set of Illinois revenue and expenditure

categories in a consistent manner over time.

3.2 Measuring and projecting Illinois' fiscal imbalances: The Fiscal Futures Project

       To overcome the difficulties created by Illinois' inconsistent budget reporting and to

make projections about future fiscal balances in Illinois, we make use of the model created by a

team at the University of Illinois' Institute of Government and Public Affairs (IGPA). Known as

the Fiscal Futures Project (FFP), this model started being built in 2008 to help build analytical




                                                 8
capacity to inform long-term fiscal policy discussions, a capability that was largely missing in

Illinois.

        The FFP team has been analyzing and reporting on Illinois' fiscal problems for a number

of years (Dye and McMillen 2009; Dye et al., 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015). The

interaction between problems funding pensions and problems funding the overall budget is a

recurring focus of their analysis and serves as the basis for ours.

        There are three essential elements in the FFP's analytical framework (Dye and Hudspeth

2015): a broad-based consistently-defined budget measure (the all-funds budget); a budget

projection model; and attention to sustainable revenue sources.

        All-funds budget: FFP has created and annually updates a broad-based measure of the

Illinois state budget that groups budget items into a meaningful set of revenue and spending

categories that are consistently measured over time. This conceptually simple accounting

exercise is a necessary first step for meaningful economic analysis.

        Budget projection: FFP has developed a long-term budget projection model for Illinois.

For each spending and revenue category, the model estimates the past relation to selected

economic and demographic "driver" variables. These relations are then applied to projected

values of the driver variables to make projections for budget components.2 The components can

then be aggregated to project total revenue and total spending. The model develops baseline

projections from current spending levels and existing revenue sources, which can then be

compared to alternative tax or spending policies.




2
  Projections of the driver variables come from the Illinois Regional Economic Input-Output Model (IREIM) of the
Regional Economics Applications Laboratory (REAL) at the University of Illinois. The IREIM is described in
Israilevich et al. (1997).



                                                        9
        Sustainable Revenue: The Illinois Constitution states that "Appropriations for a fiscal

year shall not exceed funds estimated by the General Assembly to be available during that year."

However, Illinois law allows "funds … available" to include a range of options, including the

issuance of debt, the use of one-time revenue sources, and asset sales. For example, if the state

sells off its toll booth operations to a private party, it can claim the sale as a source of revenue in

that year. In order to better distinguish revenue flows from asset sales, the FFP model focuses on

"sustainable revenue" by excluding new borrowing and other one-time revenue sources.

3.3 Recent projections of the Fiscal Futures Model

3.3.1 Cash gap projections

        Each year, as data from a new fiscal year becomes available, the all-funds database is

updated and the budget projections are re-estimated. Figure 3 presents projections from January

20153 (Dye, Hudspeth and Crosby, 2015). The top two lines in Figure 3 show total spending and

total sustainable revenue for Illinois' all-funds budget for the historical and projection years. The

budget gap shown at the bottom of the figure indicates that the model projects a $6 billion gap in

FY 2015 growing to $14 billion in FY 2026. This budget outlook for Illinois represents the

current-policy baseline projections to which alternative policy scenarios can be compared.

                                             <<Figure 3 here>>

3.3.2 Alternative budget gap

        The summary measure of fiscal balance used by the Fiscal Futures Model is the budget

gap, which is defined as the difference between total sustainable revenue and total expenditures.

These items are measured on a cash basis, with appropriate adjustments to exclude from revenue

the proceeds of new debt issuance or other balance sheet changes. However, projecting the cash

3
 Note that the January 2015 version of the database and model does not include spending cuts made in the second
half of FY 2015, nor any cuts in the enacted FY 2016 budget.



                                                       10
gap alone does not capture changes in the state's pension funding status. To remedy this, the

model produces an "adjusted budget gap," which is just the cash gap from above minus the

change in unfunded pension liabilities, i.e.:

               Adjusted Budget Gap = Cash Gap – Δ Unfunded Pension Liabilities

This is a cash-accrual hybrid, not a full accrual measure for the state. Although it captures

changes in the unfunded liability of the pension plans, it does not include changes in non-pension

assets or changes in non-pension liabilities. More specifically, the cash gap is adjusted by

subtracting the change in the "Unfunded Actuarially Accrued Liabilities." The ΔUAAL is a

residual that captures the effect of (inadequate) contributions, changes in the value of pension

assets, and changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate liabilities such as the discount rate.

Because it is based upon actuarial methods and assumptions, it is an admittedly weak proxy for

the economic value of annual underfunding. Nonetheless, it is what we have available from

public sources, and thus we forge ahead.

       Figure 4 presents cash gap and adjusted gap projections from the Fiscal Futures Model

for FY 2015 to FY 2045. The cash gap projections (shown by the solid line) are the same

baseline projections as in Figure 3, except that the projection period is longer. When model

projections are run 30 years out, the cash deficit reaches $35 billion in 2045. Recall that under

pre-December 2013 law, Illinois pension contributions are targeted to achieve only 90 percent

funding by 2045 and scheduled annual contributions are back-loaded or ramped-up as the target

year gets closer.

                                        <<Figure 4 here>>

       The dashed line in Figure 4 shows the adjusted budget gap projections. Because of both

the 90 percent target and back-loading, Illinois is scheduled to pay less than actuarially required




                                                 11
contributions, and UAAL will increase through FY 2029. Thus the adjusted budget gap is larger

(more negative) than the cash gap for the next 15 years; and increasingly less negative from FY

2030 to 2045. Whether the cash gap or alternative gap is used, the large projected shortfalls of

sustainable revenue relative to spending represent a constraint on policy options to improve

pension funding levels.

4 Policy responses to pension funding concerns in Illinois

4.1 Pre-2010: decades of inaction

       Despite the long-standing funding concerns, and numerous calls over the years to address

them, there have been very few policies enacted to improve pension funding. Ironically, the

single most consequential response to these funding shortfalls was not to find a mechanism for

improving funding, but rather to make the commitment to pay the promised benefits even more

binding on the state. In 1970, delegates to the Sixth Illinois Constitutional Convention added a

clause to the state constitution that provides substantial legal protections to pension benefits.

Specifically, Article XIII, Section 5 of the State of Illinois Constitution now states:

       Membership in any pension or retirement system of the state, any unit of local
       government or school district, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, shall be an
       enforceable contractual relationship, the benefits of which shall not be diminished or
       impaired.

       Although we discuss legal interpretations in more detail below, it is notable that this

constitutional clause increases the legal security of benefits for participants but does not require

the state to prefund the benefits. Indeed, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled in 1998 that a failure to

fund the pensions did not constitute an impairment of benefits. In Sklodowski v. Illinois (1998),

beneficiaries of several state public pension systems filed a lawsuit seeking the state to

appropriate the funds necessary to meet funding obligations contained in the Illinois pension

code. The Court noted that:



                                                 12
        The pension protection clause contained in the 1970 Constitution served to eliminate any
        uncertainty as to whether state and local governments were obligated to pay pension
        benefits to their employees.

The Court went on to say that:

        These allegations of underfunding are insufficient as a matter of law to constitute an
        impairment of benefits. Plaintiffs … have alleged only an opinion that present funding
        levels are insufficient, from a prudential standpoint, to meet the accrued future
        obligations of the funds. The claims contain no factual allegations that would support a
        finding that the funds at issue are "on the verge of default or imminent bankruptcy" such
        that benefits are in immediate danger of being diminished.

        In short, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that the constitution requires benefits be paid,

but not that they be funded. Thus, the constitution increases the security of pension benefits, but

at the cost of substantially reducing the state's flexibility to address fiscal shortfalls through

changes to public pension benefits.

        Just a few years after the adoption of the 1970 constitution, the Illinois General Assembly

adopted a funding rule linking state pension contributions to pension payouts. Madiar (2014)

explains that the legislature, beginning in fiscal year 1973, enacted a policy of making state

contributions equal to 100 percent of what the systems were expected to pay out in benefits that

year. It was recognized even at the time that this approach would lead to a deterioration of

funding status. Madiar (2014: 6) quotes the 1975-1977 Pension Commission as noting that this

funding scheme was "unacceptable since it result[ed] in a deferment of the burden of financing

currently incurred benefit obligations to future generations of taxpayers." Nonetheless, this

approach to funding was followed through 1981. The commitment to funding declined further in

1981 when then-Governor Thompson announced that the state would contribute only 60 percent

of the estimated payouts, and portrayed this as a way to reduce pressure on the state budget.

From 1982 to 1995, Madiar (2014: 7) notes that "pegging state pension contributions to at or

below 60 percent of payout became the state's de facto funding policy."



                                                  13
       In 1994, the Illinois legislature passed and then-Governor Edgar signed Public Act 88-

593, which created a new funding path for public pensions. There are at least three notable

features of this plan. First, the funding goal was set at only 90 percent of liabilities (calculated

using standard actuarial calculations including the use of expected returns as a discount rate,

which has the effect of making the liabilities appear smaller). Second, the path to this funding

level was stretched over 50 years, reaching the 90 percent funding level in 2045. Third, the

funding plan was back-loaded, with a 15-year "funding ramp" that kept contributions well below

standard actuarial levels in the early years. By 2010, the state's required contributions under this

law were to be set at a level where they would remain a constant fraction of payroll sufficient to

reach 90 percent funding by 2045.

       Since 1995, the state has not consistently met even these funding requirements. Even

when the state did make substantial contributions, it was often done in a manner that partly

reduced the impact of the funding. For example, then-Governor Blagojevich issued $10 billion of

Pension Obligation Bonds (POBs) in 2003. Although this helped boost the funding status of the

plans, the authorizing legislation also provided that state contributions be reduced by the amount

of principal and interest paid on the bonds (CoGFA 2014). Effectively, the state was borrowing

money, investing it in the pension funds, and betting that the returns on the pension portfolio

would exceed interest paid on the bonds. Then in Fiscal Years 2006 and 2007, the state enacted

"pension holidays" to reduce its contributions for those years below that specified in the already

back-loaded 1994 law.

       POBs were issued again in FY 2010 and FY 2011, in each case with the proceeds being

treated as part of that year's pension contributions. It is important to note that this approach to

using POBs does virtually nothing to boost the pension plan's funding status over the long-term.




                                                  14
Conceptually, a state could convert implicit pension debt – in the form of benefit obligations – to

explicit debt, thereby providing a mechanism for reducing unfunded liabilities. But rather than

using POBs to reduce unfunded pension obligations in this way, Illinois has instead used them as

a source of funds for making statutorily scheduled annual pension contributions. This, in turn,

allows the legislature to avoid higher taxes or spending cuts in other programs in the short-run.

Effectively, the POBs end up having little to do with pensions, and instead serve as a form of

general borrowing by the state.

       Calculation of pension funding ratios, as shown in Figure 2, include plan assets in the

numerator and plan liabilities in the denominator. This calculation does not include liabilities in

the form of POBs. Figure 5 reproduces the plan-only pension funding ratios (from Figure 2) for

the last 20 years, compared to an alternative measure which has both plan liabilities and POB

liabilities in the denominator. When all pension related liabilities are included, Illinois' funding

ratio is even lower – ranging from 6 percent lower in 2004 to 3 percent lower in 2014.

                                        <<Figure 5 here>>

       All in all, the State of Illinois' record at dealing with pension funding over the past

century can best be described as one of consistently contributing at a rate below that required to

bring the systems to full funding. With the pension funding "ramp-up" of contributions as a share

of payroll from the 1994 law being fully phased-in by FY 2010, the statutorily required annual

pension contributions accounted for $4.0 billion, or 17.7 percent of total state-source General

Fund revenues (CoGFA 2010). These facts, among other factors, finally put Illinois pension

reform on the political and legislative agenda.




                                                  15
4.2 The creation of a two tier system in 2010

       In 2010, the Illinois legislature passed Public Act 96-0889, which created a "two tier"

pension system. Tier I included all public employees hired on or before December 31, 2010. Tier

II created a new and substantially less generous system for state workers hired on or after

January 1, 2011. The key differences between the tiers are summarized in Table 2, and include

changes to vesting, normal retirement age, the definition of final rate of earnings, a reduction in

the post-retirement benefit increases, and a cap on pensionable earnings.

                                         <<Table 2 here>>

       The much smaller benefits being provided to Tier II workers could make it more difficult

for Illinois to meet minimum pension generosity requirements that are in place for states that

opted out of the Social Security program for state workers. According to the executive director of

TRS, "because the Tier II law limits the growth of Tier II benefits to a rate that is slower than the

growth of Social Security benefits, in the future a Tier II benefit will be smaller than the

minimum Social Security 'safe harbor' benefit" (Ingram 2015). If benefits do fall below the safe

harbor, then either the state will need to increase benefit generosity or it will need to require that

TRS and SURS participants now exempt from Social Security – and the school districts or

universities that employ them – start paying Social Security payroll taxes.

       Because this new Tier II benefit structure applied only to individuals who were not yet

employees of the state as of the time the law took effect, this reform did not diminish or impair

benefits of any existing employees, and thus did not cause constitutional concerns. The other side

of the coin, however, is that this reform had very little effect on the pre-existing unfunded

obligations of the system, or any meaningful effect on the near-term cash outflows. Thus,

political pressure to enact more far-reaching reform continued to build.




                                                  16
4.3 The 2013 Illinois pension reform

       Efforts to reform Illinois pensions reached a fever pitch in 2013. During the spring

legislative session, two major reform bills were being pushed, one by the powerful House

Speaker Madigan, and the other by Senate President Cullerton. Both sought to reduce the

Automatic Annual Increase (AAI), which provides a 3 percent annually compounded benefit

increase to retirees. Although commonly referred to as a COLA, it is important to note that the

AAI is set at 3 percent annually regardless of the rate of inflation. As noted earlier, this makes

the AAI a rather expensive provision – both in absolute dollar terms and relative to other states –

at least given current inflation expectations. The two bills differed substantially in their

approach. The Madigan-sponsored bill imposed a reduction in the AAI, capping it the lesser of 3

percent or ½ of the CPI. The Cullerton bill, which garnered some support from labor unions,

offered a lower AAI in return for state funding guarantees and access to retiree health care,

among other provisions. Importantly, the access to retiree health care would be implemented by

removing already existing retiree health care from employees that chose not to accept the AAI

reduction, rather than adding it as a benefit to those that did.

       Neither bill was able to pass both houses of the Illinois General Assembly, and thus

negotiations continued in the summer (including a report of a ten-member, bipartisan, bicameral

committee) and into the fall. Finally, the legislature passed Senate Bill 1 (SB1) on December 3,

2013 and was signed by the Governor as Public Act 98-599 two days later. The law applied to

four of the five public plans outlined above: the judges' plan was omitted, presumably to avoid

conflicts of interest in the inevitable court challenges that were to follow. The reform included

numerous provisions and was set to take effect on July 1, 2014.




                                                  17
       Under this new law, the AAI would be reduced from 3 percent of the total pension

amount, compounded annually, to 3 percent of the lesser of the total annuity or $1,000 times the

number of years of service (with the $1,000 multiplier increased each year by CPI inflation).

This represents a substantial cut in the present value of future benefits for higher earners. The

legislation also required that individuals "skip" the automatic annual increase for a number of

years based on their age at the time of reform, with older workers losing one year of AAI and

younger workers losing up to five years of AAI.

       A second provision would reduce earnings included in the pension formula from the

current IRS maximum ($255,000 in 2013) to $110,631 in fiscal year 2015. Individuals already in

the system earning over this cap would be grandfathered and capped at their June 2014 salary,

but would not see any growth in their pensionable salary unless and until the plan cap grows with

inflation to surpass their grandfathered amount. As noted by Brown (2014), for individuals

subject to the cap, an additional year of work will increase the nominal value of their future

pension by only 2.2 percent of the cap, meaning that if inflation were to be above 2.2 percent,

additional years of work would result in negative real pension accruals.

       A third provision would increase the normal retirement age up to five years. This would

be phased in at approximately 4 months per year, starting with those age 45 in 2014.

       A fourth provision would reduce a key interest rate used to calculate benefits under the

"money purchase" option. This feature, which was suggested in a proposal by Brown et al.

(2013), would reduce the assumed Effective Rate of Interest from its 2013 level of 7.75 percent

to 75 basis points over the 30-year Treasury bond rate. The lower formula rate would reduce the

likelihood that the money purchase method of calculating benefits would exceed that of the

standard benefit formula.




                                                 18
         A fifth provision would reduce employee contributions from 8 percent of pay to 7 percent

of pay. All else equal, a reduction in contributions obviously harms the funding status of the

system. This was, however, an attempt by the legislature to convince the courts that participants

were being given something of value in return for the changes to benefits, and thus the law

should be held constitutional (more on this below).

         A sixth provision of the law would create an optional defined contribution (DC) plan that

individuals can elect in exchange for stopping future benefit accruals under the DB system. As

designed, however, the optional DC plan does not appear to be financially attractive (Brown

2014).

         Brown (2014) illustrates the net effect of these provisions on benefits of hypothetical

employees and finds the reductions to be quite substantial, especially for higher income

employees. Under his stylized calculations, a worker earning $40,000 per year would see no

immediate impact on her initial pension, although the reduction in the automatic annual increase

would lead to a 5 percent reduction in the present value of all future benefits. In contrast, an

individual earning $120,000 would experience a cut of 50 percent at retirement, and a 56 percent

cut in the present value of future benefits. Brown (2014) notes that one can construct examples

of high income individuals for whom the present value of benefit reductions would be over 70

percent.

4.4 Fiscal impact of 2013 pension law

         Even though, as discussed later, the 2013 pension reform law (SB1) was eventually found

to be unconstitutional, we apply the Fiscal Futures Model to estimate its would-be fiscal impact.

Figure 6 shows projections of the cash gap for existing pension law (the ramp-up of

contributions to 90 percent funding by 2045) compared to SB1. The dark line in Figure 6 is




                                                 19
identical to cash-gap projections for existing pension law shown in Figures 3 and 4. The light

colored line in Figure 6 show cash-gap projections assuming that the court had rules SB1

constitutional and that implementation began in FY 2016.4

                                              <<Figure 6 here>>

        Compared to existing law, SB1 reduces the cash-gap by about $2 billion per year for 10

years. The reduction in the cash gap grows thereafter, reaching $14 billion each year after the

100 percent funded ratio is reached in FY 2040, at which time state contributions would fall to

normal cost only. A key qualitative feature that jumps out from Figure 6 is that even if SB1 had

been upheld as constitutional, it addresses only a small fraction of the overall budget gap over

the next few decades. So even if SB1 had been upheld, Illinois would still have needed

substantial increases in revenue or substantial reductions in spending to restore any semblance of

fiscal balance.

4.5 The 2013 reform ruled unconstitutional

        Given the magnitude of the benefit cuts and the protective language of the Illinois

constitution, it is not surprising that the December 2013 law was quickly challenged in the

courts. In March 2014, five lawsuits filed by various parties in separate courts were ordered

consolidated and assigned to the circuit court of Sangamon County. In May 2014, the circuit

court enjoined implementation of the law (on its would-be June 1, 2014 effective date).

        The plaintiffs' case received a significant boost in July 2014 when the Illinois Supreme

Court – considering the separate issue of reductions in retiree health care benefits in the Kanerva


4
  Not shown here are adjusted-gap projections for SB1. Not surprisingly, SB1 has a beneficial (less negative) impact
on the adjusted gap compared to existing law. The magnitude of the annual savings from SB1 is around $2 billion in
the first several years of implementation, increases to around $8.5 billion in in the mid-2030s, and narrows to $3
billion by 2045. The most notable single year impact of SB1 is in the year of implementation – an immediate
reduction of the present value of future benefit liabilities in excess of $20 billion.



                                                        20
v. Weems (2014) case – ruled that "the state's provision of health insurance premium subsidies

for retirees is a benefit of membership in a pension or retirement system within the meaning of

article XIII, section 5, of the Illinois Constitution" and, as a result, these subsidies are

constitutionally protected. Not only were the justices reinforcing the strength of the non-

impairment clause, but in a development that was a surprise to many analysts, they extended the

non-impairment clause to cover retiree health benefits on the grounds that these were a benefit of

membership in state retirement systems.

          In November 2014, the Sangamon County circuit court struck down the pension reform

law, ruling that the non-impairment clause is "plain" and "unambiguous," and that the pension

reform law "without question diminishes and impairs the benefits of membership in state

retirement systems" (Belz 2014). The state immediately appealed the decision to the Illinois

Supreme Court.

          At oral arguments in March 2015, the state made the case that: (a) notwithstanding non-

impairment clause issues, (b) the state's "police powers" include abrogation of contracts in an

emergency, and (c) the state's current fiscal situation constitutes such an emergency. Solicitor

General Shapiro argued: 5

          Like all contracts, they can be altered. They are not absolute. Everyone in our case
          apparently agrees that … contractual relationships are subject to the limitations on the
          basis of a state's police power.

The plaintiff's attorney responded with:

          This is a case about a constitutional provision, one that is explicit, clear and
          unambiguous and that is subject to no stated exception. The state has not cited a single
          case where the reserve sovereign powers and police powers have been held to override a
          constitutional provision, and that's because there is no such case.

    The following quotes are excerpted from the "Chicago Tonight," WTTW-TV website (2015).



                                                       21
       In May 2015 in Heaton v. Quinn, the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed the lower court

ruling and declared Public Act 98-599 unconstitutional and unenforceable. Justice Karmeier

wrote the opinion for a unanimous court. As universally anticipated after its Kanerva v. Weems

(2014) decision, the court first decided that the reform law did "diminish or impair" pension

benefits and thus violated the pension protection clause of the Illinois Constitution.

       The court then dealt with the state's assertion of "police powers," framing the argument as

follows (Heaton v. Quinn: ¶52):

       [F]unding for the pension systems and State finances in general have become so dire that
       the General Assembly is authorized, even compelled, to invoke the State's "reserved
       sovereign powers," i.e., its police powers, to override the rights and protections afforded
       by article XIII, section 5, of the Illinois Constitution in the interests of the greater public
       good.

The court began by stating that in past cases where the state or a local Illinois government

claimed fiscal exigency to avoid making constitutionally protected expenditures, "we have

clearly and consistently found them to be improper (¶53)."

       The court then presented the standards applicable to this issue, drawing mostly from U.S.

Constitution "contract clause" cases. The basic standard is whether the impairment is "reasonable

and necessary to serve an important public purpose (¶62)." The court addressed a number of

issues under that standard.

      Were problems "unforeseen and unintended" (¶65)? No. "The General Assembly had

       available to it all the information it needed to estimate the long-term costs of those

       provisions [of the pension law it seeks to change]. … [I]t is a crisis for which the General

       Assembly itself is largely responsible (¶66)."




                                                 22
      Did the state choose the "least drastic means of addressing its financial difficulties"

       (¶68)? No. Other alternatives were discussed in hearings on the bill and the General

       Assembly chose not adopt a permanent tax increase (¶¶67-68).

      Did the law "distribute the burdens evenly" (¶69)? No. Tier I pension recipients would

       bear the whole cost, not taxpayers generally.

       Having determined that the law did violate the constitutional protection of pension

benefits and the state's claim of police powers did not meet other standards of "necessary and

reasonable," the court did not have to evaluate the severity of the state's fiscal crisis in making its

decision. The court did say (¶87):

       The financial challenges facing state and local governments in Illinois are well known
       and significant. In ruling as we have today, we do not mean to minimize the gravity of the
       State's problems or the magnitude of the difficulties facing our elected representatives.
       [But]… Crisis is not an excuse to abandon the rule of law. It is a summons to defend it.

5 Post-ruling pension reform options

5.1 Governor Rauner's 2015 proposal

       Republican Bruce Rauner took office as the new Illinois Governor in January 2015. A

month later, on February 18, 2015, he issued his first budget address (Rauner 2015a). In it, he

called for a new round of reforms for Illinois pensions, noting that action would be needed

regardless of what the Supreme Court decided regarding the 2013 law. After the Illinois Supreme

Court invalidated the 2013 reform bill, Governor Rauner reasserted the importance of his plan.

       The core of his proposal is to freeze benefits of Tier I employees as of July 1, 2015 and

permit no further accruals. For work after this date, additional pension accruals would operate

according to the Tier II benefit structure explained above. Alternatively, workers would be

permitted to opt for a defined contribution (DC) plan on a going forward basis. However, the

proposal also appears to require that those taking this "buyout" would accept a reduction in the



                                                  23
value of their automatic annual increase on benefits earned prior to July 1, 2015, and in return

receive a lump-sum contribution to their new DC plan. The new DC plan would include an

employer match, although the details of that match have not yet been specified.

       There are at least three major obstacles to the Governor's proposal. First, it appears to be

dead on arrival in the Democratic controlled House and Senate. Second, the constitutionality of

this proposal remains unclear. The Governor clearly argues in his budget documents (Rauner

2015b: 2-16) that this would be constitutional because the changes "do not reduce earned

benefits." There is nothing in the Illinois Supreme Court's ruling (Heaton v. Quinn 2015) that

suggests the constitutional protections as only applying to accrued benefits and not prospective

benefits. Third, the savings from the Rauner plan come from calculating prospective benefits for

Tier I members using the Tier II formula. As already noted, the low COLA for Tier II will

eventually lead to benefits below the Social Security "safe harbor" level and trigger costly

payroll tax contributions.

5.2 Limited options for cost-saving pension reforms remain

       The 2010 two-tier reform reduced far-distant pension costs but did nothing to reduce the

already accumulated legacy costs of unfunded pension liabilities. Beyond the possibility that

benefits on the prospective earnings of Tier I workers can legally be cut, which few outside the

Rauner administration believe, there is not much that can be done to reduce pension legacy costs.

       Pension legacy costs must still be dealt with, however, by cutting other spending or by

raising new revenues. The path of least political resistance may be to extend the amortization

period for the unfunded liability over a longer time period and/or once again back-load

payments. This would continue the long-standing tradition in Illinois of continuing to shift the

cost to future taxpayers.




                                                24
6 Conclusion

        Illinois is an unfortunate but useful case study of the fiscal strain placed on states that run

large negative fiscal imbalances for many decades. Illinois' public pensions have essentially been

used as a source of borrowing, allowing the state to keep taxes lower and other spending higher

than would be permitted if the state followed a more balanced budget process.

        Public pensions are part of the fiscal challenges in Illinois, but not for the reasons often

asserted in public discussions. Policy makers, reporters, and other commentators often point to

"excessive" public pensions as the root of all of Illinois' budget woes. Although it is quite easy to

find examples of abuses in the Illinois pension system, as well as examples of individuals

receiving extremely generous annual pension benefits that substantially exceed those available to

the average private sector pension participant, our illustrative calculations suggest that those

situations are not the norm. Indeed, the data suggests that Illinois public pensions are not outliers

compared to the generosity of other state pensions around the country. Some commentators will

argue that public pensions in all states are too generous, an issue that we make no attempt to

address in this paper. Rather, our point is that relative to public pensions in other states, Illinois

pensions are not outliers in terms of generosity but they are outliers in terms of their funding

status. This implies rather strongly that inadequate contributions to the pension funds are the

primary cause of the low funding ratios of the state's pension plans.

        Our examination of fiscal practices in Illinois reveals that accumulation of unfunded

pension liabilities is just one – though overwhelmingly the largest – of many time-shifting

budget practices and part of an overall pattern of delaying payment and avoiding policy changes

that would restore fiscal sustainability. The state has repeatedly shifted Medicaid payments to

future years and allowed bills to other vendors to remain unpaid for months. Illinois has also




                                                  25
routinely relied on one-time revenue sources, assets sales, balance transfers across funds and

borrowing to pay for ongoing operations.

          Looking forward, projections of future revenues and expenditures indicate that the budget

gap will continue to widen, which will require additional revenue and/or spending reductions to

rectify. Further, the accumulation of liabilities from past years represent a large claim on future

budgets. An increasing share of those sustainable revenues that are available in future years will

be devoted to payoff of these legacy costs, crowding out what is left to pay for other state

services. Interestingly, this would be true even if the 2013 Illinois pension reform law had been

upheld.
