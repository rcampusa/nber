                                             ABSTRACT

We document a strong correlation in the brand of automobile chosen by parents and their adult children,
using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. This correlation could represent transmission
of brand preferences across generations, or it could result from correlation in family characteristics
that determine brand choice. We present a variety of empirical specifications that lend support to the
former interpretation and to a mechanism that relies at least in part on state dependence. We then discuss
implications of intergenerational brand preference transmission for automakers’ product-line strategies
and for the strategic pricing of vehicles to different age groups.

1    Introduction
Economic models generally treat consumer preferences as exogenous and fixed. However,
recent studies on tastes for food (Birch 1999; Logan and Rhode 2010; Atkin Forthcoming),
female labor supply (Fernández, Fogli and Olivetti 2004), packaged goods (Bronnenberg,
Dubé and Gentzkow 2012), and preferences for redistribution (Luttmer and Singhal 2011)
suggest that tastes and preferences may form endogenously through prior behavior, con-
sumption, and experience. Such endogeneity has the potential to transform our view of
market behavior and public policy by creating a dynamic link between consumption today
and welfare tomorrow. For example, long-lived firms considering their pricing strategy to-
day may think ahead to how market share, and consequent brand loyalty, will affect demand
among future consumers.
    The focus in economics on models of stable exogenous preferences is at least partially
pragmatic. Models that allow for endogenous preference formation present technical and
empirical challenges, and it is difficult to identify factors that influence preferences in most
settings. One influence that is both plausibly important and potentially manageable is the
family, which has proven to be fertile ground in prior work (Fernández et al. 2004; Logan and
Rhode 2010; Atkin Forthcoming). Families may transmit preferences across generations, not
only through immutable genetic endowments, but also through environment and experience.
Thus, research on the intergenerational transmission of preferences may provide a better
understanding of endogenous preference formation more generally.
    In this paper, we empirically investigate the intergenerational transmission of prefer-
ences for automobile brands (e.g., Ford) and explore the implications of our results for the
automobile market. Automobiles are particularly interesting because they represent a large,
infrequent consumer purchase and because the industry remains crucial to the U.S. economy.
Brands are interesting in that they represent a “soft” attribute for which we might expect
preferences to be especially malleable. That is, it is difficult to see why a consumer would
inherently prefer Ford over GM for purely exogenous reasons, such as genetics. Instead, it
seems natural to expect such preferences to arise from experience and context.
    Our investigation makes use of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), which is
unique in that it follows multiple households within the same family over time. In particular,
it surveys adult children who grew up in a PSID household but have since left and formed
their own households. In several recent waves, the PSID has included questions about
automobile ownership. Using these data, we find strong correlations in automobile choices
across generations within a family. Specifically, a child whose parent has recently purchased
a given brand is 39% more likely to choose that same brand (a 5.6 percentage-point increase


                                               2
on a base of 14.3%) than a demographically similar child whose parent did not choose that
brand. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to document this correlation.
    We define brand preference somewhat broadly as a situation in which a consumer prefers
one automobile brand over another, holding constant major vehicle attributes (such as size
and performance) and consumer characteristics (including demographics and geography).1
This definition allows intergenerational brand preference transmission to be driven by either
intergenerational state dependence or direct brand preference inheritance. In intergenera-
tional state dependence, the brand choices of parents influence their children’s preferences
(and therefore choices) because children have contact with their parents’ vehicles and de-
velop tastes for minor design details or nostalgic childhood associations with a brand, or
because parental ownership generates information about performance and reliability that is
conveyed to children. In direct brand preference inheritance, the brand preferences of parents
influence their children’s preferences (and therefore choices) independently of parental brand
choices. For instance, parents might tell their children about their long-term affinity for a
brand, or parents might learn about a brand from friends or advertisements and then convey
this information to their children prior to purchasing the brand themselves. Since either
mechanism can independently create cross-household correlation in brand choices, separate
identification of these two mechanisms in our data is difficult. We do find, however, that the
correlation between the brand choices of parents and the subsequent choices of their children
is stronger for vehicles that were purchased while the children still lived at home and were
therefore more exposed to the vehicle. This evidence suggests that intergenerational state
dependence is at least one of the mechanisms driving the correlations we observe.
    Intergenerational correlation in brand choices could also arise from familial correlations of
demographic or geographic factors that determine brand choice. We attempt to insulate our
estimates from these more mundane correlations in several ways. First, we demonstrate that
controlling for the rich set of demographic factors available in the PSID has little effect on our
estimated brand choice correlations. Second, we show that correlations remain strong when
fine geographic controls are introduced non-parametrically. Finally, we repeat our analyses
for a pair of firms (GM and Ford) that produce very similar models with common attributes,
which limits the degree to which unobserved characteristics could be determining choice.
That is, while there are many demographic characteristics that might lead an individual
to choose a BMW over a Ford, it is more difficult to imagine characteristics that might
cause an individual to prefer a GM over a Ford, apart from brand preference itself. We
ultimately find strong intergenerational correlations for Ford and GM buyers as well. While
these results argue in favor of true intergenerational preference transmission, we cannot
  1
      The distinction between attributes and brands can be blurry, as we discuss below.


                                                      3
definitively rule out the possibility that demographic or geographic factors partly explain
the brand correlations we observe.
    Intergenerational brand preference transmission has several implications for automakers’
strategies. Such transmission enhances the advantage that brand loyalty gives to incumbent
firms because young consumers—who would otherwise be free of loyalty to any firm—arrive
at the new car market with preferences inherited from their parents. Furthermore, under
the state dependence mechanism, automakers gain loyalty among a future generation of
customers when they sell cars to parents, which puts downward pressure on the prices of
vehicles targeted to parents. Finally, it is widely believed in the industry that a brand’s
entry-level vehicles increase firm profits in part by “leading” young consumers to purchase
more expensive models from the same firm later in life. In the presence of intergenerational
transmission, targeting expensive models to older consumers will also increase profits in the
entry-level market by endowing young consumers with brand loyalty, generating a closed
loop of benefits to vertical product differentiation. We discuss these results further in the
body of the paper, and we flesh out the potential implications for pricing behavior more fully
in the appendix, where we derive and calibrate a simple model.
    Our analysis relates to several existing literatures. First, as discussed above, our research
relates to the nascent literature on endogenous preference formation. Much of that literature
centers on preferences for food, which in contrast to automobiles is characterized by small
and frequent repeat purchases.
    Second, previous work has studied brand loyalty in the automobile market (Mannering
and Winston 1985, 1991; Train and Winston 2007). While these papers document within-
household brand loyalty, the automobile literature has, to the best of our knowledge, not
previously documented intergenerational correlation in brand choice.
    Third, our paper relates to the broader literature that studies the magnitude and im-
plications of within-household brand loyalty (sometimes referred to as switching costs) and
brand preference persistence. A number of papers, such as Klemperer (1987), Dubé, Hitsch
and Rossi (2009), Doganoglu (2010), and Somaini and Einav (Forthcoming), focus on the
implications of brand loyalty for equilibrium prices, while others focus on empirically doc-
umenting the strength of brand loyalty and brand preferences, typically examining markets
for consumer packaged goods (Bronnenberg, Dhar and Dubé 2009; Dubé, Hitsch and Rossi
2010; Bronnenberg et al. 2012). Relative to consumer packaged goods, automobiles are much
larger expenses, they are purchased less frequently, and the product offerings are more het-
erogeneous. Brand loyalty in the automobile sector typically involves individuals purchasing
quite different products that share a brand label, whereas the literature on packaged goods
is better characterized as repeat purchases of the same item. For small purchases, brand


                                               4
loyalty may be understood as a heuristic to aid in quick decision-making, which is likely
quite different from the role that brands play in purchasing an automobile.
    Finally, our work has parallels in the extensive peer-effects and social interactions litera-
tures (see Manski 1993, 2000). Whereas much of this literature studies how individuals are
influenced by the aggregate behavior and characteristics of a reference group, we focus on
how parents and children are influenced by the choices and preferences of a small number of
individual family members. Of course, peer effects in automobile purchasing likely extend
beyond the family to friends, neighbors, and co-workers. We view parent-to-child preference
transmission as a particularly important case of this broader set of peer effects because: (a)
parent-child pairs are often more easily identified in data than many other relationships;
(b) parent-child relationships have been shown (often using PSID data) to be particularly
important for many other economic variables such as income and education (Solon 1992,
1999; Black and Devereux 2011); and (c) our data indicate that parent-to-child transmission
is more powerful than that for other within-family links, such as sibling-to-sibling.
    The balance of the paper is structured as follows. In section 2 we present a framework
for interpreting cross-household correlations in brand choices. We then describe our data in
section 3, and we report our empirical results regarding correlations in brand choice across
generations in section 4. Section 5 discusses the implications of intergenerational brand
preference transmission for automobile markets. Section 6 concludes.


2     Conceptual model of intergenerational vehicle choice
In this section, we present a simple model of household vehicle choice that clarifies possible
mechanisms by which choices may be correlated across families and the empirical challenges
of separately identifying them. We begin by noting that the distinction between vehicle
brands—on which we focus in this paper—and vehicle attributes is blurry. It is tempting to
define a brand as something that is independent of all vehicle attributes, as if, for instance,
Ford and GM vehicles were identical apart from the logo stamped on the grill. In practice,
vehicles of different brands will differ in “minor” features, including trim style, dashboard
layouts, and perceived reliability, even for cars that share identical measurable characteristics
such as size, power, and cargo space. We define a brand in a way that encompasses these
“minor” characteristics so that a brand preference might be derived from, for example, a
preference to have the dashboard controls laid out in a particular way. In contrast, when we
speak of preferences for attributes, we refer specifically to major vehicle characteristics, such
as class, horsepower, size, and fuel economy. We believe that making this distinction be-
tween brands and attributes, thusly defined, is useful because the transmission of preferences

                                               5
for brands has a different set of implications than does the transmission of preferences for
attributes. The former is primarily relevant for automakers’ pricing, marketing, and product
line strategies, while the latter is additionally relevant for public policies aimed at addressing
the externalities of vehicle use.
    Consider a household i in family f that purchases vehicle j at time t. Let the utility that
household i derives from this purchase be denoted by:

                                 Uif jt = f (Dif t , Xj ; β) + θif jt ,                       (1)

where Dif t denotes a vector of observed and unobserved demographic and location-specific
characteristics of household i, such as income, education, climate, and terrain. These char-
acteristics interact with Xj , which denotes the attributes (including brand) of vehicle j,
through the function f (·) and parameter vector β. This interaction allows observable and
unobservable characteristics of households and their locations to influence vehicle choice in
a variety of ways. For example, rural households may tend to choose pickup trucks, wealthy
households may tend to purchase large SUVs, pro-union households may tend to purchase
U.S. brands, and households living close to a Ford dealership may tend to purchase Fords.
Finally, θif jt denotes a preference for vehicle j that is unrelated to demographic or location-
specific factors. We focus on influences from other family members as determinants of θif jt ,
but other factors may exist, such as exposure to advertisements, prior driving experiences,
idiosyncratic tastes (e.g., for a particular color or trim), or vehicle market conditions at the
time of purchase.
    Intergenerational brand preference transmission is expressed in our model as a correla-
tion in θif jt across households within families, which leads to correlation in vehicle brand
choices. Cross-household correlation in θif jt could stem from intergenerational state depen-
dence, whereby parental choices influence child preferences. For example, if a child’s parents
purchased a string of GM vehicles, then that child may have nostalgic feelings for GM, a
taste for the unique features of GM’s design (e.g., the layout of the instrument panel or the
feel of the seats), superior information about GM’s performance and reliability, or simply
a “comfort level” with the brand. Alternatively, correlation in θif jt could arise from direct
inheritance of preferences from parent to child in a way that is not mediated by brand choice
itself. For instance, parents might have a belief that Fords have a better-looking trim than
do GMs and instill this belief in their children during their childhood. Direct preference
inheritance can also occur later in life. For example, parents might be exposed to a positive
review of Ford and tell their children about what they read. This mechanism may ultimately
lead to a correlation of parents’ and children’s choices, but it does not operate through state


                                                   6
dependence or experience.
    Correlations in households’ vehicle choices may also arise through cross-household corre-
lations in Dif t . It is natural to expect such correlations to exist; Solon (1992), for example,
documents strong intergenerational correlation of income. If households with high incomes
are more likely to purchase SUVs and European luxury brands, then this correlation in in-
come across generations will lead to correlations in vehicle choices across generations. Thus,
a fundamental empirical challenge of our work is to identify vehicle choice correlations that
arise from preference transmission (due to either intergenerational state dependence or direct
preference inheritance) separately from those that arise from similarities in demographic and
geographic characteristics. This identification is important because it is only the former set
of channels that is relevant for the strategic implications we consider.
    Ideally, we would identify “true” transmission of vehicle preferences from parents to chil-
dren using an instrumental variable that shifts the choices or preferences of parents but
not their children. However, all of our attempts in this direction have been substantially
underpowered given our modest sample size.2 We therefore employ several alternative ap-
proaches. First, we leverage the wealth of demographic and location information within
the PSID dataset to control directly for potential confounding factors. Despite being able
to use a rich set of covariates (including census tract fixed effects), one might nonetheless
be concerned that influential unobserved factors remain. For instance, if a family is pro-
union, all of that family’s households might have a preference for U.S. brands. Thus, we also
investigate subsets of the data for which unobserved factors are unlikely to be important,
focusing in particular on choices between Ford and GM because both of these automakers
produce a wide range of models with similar attributes and are “iconic” U.S.-based firms.
The intuition behind studying this subsample is that the identifying assumption (i.e., that
variation in parents’ brand choices is driven by idiosyncratic brand preferences, conditional
on demographics and location) is more plausible than in the full sample of all brands. In the
absence of a viable instrumental variable strategy, we believe that this subsample approach
offers the strongest evidence in favor of intergenerational brand preference transmission that
these data can provide.
    An even more challenging empirical problem is the separate identification of the extent
to which brand preference transmission is driven by state dependence or direct preference
inheritance. This distinction is important when considering implications of brand preference
   2
     The most obvious instrumental variable is the U.S. market share of the parents’ chosen brand at the
time of the parents’ purchase. However, in an IV version of the regression corresponding to column 2 of table
2, the first-stage F-statistic for this instrument is only 7.06, and the estimated coefficient on parents’ brand
is -0.127 with a standard error of 0.344. This result compares to an OLS coefficient of 0.093 and standard
error of 0.008, as reported below.



                                                       7
transmission for firms’ pricing strategies. If only direct preference inheritance is at play, then
lowering prices to boost market share among parents will not affect their children’s future
demand for a brand, whereas the opposite is true if state dependence is at work. This identi-
fication problem is similar to one common in the marketing literature, in which one observes
a series of brand choices by a single household and then tries to determine whether that
household’s choices are state-dependent or whether they simply reflect a serially-correlated
preference for a particular brand (see, for example, Dubé et al. (2010)). Ideally, we would
solve this problem using an instrumental variable, such as vehicle prices, that affects parents’
brand choices but not their preferences. However, this strategy is severely under-powered in
our setting.3 Therefore, we adopt the alternative strategy of studying systematic patterns
in brand choice correlations that speak differentially to state dependence versus preference
inheritance. In particular, sub-section 4.4 studies whether the observed choice correlations
are stronger when households have a relatively high level of exposure to the choices of their
parents.
    Finally, we note that when we study correlations between children’s and parents’ pur-
chases, it may be that the child is influencing the parent rather than the other way around.
While some of our specifications will explicitly include child-to-parent (and sibling-to-sibling)
transmission in the estimated correlations, for the most part we attempt to focus on parent-
to-child preference transmission by studying cases in which the parents’ purchase preceded
their child’s. These cases—particularly when we include lagged child’s purchases in the
regression in section 4.3—isolate the transmission direction for the state dependence mech-
anism though not necessarily for the direct preference inheritance mechanism.


3     Data
Our data on vehicle ownership come from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). In
1968, the PSID surveyed a nationally representative sample of households, and since then it
has asked them a battery of economic and demographic questions every year until 1997 and
every two years thereafter. The PSID collects information on everyone who lives in a PSID
household, but it also follows members of the original PSID sample households and their
children whenever they join or create a new household. As a result, the survey now collects
information on many households that are members of the same extended family.
    The PSID began collecting information on vehicles in 1999. Respondents report the

     Clearly, if the market share instrument discussed above fails to yield sufficient power, a price instrument
will fail as well because price effects operate through market shares. Moreover, to the extent that price
changes are driven by demand shocks, this instrument may not cleanly separate state dependence from
preference inheritance.

total number of vehicles that they own or lease and additional detailed information on up to
three vehicles, including vehicle make, model, and vintage, as well as the date of purchase,
purchase price, and whether the vehicle was a gift. These data are available from surveys
conducted in 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011. To the best of our knowledge,
the PSID is unique in providing such information for families in the United States.
    Our primary focus is on how parental vehicle brand choices correlate with the choices of
their adult children. Accordingly, our baseline sample is limited to adult heads of household
(or spouses) who purchase a car in the sample and for whom we can identify a parent
who owned a vehicle prior to their child’s vehicle purchase. We identify 4,338 unique adult
children matched to 2,587 unique parents. The difference between the number of parents
and children is due to the fact that there are many siblings in our sample.4
    Table 1 shows sample means for both children and parents in this sample. Adult children
are on average 36 years old, whereas parents are 59. Adult children have higher household
income, one more year of education (13.5 as opposed to 12.5), and larger household sizes,
which accords with the likelihood that they have young children that are still living at home.
We observe 16,054 unique vehicle purchases by these 4,388 adult children. Excluded from
this sample are vehicles that were received as gifts and vehicles that are likely to have been
within-family cross-household sales.5 In cases where parents are separated, but both are
present in the PSID and both have a prior vehicle purchase available, we match the child’s
vehicle choice with data from both parents.6 There are 1,214 such cases, which gives us

     Specifically, we drop a child’s vehicle purchase if the parent household owned the same make, model, and
model-year in the previous survey wave and subsequently no longer owns the vehicle following the child’s
purchase.
   6
     In these cases we weight each vehicle-parent pair by half so that choices that appear twice in our data
are weighted equally to those that appear once.

4       Empirical evidence of intergenerational brand pref-
        erence transmission
In this section, we develop and estimate a linear probability model (LPM) of the relationship
between brand choices of children and the choices of their parents, as well as other covariates.
We employ a LPM rather than a structural discrete choice model because it is more forgiving
to the extensive geographic and time fixed effects that we use in our estimation, though this
comes at the cost of not being able to interpret our coefficient estimates as parameters of a
utility function.
     To operationalize our brand choice data in the LPM framework, we first categorize all
vehicle choices as being one of seven “brands”: GM, Ford, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, Other
Asian, and European. Grouping smaller Asian automakers and European manufacturers
together ensures that each brand is chosen frequently enough to yield meaningful estimates
in a linear probability framework (these brand definitions imply that all choice probabilities
lie in the 4%–33% range in the raw data).7
     We build a linear probability model with multiple choice possibilities by stacking a set
of binary linear probability models for each of our 7 brands. To motivate our approach,
we first consider a linear probability model for a single brand. Our hypothesis is that
parental ownership of a given brand will make a child more likely to choose that brand.
For example, to test this hypothesis for Ford we could run a linear probability model in
which the dependent variable is coded as one if the child was observed to choose a Ford. In
addition to controls for the child’s demographics and parents’ demographics, our regressor
of interest would be a dummy variable for the parents’ brand choice, which would be coded
as 1 if the parents’ most recent vehicle purchased prior to the child’s purchase was a Ford.8
    7
     In order to test whether the correlation across generations is coming from a correlated preference for
brand (e.g., Ford) or sub-brand (e.g., Ford, Lincoln, or Mercury), we have run subsets of our regressions
with 41 sub-brands instead of the 7 brands, interacting our control variables with all 41 sub-brands. In
general, we find that both the overall brand and the sub-brand of the parent have a statistically significant
correlation with the sub-brand chosen by the adult child.
   8
     Year of purchase is recorded for all but a handful of very old cars, which we dropped. Month of purchase
is missing for 37% of all child and 31% of all parent purchases, however, including all purchases in the 2009
and 2011 waves. In establishing whether a parent vehicle was purchased before a child vehicle, we treat these
observations conservatively by coding parent purchase months as December and child purchase months as
January.




                                                     10
The one-brand estimation equation would be:

                         F ordif t =γ · F ordpf t + Xift 0 β + Xpft 0 δ + αt + if t ,                    (2)

where F ordif t is coded as 1 if child i of family f at time t chose a Ford, F ordpf t is coded as 1 if
parent p’s most recent choice before t was a Ford, αt is a period-specific constant to capture
Ford’s average market share in each period, Xift are the child’s observable demographic
characteristics, and Xpft are those of the parents. In this regression of “Ford against the
field”, all observations in our data are included.
    Instead of running 7 separate one-brand linear probability models, we stack them and
run pooled OLS. For each of our seven brands, we create an observation for each observed
choice situation (each car purchase) in which the dependent variable is coded as 1 if the
brand is chosen and zero otherwise. We do this for all seven brands and stack the data,
which generates a final data set that has seven times the number of observations as our
original data set that included one observation per choice.9
    We interact all of our regressors with brand dummies, thereby allowing observed de-
mographic and geographic factors to affect the choice probability of each brand differently.
Thus, all covariates are denoted with a j subscript or interacted with a coefficient vector of
length j. The one restriction that we impose is that the effect of the parents’ past brand
choice is common across brands.10 Thus, instead of seven dummy variables for parental
brands, there is only one dummy variable coded as 1 when the parental choice matches the
brand represented in the corresponding row of data for the child. For each child’s purchase,
exactly 1 of 7 observations will have the parental dummy variable coded as 1.
    This leads us to the following estimation equation:

                     bif jt =γ · 1(bpf jt = bif jt ) + Xift 0 βj + Xpft 0 δj + αjt + if jt ,             (3)

where the dependent variable, bif jt , is a dummy coded as 1 if child i of family f chose brand j
in choice t. The independent variable of primary interest is a dummy variable that indicates
   9
      Our procedure can also be described as expanding each observed choice as follows. For each vehicle
purchase by every individual in our data, we expand the original data sample to include seven lines of data.
The first is for the brand that was chosen by the individual, and this line has the dependent variable coded
as one. The other six are observations with a zero dependent variable, one for each of the six brands not
chosen.
   10
      By using the linear probability model, we do not impose a restriction that predicted values must be
between zero and one, nor do we require that the sum of the predicted values across the seven brands must
equal one for each choice situation. We have checked our predicted values for our baseline specifications, and
we find that the vast majority of predicted values are between zero and one, and those that deviate are very
small negative numbers. Similarly, the sum of the predicted values across the seven brands for each choice
situation are tightly distributed around 1.


                                                       11
whether the parents’ most recent prior purchase is of that same brand: 1(bpf jt = bif jt ).11
    Our hypothesis is that the γ coefficient will be positive; that is, children are more likely
to purchase a given brand if their parents have purchased that brand in the recent past. We
control for both child characteristics Xif t and parent’s characteristics Xpf t , which enter with
brand-specific coefficient vectors, βj and δj , that we estimate by interacting child and parent
characteristics with brand dummies. Finally, we allow for brand-by-month of purchase fixed
effects, αjt to capture overall market shares, leaving if jt as the error term.
    This setup expands each observed brand choice into seven observations. To avoid this
expansion of the data set unduly shrinking our standard error estimates, we cluster all
standard error calculations at the level of the 1968 PSID family. This clustering accounts
for the mechanical correlation in the residuals between the seven observations that represent
a single choice, the correlation in each individual’s choices across choice situations, and the
correlation across siblings or cousins. We also weight each observation using PSID-provided
sampling weights so that the original PSID households on which our sample is based can be
interpreted as representing the U.S. population at the time of the original survey.
    We do not allow for an outside good, which would be interpreted as the option to not
purchase a vehicle at all. Inclusion of an outside good is standard in discrete choice modeling,
but here we are interested in knowing whether or not a child, conditional on purchasing a
vehicle, decides to buy a brand that is the same as the one owned by members of his or
her family. Inclusion of an outside good would conflate correlations in choice that determine
whether or not individuals purchase vehicles with correlations in the brand chosen when
purchasing a vehicle, which are distinct phenomena.


4.1     Baseline results
We begin by showing simple correlations in order to demonstrate the strength of the intra-
family relationship and then demonstrate how the correlation is affected by various controls.
We focus here and in section 4.2 on separating intergenerational brand preference transmis-
sion from choice correlation driven by demographic or geographic factors. Section 4.3 then
studies whether the choice correlations are caused by short-run or long-run mechanisms, and
in section 4.4 we attempt to distinguish between the intergenerational state dependence and
  11
     We have experimented with a variety of ways of characterizing the parents’ choice given that parents
may own multiple vehicles. In section 4.3 below, we include additional lags of the parents’ choices. In section
4.4, we expand the dataset so that each child’s purchase is matched to all of the parents’ prior purchases,
not just the most recent purchase. We have also experimented with an independent variable measuring the
share of parents’ vehicles from a specific brand, as well as with matching child and parent vehicles one-to-one
based on the order in which the vehicles are listed in the survey. In all cases, our qualitative results are quite
similar.

   Standard errors clustered by 1968 PSID family are in parentheses. Each column is a linear probability
   model where each individual-year-vehicle choice enters the data 7 times, once for each brand (GM,
   Ford, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, Other Asian, and European). Child’s and parents’ demographics
   include age, education, income, gender, number of children in household, and family size. All control
   variables are interacted with 7 dummies, one for each brand. Columns 6 and 7 limit the sample to
   households living in census tracts that contain more than one PSID family.



direct brand preference inheritance mechanisms.
    Table 2 presents coefficient estimates of γ from equation 3, which regresses the brand
chosen by the child on a dummy for whether or not the parents’ most recent purchase is the
same brand. The estimate in column 1, which includes only month-of-purchase by brand
fixed effects that control for the overall share of each brand during each period, indicates
that a child is 9.6 percentage points more likely to choose the brand that her parents chose.
There are seven brands in our choice set, so the probability that the average brand is selected
is 0.143. Thus, our estimate implies that a child whose parents chose a particular brand is
67% more likely to choose that brand than another child whose parents chose differently.
    This is a remarkably strong relationship, but it may reflect not only the intergenerational
transmission of brand preference that we are interested in, but also familial correlations in
demographic and location-specific factors that cause related households to demand similar
attributes in vehicles, in turn causing a correlation in brand choice.
    As a first step toward addressing this issue, we introduce progressively richer controls in
columns 2 through 7 of table 2 and examine how the coefficient estimates change. In column
2 we add demographic controls (including family income, age, sex, education, number of kids
in the household, and household size) for the child’s household and the parents’ household.12
  12
    Each of these characteristics is interacted with a dummy for each brand, which is a flexible analog to
the traditional approach in the automobile demand literature of interacting vehicle attributes with buyer
characteristics. We additionally experimented with a large assortment of additional financial controls from


                                                    13
The addition of these controls lowers the estimated coefficient from 0.096 to 0.088. While the
modest impact of these controls on the estimated coefficient is encouraging, the regression’s
R2 also changes only slightly, from 0.085 to 0.096. Following the logic of Altonji, Elder and
Taber (2005), the fact that this modest increase in explained variation yields a measurable
drop in the estimated coefficient raises the possibility that, if unobserved demographic factors
that affect children’s brand choices are as correlated with parents’ choices as are the observed
demographic factors, then these unobservables may explain much of the observed brand
choice correlation. We further address this issue in section 4.2 where we focus on two
brands—Ford and GM—that have very similar attributes so that choices between them are
therefore unlikely to be affected by demographic factors.
    The remaining columns of table 2 address common geographic factors that might lead to
choice correlation. Column 3 adds state-by-brand fixed effects, which control for differences
in market shares and location-specific factors that vary by state. Column 4 adds analogous
fixed effects for parents. These fixed effects cause the estimated coefficient to fall from 0.088
to 0.075.
    Geographic factors, such as dealer location, local prices, weather, and terrain, may vary
significantly within some states. In column 5 we add county-by-brand fixed effects for the
child’s county of residence, which is intuitively a small enough geographic area to control for
most omitted factors that we have in mind. County fixed effects lower the point estimate
to 0.056, which is approximately 58% of the magnitude of the raw correlation and still
highly significant, both statistically and economically. This estimate implies that parental
ownership boosts the conditional probability that a child buys a given brand by 39%.
    We interpret the difference across columns in the estimated effects as evidence that some
location-specific factors are both important in determining brand choice and correlated across
family members (who tend to live in similar places). Weather, terrain, urbanization, and
culture are important determinants of the demand for attributes, which are different on
average across brands. Even conditional on demand, there may be a different availability of
brands across geographic areas due to the location of dealerships. In our view, most of these
differences should be captured by county-level fixed effects, so column 5 is our preferred
specification.
    Nonetheless, we can push further and include fixed effects for each census tract (a unit
of approximately 2,500 to 8,000 people) in the sample to address very fine-scale local factors
(local repair shops, for example). We are able to include these fixed effects because the
original PSID sample design drew stratified samples from particular geographic areas. The
the PSID, such as amounts spent on vacations, eating out, health insurance, clothes, and a variety of other
expenditures and found that these did not affect the estimates substantially.



                                                    14
legacy of that original sample design is that PSID households are still more geographically
clustered than would be the case for a random sample of households. That said, a large
number of census tracts in our sample hold only one PSID family, so to use census tract fixed
effects we must first restrict the sample to tracts in which we observe multiple families.13
Column 6 re-estimates the model with county level fixed effects on this subsample, and
column 7 estimates a model with census tract fixed effects. Even when including these
effects, our coefficient of interest is economically and statistically significant. The census
tract fixed effects are powerful, increasing the R2 from 0.280 to 0.416 and further lowering
the point estimate between columns 6 and 7 (though the coefficients are still comfortably
within each other’s confidence intervals).14
    Our baseline regressions focus on parental choices determining child choices, which we
believe to be the strongest intrafamily channel of brand preference transmission. We can,
however, configure our data to examine the relationship that prior purchases by any family
member have to subsequent choices by their relatives. To do so, we take every vehicle
choice observed in the data and match it to the most recent purchase made by every other
related household in the dataset (including parents, children, siblings, cousins, etc.). We
then include all of these bilateral relationships in one regression, down-weighting vehicles
that are matched to multiple family members’ vehicles so that they have equal influence
on the estimate as those that have only one match. This alternative construction expands
our sample size considerably and delivers more precise, but modestly smaller effects. For
example, the all-family matched analog of column 1 from table 2 produces a coefficient
(standard error) estimate of 0.068 (0.005), and the county fixed effects analog to column 5
produces an estimate of 0.030 (0.004). These results are consistent with our intuition that
parent-to-child influences are particularly strong, but it also suggests that broader family
network effects have influence.


4.2      Estimates limited to similar brands
The principal concern with our baseline regressions is that demographic or location-specific
characteristics of children and parents will be correlated and that these characteristics drive
demand for vehicle attributes that are correlated with brand. While we believe that con-
trolling for county and census tract fixed effects adequately addresses location-specific con-
  13
     If we do not restrict the sample in this way, the main coefficient is then primarily identified off of within-
family variation in brand choice over time rather than cross-family variation. This identifying variation
largely excludes long-term effects from the estimate so that it cannot be compared to the estimates in
columns 1 through 5 (see section 4.3 for a fuller discussion of long-run versus short-run effects).
  14
     When we restrict our attention to similar brands in section 4.2, this decrease in the point estimate is
substantially mitigated.

founders, the possibility remains that our estimates are contaminated by demographic con-
founders, even after controlling for observables. For example, individuals who work in con-
struction occupations may be more likely to prefer light trucks to passenger cars. Because
GM’s fleet is more heavily tilted toward light trucks than is Honda’s, such people will be
more likely to buy a GM, even in the absence of any brand preference.
    Here, we address this issue by isolating the choice set to two brands that are very similar:
Ford and GM. Ford and GM are both full-line, U.S.-based automakers that compete directly
in every vehicle segment.15 Because their vehicle lineups are very similar, we would expect
intrafamily brand choice correlations to be quite weak in the absence of intrafamily brand
preference transmission when we limit our sample to children who choose either a Ford or a
GM.
    Table 3 repeats the specifications in table 2 for a subset of choices limited to Ford and
GM. Specifically, we keep all instances in which a child chose either a Ford or GM, which
  15
     Popular perception holds that Ford and GM are similar brands. We have confirmed this empirically
using a measure of “distance” between brands that borrows from Langer and Miller (2013), who calculate the
distance between pairs of vehicles in attribute space based on vehicle segment, price, number of passengers,
wheelbase, fuel economy, and horsepower for GM, Ford, Toyota and Chrysler. Using their metric, we have
confirmed that Ford and GM vehicles are on average substantially closer to each other than they are to
Toyota or Chrysler.

accounts for about 54% of our original sample.16 As in the full sample, the results are all
positive, statistically significant, and economically large, corroborating our baseline results
and casting doubt on the possibility that the correlation in brand choice across households
is due entirely to demographic confounders. Notably, the estimated coefficient actually
increases slightly going from column 1 to column 2 as the demographic controls are added,
which was not the case in the “all brands” specification from table 2. This result comports
with the intuition that demographic factors are unlikely to influence the choice between Ford
and GM. Moreover, following the logic of Altonji et al. (2005), if our “headline” demographic
variables are not correlated with the choice between Ford and GM, it seems unlikely that
unobserved factors would be correlated either. It is also worthwhile to note that when the
county fixed effects are replaced with census tract fixed effects going from column 6 to column
7, the estimated coefficient hardly changes despite a substantial increase in R2 , suggesting
that county-level effects are sufficient to control for local factors affecting brand choice.17
    The magnitudes of the coefficients are somewhat larger in the subsample in table 3 than
in the full sample in table 2. Nonetheless, parents’ brand choice has a slightly smaller
percentage effect on child’s choice probabilities in the restricted sample because the baseline
choice probabilities are higher. In the full sample, the market share for Ford is 22%, while
that for GM is 33%. In the subsample, the corresponding figures are 39% for Ford and
61% for GM. Thus, the coefficient of 0.084 in column 5 of table 3 (the county fixed effect
specification in the restricted sample) implies that a child whose parents’ most recent prior
purchase was the same brand boosts the probability of purchase by 22% for Ford and 14%
for GM, whereas the analogous coefficient in table 2 (the full sample) represents a 25% effect
for Ford and 17% for GM. This difference is intuitive given that Ford and GM are generally
close substitutes.
    Toyota and Honda are also similar brands. They both produce a full range of sedans
and fuel efficient SUVs, though Honda produces only a limited set of pickup trucks. Table
4 shows results from the same set of specifications for the sample of observations limited
to children who purchased either a Honda or a Toyota, excluding all pickup trucks. The
estimated effects in this subsample are even larger; the county fixed effects specification in
column 5 (our preferred specification) indicates that having a parent who owns a Honda
  16
      We do not restrict the sample based on whether the parents chose Ford or GM. We do, however, add an
additional control variable for whether the parents’ choice was one of these two brands. This control helps
ensure that the sum of the child’s choice probabilities for the two brands is close to one.
   17
      As an additional test for local confounders, we have estimated the Ford/GM specification using a sub-
sample in which the child lives in a different state than the parents (including demographics and state fixed
effects in the specification, for both child and parent). The point estimate of γ from this subsample is 0.139,

Toyota have a smaller market share than Ford and GM, which leaves us with a smaller sample
size and larger standard errors. Nevertheless, our estimates are statistically significant at
any conventional level except when we limit the sample to those who live in a census tract
common to another PSID family in our sample (columns 6 and 7), at which point we lose
power.


4.3       Long-run versus short-run effects
In this section, we examine the extent to which the brand choice correlations documented
above are driven by long-run or short-run brand preference transmission. Both long-run
and short-run transmission could be associated with the intergenerational state dependence
mechanism or the direct preference inheritance mechanism. For instance, long-run transmis-
sion could derive from early-childhood experience with a brand or from parents’ repeated
statements to a child that they believe one brand is better or more reliable than another.
Short-run transmission could come from information about parents’ recent purchases or from
parent-child discussions about recent reviews of or advertisements by a particular brand.
 18
      A 31.4 percentage point increase on an average market share of 50% is a 63% increase.


                                                     18
    We begin by studying how children’s brand choices correlate with multiple previous
choices of their parents, including both the most recent choices as well as earlier choices. To
do so, we augment our baseline regression with indicator variables for whether the brand of
each child’s purchase matches the brand of the parents’ lagged purchases.19
    Ideally, we would like to use parents’ complete life history of vehicle ownership to test how
vehicles owned at different points in their children’s lives influenced the children’s subsequent
choices. Unfortunately, we are limited to seven waves of data, which leaves us with relatively
few car purchases for most families and a complete history for none. Thus, we are only able
estimate and compare how children’s brand choices correlate with the most recent versus
somewhat less recent choices of their parents. If children’s brand choices correlate more
strongly with their parents’ most recent choices, then short-run preference transmission is
likely important. If less recent parent choices still have predictive power conditional on recent
parent choices, then longer-run preference transmission is also likely important.20
    When we add parents’ lagged brand choices to the regression, we also add indicators for
the children’s own lagged brand choices. We do so for two reasons. First, in the presence of
within-household state dependence, the lagged choices of a parent may continue to influence
a child’s current choice indirectly via the child’s earlier brand purchase. Thus, to test whether
lagged parent purchases have a direct long-run influence on child choices, we must control
for the child’s lagged purchases.
    Second, these lags help, in part, to identify parent-to-child transmission separately from
child-to-parent transmission. In particular, children’s choices might have a short-run influ-
ence on the preferences of their parents—the state dependence mechanism from child to
parent. If so, then this correlation could propagate via within-household state dependence
to generate a longer-term correlation between recent child choices and lagged parent choices.
Conditioning directly on the lagged choices of children helps protect against this concern.21
Unfortunately, these lags do not address the possibility that children might influence their
parents through the direct preference inheritance mechanism. For instance, a child might
tell her parents about a recent blog post arguing that Fords are a great buy, leading both
  19
      Observations of lagged purchases are not available for all child’s purchases. Rather than drop observa-
tions that are missing lags, we also include in our regressions interactions between the brand dummies and
indicator variables (one for each lag in the regression) that equal one if the lag is missing.
   20
      For reference, the average time elapsed between the child’s purchase and the parents’ lagged and second
lagged purchases are 40 months and 65 months, respectively. Thus, even our limited specification is suggestive
of effects that take place over several years.
   21
      Of course, child-to-parent state dependence could arise from more distant child’s purchases than the
second lag. We have also estimated specifications that include third and fourth lags of children’s purchases
and found that doing so has only a minor effect on the estimated coefficients. For instance, adding third
and fourth own-lags to specification (3) of table 5 below reduces the coefficient on the indicator for parents’
brand = child’s brand from 0.040 to only 0.038.

the parents and then the child to buy a Ford. In this case, child and parent choices will be
correlated, even controlling for the child’s lagged purchases.22
    Table 5 reports linear probability model regressions that include indicators for parents’
and children’s lagged purchases. All regressions use our preferred specification with demo-
graphic controls and county fixed effects. Columns 1 through 3 use all seven brands and
include, progressively, zero, one, and two lags of both the parents’ and children’s purchases;
columns 4 through 6 repeat these specifications for the Ford and GM subsample. The re-
sults show little difference between the estimated coefficients on the parents’ most recent
and lagged choice. In the Ford and GM subsample, the lagged coefficient is actually larger
than the most recent coefficient, though the two are not statistically distinct (p = 0.527 in
column 6). Parents own 2.1 vehicles on average (see table 1), so the similarity of the most
  22
     We focus here on short-run preference transmission, since it seems unlikely that young children still
living with their parents would be able to influence the longer-run brand preferences of their parents in this
way.


                                                     20
recent and first lagged brand choice of parents may reflect the fact that the two most recent
purchases on average represent the parents’ current fleet. The estimated coefficients on the
parents’ second lag are, however, substantially smaller than those on the parents’ most recent
purchase. This difference is statistically significant (p = 0.031) for the all brands sample and
marginally significant (p = 0.116) for the Ford/GM subsample. The estimated coefficients
on the parents’ second lagged choices themselves are positive (and statistically significant
in the all brands sample). Overall, these results suggest that both short-run and long-run
preference transmission are at work.23
    We next attempt to isolate the short-run mechanism by examining regression models
that include a fixed effect for each child household. These fixed effects account for any
household-level permanent brand preference so that the only source of identification comes
from changes in parents’ brand choices over time. For these regressions, we revert to our
original specification that includes only the parents’ most recent brand choice.
    Results from the household fixed effects specification are given in table 6, in which all
columns include demographic controls. Column 1 includes all seven brands, while column
2 uses only the Ford and GM subsample to guard against time-varying unobservable demo-
graphic factors that may be correlated between child and parent. In both of these speci-
fications, the estimated coefficient of interest is positive but statistically insignificant. To
improve the estimates’ precision, we expand the sample to include all bilateral relationships
that are available in the data (that is, including siblings, uncles, cousins, etc. as discussed at
the end of section 4.1 above). When we use this expanded sample, the estimated correlation
between children’s choices and relatives’ choices is positive and statistically significant, as
shown in columns 3 and 4 of table 6.24 While the magnitudes of these coefficients are small
relative to those obtained without household fixed effects (the corresponding point estimates
are 0.062 for column 3 and 0.102 for column 4, still using the “all relatives” sample), they
nonetheless provide evidence that brand preference transmission has a short-run component
and is not entirely driven by childhood experiences.
  23
      We are limited in how many lags we can include by data availability. Another approach is to proxy for
the parent’s past purchases by including directly the market share of each brand in the parent’s geographic
region further back in time. We do not, however, have market share data at the subnational level for most
years. We can construct market shares for 1990 at the level of the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) using
the National Household Transportation Survey. When we include the 1990 market share of the brand in the
parents’ MSA as an additional control variable, we find that these market shares are positively correlated
with child choice, but statistically imprecise.
   24
      We have also run the column 4 specification while including county fixed effects to account for households
that move during the sample. The results are robust to these fixed effects: the estimated coefficient and
standard error are 0.016 and 0.006, respectively. We have not run the column 3 specification with county
fixed effects due to computer memory constraints.

4.4        Tests for intergenerational state dependence
In this section, we explore the extent to which we can distinguish intergenerational state
dependence from direct preference inheritance. To do so, we use variation in the exposure
of children to their parents’ vehicles, under the logic that an increase in exposure should
strengthen the state dependence mechanism but not the direct preference inheritance mech-
anism. Specifically, we study whether children are more strongly influenced by vehicles that
their parents owned while they still lived with their parents, under the presumption that
children were more likely to have direct exposure to such vehicles.
    For this analysis, we expand the sample by matching each child’s choice to all observed
choices by their parents that precede the child’s choice, not just to the parents’ most recent
purchase. Thus, for each vehicle that a child purchased, there may be multiple observations
in the regression sample, one for each parent purchase.25 For each matched child and parent
  25
    To be clear, we do not add parents’ past brand choices as lagged regressors, as we did in section 4.3
above. Instead, we create a separate observation for each child-parent match. We do so for two reasons.
First, the number of available parent purchases varies substantially across child households. Second, this
approach eases the interpretation of the interacted regressors discussed below. We re-weight the observations
in this expanded sample such that every case of a child’s vehicle choice receives equal weight, regardless of
how many parent vehicles it was matched to; we then apply the PSID sampling weights. As before, we
ultimately expand this sample according to the number of brands in our linear probability model framework.


                                                        22
purchase, we then identify whether the parents’ purchase was made while the child was still
living in the parents’ household. There are 16,115 such “child at home” purchases made by
parents in the data, out of 58,420 total parent purchases. On average, the children in this
subsample are 16.9 years old while living at home when their parents buy a vehicle (standard
deviation = 5.5 years) and 26.0 years old after having moved out when they buy their own
vehicle (standard deviation = 4.6 years). The average age at which children matched to “at
home” cars move out of their parents’ home is approximately 22.4 years old.26
    Our primary variable of interest is an interaction between the indicator for whether the
parents’ brand choice matches the child’s brand choice with an indicator for whether the
parents’ purchase occurred while the child was still at home. Our idea is that children will
have had more exposure to a car that their parents owned if they lived with their parents
during the ownership period. This interacted variable may also be capturing age effects,
however, because children are on average younger during the time in which they live with
their parents. If children are more impressionable while they are young, then our interaction
term may be positive because of a correlation with age. We address this possibility by
allowing the relationship between the parents’ brand choice and the child’s brand choice to
vary flexibly with the child’s age at the time of the parents’ purchase. Age effects may be
nonlinear, so we include interactions between whether the parents’ brand choice matches the
child’s brand choice and polynomials up to a cubic in the child’s age. Finally, our regression
specification also accounts for decay in brand preference transmission over time by controlling
for the length of time between the child’s and parents’ purchases (interacted with the child’s
brand = parents’ brand indicator).
    Table 7 reports linear probability model regressions that add these interacted regressors
in the expanded set of child-parent matched vehicles. We use our preferred specification with
demographic controls and county fixed effects in all regressions. Columns 1 through 3 use
all seven brands and include progressively richer polynomials in the child’s age at the time
of the parents’ purchase; columns 4 through 6 repeat these specifications for the Ford and
GM subsample. Our focus is on the interaction between the brand choices of parents and
whether or not the child lived at home when the vehicle was purchased (the second variable
in table 7). The estimated coefficient on this interaction term is positive in all specifications
and is statistically significant in all three columns of the Ford and GM subsample, provid-
ing evidence that at least some of the intergenerational brand choice correlation is being
driven by state dependence. Overall, this result is robust to increasing the richness of the
  26
    We do not know the exact date at which children moved out; we only know the survey date at which
each child is observed in his/her own household. The average age at this observation is 23.4; we subtract

age-at-purchase polynomial, and the polynomial coefficients themselves are consistent with
intergenerational brand choice correlation being stronger for older children.27 This age effect
reflects the possibility that once they have moved out of the house, older children are more
attuned to vehicle brands than younger children (perhaps due to budget constraints early
in adult life). Finally, the interaction between the parents’ brand choice dummy and the
time elapsed between the parents’ and child’s purchases is negative (though insignificant) in
all specifications. This last result suggests that the influence of the parents’ choice on the
child’s choice decays over time, consistent with the findings from the lag models studied in
section 4.3.28

     Omitting age effects entirely reduces the estimate of the coefficient of interest by roughly one-third. This
result occurs because the “at home” effect is conflated with the effect of purchases occurring at a young age.

brand choice is weaker if the parents had a poor experience with a vehicle. To identify vehicles that were

5     Implications of brand preference transmission for the
      vehicle market
What might intergenerational brand preference transmission imply for firms’ strategies and
market outcomes in the automobile industry? Some implications are closely related to estab-
lished findings in the literature regarding within-household brand attachment. For example,
Bronnenberg et al. (2012) shows that state dependence in brand choice will strengthen in-
cumbent firms by increasing barriers to entry and limiting the speed with which market
shares may change over time. It is intuitive to expect that intergenerational preference
transmission will exacerbate these effects by tying young consumers—who would otherwise
be unattached to a brand and therefore open toward new entrants or smaller firms—to their
parents’ preferred brand.
    Our findings also relate to the literature on switching costs, which focuses on how state
dependence in consumers’ brand choices affects firms’ profits in equilibrium (Klemperer 1987;
Dubé et al. 2009; Somaini and Einav Forthcoming). Incorporating intergenerational state
dependence into traditional switching cost models yields unique implications in settings like
the automobile industry in which firms offer multiple products targeted at consumers of
different ages. To see the intuition, consider a simple overlapping generations model in
which every consumer lives for two periods, buys two cars during his or her lifetime—one
entry-level model while young and one upscale model while old—and has a child while old
that becomes a young consumer in the next period. If consumers have state dependent brand
preferences and do not pass these preferences on to their children, then this model resembles
the one analyzed in Klemperer (1987), which establishes that firms will lower prices for
young consumers to “invest” in brand loyalty and then “harvest” that loyalty among older
consumers by charging higher prices.
    Intergenerational state dependence disrupts this logic. In the extreme, if the dependence
of children’s preferences on their parents’ choices is as strong as within-generation state de-
pendence, then the overlapping generations become equivalent to an infinitely lived consumer
with constant loyalty. In this case, the problem resembles the switching cost model of Dubé
likely of poor quality, we used wholesale auction price data to estimate a depreciation rate for each vintage of
each model and matched these depreciation rates to the parents’ car choices. While our point estimates on
the interaction of depreciation rates with parents’ brand choice indicate that the intergenerational correlation
is weaker for vehicles that proved to be of low quality, these regressions lack statistical power and we thus
omit them from the paper. As an alternative approach, we simply interacted parents’ brand choice with the
length of time that the parents owned their vehicles; we imagine that parents would get rid of disappointing
vehicles more quickly. While the intergenerational correlation is weaker for cars that parents held for shorter
periods, this result does not necessarily indicate state dependence, for parents would also hold vehicles for
shorter periods if the vehicles were a poor fit for the parents’ underlying preferences.



                                                      25
et al. (2009), in which firms balance harvesting and investing incentives in every period,
and there is no economic distinction between young and old consumers. Thus, relative to
the model with no intergenerational state dependence, equilibrium prices for upscale cars
should fall, since firms will recognize that purchases by parents today improve their market
share among young consumers tomorrow. Conversely, prices for entry-level cars should rise
because young consumers enter the market with brand loyalty that can be harvested.
    In appendix A, we set up and solve a simple version of this model with two symmetric
Bertrand-competing firms that sell cars to consumers who live two periods each, buying a
different type of car each period. Consumers have logit demand with a brand switching cost
that we calibrate using our estimates from section 4.29 For simplicity, we assume that the
young and old car markets have the same cost and demand parameters. When we allow
for within-household but not intergenerational state dependence, the model reproduces the
Klemperer (1987) style result that equilibrium prices are lower for cars targeted at young
consumers than for cars targeted at older consumers. However, when intergenerational state
dependence is as strong as within-household state dependence, the model is equivalent to
that of Dubé et al. (2009), and equilibrium prices are equal for both types of cars. We also
present an intermediate case in between these two extremes.
    In our calibrated examples, the net effect of state dependence on average prices and firm
profits is negative. This result echoes a similar finding by Dubé et al. (2009) in consumer
packaged goods markets: when switching costs are modest, their presence may cause prices
and profits to decline because firms are never able to fully capitalize on their customers’ brand
loyalty as they constantly compete for the next generation of consumers.30 This finding
may also speak to the auto industry’s apparent focus on sales volumes to the potential
neglect of current profits. The industry media is filled with stories about market share,
sales volumes, and conquest rates. Anecdotally, automakers are said to focus on hitting
quarterly sales targets, deeply discounting or even selling some vehicles at a loss to meet
these targets. It is natural for an economist to view such prioritization of sales volumes
over profitability as a mistake. In the presence of strong brand preferences, however, firms
face a tradeoff between current and future profits, potentially justifying this focus on volume.
Moreover, transmission of brand preferences across generations limits the incentive to harvest
brand preferences among older consumers, as doing so might jeopardize the loyalty of future
generations.
    Intergenerational brand preference transmission may influence not only how firms set
  29
    We also use within-household brand choice correlations that we discuss in appendix B.
  30
    Cabral (2009) further discusses why the investment incentive to lower prices is first-order while the
harvesting incentive to raise prices is second-order.



                                                   26
prices for the goods that they sell, but also the set of products they choose to develop.
Most automakers offer a wide range of vertically differentiated products. State dependence
provides one rationale for such a strategy. The stronger are brand preferences, the more
valuable it is to keep consumers within the brand as they move through their life cycle and
demand different types of cars.31 When households have state-dependent brand preferences,
producers have an incentive to develop entry-level offerings that will “lead” consumers to
their profitable upscale goods as they age. If brand preferences are transmitted between
generations, however, then producers of entry-level models will also have an incentive to
develop upscale product lines to “lead” future generations to their entry-level products. The
ability of upscale products to boost future sales of downmarket products may, for instance,
help explain the relatively slow growth of Toyota and Honda in the 1980s, and Hyundai and
Kia today, which offer mainly entry-level vehicles but do so at a low price given their high
quality.
    These considerations may also help explain the competition between Ford and GM early
in the twentieth century. Ford initially sold a single, affordable vehicle and focused on driving
down costs through economies of scale. Henry Ford had no interest in product differentiation
and famously quipped that “people can have a Model T in any color—so long as it is black.”
Meanwhile, GM’s strategy was to build a variety of cars to fit a range of lifestyles and income
levels, embodied by the famous quote from Alfred Sloan that GM would sell “a car for every
purse and purpose.” As cars first became affordable to the masses, brand loyalty would have
been minimal because most consumers had not previously owned a car, nor had their parents
owned a car. This limited the initial benefits to GM’s approach.
    Over time, however, strong within-household brand preference would have allowed GM
to charge higher prices to consumers who “graduated” to their upscale models. This would
have given GM an extra incentive to cut prices on their entry-market cars, which were in
competition with Ford’s Model T, in order to gain future loyal upscale customers. Further-
more, having no upscale model would have also put Ford at a competitive disadvantage
among the subsequent generation’s entry-level consumers if intergenerational brand prefer-
ence transmission was strong. That is, the children of consumers who had progressed to
an upscale GM model would have inherited a preference for GM before they went to buy
their first (entry-level) car. Thus, both within-household and intergenerational brand pref-
erence transmission may have been important in determining the ultimate success of GM’s
differentiated approach, which Ford itself later adopted.
  31
    There are, of course, many other reasons that firms might offer a broad set of vertically differentiated
goods apart from consumer brand preferences, including production economies of scope and the value of
covering a wide range of consumers’ attribute preferences.

6    Conclusion
Our analysis of PSID data suggests that automobile brand preferences may be passed through
generations in ways that are important to the strategies of automobile producers. We docu-
ment a strong correlation across generations in brand choice that remains strong even when
limiting the analysis to similar brands and controlling for a rich set of demographic fac-
tors and fine geographic fixed effects, leading us to conclude that intrafamily correlations
are likely not driven entirely by correlated demographic characteristics but rather reflect
an important role for intergenerational brand preference transmission. Further, our finding
that intergenerational choice correlation is stronger when children are directly exposed to
their parents’ vehicles suggests a role for intergenerational state dependence, in which actual
experience with a vehicle is important for influencing brand choice across generations.
    These results inform our understanding of endogenous preference formation, complement-
ing recent work that has focused on the role of local tastes and geography in shaping con-
sumers’ preferences (Logan and Rhode 2010; Atkin Forthcoming; Bronnenberg et al. 2012).
They may also inform automakers’ pricing and product-line incentives. Intuition suggests,
and our numerical simulations in the appendix confirm, that intergenerational state depen-
dence curtails firms’ ability to price discriminate across young and old consumers, since
charging a high price to old consumers today reduces sales to young consumers tomorrow.
That is, the “invest in young consumers and harvest old consumers” strategy (Klemperer
1987) is no longer optimal when parents’ choices affect the preferences of their children.
More broadly, intergenerational state dependence may also enhance firms’ incentive to of-
fer a broad range of products that appeal to consumers over their entire lifetime, thereby
allowing multiple generations within a family to preserve their brand loyalty.

A      Theory model details
This appendix provides additional information and results for the theory model that is
described briefly in section 5. We focus on implications unique to intergenerational brand
preference transmission by considering markets, such as those for automobiles, in which firms
can discriminate between younger and older consumers. In particular, we explore how firms
offering multiple products—each catering to a different age class—will want to price and
market these products differently in the presence of intergenerational state dependence.32
    The related literature (see especially Klemperer (1987), Dubé et al. (2009), and Somaini
and Einav (Forthcoming)) has typically used the term “switching costs” to refer to a reduc-
tion in utility experienced by a consumer who switches from one brand to another in different
periods. This is identical to how we implement what we here call state dependence.33 Our
model differs from the existing literature in that we allow the choices of older consumers to
affect the preferences of their children (next period’s younger consumers) and that we model
firms as offering different products to consumers of different ages.34 We model multi-product
firms to relate the model more closely to the automobile market, in which nearly all manu-
facturers produce a range of models tailored to consumers in different stages of their lifecycle,
and to highlight the role that intergenerational state dependence can play in determining
automobile prices in equilibrium.
    We study a simple, symmetric model in which two firms compete in two different prod-
uct markets and consumers live two periods, purchasing once in each market. We forego
  32
      As discussed in section 2 above, intergenerational brand preference transmission will only have impli-
cations for pricing strategies if it operates via the state dependence mechanism. In contrast, the direct
preference inheritance mechanism will affect automakers’ advertising and product line strategies but will not
affect their pricing strategies.
   33
      Some papers model switching costs as an increase in utility from purchasing the same brand that was
purchased in the previous period (our approach), while others model switching costs as a decrease in utility
from purchasing a different brand. Dubé et al. (2009) examines both models and finds that they produce
identical predictions in the absence of an outside good. In the presence of an outside good, the second
formulation yields lower prices in equilibrium, as switching costs make the outside good relatively more
appealing.
   34
      A further generalization of our model would be to allow for a broader set of peer effects so that, for
example, older consumers’ choices could influence other older consumers. While this generalization is be-
yond the scope of this paper, we believe that such peer effects would have similar effects to what we find
here for intergenerational state dependence: a relative reduction in the markup for upscale vehicles (since
within-household brand loyalty becomes less important in the presence of cross-household state depen-
dence). Moreover, our focus on parent-to-child transmission is motivated by our empirical finding that the
parent-to-child channel is stronger than that for other family links and by the extensive literature showing
intergenerational correlations in many economic measures (Black and Devereux 2011).



                                                    A-1
a richer model that would more closely match the current automobile industry—a model
with more than two major firms, many products per firm, and richly differentiated con-
sumer preferences—for several reasons.35 First, the simultaneous estimation of the param-
eters needed to simulate the model (those governing households’ preference heterogeneity,
households’ brand preference transmission, and firms’ marginal costs) would be a substan-
tial undertaking that is beyond the scope of this paper and likely beyond the power of our
data.36 Second, the computational challenges of simulating such a model would be immense.
Finally, the simple model we present is close in spirit to most of the brand loyalty literature
and provides clear, intuitive results that we believe would generalize qualitatively to a more
complex model.37


A.1      A simple model of automobile pricing under brand loyalty
In our model, there are two symmetric firms, denoted j and k, that compete in a differentiated
Bertrand pricing game with an infinite horizon and overlapping generations of consumers.
In each period, there are unit masses of two types of households: young (type A) and old
(type B). All consumers are born as type A, become type B in the second period of their
lives, and then die, creating a new type A consumer (offspring) upon death. All consumers
purchase exactly one vehicle in each period of their lives, and there is no outside good. We
have in mind that children are present in the type B households, are exposed to their parents’
brand choice, and then become type A consumers upon leaving their parents’ home. A key
feature of the model is that the type A and type B consumers purchase different kinds of
cars. Both firms are aware of this fact, and both sell two vehicle models catering to the two
types. Thus, there are four vehicles in the market: jA, jB, kA, and kB. Car types A and B
can be thought of as cars preferred by younger versus older consumers, or entry level versus
upscale, or single-person versus family vehicles.
    For both brevity and clarity, we will focus on the case in which type A households consider
only vehicles jA and kA and type B households consider only vehicles jB and kB. Clearly
  35
     The treatment of consumers as living for two periods is also an abstraction, though one that is in line
with much of the switching cost literature (Klemperer (1987) and Somaini and Einav (Forthcoming), for
example). We revisit the question of the duration of consumers’ lifetimes and the time gap between periods
when we discuss the model’s discount factor further below.
  36
     Dubé et al. (2009) and Dubé et al. (2010) are able to simultaneously estimate preference heterogeneity and
within-household brand loyalty because they observe both a large number of repeat purchases per customer
and rich price variation in their dataset on orange juice and margarine purchases. While our PSID dataset is
well-suited for estimating intergenerational brand preference transmission, the limited number of purchases
observed for each household and weak price data make it poorly suited for characterizing heterogeneous
preferences for price and other attributes.

     We are encouraged here by the fact that Dubé et al. (2009) find qualitatively similar predictions from
the simple and complex versions of their model.


                                                      A-2
this is an abstraction, as there will be some substitution by households across vehicle types.38
Still, in a survey of over 22,000 consumers by a market research firm described in Langer
(2012), the Cadillac Deville and Lincoln Town Car had more than 100 purchasers over the
age of 60 and none under the age of 40, while the Scion tC had more than 100 purchasers
under 40 and only 6 over 60. Similarly, only 5% of consumers who say they purchased a
Buick are under the age of 40. Clearly, there are vehicles that appeal strongly to specific age
groups.
    Let the utility of a particular consumer i of type B that purchases vehicle jB be given
by:

                              UijB = V − αPjB + µB 1{biA = j} + εijB ,

where V is a baseline utility that is common across the two brands, PjB is the price of vehicle
jB, and 1{biA = j} is an indicator for whether consumer i purchased brand j when he or
she was a type A last period. The parameter µB denotes the strength of within-consumer
persistence of brand preferences. The utility from purchasing the other brand’s vehicle kB
is given similarly.
    The utility of a consumer i of type A that purchases vehicle jA is similarly given by:

                              UijA = V − αPjA + µA 1{biB = j} + εijA .

Here, 1{biB = j} is an indicator for whether the parents of consumer i purchased brand
j when the parents were type B last period. The parameter µA denotes the strength of
intergenerational brand preferences. This formulation assumes that the parents’ type A
car—which we imagine to be owned by parents before the next generation is born—does not
influence the child’s utility function. (Thus, our two-period formulation does not distinguish
between short- and long-run state dependence, but it does exclude direct brand preference
inheritance that could cause parental choices that occurred before a child was born to in-
fluence child choice.) The random utility components εijB and εijA are assumed to be i.i.d.
type I extreme value over individuals i, brands j and k, and types A and B.
  38
    Allowing for some cross-age substitution has essentially no impact on models in which intergenerational
brand preference transmission is as strong as within-household transmission. In models in which intergener-
ational transmission is relatively weak, cross-age substitution reduces the gap between the type A and type
B vehicle prices (and does so in a qualitatively symmetric way). The result that brand preferences (of a
magnitude corresponding to our estimates above) reduce equilibrium prices continues to hold. This is true
even in the extreme case in which there is no intergenerational brand preference and consumers have no
systematic preference for their own type of vehicle. This last model is similar to that of Doganoglu (2010),
in which consumers live for two periods and the (single product) firms cannot distinguish between young
and old.



                                                   A-3
   We assume that type A consumers are not forward-looking when deciding whether to
purchase vehicle jA or kA.39 We also assume that type B consumers are not forward
looking in the sense that they do not consider the implications of the brand preferences they
transmit to their children.
   We next discuss aggregate demand and the firms’ profit and value functions. Let φA and
φB denote the fraction of consumers loyal to brand j in the A and B markets, respectively.
Given the price of each vehicle and φA and φB , the demand for each vehicle will be given by
a weighted sum of standard logit choice probabilities. For example, the demand for vehicle
jA is given by:

                                          exp(V − αPjA + µA )
                      DjA = φA
                                exp(V − αPjA + µA ) + exp(V − αPkA )
                                                 exp(V − αPjA )
                           + (1 − φA )                                      .
                                       exp(V − αPjA ) + exp(V − αPkA + µA )

    We model the marginal cost of all four vehicles in the market as a constant, denoted by
c. Firm j’s per-period profits are then given by:

πj (PjA , PkA , PjB , PkB , φA , φB ) = (PjA − c) · DjA (PjA , PkA , φA ) + (PjB − c) · DjB (PjB , PkB , φB ).

    In the infinitely repeated game, the firms’ state variables are the brand loyalty shares
φA and φB of the consumers of each type. The states evolve so that next period’s loyalty
of the type A consumers is given by the current period’s demand of the type B consumers
                  0                                     0
for vehicle jB: φA = DjB (PjB , PkB , φB ). Similarly, φB = DjA (PjA , PkA , φA ). We restrict the
firms to Markov strategies so that, with a discount factor δ that is shared by the two firms,
firm j’s Bellman equation is given by:

                                                                                       0    0
               Vj (φA , φB ) = max {πj (PjA , PkA , PjB , PkB , φA , φB ) + δVj (φA , φB )}
                                PjA ,PjB


   Firm k’s Bellman equation is defined similarly. These equations capture the tradeoff
the firms face as the parameters µA and µB , which govern the strength of brand loyalty,
vary. The incentive to increase current-period profits by increasing prices is weighed against
the incentive to increase future profits by lowering prices to boost the share of future loyal
consumers.
   For a given set of model parameters, the Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE) of the firms’
  39
     Per the intuition of Somaini and Einav (Forthcoming), we expect that allowing for forward-looking
behavior by type A consumers would result in higher prices for type A vehicles because type A consumers
will become less sensitive to current price changes. As a second-order effect, prices for type B vehicles should
then fall in equilibrium because the continuation value of future type A consumers will have increased.

dynamic Bertrand pricing game can be solved computationally using value function iteration
techniques.40 In the simulations presented below, we fix V = 1, α = 8, and c = 1. The choice
of V is immaterial in the absence of an outside good. The price preference α and marginal
cost c parameters together yield, in the absence of any brand preferences, an equilibrium
price for all vehicles of 1.25 and equilibrium own-price elasticities of -5. This markup and
elasticity roughly correspond to typical markups and elasticities found by Berry, Levinsohn
and Pakes (1995).
    The choice of discount factor merits discussion. We treat automakers as having an
annual real discount factor of 0.9 and treat the time between periods in the model as five
years, which roughly corresponds to the average vehicle holding time in our data. Thus, the
discount factor δ used in our model is 0.95 ≈ 0.59. An obvious tension here is that consumers
live longer than ten years. One alternative approach would be to use a discount factor that
reflects the time gap between generations (with a value of 0.925 ≈ 0.07, for example). In this
case, automakers would care little about future generations when setting prices. However,
this alternative approach neglects the fact that consumers purchase vehicles more frequently
than every 25 years and that children begin purchasing vehicles of their own soon after they
are exposed to purchases their parents made while they were teenagers still living at home.
    Ideally, we would resolve this issue by studying a model in which consumers live for
many periods, each five years apart, and transfer brand preferences to new consumers (their
children) via their brand choices over one or several purchases relatively late in life. In such a
model, even though generations would be far apart in time, the chain of purchases occurring
every five years—and in particular across the short, potentially overlapping transition from
one generation to the next—would give automakers a sufficient incentive to consider the next
generation when setting prices for upscale vehicles. While the high dimensionality of the state
and decision spaces of such a model precludes its implementation, a previous version of this
paper did present a computationally feasible version of such a model that forces automakers
to group consumers into two broad classes (young and old), selling one vehicle type to each
class and forbidding within-class price discrimination. Despite this alternative model’s large
time gap between generations, we nonetheless found qualitatively similar results to those
discussed below. In particular, intergenerational state dependence eliminates differences in
markups between vehicles targeted at young versus old consumers.
    Finally, the range of brand loyalty parameters µA and µB that we consider spans zero to
one. Values of zero collapse the model to a standard static Bertrand problem, for which the
  40
    Without intergenerational brand loyalty (µA = 0), the model reverts to a standard two-period game
(akin to that of Klemperer (1987)) that can be characterized analytically, though the results presented
below for this case were nonetheless generated numerically.



                                                 A-5
equilibrium price is 1.25. Our estimates from section 4 correspond to values of µA within
the zero to one range. For our preferred “all brands” specification (column 5 of table 2),
the corresponding value of µA is about 0.35.41 For the Ford/GM regression, µA is about
0.17, while µA is about 0.65 for the Toyota/Honda regressions. To calibrate values of µB , we
have estimated within-household brand choice correlations that parallel the intergenerational
correlations presented in tables 2 and 3. These regressions, which are discussed in more detail
in appendix B, suggest that µB is about 0.75 in the regression with all brands and 0.50 in
the Ford/GM regressions—so roughly 2-3 times as large as µA .


A.2      Optimal prices in a model with symmetric firms
We explore the impact of brand preferences on firms’ equilibrium pricing strategies by in-
creasing the brand preference parameters µA and µB from zero and examining the change in
firms’ equilibrium steady state prices. These prices are sufficient statistics for steady state
profits because in steady state the two firms split the A and B markets equally (due to the
symmetry of the firms’ demand and cost parameters).
    Figure 1 presents steady state equilibrium prices, over a range of brand loyalty strengths,
for three cases. For all cases, the prices of firms j and k are equal within each of the markets
A and B due to symmetry. In the first case, given by the solid lines, intergenerational brand
transmission is turned off by holding µA = 0 while the strength of within-household brand
preference is varied by letting µB range from 0 to 1. In this case, we find that increasing
µB raises the prices of the type B cars while lowering the prices of the type A cars. That
is, when households develop brand loyalty but do not pass this loyalty to their children, the
equilibrium prices for vehicles intended for older consumers will be high relative to prices for
vehicles intended for younger consumers. The intuition for this result follows directly from
Klemperer (1987): if first period choices determine brand loyalty in the second period, then
firms will “invest” in customers in the first period by charging lower prices and “harvest” the
consumer loyalty in the second period. The “investment” effect in the A market outweighs
the “harvesting” effect in the B market (that is, average vehicle price is less than the no-
loyalty baseline price of 1.25) for values of µB up to about 0.83. If brand loyalty is stronger
than that, however, then the “harvesting” effect dominates in our model.
    When intergenerational brand loyalty is equal to within-household brand loyalty—the
case denoted by the dotted line in figure 1—the A and B markets behave identically to
one another so that the prices for all four vehicles are equal in steady state, and the model
  41
    Given a value for µA and assuming the brands in the choice set yield equivalent utility in the absence of
a brand preference, the effect of parents’ ownership on the probability of brand choice in our model is given
by (eµA − 1)/(eµA + (N − 1)), where N is the number of brands in the choice set.

           demand for each of the four cars jA, jB, kA, and kB is equal to 0.5. The solid
           line denotes the case in which there is no intergenerational brand loyalty, the

           in which intergenerational and within-household brand loyalty are equal.


collapses to that of Dubé et al. (2009). Relative to the case with no intergenerational state
dependence, type B prices fall because high type B prices now reduce future demand and
profits, and type A prices rise because investing in future type B consumers is no longer
as profitable. The prices of the type A and B vehicles—now equal in steady state—are
roughly equal to the average of the type A and B prices from the no intergenerational state
dependence case. That is, intergenerational state dependence appears to primarily affect the
distribution of prices across types rather than the average price in the market. Thus, similar
to the no intergenerational state dependence case, steady state equilibrium prices are lower
than in the case of no brand loyalty for values of µB up to about 0.80.
    Finally, the dashed line plots an intermediate case in which intergenerational brand pref-
erence parameter, µA , is half as large as the within-household parameter, µB . This case
is consistent with our empirical estimates of the relative strength of intergenerational state


                                                                              A-7
dependence and within-household state dependence. Not surprisingly, this case lies between
the two other cases. Here, average vehicle price is less than the no-loyalty baseline price of
1.25 for values of µB up to about 0.97, which exceeds our preferred estimates for µB of about
0.5 to 0.75. This implies that the existence of brand loyalty causes a net reduction in firm
profits, which accords with the theoretical intuition of Cabral (2009).42


B      Within-household brand loyalty
In order to understand the size of intragenerational brand loyalty relative to within-household
brand loyalty, we compute the size of within-household brand loyalty in our data. To that
end, we use the sample of households whose purchases can be matched to their parents’
prior vehicle purchase and estimate regressions analogous to those in table 2 of the text,
with the brand of the household’s most recent purchase in place of the brand of the parents’
most recent purchase. Columns 1 through 4 of Table 8 present these results. We do not in-
clude specifications that include census tract fixed effects because these present an incidental
parameters problem in what is essentially a lagged dependent variable regression.
