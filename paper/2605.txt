                                    ABSTRACT


       A new empirical analysis of aggregate United States consumption and

  saving for the period 1947-80 is presented. The model is based on the

  theory of exact aggregation. It recognizes explicitly that households with

  different characteristics may be heterogeneous in their behavior and that

  aggregate behavior may depend on the changing composition of households by

  characteristics and therefore may not be adequately portrayed by a

  representative consumer, but otherwise it imposes minimal assumptions on

  household behavior. The model integrates longitudinal and cross-sectional

  microeconomic data on household characteristics with the traditional

  aggregate time-series data. Various hypotheses on consumption such as age

  independence, proportionality to wealth, and price independence, are tested

  and rejected. Strong evidence of relative price effects and a systematic

  variation of aggregate consumption with changing age distribution of wealth

  in the economy is found. Especially important is the substantial estimated

  difference in the shares of wealth consumed between households headed by

  persons born prior to and those born after 1939. One important lesson from

  this study is that modeling the aggregate U.S. economy as a representative

  consumer may give rise to misleading results.

1.   Introduction

     The consumption and saving behavior of an economy reveals much about

the nature of its society, since it reflects its values, institutions,

incentives, and demographics. However, a large number of conceptual and

empirical issues cloud analyses and interpretations of postwar U.S.

consumption and saving. It is by now well known that, as conventionally

measured, the postwar U.S. saving rate is low by international standards,

and that it has fallen since the 1950s and 1960s. Simultaneously, the

average annual rate of growth in real consumption rose from 2.74% in the

period 1950-1962 to 3.45% in the period 1963-80, an increase of 25%. Had

consumption continued growing at its slower early postwar pace, annual real

consumption would have been at least 10% less by 1980 than in fact occurred.

The difference amounts to approximately 8% of GNP (or approximately double

the annual federal budget deficit). The cumulative value of this extra

consumption from 1963 to 1980 rivals the value of output lost in all postwar

recessions combined. What were the proximate causes of these changes?

     Among the more interesting and important empirical questions are the

extent to which changes in relative prices (e.g., real after-tax rates of

return to saving) and demographics (as reflected by the shares of wealth

held by households headed by persons of different ages and vintages) affect

aggregate consumption. These issues are important as an explanation of

recent economic history, and possibly as a guide to understanding the

factors that may affect the future course of consumption and saving and the

implications of alternative economic policies. The effects of public debt

and Social Security on the level of private saving, the "interest

elasticity" of saving, and hence the optimal tax treatment of saving, are




                                         1
not only current policy issues but have been the subject of much analytical

and empirical research in the past decade.

     Since the aggregate saving rate is the net result of adding the saving done

by all households doing positive saving and subtracting the dissaving of all

households dissaving, analyses of aggregate consumption and saving must also

come to grips with the problem of aggregation to the extent that the households

are heterogeneous (see Corman (1953), Lau (1982), and Jorgenson, Lau, and

Stoker (1980, 1982)).

     Much recent research on saving behavior has focused on tests of the leading

models of saving behavior such as the lifecycle hypothesis (LCH) or the

intergenerational altruism model (ICA) also known as the Ricardian equivalence

hypothesis. This is not our purpose here. Rather, it is to identify analyze

and account for empirical regularities, if any, in. the postwar consumption and

saving behavior of U.S. households. We do this by merging longitudinal and

cross-sectional microeconomic data on various household characteristics, such as

age cross-tabulated by income (or wealth), with aggregate time-series data such

as those on consumption, income, wealth, prices, wage rates and interest rates.

In the process, we also develop measures of and trends in aggregate household

wealth and its composition, including the shares of wealth held by households

headed by persons of different ages. We then analyze the share of aggregate

wealth consumed in current purchases of goods and services and also of

leisure.1 We do this in a model that imposes minimal behavioral assumptions

on the households. We maintain that household budget constraints are

identically satisfied and households have "no money illusion", but we do not    -




1. Leisure per person per year is measured as the difference between the maximum of
hours available, defined to be 4400 hours per year, and the actual number of
hours worked.




                                        2
assume utility maximization on the part of the households, nor any functional

restrictions on the structure of household demands, such as inter- and/or intra-

temporal separability (which have been prevalent in the tests of the lifecycle

and intergenerational altruism models)

     Instead, we ask the straightforward questions: Can the integration of

these longitudinal and cross-sectional microeconoinic data with the aggregate

time series data, subject to our minimal behavioral restrictions and "exact

aggregation" conditions, provide an adequate empirical model of postwar U.S.

consumption and saving? And if so, can the model be used to assess the

importance of various factors affecting aggregate consUmption and saving in

the postwar period and to account for the growth of aggregate consumption on

the basis of these factors? One might view this work as an integration of

traditional aggregate time series consumption function estimation and growth

accounting, but incorporating microeconomic data, paying attention to the

development of age-specific household balance sheets, and applying the

theory of exact aggregation.2 We test for the effects on aggregate

consumption of some potentially important factors such as the age

distribution of wealth, relative prices, and vintage.3



2. We also include leisure, which is generally omitted from most studies of
aggregate consumption, in our study.

3. A cautious interpretation would be that our results provide us a good
explanation of the aggregate consumption and saving behavior and thus
represent a useful reconstruction of recent economic history. A less
cautious interpretation, the plausibility of which we leave to the reader,
is that the results can be given a structural interpretation which bears on
some of the issues raised above. While we are sacrificing some of the
advantages associated with assuming an imposed structure such as utility
maximization by a representative consumer with intertemporally additive
and stationary preferences, we gain substantial flexibility at the expense
of some added caution in interpreting the results.




                                         3
     The results themselves are striking: we find substantial age effects on

consumption and leisure, which suggest that policies which shift resources

among age groups are likely to affect aggregate consumption and saving; the

"interest elasticity' of aggregate saving4 is -0.5 in 1972 and 0.5 in 1980

with wealth held constant, but essentially zero in 1972 and 0.1 in 1980 when

one includes the Summers' effect, i.e. ,   the   revaluation of human wealth when

real after-tax rates of return change. We find a significant vintage

effect, i.e. ,   households headed by persons born since 1939 consume a much

larger fraction of their wealth than persons born prior to 1939 at the same

ag other things being equal. We also present formal tests of various

hypotheses concerning aggregate consumption and leisure: unitary wealth

elasticity; proportionality of expenditures to wealth; intertemporal

separability of household demand functions; and the absence of real interest

rate and relative price effects. All of these hypotheses, with the

exception of intertemporal separability, can be rejected at the 1-percent

level of significance. Each of these results is individually quite

interesting and important. Together, they supplement previous empirical

research and we believe add an important new insight to the understanding of

aggregate consumption and saving behavior in the postwar United States.

     Our paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a brief review of

the recent literature on the determinants of aggregate consumption and saving.



4. The "interest elasticity" of saving varies considerably across age cohorts
and across households with different ratios of nonhuman to human wealth.
These elasticities are evaluated at the 1972 and 1980 values of the
independent variables respectively. See Section 4 below.




                                           4
It is not meant to be exhaustive, but to enable the reader to place the novel

aspects of our research in perspective, with respect to both their strengths and

potential limitations. We discuss issues of aggregation, age effects, relative

price effects, estimates of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution and/or

interest elasticity of saving, etc. We find that various approaches have both

strengths and weaknesses, and that this is inherently true of virtually any

approach to analyzing the aggregate data. Our conclusion is that while our

approach is not free of its own limitations, it does add considerable novelty in

terms of the construction and treatment of the data and the specification of the

econometric model of aggregate time series consumption behavior.

     Section 3 presents the basic structure, rationale, andmaintained

hypotheses of the model. We discuss in some detail the theory of exact

aggregation and our use of it.5 Also presented are the comparative static

effects on consumption, leisure and saving of changes in factors such as the

prices of consumption and leisure, wealth and real after-tax rate of

interest. A discussion of the limitations of the model, including its

partial equilibrium nature, is given. Readers not interested in the

technical details of the derivations may skip to Section 4.

     Section 4 presents our empirical results. We begin with a brief

description of the data, which include aggregate data taken from relatively

traditional sources and our integration of various longitudinal and cross-

sectional age-specific individual household data with the aggregate data.




5. For a detailed discussion of the theory of exact aggregation, see Lau
(1988).

.We report the model specification, parameter estimates, and the fit of the

econometric results. In the aggregate, the model fits the data quite well

by the usual statistical criteria, We also discuss the results of the

statistical tests. We interpret the estimates of some important parameters,

such as the interest elasticity of saving, defined in various ways, and

for alternative values of other variables.

     We also compare our formulations and results to other typical aggregate

time series results. This is important not only to clarify the nature of

our results, but also to facilitate the comparison of our results to those

of the more traditional approach which analyzes aggregate consumption as a

function of aggregate income and possibly nonhuman wealth, since we analyze

the shares of aggregate wealth consumed, where wealth includes human and

nonhuman wealth, as a function of aggregate wealth and other variables.

     We also discuss the implications of the estimated age profile of

consumption and saving. It follows a pattern that is consistent with a weak

form of the "hump saving" theory of Harrod (1948) and the insight of the

lifecycle hypothesis that the propensity to consume varies with age. We

also highlight the vintage effect, in which households headed by persons

born since 1939 have a substantially higher consumption, and hence lower

saving, propensity than those born prior to 1939, other things being equal.

Among other implications, these results suggest that the typical

 "representative consumer" models estimated on aggregate time-series data may

be quite misleading. We discuss the implications of this demographic

feature of saving behavior for the future of aggregate saving in the United

States, and pose some puzzles related thereto.

     Section 5 provides an interpretation of our results. We decompose the

growth in aggregate real consumption in the United States for the period

1950-1980 into components corresponding to the various factors affecting the



                                         6
growth of consumption, such as population and household growth, and changes

in the average real wealth per household, the age distribution of wealth,

real after-tax wage rates, real after-tax rates of return, female labor

force participation rates, the unemployment rate, the share of wealth held

by households headed by persons born prior to 1939, etc. These

decompositions reveal interesting features of the factors associated with

the postwar growth of aggregate real consumption in the United States and,

in addition, illuminate the comparison of real consumption growth over

different time periods in which the trends in these factors may differ

substantially.

     Section 6 presents a discussion of our results in the context of various

analytical, empirical, and policy issues. We discuss the basic conclusions of

our research in relation to other previous research, including both the

advantages and limitations of these new results and an agenda for future

research along these lines to complement other approaches to research on

aggregate consumption and saving behavior.

     A brief discussion of our data and methods is presented in the Appendix.6



2.   A Brief Review of Research on Consumption and Saving

     In the last fifteen years, there has been an explosion of research on

consumption and saving behavior. This research has attempted to achieve several

goals, explored several different types of data and employed alternative

methodologies.   It cannot be our purpose here to survey any of these lines of

research fully. Further, while the research ought to be complementary among the

                                         .7
different lines, often the work within a particular methodological approach

either ignores or is just unsympathetic to the results of research of other

approaches. Without commenting further on this issue, we turn to a brief

discussion of each of these lines of research.

     First, there has been a substantial explosion of research along what might

be termed extension of traditional time series aggregate consumption function

estimation. Whether or not the lifecycle hypothesis of Modigliani and Brumberg

(1954) is maintained in the specification of the consumption relation, the basic

approach has been an attempt to expand the traditional set of factors thought to

influence aggregate consumption in a given period, and to derive better measures

of, or proxies for, the relevant variables such as permanent income, wealth, the

government budget deficit, or other fiscal and monetary variables. Particularly

influential has been a series of studies of the effect of expected future Social

Security benefits on saving, beginning with Feldstein (1974). While the debate

is hardly over, we believe that a sensible reading of the evidence would be that

each dollar increase in expected future Social Security benefits results in a

decrease in private saving of about twenty-five to fifty cents. The interested

reader should consult Feldstein and Barro (1978), Darby (1979), Leimer and

Lesnoy (1982), Sernheim (1987) and the methodological criticism of Auerbach and

Kotlikoff (1983).

    The interest in the effects of fiscal policy on consumption was given

added impetus by the modern restatement of the Ricardian equivalence

hypothesis by Barro (1974). This model, also known as the intergenerational

altruism model, has the striking time series implication that changes in the

age distribution of resources should not affect aggregate consumption,

conditional on aggregate resources, because transfers among cohorts will

result in exactly offsetting consumption and saving behavior so as to

maintain aggregate consumption constant. Moreover, under certain



                                         8
conditions, a shift from tax to debt finance, given the level of government

spending, will not affect consumption or national saving as government

borrowing would be offset by increased private saving in anticipation of

increased future tax liabilities. Numerous time series consumption function

studies of this phenomenon and attempted tests of the Ricardian equivalence

hypothesis are surveyed and criticized in Barth, et al (1984) and Sernheim

(1987). Two important papers are those of Feldstein (1982) and Kormendi

(1983) which disaggregate fiscal variables and measure them in several ways.

Boskin (1987) extends the measurement of government deficits and debt in

several important ways and incorporates these in estimates of consumption

functions and in analyses of the effect of deficits on the composition of

CNP. While the results of these studies are not uniform, and are subject to

some methodological criticisms (see especially the discussion in Bernheim

(1987)), the bulk of the research results tends to reject a strict

interpretation of the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis. Most studies also

reject complete Keynesian myopia and estimate that future taxes are

partially anticipated. Perhaps a quasi-consensus estimate is that a one-

dollar debt for tax substitution would increase consumption about thirty to

forty cents (see Boskin (1988)).

     A more direct test, less susceptible to some of the criticisms of the

traditional time series consumption functions, is performed by Boskin and

Kotlikoff (1985). They build a finite approximation to an intergenerationally

altruistic infinitely-lived optimal consumption program and test whether the age

distribution of resources affects consumption. One of the striking implications

of the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis is that the age distribution of

resources should not affect aggregate consumption, given the aggregate level of

resources. Boskin and Kotlikoff (1985) reject this implication of the Ricardian




                                         9
equivalence hypothesis.

     Of course, the lifecycle hypothesis and the Ricardian equivalence

hypothesis, while conflicting theories of aggregate consumption and saving

behavior with drastically different implications for the efficacy of fiscal

policy, do not exhaust the potential set of possibilities. The strict lifecycle

hypothesis with an expected average propensity to consume over the lifecycle of

unity --   i.e.   ,
                      no planned bequests --   is   also usually rejected by the data in

two types of tests. It is important to note that it is usually this strict

form of the lifecycle hypothesis, not the potential insight of consumption

smoothing or the age distribution of resources affecting aggregate consumption

(with or without a planned bequest motive), and therefore, the potential for

fiscal policy to affect consumption and national saving, that is being tested.

A weaker form of the lifecycle hypothesis with planned bequests or some convex

combination of the lifecycle hypothesis and other models of saving could still

leave some role for fiscal policy.

     The two types of tests of the lifecycle hypothesis are based on the saving

or dissaving behavior of the elderly and existence or non-existence of "forward-

looking" behavior by consumers in time series studies. Basically, the first

type of test attempts to see how wealth varies with age. The strict form of the

lifecycle hypothesis suggests that the elderly should be dissaving. Mirer

(1979), Darby (1979), David and Menchik (1981), Danziger, et al (1982), and Kurz

(1984) all report results from cross-section data that the elderly seem not to

dissave, and in fact, may continue to save. This empirical finding has

questioned the applicability of the strict form of the lifecycle hypothesis.

Related studies attempting to examine consumption and earnings paths of

households to see if aggregate saving can account for a substantial fraction of

the capital stock also typically reveal that there is a large unexplained




                                                    10
residual (see Kotlikoff and Summers (1981))

    Bernheim (1984) and Diamond and Hausman (1984) use longitudinal data to

examine the extent to which the elderly save or dissave. goth studies find that

the elderly do dissave after retirement, although the extent of dissaving is not

large in all cases. Hurd (1987) presents an interesting analysis in which the

retired elderly in the sample dissave, and therefore, the wealth-age

relationship of the elderly is consistent with the strict lifecycle hypothesis.

An interesting test for a bequest motive is whether the saving of the elderly

who have living children differs from those who do not. Hurd finds no evidence

for a bequest motive via differential saving of those who have living heirs.

    The second type of test stems from the pioneering work of Hall (1978) and

Sargent (1978). These studies use the estimated Euler equations derived from

the first-order conditions for optimal consumption behavior under uncertainty.

As noted by Hall, this suggests that consumption should evolve as a random walk

or that changes in consumption should not be predictable. Hall (1986) further

observes that "the empirical work testing this proposition says, in sum, that

consumption is fairly close to a random walk, but certain variables have enough

predictive power that the hypothesis is rejected in formal statistical tests."

These studies estimate the parameters of a stochastic difference equation for

consumption, in which the influence of wealth and income on consumption should

be zero. The basic question is often interpreted as whether there is an excess

sensitivity of consumption to income which cannot be explained by people fully




7. This study contained a mathematical error which when corrected would increase
the fraction of the capital stock which can be accounted for by lifecycle saving
from 20% to 50% --still  far less than the total.

rationally optimizing over a long time horizon. Among the more influential

papers in this tradition are Flavin (1981), Hayashi (1982, 1985), and the

microeconomic data exploration of Hall and Mishkin (1982) which concludes that

about four-fifths of consumers could be modeled as if they were maximizing over

a long time horizon, whereas one-fifth could not. The traditional

interpretation of these results is a test for liquidity constraints (rather than

following rules of thumb or some other interpretation)

     The Euler equation approach involves several important advances,

especially the ability to circumvent the thorny issue of measuring permanent

income. However, most of these studies assume rather strict maintained

hypotheses, e.g., maximization of a utility function (usually taken to be

intertemporally additive and stationary), that the econometrician can

specify the information set available to consumers at each point in time, or

more precisely, that innovations in information can be accurately measured

and modeled. For example, the response to a change in fiscal policy may

depend upon the entire previous history of certain variables, as these may

determine the subjective probability distribution of future fiscal decisions

as seen by the consumer. Even more importantly, in aggregate time series

studies, it is usually assumed that the economy can be modeled as a single

representative consumer. This notion has come increasingly into disrepute

for a variety of reasons. One is the vast array of empirical results

suggesting substantial heterogeneity in saving behavior; the theoretical

underpinnings, e.g., of the lifecycle model, suggest that differences in age

may matter; another is the studies finding a substantial fraction of the

general population liquidity constrained (Hall and ?'Iishkin (1982)), and of

the elderly liquidity constrained (Hurd and Boskin (1984)). Some analyses

are beginning to explore the ramifications of heterogeneity, e.g., in wages

or wage prospects and their implications for liquidity constraints (Hubbard



                                          12
and Judd (1987), for example)   The influence of this offshoot of the

rational expectations hypothesis from macroeconomic theory is substantial,

but the empirical usefulness of the aggregate time series studies is clouded

by the aggregation issue; when there are two or more types of consumers,

the estimation procedure breaks down and the simple interpretation given to

the results is inappropriate.

     There have also been several attempts to examine the theoretical

underpinnings of the lifecycle hypothesis and their implications for

aggregate consumption and employ various advances in technique in

reestimating aggregate consumption relations. Particularly important are

the papers of Blinder and Deaton (1985) and Deaton (1986) .    These papers

indicate that aggregation is important to issues of interpretation of the

effects of various variables on aggregate consumption, such as interest

rates; that distinguishing between fiscal actions perceived as temporary

rather than permanent is important; and that model specification may have

much to do with estimates of the degree of tax discounting.

     Much emphasis has been placed on the degree of interteinporal

substitutability or in more traditional terminology, the "interest

elasticity" of saving. Boskin (1978), Summers (1981, 1982, 1984), Hansen

and Singleton (1983) and Hall (1985) are the most often quoted studies, and

come to rather different conclusions based on their different methodologies

and data. In the traditional aggregate time series framework, small and

statistically significant positive interest elasticities of saving are found

in Boskin (1978), somewhat larger ones by Summers (1982) .    Howrey and Hymans

(1980) criticize some of this work although they focus on only a very small

component of personal saving. The issue of the degree of intertersporal

substitutability is important to real business cycle theory and has been a




                                          13
subject of much debate. Hansen and singleton (1983) estimate substantial

interteinporal substitutability, whereas Hall (1985) questions this

conclusion and finds little evidence of intertemporal substitutability.

Whether one wants to accept all of the maintained hypotheses in estimating

the intertemporal substitutability parameters (such as utility maximization

itself, or the usual intertemporally additive and stationary functional

form) and the methodology used is an open question. Problems also arise in

the interpretation of studies estimating interest elasticities of

consumption in structural consumption functions, since careful attention is

not always paid to a precise definition of the conceptual experiment under

consideration, such as what is presumed to be constant or allowed to vary.

     Perhaps a tentative summary of recent research on consumption and saving

would include the following:

     (1) No single model of consumption behavior, for example, the strict

lifecycle hypothesis or the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis, is sufficient to

explain aggregate consumption fully. Both theories are strongly rejected in

studies based on aggregate time series data, and the former is strongly rejected

in most studies of the dissaving behavior of the elderly.8

     (2) There is substantial heterogeneity among consumers. This

heterogeneity may be a function of age, the steepness of earnings and desired

consumption profiles leading to liquidity constraints, or a host of social,

psychological, environmental, historical, and economic variables.

     (3) The age distribution of resources, given their aggregate level,

                                         14
appears to affect aggregate consumption.9

     While substantial controversy still surrounds these issues, recent

methodological, data, and measurement advances hopefully will allow us to

improve our understanding of them. This paper is one attempt to do so. Our

results complement the strands of research described above without necessarily

maintaining the standard hypotheses contained within each of them.

(including both goods and services) and leisure expenditures of the current

period, tth, appropriately imputed as necessary, of an individual, say the ith,

     is assumed to be a function of the spot prices of consumption,              and

the current period and the value of its set of demographic attributes, A.t.

which includes variables representing the age of the head of the household, in

the current period. The individual household's consumption expenditure function

for the current period may thus be written as:

                         n*

where T, a positive integer, is the length of the planning horizon, which is set

sufficiently large so that it may be taken to be independent of the value of the

set of attributes A.t and t       itself.   (Of course, it is entirely possible,

depending, for example, on the age of the head of the household, which is

included in the set of attributes, A.t. that the forward prices of sufficiently

distant future periods may have no effect on the values of the consumption and

leisure expenditures of the current period.) As specified in equation (3.1),

all households are assumed to face identical spot and forward prices of

consumption but are allowed to have individual household-specific consumption

expenditure functions, as well as individual household-specific spot and forward



                                                 16
prices of leisure, wealth and set of attributes in each period. In addition,

the consumption expenditure functions are assumed to be stationary with respect

to time (but not necessarily with respect to age) .                What this means is that the

consumption expenditure of a household headed by a person aged 45, for example,

will be the same in each period if the current and forward prices, wealth and

set of other attributes remain unchanged. Thus, changing individual household

tastes are ruled out in our specification except insofar as they are embodied in

the changing value of the set of attributes over time.

     Similarly, the ith household's leisure expenditure function for the current,

tth, period may be written as:

     3.2    Relationship Between Spot and Forward Prices

     Futures markets are far from complete and forward prices of consumption and

leisure, to the extent that they exist meaningfully for an individual household

in its household decision-making process, are not generally directly observable.

It must nevertheless be true that the consumption expenditure of an individual

household in the current period depends in general not only on the prices of the

current period, but also on the expected prices of the future periods (or more

properly speaking, the (possibly subjective) joint distribution of prices of

future periods)     As these future (spot and forward) prices are not generally

observable, some assumptions on the expectations of the individual households

are necessary in order that equations (3.1) and (3.2) may be made operational.

We make the following simplifying assumptions with respect to the current and

future prices of consumption and leisure:

     (1) The expected spot prices of consumption of all future periods,




                                                       17
               taken at and conditional on the spot price of consumption of the

current period, are assumed to grow geometrically at a constant rate equal to

      which may be referred to as the rate of expected inflation.



(3.3)              = Pt   (1 + itt)




where              is the expected spot price of consumption of the (t+t')th period

and          is the expected constant rate of increase of the spot price of

consumption per period, taken at and conditional on the spot price of

consumption of the current period (as well as the spot prices of consumption of

past periods).

        (2) The expected after-tax spot prices of leisure of a household with a

standard set of attributes, A0, of all future periods, s0(÷f)'s taken at and

conditional on its spot price of leisure of the current period, w0 are assumed

to grow geometrically at a constant rate equal to



                                          t,
(3.4) wO(.) w0 (1 + itt)


        For example, suppose the standard household is one headed by a 45-year old

white male person, then the expected spot wage rates for a 45-year old white

male person for all future periods, taken at and conditional on the spot wage

rate of the current period, are assumed to be equal to the current spot wage

rate times a factor which grows geometrically at a constant rate equal to             per

period. Thus, the expected real after-tax spot prices of leisure are assumed to

be constant.

        (3) For a household with a set of attributes, A.t different from A0, the

spot price of leisure in the current period is given by:

        w.     =
                   h(A.)/h(A0)        .




                                               18
where h(.) is a known function which is independent of time. Without loss of

generality h(A0) can be taken to be unity. Holding all components of thá set of

attributes other than age constant, then h(s) considered as a function of age

gives precisely the age profile of spot wage rates.

        The spot price of leisure in any period, t'th, whether current or future,

is given by:


(3.5)         w1, =       h(A.,)   woe,



where A.           is the value of the set of attributes of the ith household in the
            it,

t'th    period.

        The expected spot prices of leisure of all future periods of a

household with a sequence of values of its set of attributes (Aits

A.
      t÷1
                    A. t÷T are equal to a sequence formed by the products of

h(A.t+t,)'s and the expected spot prices of leisure of the standard

household in the t+t'th period, and hence, by assumption (2), equal to

h(At+t,) w0 (l ÷ t)t.
        (4) The       expected nominal after-tax interest rate for all future

periods,              ,   t'—l, . .T,
                               .        taken at and conditional on the nominal after-tax

interest rate of the current period, is fixed and equal to the nominal

after-tax interest rate of the current period, i, which is identical for

all households;

        (5)       The joint distribution of the spot prices of consumption and
leisure       (of the standard household), the nominal interest rate and the rate

of inflation for all future periods in the current period, conditional on

the   spot prices of consumption and leisure, the spot nominal interest rate
and the rate of inflation in the current period are known to all individual



                                                     19
households;

        (6) The moments of the joint distribution of the spot prices of consumption

and leisure, the nominal interest rate and the rate of inflation for all future

periods of order greater than or equal to the second, conditional on the spot

prices of consumption, leisure and the spot nominal interest rate and the rate

of inflation in the current period, are fixed constants known to all individual

households.

        Note that the means of the conditional joint distribution in any current

period are assumed to be equal to the spot values of the current period. Thus

the means are allowed to change over time even though the higher-order moments

are assumed to be fixed constants.

        Given these assumptions, and the possibility of arbitrage across current

and future periods, the forward prices of consumption are given by:

                                pt+t,
                           —

where rt E       -    is   the real after-tax rate of interest in the tth period.

Mote that equation (3.6) is merely an intertemporal efficiency condition and

does not, in itself, imply that the individual household behaves as if it

maximizes a household utility function.

        Similarly, given these assumptions, and the possibility of interteniporal

borrowing and lending on the part of the individual household, the forward

prices of leisure are simply given by:

                     wUth(A.

                      (l±r)

        For an individual household with a set of attributes equal to                   in the

current period, the sequence of A÷,'s is not arbitrary. It is reasonable,

in fact even likely, that A.              is expressible as a function of              and t'

knowit to the individual households:


(3.10) A.t+t, g(At') t' —                 1     T.




Equations (3.9) and (3.10) in turn imply that


(3.11) £nwt+, = 2nwot          -
                                   t'2n(l+r)    ÷ 2nh*(A.,t?), Vt',t'l,



where h*(A.tts) h(g(At')). Vt',t'l, and h*(A.,t) considered as a function

of t' represents the stationary time profile of future expected spot prices of

leisure faced by the head of the ith individual household with set of attributes




                                                 21
Alt in the tth period. Note that equation (3.8) is also merely an intertemporal

efficiency condition for the ith individual household and does not, in itself,

imply that the ith individual household maximizes a household utility function.

      Moreover under these assumptions, the ratio of the spot prices of leisure

facing the heads of the ith and jth individual households in the current period

depend only on the values of the sets of attributes of the ith and jth

individual households in the current period. Thus,




                 w h(A.t)
                 ——             I   Vij;Vt.
                       h(A.t)


      By substituting equations (3.5), (3.7) and (3.11) into equation (3.1),

we obtain:


(3.12)          =                   T; w0,A,l,2        T; W.A.t),      '&i,t,




A similar substitution may be made for equation (3.2). Since the integers

I        T are constants, the individual household consumption and leisure

expenditure functions may be simplified into:



(3.13)                                                    V i,t

and

horizon, being constant over i and t, are suppressed.11 (Alternatively, one

may assume T., the maximum planning horizon of the ith individual household, to

be a function of A.t resulting in the same consumption and expenditure

functions as equations (3.13) and (3.14).) f*(.) and          can, of

course, be directly derived from        and f.(.) under the assumptions on

forward prices of consumption and leisure. Note that it is not necessary to

take into account "planned" bequests, if any, explicitly, as they are functions

of the saute variables as those on the right-hand sides of equations (3.13) and
         12
(3.14)




     3.3 Aggregation

     If data on the consumption and leisure expenditures as well as the wealth

and values of the set of attributes of individual households (or groups of

households with approximately identical wealth and set of attributes) are

available on a time-series basis, then one can estimate the consumption and

leisure expenditure functions in equations (3.13) and (3.14) directly after

specifying parametric functional forms for        and        and stochastic

disturbance terms for the system of two equations. (All the variables included

in the consumption and leisure expenditure functions are observable.)

Unfortunately, such disaggregated data are not generally available on a time-




11. Similarly, the higher-order moments of the conditional joint distribution of
prices and interest rates, being constants, may also be suppressed even if they
affect current consumption and leisure expenditures.

12. We note that alternative assumptions on expectations can be consistent with hLs
model so long as they result in stationary household consumption and leisure
expenditure functions of the form in equations (3.13) and (3.14).




                                         23
series basis. What are more generally available are data on aggregate

consumption and leisure expenditures for the whole economy, data on the joint

distribution of individual household wealth and attributes, and the total

number of individual households, Nt in the economy in the current period.

What is needed is thus a model in which variations in aggregate consumption and

leisure expenditures can be explained by variations in the spot prices of

consumption and leisure, the real interest rate, the joint distribution of

individual household wealth and attributes and the total number of individual

households. Variations in the joint distribution of individual household wealth

and attributes may be measured through variables that may be considered as

"statistics" of the joint distribution. Examples of such variables include

average wealth per household, average age of heads of individual households, and

the variance of wealth over individual households. If the joint distribution of

individual household wealth and attributes changes, the values of these

variables may be expected to change.

         The aggregate consumption and leisure expenditure functions are thus

expected to take the form:



                  Nt
(3.15)
                              F(p, w0 rt NtJ s1t S2                S)

                  Nt

                                F(pt   wot        Nt S1, S2         S)

where N is the total number of individual households in the current, tth, period,

 it i — 1,..,,
S.   ,               n, are the values of the n variables --   "statistics"   --


reflecting the joint distribution of individual household wealth and attributes

of the current period.

       The S's, i 1. n, are each functions of W1. WNt Ai.
ANt as well as Nt. Moreover, each such function should remain unchanged with

respect to a simple renumbering of the individual households. In other words,

each such function must be symmetric with respect to the indexes or

equivalently, invariant to a permutation of the indexes 1 through N. Thus, for

example,




(3.17)              S1                  WNt A1t                       Nt)

Furthermore, even if not all of                                                      are observed,

In other words, the consumption and leisure expenditure functions of individual

households with identical wealths and attributes are each identical up to the

addition of a function independent of wealth and attributes. If it were

further assumed that the individual consumption and leisure expenditures are

nonnegative and aggregate consumption and leisure expenditures are both zero

when aggregate wealth is zero, the individual consumption and leisure

expenditure functions may be simplified to:

ensure that the expenditure functions, including planned future expenditures and

bequests, sum to total wealth (sununability) and that the individual households

have no money illusion (zero degree homogeneity). For our analysis we choose

the following types of gk(W.t, A.t) functions:

utility maximization on the part of the individual households, although our

specifications in equations (3.33) and (3.34) are not inconsistent with it. The

rationale for maintaining the hypothesis of suimnability is simply that each

individual household can make its lifetime consumption, leisure and bequest

choices only within its lifetime wealth constraint. The rationale for

maintaining the hypothesis of zero degree homogeneity is simply that each

individual household should not change its lifetime consumption, leisure and

bequest choices if the set of possible choices (represented by all available

choices within the lifetime wealth constraint) is unchanged. Note that the two

hypotheses do not imply utility maximization of the individual household. The

decision-making process within each household can be arbitrary as long as it is

stationary over tine. For example, one may have the husband and the wife of a

household each making decisions on fifty percent of the individual household's

total resources. The resulting behavior for the household can be expected to

satisfy summability and zero degree homogeneity but not necessarily utility

maximization by the individual household as a whole.




        3.5 Specific Hypotheses on Consumption Behavior

        The specification in equations (3.33) and (3.34) is sufficiently flexible

to embed a number of hypotheses found in the literature on consumption behavior.

We discuss each of these hypotheses in turn.

        (1) Unitary Wealth Elasticity. It is often assumed that individual

household consumption (and leisure) expenditure is proportional to individual

household wealth. In the context of our specification, this hypothesis implies

that:

                                =0
            cW
                   -
                       cc   +

and



                                           30
          '3zW =     - zc   +         0



     (2) Proportionality of Expenditures to Wealth. This hypothesis is often

identified with Friedman (1957).14 It implies that consumption (and leisure)

expenditure is proportional to wealth, and, in addition, that the factors of

proportionality depend only on the rate of interest but not the prices, given

wealth. In the context of our specification, this hypothesis implies that:


          /3
               cc   +pcz—o
          p zc      +pzz—o


                        =0

For this degenerate case consumption and leisure expenditures are fixed constant

are idenical1y zero, so that they satisfy the restrictions here. See

obviously, if the hypothesis of unitary wealth elasticity does not hold, the

proportionality hypothesis cannot hold.

     (3) Interteinporal Separability. Intertemporal separability is a

hypothesis that is often maintained when each individual household is assumed to

maximize its utility. It implies that the interternporal utility function of the

household has the form,




     U.t(C.                 Zi(t+ly... Ci(t+T)lZi(t+T))



   Uit(1Jt(CitZit)IJt+l(Ci(t+l)frZi(t÷l))        Ut+T(Ci(t+T)Zi(t+T)))


It encompasses as special cases that of intertemporal additivity:




    U     t'


and that of intertemporal stationary additivity:




    U      t'=O


    The principal empirical implication of intertemporal separability is

that the relative expenditures on different commodities within the same

period are independent of the prices of the commodities in a different

period. This is a necessary (but not in general sufficient) condition for



16. A further possible specialization consists of replacing U(.) by U(.).




                                            32
intertemporal additivity and intertemporal stationary additivity as defined

above. This hypothesis is testable, however, even for a household not

necessarily assumed to be maximizing utility. Under our assumptions about

the relationship between current and expected future spot prices, this

hypothesis implies that the relative expenditures of the current period are

independent of the real after-tax rate of interest, holding wealth constant.

In terms of our specification, this hypothesis implies that:



               pcr

and


               zr

Note, however, that under this hypothesis, current consumption and leisure

expenditures may still be sensitive to the real after-tax rate of interest,

only their ratio is insensitive to the real after-tax rate of interest. The

hypothesis that we test, as discussed above, is weaker than the usual

hypothesis of intertemporal separability of the utility function (and a

fortiori weaker than the hypotheses of intertemporal additivity and

intertemporal stationary additivity).


      (4) Absence of Interest Rate Effects. This hypothesis implies that

both consumption and leisure expenditures are, given aggregate wealth and

its distribution, independent of the real after-tax rate of interest.

However, it does not preclude a change in the real rate of interest from

affecting consumption and leisure expenditures indirectly through its effect

on the revaluation of wealth (the so-called "Summers' effect"). In the

context of our specification, this hypothesis implies



     cr 0; zr —            0; and r —

Obviously, if the hypothesis of intertemporal separability does not hold, the
hypothesis of no interest rate effects cannot hold.

      (5) Complete Price Independence. An extreme hypothesis about consumption

and leisure behavior is that the consumption and leisure expenditure to wealth

ratios are fixed independently of current and expected future prices, holding

wealth constant. Such a hypothesis implies that all the parameters are zero

household behavior (summability and zero degree homogeneity (no money illusion))

and minimal assumptions necessary for exact aggregation. We distinguish

among types of households based on the age of the head of household and allow

changes in the composition of the households by type to affect aggregate

to analyze other attributes as well, we focus in this paper on the attribute

namely age, as discussed in many of the studies reviewed in Section 2.



     3.6 Specification of the Aggregate Expenditure Functions

     The aggregate consumption and leisure expenditure functions are obtained by

adding up the individual consumption and leisure expenditure functions across

the households:

where Dt is a dummy variable which takes the value 1 if the ith

household is of the jth type at time t and 0 if the ith household is not of the

jth type at time t.

     It is possible to estimate equations (3.35) and (3.36) directly.

However, we note that both dependent variables, aggregate nominal

consumption and leisure expenditures, are 1.ikely to show sustained increases

over time because of the increase in the number of households (population)

and inflation. It is therefore unlikely that additive stochastic

disturbance terms are (separately) homoscedastic for each of the two



                                              35
functions. In order to mitigate the possibility of heteroscedasticity, we

divide both sides of equations (3,35) and (3.36) by aggregate wealth at time

t, obtaining the aggregate consumption expenditure to wealth and leisure

expenditure to wealth ratios:

The 'statistics'1 representing the distribution of wealth by size and by the

type of household can be obtained from a time-series of cross-sectional

income surveys.

     In addition, if the parameters are known, equations (3.37) and (3,38)

may be used to predict the effects on aggregate consumption, leisure and

saving of alternative potential future paths of evolution of the size and

age distribution of total wealth.

     Finally, it is important to note that our model focuses entirely on the

household side - -   the   demands for current and future consumption and leisure

(or the mirror image, supplies of current and future labor). The households

are assumed to behave as price-takers, that is, as if their individual

actions do not affect the (possibly subjective) joint distribution of

current and futuze prices. The model leaves unexplained the current and

future prices, wealth and its distribution. Thus, it is a partial

equilibrium model, reflecting only the equilibrium of the households, but

not necessarily the markets for consumption goods, labor and saving.



     3.7 Comparative Static Effects

     We attempt to estimate the comparative static effects of changes in the

current price of consumption, after-tax wage rate, wealth and the real after-tax

rate of interest (with human wealth held constant as well as revalued) on the

consumption, leisure and value of saving (defined as in the National Income and

the elasticities of each of the dependent variables with respect to the

independent variables (at a given set of values of the latter).

        We also compute the elasticities of consumption and leisure demands with

respect to the after-tax wage rate and the real after-tax rate of interest under

the assumption of full revaluation of human wealth of the household. Nonhuman

wealth of the household is assumed to consist entirely of floating rate assets

and liabilities and hence to remain unchanged with respect to changes in the

real after-tax rate of interest.

          Finally, we attempt to estimate the effects of changes in the independent

variables on saving. The saving of the ith household in the tth period, S..

may be defined as the difference between current full income and current

expenditure on consumption and leisure:



(3.46)                                                               -                -

where            is the maximum quantity of leisure of the ith household in the tth

period.22 The elasticity formulae for saving may be computed as follows:23




22. Note that the net change in the value of wealth, including capital gains or
losses and transfers, is not included in this NIPA definition of saving, Of
course, transfers net to zero for the economy as a whole (except for net
unilateral transfers to foreigners).

that is, the interest elasticity of saving with human wealth evaluation is

expected to be greater than that without human wealth revaluation. With

negative saving, the opposite is true. One can also use these same formulae to

calculate the aggregate elasticities. For example, the elasticity of

aggregate saving with respect to the real after-tax rate of interest, with

human wealth revaluation, may be computed as:

4.   Empirical Results

     4.1 A Brief Description of the Data

     As discussed in the introduction and Section 3, we attempt to combine

various types of data in order to develop an improved empirical model of

aggregate consumption. Primarily, we combine disaggregated data on the age

distribution of income and its components and consumption with aggregate time

series data on consumption, leisure, wealth, and price variables. We use the

rich source of disaggregated information available in the annual Current

Population Surveys on income and other variables cross-tabulated by various

household characteristics such as age of head of household to build cohort-

specific human and nonhuman wealth accounts which aggregate to national wealth.

We use additional information from the 1972-73 Consumer Expenditure Survey and

the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to estimate how the ratio of household

consumption and leisure to wealth varies by the age of the head of household.

     The aggregate consumption data come from the National Income and Product

Accounts (NIPA), and no attempt is made here to develop a more consistent

treatment of the services of consumer durables, as is sometimes done (see, for

example, Boskin, Robinson and Huber (1988), Christensen and Jorgenson (1973), or

David and Scadding (1974)).

     Data on interest rates, wage rates, and price levels are developed from

standard sources and their derivations are briefly described in the Appendix, as

are our data on female labor force participation and unemployment rates. Our

methods for deriving expected inflation and the expected present value of human

and nonhuman wealth are also briefly described in the Appendix. For human




                                        47
                                            27         -
wealth,   we estimate an age-wage profile         and discount expected future earnings

of each age cohort by the sum of the real after-tax discount rate and mortality

probability. For nonhuman wealth, we blow up, for each category of a property

income, the sum across all age cohorts so that it conforms to the corresponding

NIPA aggregate totals, and then capitalize total property income for each age

cohort. We use different discount rates for human and non-human capital as

discussed in the Appendix.

     Before proceeding to a discussion of the econometric results it is

worthwhile to examine the trends in the actual consumption and leisure data.

Figure 4.1 presents the aggregate consumption and leisure expenditures for

the U.S. economy from 1947 to 1980 in constant 1972 prices. These have

grown steadily in the time period under study, with an apparent acceleration

in the rate beginning in the early 1960s.

     Based on our estimated consumption and leisure expenditure equations, we

present in Section 5 below the decomposition of the annual growth rate of

aggregate consumption into factors presumed to explain it, broken down into two

periods, 1950-62 and 1963-80, roughly corresponding to modest and more rapid

growth in aggregate consumption, respectively.

     Figure 4.2 presents a prelude to the econometric results. We compare the

estimated consumption to CNP ratio (derived from the product of our

econometrically estimated ratio of consumption to wealth and the ratio of our

estimated wealth to GNP) to the actual consumption to ON? ratio for the period




27. Male age-earnings profiles, controlling for education, race, etc., are quite
stable over time in the U.S., and surprisingly similar across countries (see,
for example, Smith and Welch (1986) and Psacharopoulos (1981)).

1947-80. In the immediate post-war period, saving, which had been a very small

fraction of GNP, rose substantially and this accounts for a five or six

percentage point decline in the consumption to CNP ratio from 1947 to 1951.

Consumption from the 1950s to the early l960s was relatively constant as a share

of CNP. Beginning in the early 1960s, it fell for several years, and then

fluctuated in a narrow band around 0.61 through the end of the 1970s. Our

estimated consumption/GNP ratio tracks the actual consumption/CNP ratio quite

well. The maximum deviation for any year is about one percent of CNP.

     Figure 4.3 looks at the flip side of consumption, namely saving.   It

presents the actual NIPA saving to CNP ratio and the estimated saving to GNP

ratio derived from our consumption expenditure equation reported below. Again,

from a very low rate in the immediate post-war period, saving as a ratio of GNP

rose rapidly in the late 1940s, was fairly level around 7% throughout the 195Os,

rose to a little over 8% in the early 1970s, and has been on a somewhat downward

trend from the early 1970s to 1980 (a trend which continued in the l9SOs).

Again, since our estimated consumption to CNP ratio reflects actual consumption

to CNP quite well, so does our estimated saving to GNP ratio track actual saving

to CNP quite well. The maximum deviation is again approximately 1% of CNP (in

1957, at the time considered a bad recession).

     We now turn to a detailed discussion of the econometric model and results.

These results include estimates of aggregate consumption and leisure expenditure

share (of aggregate wealth) equations, tests of various hypotheses concerning

aggregate consumption and estimates of parameters of particular economic

interest.

        4.2 Econometric Specification and Estimation

        We start from the specifications in equations (3.37) and (3.38). We

distinguish the types of households by means of the following set of dummy

variables:
                    1, if the age of the head of the ith household is between 14 and 24
                       years in the tth period;
         it I1o,          otherwise.

                          if the age of the head of the ith household is between 25 and
                          34 years in the tth period;
        D                 otherwise

                          if the age of the head of the ith household is between 35 and
                          44 years in the tth period;
              I
              Io          otherwise.

                    1,    if the age of the head of the ith household is between 55 and
                          64 years in the tth period;
              5
         it
              I.          otherwise.

                   1, if the age of the head of the ith household is greater than or
                      equal to 65 in the tth period;
         65
                         otherwise.

                         if the head of the ith household in the tth period was born prior
                         to 1939;

                         otherwise.


We note that because of the presence of the constants a and a in equations

(3.37) and (3.38), it is not necessary to have a dummy variable for households

headed by persons in the age-cohort of 45-54 years. We further note that the

dummy variable D?9 attempts to distinguish between those households headed

by persons who experienced the Great Depression and those which were not.

        In accordance with equations (3.37) and (3.38), we form variables of the

type:




                                                  50
          Wit
for each j and t. These variables may be interpreted as the share of aggregate

wealth held by households headed by persons in the jth age-cohort in the tth

period.

     In addition1 we introduce two non-household specific independent variables

which are believed to influence current consumption and leisure decisions. The

first variable is the female labor force participation rate (FLPR) in

percent.28 The second variable is the unemployment rate, represented by the

natural logarithm of the prime age white male unemployment rate (UE), in

percent. These two independent variables, as well as the share of wealth held

by the pre-1939 cohort, are presented in Figure 4.4 (normalized to be 1.0 in

1972), and compared against the pure time trend variable. It is readily

apparent that these variables move quite independently of one another and of the

pure time trend.

     Finally, we add stochastic disturbance terms to both the consumption and

leisure expenditure share equations. The stochastic disturbance terms are

assumed to have a constant variance-covariance matrix over time and are possibly

correlated across equations but not across time periods. We use annual data



28. For the leisure expenditure equation, it is assumed that the female labor
force participation rate has no effect before 1963. The female labor force
participation rate accelerated around 1963, as did related household
formation and dissolution data, and it roughly marked the beginning of the
changing perception of women's roles in society.

29. While at the level of the individual household it is reasonable to assume that
the household is a price-taker in the markets of consumption, labor and credit,
in the aggregate it is not plausible to maintain that the prices are exogenous
or predetermined. Thus, it may be preferable to estimate the parameters by a
nonlinear instrumental variables approach. This will be attempted at a later
date.

consumption and leisure to wealth share equations. Instead, the difference

between the consumption expenditure-wealth ratios (and the leisure

expenditure-wealth ratios) of any two age cohorts in 1972 is assumed to be

the same as the difference between the corresponding averages derived from

the 1972-73 Consumer Expenditure Survey. However, the absolute levels of

the cohort-specific consumption expenditure-wealth and leisure expenditure-

wealth ratios are not constrained to be the same as the averages in the

1972-1973 Consumer Expenditure Survey. In addition, these ratios are

required to satisfy unimodality constraints, that is, the slopes of their

respective age profiles are allowed to change signs only once up to age 64.
