Financing as a Supply Chain: The Capital Structure of Banks and Borrowers

                                               ABSTRACT

We develop a model of the joint capital structure decisions of banks and their borrowers. Strikingly
high bank leverage emerges naturally from the interplay between two sets of forces. First, seniority
and diversification reduce bank asset volatility by an order of magnitude relative to that of their borrowers.
Second, previously unstudied supply chain effects mean that highly levered financial intermediaries
are the most efficient. Low asset volatility enables banks to safely take on high leverage; supply chain
effects compel them to do so. Firms with low leverage also arise naturally as borrowers internalize
the systematic risk costs they impose on their lenders. Because risk assessment techniques from the
Basel II framework underlie our structural model, we can quantify the impact capital regulation and
other government interventions have on bank leverage, firm leverage, and fragility. Deposit insurance
and the expectation of government bailouts lead not only to risk taking by banks, but increased risk
taking by firms. Capital regulation lowers bank leverage but can lead to compensating increases in
the leverage of firms, as well as a small increase in borrowing costs.

1       Introduction

In the wake of the recent financial crisis, there have been repeated calls from academics, practitioners,
and policy makers to tighten the regulation of financial institutions and force banks to hold more
equity capital. Business leaders have responded that leverage is a natural part of the banking business
and that limiting it will inhibit credit access and impede economic growth. This paper builds a quanti-
tative model of banking that explains bank capital structure decisions and sheds light on fundamental
questions about the nature of banking.

There is disagreement on the causes and effects of high bank leverage; however, there is no disagreement
that banks and other financial institutions are indeed highly indebted. The average leverage of U.S.
banks, measured as the ratio of debt to assets, has been in the range of 87%–95% over the past eighty
years.1 At the same time, the average leverage of public U.S. non-financials, measured in the same
way, has been in the range of 20%–30% over a long period, below the predictions of many models.2
This dramatic difference in financial structure is puzzling at first glance.

In this paper we explain this gap by modeling the interaction between a bank’s debt decisions and
the debt decisions of that bank’s borrowers. Our framework blends the Vasicek (2002) model of bank
portfolio risk, as used in the Basel regulatory framework, with standard capital structure models. The
interaction between banks and borrowers explains the high leverage of banks and the low leverage of
firms. In our base case, banks opt for leverage of 88% while firms chose only 37% leverage, close to
real-world values.

High bank leverage is possible because bank assets are an order of magnitude less volatile than the
assets of their borrowers. This dramatic risk reduction arises due to banks’ diversification and, more
importantly, banks’ status as senior creditors. The power of these two factors, and a synergy between
them, leads to a dramatic reduction in bank volatility and allows banks to carry high debt without
undue default risk. Borrower asset volatility of 40% leads to bank asset volatility of 1.7%, consistent
with empirical evidence.3

While diversification and seniority mean banks can pursue high leverage with relative safety, our
supply chain mechanisms compel them to do so. Banks provide financing to other agents and pass
their financial frictions on to their borrowers. High leverage allows debt benefits to be more efficiently
transported down this financing supply chain. The essence of the supply chain effects is that debt
benefits originate only at the bank level. This is driven by a fundamental asymmetry between final

     E.g., Ronn and Verma (1986) and Hassan, Karels, and Peterson (1994) find bank asset volatility ranging from 0.009
to 0.023.

users of financing (“downstream” borrowers) and those that act as intermediaries passing financing
along (“upstream” borrowers). Even if the downstream borrowers have extremely low leverage, it is
still optimal for the upstream borrowers – banks – to lever up, generate debt benefits, and pass those
benefits downstream. However, if the upstream borrowers have similarly low leverage, no benefits are
generated that can be passed along and, as a result, the downstream borrowers also do not lever up.

Beyond its effect on bank leverage, this financing supply chain leads to strategic interaction between
bank and borrower debt decisions: bank leverage and firm leverage can act as both strategic substitutes
and strategic complements. The strategic substitution effect arises because of bank distress costs.
Imagine a scenario where banks are very highly levered and thus are less capable of weathering losses
during economic downturns. If financial distress is costly, competitive banks pass this cost on to their
borrowers. These borrowers respond by taking on less debt, effectively shielding banks by making
their loan portfolio safer. In the opposite scenario, where banks have low leverage, these systemic risk
costs are lessened and bank borrowers borrow more.

The strategic complementarity effect arises from the link between the benefits of debt for banks and
borrowers. Banks pass their own debt benefits, such as tax benefits, downstream to their borrowers
by charging lower loan interest rates. In a competitive banking environment, banks that use equity
financing are competed out of business by more levered banks which can offer lower interest rates. A
bank’s borrowers get their own benefits from debt, but by paying interest to the bank, they decrease
the bank’s debt benefits unless the bank’s debt is correspondingly increased.

Although these forces are general enough to apply to a variety of frictions and borrowers, we consider
firms that borrow from banks and are subject to both bankruptcy costs and the tax benefits of debt.
Banks and firms deduct interest payments from their taxes and face proportional default costs in
bankruptcy. The diversification, seniority, and supply chain mechanisms we identify are much more
general and play a similar role in the presence of other incentives to issue debt and other classes of
borrowers.

Regulators, academics, and policymakers can use our framework to analyze the impact of deposit
insurance, bailouts, and capital regulation. Because our framework is built on commonly calibrated
models, it naturally lends itself to quantitative analysis. We find that both deposit insurance and
bailout expectations lead to moral hazard and increase bank leverage. These effects are highly non-
linear – a moderate amount of insured deposits (below 94% of bank liabilities) or bailouts with low
probability (below 50%) has minimal impact on bank risk taking but larger interventions can induce
dramatic gambling strategies.

Effective capital regulation reduces the moral hazard banks face, but ineffective capital regulation has
its own hazards. Capital regulation that fails to take into account borrower risk can cause banks to
lend to riskier firms, due to the substitution effect, and lead to higher rates of non-financial corporate


                                                    3
defaults. The Standardized Approach of Basel II and III suffers from this flaw, which significantly
reduces the efficacy of these regulations. These effects are particularly pronounced in the presence of
deposit insurance, bailouts, or other subsidies to failed banks. Stronger capital regulation or appropri-
ately risk-weighted capital regulation is effective at preventing these effects, but may still be subject
to gaming. For example, we consider the possibility that banks can change loan characteristics such
as systematic exposure, which dramatically increases moral hazard and bank risk taking. This sug-
gests that current capital regulation may be inadequate to the extent that banks can manipulate
between-exposure correlation or other loan parameters.

Current capital regulation standards may be insufficiently strong and insufficiently targeted. For
example, we find that doubling the equity requirements of Basel II – increasing equity capital require-
ments to 16% for the Basel Standardized approach and doubling the equity requirements of the Basel
Internal Ratings-Based Approach – lowers the incidence of bank failure and associated bailout costs by
up to 80%. Our model shows that capital requirements increase the costs of credit by 1.5 basis points
for each percentage point of bank equity, a low number that suggests additional capital regulation has
a relatively low cost and may be warranted.

Beyond this, better targeted capital regulation, where the banks subject to the most extreme moral
hazard face the toughest restrictions, can also increase efficiency. The Basel III proposal moves towards
this by imposing additional requirements on systemically important financial institutions. Capital
regulation that goes farther and imposes higher equity requirements on banks with high levels of
insured deposits may improve efficiency. Even when subject to Basel-style capital regulation, banks
with insured deposits accounting for more than 95% of their liabilities have an incentive to gamble.
Many banks have such high levels of insured deposits and without strong capital regulation those
banks have an incentive to undertake risky behavior.

The supply chain model also allows us to analyze the impact of varying economically important
parameters. For example, consider an increase in the default costs of firms. First, banks react by
decreasing their leverage as they now have riskier portfolios. Second, firms decrease their leverage as
their distress costs have increased. Lower firm leverage reduces bank portfolio volatility and pushes
bank leverage up, through the strategy substitution effect. Surprisingly, the overall effect is to increase
bank leverage, at least for our parameters.

Our analysis yields a number of empirical predictions. First, banks with large insured deposit bases
or banks likely to be subject to government bailouts, will have higher leverage and make riskier loans.
Second, better diversified banks, such as national banks, will have higher leverage and less asset
volatility than less diversified banks, such as local banks. Third, borrowers with more systemic risk
will pay higher interest rates than otherwise similar borrowers with less systemic risk, unless their
loans are priced by banks subject to bailouts or deposit insurance.



                                                    4
Beyond capital regulation and bank-specific policy, our results suggest that equalizing the tax treat-
ment of debt and equity will reduce systemic risk. Because tax benefits to debt are a transfer and do
not obviously create value, such a change could be more efficient and less costly than other proposals
for financial regulation.

Our supply-chain effects are general enough to apply to many of the bank financing frictions that have
been identified in the literature. Like Harding, Liang, and Ross (2007), we use the tax benefits and
bankruptcy costs framework of Kraus and Litzenberger (1973). However, our supply chain approach
could equally well apply to other financing frictions.      For example, DeAngelo and Stulz (2013)
model bank capital structure by assuming banks generate value by taking deposits and this drives
bank leverage: our model could be extended to have these benefits passed down the financing supply
chain rather than tax benefits. Allen and Carletti (2013) also study the interplay between banks and
borrowers by studying a segmented market for banks and firms, where the bank serves one or two
firms and all the agents set their equity capital. They argue that deposits with below market interest
rates are a subsidy on bank borrowing, which means bank’s debt is not fairly priced. This could easily
be incorporated in our framework.

Our paper is also related to a literature on the costs and benefits of capital regulation. The Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision (2010) and Elliott, Salloy, and Santos (2012) estimate that capital
regulation increases lending spreads by 0.28%–0.66%. We find costs an order of magnitude lower than
these papers because we allow for endogenous bank return on equity and we allow firms to adjust their
capital structure in response to regulation.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Sections 2 and 3, we develop and discuss a supply
chain model of bank and firm financing. In Section 4, we present the quantitative results on bank and
firm leverage. In Section 5, we analyze the impact of government bailouts and deposit insurance and
in Section 6 we explore the impact of capital regulation. In Sections 7 and 8, we extend the model
to cover banks’ bargaining power and bond markets, respectively. In Section 9, we discuss possible
extensions to the model. Concluding remarks are given in Section 10.



2    A Supply Chain Model of Financing

In this section, we blend a structural model of bank portfolio returns with the trade-off theory of
capital structure. Section 2.1 outlines a model of bank capital structure using the Vasicek (2002)
framework, which applies a Merton (1974) style intuition to bank portfolios by assuming they are
composed of loans secured by correlated lognormally distributed assets. Section 2.2 sets up a model
of a firm that is subject to trade-off frictions and issues Merton (1974) style debt. Section 2.3 links
the bank with the firm to derive a unified model of the financing supply chain.


                                                  5
The Vasicek model we use for bank assets has been widely used by financial regulators. Notably, it
underlies the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach to capital regulation in Basel II and Basel III.4
Thus, our model of capital structure decision-making can be readily applied to the existing capital
regulation framework.


2.1    Capital Structure of Banks

Consider a bank with a portfolio of loans. Each loan i is collateralized by an asset that pays a one-off
cash flow of Ai at the loan’s maturity at time T . The value of this cash flow is lognormally distributed
with                                                            

                                      log A ∼ N − T σ , T σ ,                                         (1)
                                                     2

where N (µ, σ 2 ) denotes the normal distribution with mean µ and standard deviation σ. This specifi-
cation has the property that E Ai = 1.
                                 


Each loan has a promised repayment of RA due at time T . The time-T asset value Ai determines
whether the loan is repaid or defaults. If Ai is greater than some threshold CA , the loan does not
default and the bank receives a full repayment of RA . (In Section 2.2, where a firm’s optimal capital
structure decision is considered, optimal default thresholds and debt repayments are derived.) If the
asset value is low, Ai < CA , the loan defaults and ownership of the collateral passes to the bank. The
bank recovers (1 − αA )Ai , where αA is the proportional bankruptcy cost incurred on defaulted bank
loans.

The bank’s payoff from any loan i, B i , is given by

                              B i = RA I Ai ≥ CA + (1 − αA )Ai I Ai < CA ,

                                                                                                             (2)

where I[·] is the indicator function.

A bank’s portfolio consists of n identically structured loans. The assets that underlie these loans are
exposed both to a common systematic shock and to loan-specific idiosyncratic shocks. We can write
the time-T value of the asset collateralizing loan i in terms of these shocks:
                                           p       p               1
                                log Ai =    ρT σY + (1 − ρ)T σZ i − T σ 2 ,                                  (3)
                                                                   2
where Y is the systematic shock, Z i is a loan-specific idiosyncratic shock, and the shock random
variables Y, Z 1 , Z 2 , . . . , Z n are jointly independent and standard normal.

If the bank’s loan portfolio is composed of many small loans, the idiosyncratic shocks to each loan are
diversified away and the only variation that matters is the systematic shock, which can cause multiple
borrowers to default at once. Taking n → ∞ so that the bank’s portfolio is perfectly fine-grained, we
get B → E B i |Y almost surely from the Strong Law of Large Numbers.6

Models of capital regulation, including those based on the Vasicek (2002) framework, typically assume
the exogenous existence of bank capital. In reality, banks make capital structure decisions in response
to capital regulation and financial frictions. We focus on the twin frictions of corporate tax and distress
costs, which underly the trade-off theory of capital structure that is commonly applied to nonfinancial
firms.

A profitable bank owes corporate income tax and can reduce this tax expense by deducting the interest
payments on debt. Banks are assumed to have access to competitive debt markets, and the bank’s
debt is thus fairly priced. As in the Merton (1974) model, we assume that the bank’s debt is zero
coupon. Let VBD denote the price of the bank’s debt and RB denote the amount the bank must pay
to its creditors at time T . The bank’s interest obligation is then RB − VBD , and it can use this interest
payment to reduce its tax bill.

We assume the bank pays corporate income tax at rate τ on its pre-tax profit, where the bank’s pre-tax
profit consists of the value of its portfolio, B; less the cost of its portfolio, VAD ; less the interest paid,

    We model loan recoveries directly, from collateral value. This differs from most applications of the Vasicek (2002)
model, which  take
                 recovery in default as fixed and model only the portion of loans that default.

derived in Section 2.3.) Thus, the bank faces a tax obligation of τ (B − VAD − (RB − VBD )), provided
this number is positive.8 The total free cash flow available to the bank’s debt and equity holders is
the after-tax value of the bank’s portfolio:

Debt introduces the possibility of financial distress. The bank defaults if this free cash flow is less than
the amount the bank owes its creditors, so that the bank’s payoff to equity holders would be negative
if default did not occur. We can write the bank’s default condition as

                                  B − τ max {0, B − VAD − (RB − VBD )} < RB .                                              (7)

Because VAD > VBD , this condition simplifies to

                                                         B < RB .                                                          (8)

The bank defaults if and only if its portfolio value at time T is below the amount it owes its creditors.
Ownership of a defaulting bank passes to its creditors (ignoring for now the possibility of government
intervention). These creditors recover (1 − αB )B, the bank’s portfolio value less the proportional
bankruptcy costs of αB .

The resulting cash flows to the bank’s claimholders are summarized in Table 1. Discounting these
payoffs to time 0, the bank’s equity value VBE and debt value VBD are given by

              VBE = e−T rf E [(B − τ max {0, B − VAD − RB + VBD } − RB ) I [B ≥ RB ]] and                                  (9)
              VBD = e−T rf E [RB I [B ≥ RB ] + (1 − αB )BI [B < RB ]] ,                                                  (10)

where rf is the instantaneous risk-free rate.

The bank’s total value is the sum of the values of the debt and equity claims:
                                                                                       
                        −T rf
 VB = VBD + VBE = e           E (1 − τ )B + τ min {B, VAD + RB − VBD } − αB BI [B < RB ] . (11)
                                 | {z }       |             {z            } |   {z    }

This value, VB , can be maximized by promising an appropriate repayment, RB . As in the standard
trade-off model, an overly high repayment will result in excessive default costs, while an overly low
repayment will forgo tax benefits.
   7
     In the U.S., interest tax credits are based on the annual interest implied by the original issue discount. These annual
tax credits will add up to the full original issue discount. In our model, the only cash flows occur at time T and thus
this tax credit can only be applied against the corporate tax due at that time.
   8
     In this asymmetric tax system, the bank pays tax on its profit but does not get a tax rebate on its losses. Alternatively,
the bank can be assumed to recover a proportional tax rebate on losses. Such a tax system produces similar results.
More complicated tax systems could easily be introduced into this model.

2.2    Capital Structure of Nonfinancial Firms

We model the capital structure decisions of nonfinancial firms by adding firm-level tax and bankruptcy
costs to the Merton (1974) model of risky corporate debt.9 This allows us to endogenize the loan
variables that we took as exogenous in the previous section.

Consider a single firm that balances the tax benefit of debt against the cost of financial distress. The
firm has a single, time-T , pre-tax cash flow F i with
                                                                
                                                      1
                                      log F i ∼ N − T σ 2 , T σ 2 .                                  (12)
                                                      2

This firm pays corporate income tax at a linear rate τ on this cash flow and so faces a total tax burden
of τ F i . To reduce that tax burden, the firm can issue zero-coupon debt with face value RF , maturity
T , and price VF D . For now, assume that the firm’s debt is priced by competitive, risk-neutral investors
without financing frictions. (In Section 2.3, the firm’s interest rate will be tied to the bank’s funding
decision.) As with the bank, the firm’s interest payment reduces its tax liability. The firm pays
RF − VF D in interest at time T , and so the firm’s equity holders realize a tax benefit of τ (RF − VF D )
against any tax owed by the firm.

Under these assumptions, the firm’s time-T free cash flow is

                                        F i − τ max 0, F i − (RF − VF D ) .
                                                   
                                                                                                                    (13)

The firm defaults if this free cash flow is less than the firm’s debt obligations, i.e.,

                                      F i − τ max 0, F i − (RF − VF D ) < RF .
                                                 
                                                                                                                    (14)

As RF > VF D , the firm’s default condition can be simplified to
                                                                  τ
                                            F i < CF = RF +          VF D ,                                         (15)
                                                                 1−τ
where CF is the firm’s default threshold. In default, ownership of the firm passes to its creditors with
the firm’s value impaired by proportional bankruptcy costs of αF , so that the firm’s creditors receive
(1 − αF )(1 − τ )F i in default.10 The resulting cash flows are summarized in Table 1. Discounting the
expectation of these cash flows, the firm’s time-0 equity and debt values can be written as

                VF E = e−T rf E    F i − τ max 0, F i − RF + VF D − RF I F i ≥ CF and
                                                                                

                       = e−T rf E RF I F i ≥ CF + (1 − τ )(1 − αF )F i I F i < CF .
                                                                             

      The Merton model, which is the foundation of the contingent claims framework, underlies modeling of corporate
financial decisions and pricing of default-risky assets (e.g., Leland (1994)).
   10
      A defaulting firm does not pay interest and so cannot deduct it; therefore, the firm’s creditors get a cash flow of
(1 − αF )F i less tax costs of τ (1 − αF )F i .


                                                           9
The firm’s initial value, VF , is the sum of the values of the debt and equity claims:
                                                                                         

A firm subject to these financing frictions chooses a promised repayment, RF , that maximizes the firm’s
time-0 value. Because the non-financial and financial sectors of the economy face the same frictions,
Expression (18) of the firm’s value and Expression (11) of the bank’s value are very similar.11


2.3    Joint Capital Structure Decision of Firms and Banks

This section links the model of bank financing in Section 2.1 with the model of firm financing in
Section 2.2 in order to develop a model of the joint capital structure decisions of banks and firms. By
endogenizing the capital structure of both banks and firms simultaneously, we can derive a plethora
of interesting results. For simplicity, we assume that firms can raise financing only by issuing equity
and borrowing from banks. While a reasonable assumption for small and medium-sized firms, this is
less realistic for large firms that can choose between debt markets and banks. In Section 8, we extend
the model to include firms’ access to debt markets.

Consider a bank as described in Section 2.1 that lends to a large number of firms, where each firm is
as described in Section 2.2 and firms pursue identical financing policy.12 Each firm i uses its future
cash flow F i as collateral to borrow VF D from the bank with an agreed repayment of RF at time
T , with these variables replacing Ai , VAD , and RA , respectively, in the bank’s loan equation. The
bank’s recovery on a defaulted loan, formerly (1 − αA )Ai , is replaced by the firm’s creditor’s recovery
in bankruptcy, (1 − αF )(1 − τ )F i . Therefore, the bank’s loan payoff expression (2) becomes

                           B i = RF I F i ≥ CF + (1 − αF )(1 − τ )F i I F i < CF ,
                                                                             
                                                                                                                    (19)

with the other bank value equations being similarly adjusted.

The bank funds its lending by issuing equity with value VBE and debt with promised repayment RB
and value VBD . The banking system is perfectly competitive and thus the bank makes zero profit in
expectation. This arises naturally with costless entry and exit of banks. With a competitive banking
sector, the proceeds of the firm’s debt issuance, VF D , are exactly equal to the value the firm’s loan
adds to the bank. As the borrower firms are ex-ante identical and we have scaled the bank’s value
  11
     The slight structural difference between Expressions (11) and (18) arises because banks deduct their loan costs from
their taxable income while firms lack a similar deduction. Enriching our model by allowing firms to deduct investment
costs from their taxes does not change the model’s results.
  12
     It is possible that in our model it would be optimal for firms to coordinate and choose heterogeneous financing in
equilibrium. We allow only for a symmetric equilibrium.



                                                           10
by their number, this means that VF D = VB = VBE + VBD . Under this assumption, banks and firms
set their capital structures to maximize their joint value, VF = VF E + VB . Effectively, banks that do
not maximize firm value are competed out of business as other banks are able to offer firms better
financing terms. Competitiveness of the banking system implies that any bank surplus gets passed
down to firms in the form of lower interest rates. In Section 7, we extend the model to the general
distribution of surplus between firms and banks.

The total firm value at date 0 is thus the sum of the value of the firm’s equity (16) and the value the
firm’s loan contributes to the bank (11):

The financing frictions driving the policies of both banks and firms are present in this combined value.
Under our model, the capital structure parameters, RF and RB , are chosen to maximize the total firm
value VF .



3     Driving Economic Forces

The confluence of several economic mechanisms drives the capital structure decisions of banks and
firms, as well as the fragility of the resulting system. We divide these mechanisms into two classes.
First, there are two risk attenuation mechanisms, namely diversification and seniority. A diversification
effect, due to the bank’s risk pooling, and a seniority effect, due to the bank’s status as a senior creditor,
reduce bank asset risk and allow the bank to have high leverage without high default risk. Second, two
supply chain mechanisms push banks to taking high leverage through the bank’s strategic interaction
with its borrowers.


3.1   Diversification and Seniority

Diversification and seniority make the bank’s asset volatility as much as twenty times less than its
borrowers’. Even in conservative scenarios, these effects reduce the bank’s asset volatility by an order
of magnitude. Figure 1 shows how diversity and seniority can lead to such a dramatic reduction in
risk. The diversification effect alone significantly reduces the spread of returns, while diversification
and seniority together dramatically reduce portfolio volatility. This suggests that both seniority and
diversification reduce volatility, with a synergy between the two effects, but the impact of seniority

is more profound. As further shown in Table 2, the diversification effect alone halves volatility, while
seniority alone decreases volatility by a factor of five. What can explain such surprising magnitudes?
Given the importance of this risk reduction, we devote the rest of this section to explaining the
economics of these effects.

The diversification effect arises because banks lend to a large number of firms and so experience
aggregate returns that are less volatile than the returns on any single loan. As shown in Table 2,
the strength of this effect is governed by the correlation between the loans in a bank’s portfolio; in
other words, the systematic exposure of the firms to which the bank lends. Less correlated borrowers
reduce the bank’s loan portfolio volatility, which means the bank can pursue high leverage without
a correspondingly high default risk. In the extreme case where the bank’s borrowers experience
independent shocks, the bank would have an effectively riskless portfolio and could be fully levered
with no risk of default. A firm that borrows from such a bank would capture all the tax benefits of
debt as its bank would pass along those tax benefits with perfect efficiency.

The seniority effect arises from the priority of bank loans in a firm’s capital structure. Banks are
generally senior creditors and as such are paid first in bankruptcy, before a firm’s equity holders and
other creditors, such as public debt holders. This seniority effect is a critical phenomenon, because it
means a bank will not suffer losses unless its borrowers perform very poorly.13 Correspondingly, for a
bank to experience financial distress, a non-trivial fraction of its borrowers must lose a large fraction of
 13
   For example, Acharya, Bharath, and Srinivasan (2007) and Ou, Chlu, and Metz (2011) show that banks recover
more than other creditors when their borrowers default.



                                                                 12

their value. In our base model, a bank is the only holder of the debt issued by a firm. In reality, large
firms finance themselves in the bond market and small firms finance themselves using trade credit.
Bank borrowing is typically senior to these types of obligations, which reduces bank losses even further
in the event of a default. The seniority of a bank in the firm’s capital structure allows the banks to
pursue high leverage without high default risk. Some intuition can be grasped by analyzing Figure
2, which shows how bank leverage responds to exogenous variation in firm leverage, where leverage is
defined as the ratio of debt to total value. As firm leverage decreases, and firm debt becomes senior
to a larger tranche of firm equity, bank leverage increases correspondingly. Section 8 explores this
mechanism in further detail by introducing junior bond debt into a firm’s capital structure.

Assuming firms have leverage of 40% and ignoring firm-level tax and default costs produces a bank
asset volatility of 0.0167, much lower than the volatility of the borrower firms.14 These numbers are
in line with Ronn and Verma (1986) and Hassan, Karels, and Peterson (1994), who find bank asset
volatility ranging from 0.009 to 0.023 using different methodologies and bases.


3.2      Supply Chain Effects

The core of our model is a financing “supply chain” where banks borrow from debt markets and firms
borrow from banks. Both firms and banks get tax benefits from debt. The consequences of this interest
tax shield have been recognized and explored by generations of corporate finance models. However,
banks that receive interest payments from firms must pay corporate tax on that interest. Expanding
Expression (20) highlights how these countervailing tax effects cause a firm’s interest tax shield to

                                    Tax benefit of loan losses             Bank interest tax shield


Effectively, firm interest payments constitute bank profit and thus a firm’s increased interest deduction
is a bank’s increased taxable profit. Because these effects cancel each other, the only real tax savings
come from the bank’s interest tax shield.

The observation that debt benefits originate only at the bank level is much more generic and is driven
by the fundamental asymmetry between final users of financing (“downstream” borrowers) and those
that act as intermediaries passing financing along (“upstream” borrowers). Even if the downstream
borrowers – firms – have extremely low leverage, it is still optimal for the upstream borrowers – banks
– to lever up, generate debt benefits, and pass those benefits downstream. However, if the upstream
borrowers have similarly low leverage, no benefits are generated that can be passed along and, as a
result, the downstream borrowers also do not lever up. For example, the same logic would apply to a
relationship between a firm and its supplier that acts as a trade creditor.

This supply chain mechanism is fundamentally similar to the impact personal tax exerts on corporate
debt tax benefits. In models such as Miller (1977) or DeAngelo and Masulis (1980), firms get tax
benefits from debt but issuing debt causes a firm’s investors to pay higher personal tax. In the supply
chain model, a firm’s debt issuance increases the corporate tax of the bank holding that debt. In
both types of model, downstream borrowers cannot capture the full tax benefits of debt because of
the tax costs debt imposes on upstream debt holders. The supply chain intuition also shows that,
while traditional models of capital structure (as well as contingent-claim models of credit risk) do not
specify the identity of debt buyers, they cannot be banks or similar institutions as these institutions
would impose their own financing frictions.

The strategic link between bank and borrower financing decisions means that these decisions can be
both strategic complements and strategic substitutes. Figure 3 highlights these interactions by showing
how firm leverage responds to exogenous variation in bank leverage.

The strategic complementarity effect arises because lower bank leverage reduces a firm’s ability to
capture the tax benefits of debt. A bank with low leverage pays substantial tax on its interest income
and must charge high interest rates to make up for that tax burden. As shown in Expression (21), a
firm’s interest payment generates a net tax benefit only to the extent that the receiver of that interest
payment can avoid paying tax on it. The only real tax benefits are generated by upstream borrowers,
such as banks, and low bank leverage prevents these upsteam borrowers from generating tax benefits.

                                                   Bank Leverage


This supply chain effect makes bank and firm leverage strategic complements. At the extremum,
consider a firm borrowing from an all-equity bank, as shown on the far left in Figure 3. An all-equity
bank cannot pass on any tax benefits of debt and thus a firm borrowing from such a bank gains no
tax benefit from leverage. The firm’s interest tax deductions are effectively the bank’s taxable income
and thus the net tax benefit is zero. The presence of distress costs means the firm then issues no debt.
For relatively low bank leverage, this strategic complementarity effect dominates, which reduces the
total indebtedness of the economy.

The strategic subsitution effect arises because lower bank leverage reduces the risk of bank failure
and therefore expected bank distress costs. This effect decreases firm borrowing costs and allows a
firm to increase its leverage without jeopardizing the bank’s financial stability. Of course, this effect
is only important if the firm is properly incentivized to increase its leverage (i.e., if bank leverage is
high enough that tax benefits are marginally important). This effect is thus likely to dominate for
relatively high bank leverage. Consider an extremely highly levered bank that will be pushed into
distress by even a small negative shock. This instability translates into higher firm borrowing costs,
which will reduce a firm’s debt issuance. Effectively, a firm builds up a safety cushion to protect its
bank. At the extreme, with a fully levered bank, optimal firm leverage attenuates to zero, as shown
on the far right of Figure 3.



4    Capital Structure and Default Likelihoods of Firms and Banks

Because our framework is a combination of two widely accepted and commonly calibrated models, the
Vasicek (2002) model used by bank regulators and the trade-off model used in the corporate finance


                                                     15
literature, we can readily quantify our results. This section explores the economic magnitudes of bank
and firm leverage ratios and their associated default probabilities.


4.1      Benchmark Parameter Values

Our benchmark parameter values are based on empirically motivated proxies. Because many param-
eters of interest are challenging to estimate with good precision, we conduct extensive comparative
statics exercises.

We set the benchmark value of our firm asset correlation parameter, ρ, to 0.2. This is similar to
the values assumed by regulators. The Basel II (and Basel III) IRB Approach sets its loan-specific
correlation parameter, ρ̂, to between 0.12 and 0.24 based on the following formula:

                                      1 − e−50P D            1 − e−50P D
                                                                        
                            ρ̂ = 0.12             + 0.24 1 −               ,                 (22)
                                        1 − e−50               1 − e−50

where P D is the loan default probability (see paragraph 272 of Basel Committee on Banking Super-
vision (2004) for more details).15 Our value of 0.2 is also similar to the values estimated by Lopez
(2004), who uses KMV software to derive values ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 based on firm size. However,
the finance literature lacks a consensus on the appropriate value for this parameter. For example,
Dietsch and Petey (2004) find asset correlations in the range of 0.01–0.03 for small and medium-sized
enterprises in Europe.

We set annual firm asset volatility, σ, to 0.4, a value broadly consistent with empirical estimates.
Annualizing the figures from Choi and Richardson (2008) gives volatilities in the 0.25–0.65 range,
varying with firm leverage. Schaefer and Strebulaev (2008) find asset volatility to be on the order
of 0.2–0.28 for large bond issuers. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2002) prescribes a
time to maturity of 2.5 years (see paragraph 279) and we use this value in our estimates. While public
corporate debt typically has a maturity of 7–15 years at origination, bank debt is of substantially
shorter duration. For example, the loans studied by Roberts and Sufi (2009) have a time to maturity
that averages four years, but are renegotiated, on average, after 538 days. Time to maturity is
                                                            √
important primarily due to its impact on total volatility, σ T .

Several estimates suggest that the effective tax rate U.S. companies pay is less than the statutory
federal corporate tax rate of 0.35, so we use a value of 0.25. For example, Graham and Tucker (2006)
show that the average S&P 500 firm paid less than 18 cents of tax per dollar of profit in each year
between 2002 and 2004 (see also Graham (1996, 2000)). We set firm and bank distress costs, αF
and αB respectively, at 0.1. For firms, this assumption is likely conservative. Some recent estimates,
such as Davydenko, Strebulaev, and Zhao (2012), find that, conditional on experiencing distress, large
 15
      The regulatory correlation is subject to a further downward adjustment of up to 0.04 for loans to small firms.


                                                            16
firms incur sizable total distress costs of 20%–30% of asset value at the time of distress onset. In a
theoretical work, Glover (2012) suggests that distress costs can be even higher. There is little empirical
evidence on bank bankruptcy costs. James (1991) finds direct bank bankruptcy costs equal to 10% of
assets. Because distress costs are an important driver in our model, we conduct extensive robustness
tests with respect to these two parameters. Finally, we set the risk-free rate, rf , to 0.05.


4.2    Benchmark Estimates

Table 3 shows the capital structure and default risk implications of our model for a variety of parameter
values. The first two columns consider a firm borrowing from a bank and show firm market leverage,
VF D /(VF E + VF D ), and the associated annual firm default probability. The next two columns show
the capital structure and default rate of the bank, where the bank’s market leverage is given by
VBD /(VBE + VBD ).16 For comparison, the final two columns show the capital structure and default
probability of a firm that issues bonds in the public market and does not borrow from the bank. Three
results immediately stand out.

First, bank leverage is indeed very high. Our benchmark case yields banks with 88% leverage, a value
that would be extremely high for a nonfinancial firm (indeed, a nonfinancial firm with such a leverage
would be almost automatically regarded as a firm in distress) but in line with the empirical evidence
on the capital structure of financial firms. For example, FDIC data shows that aggregate bank book
leverage has been 87%–95% for the past 80 years.17 Furthermore, all of the parameter variations
in Table 3 produce high bank leverage. As all of the trade-off benefits in the system originates
upstream, in the banking sector, bank leverage is pushed upward. The seniority and diversification
effects dramatically reduce bank risk and allow banks to afford this high leverage. For example, banks
in our base case have an annual default rate of only 0.53%.

Second, firm leverage is substantially lower than bank leverage, as has been widely empirically doc-
umented. The average quasi-market leverage ratio for U.S. public firms between 1962 and 2009 is
25%–30%, with more than 20% of firms having less than 5% leverage (e.g., Strebulaev and Yang
(2013)). A tendency of nonfinancial firms to exhibit low leverage and a failure of many standard
models to explain such low leverage is known as the low-leverage puzzle and has generated a lot of
research (e.g., Leland (1994, 1998); Goldstein, Ju, and Leland (2001); Morellec (2004); Ju, Parrino,
Poteshman, and Weisbach (2005); Strebulaev (2007)). For the benchmark parameter estimates, our

banks are profitable, our results for book and market values are similar.

model produces a firm leverage of 37%, substantially smaller than in many trade-off models.18 What
can explain a more than 50% difference between bank and firm leverage? Obviously, firms do not enjoy
the same diversification and seniority protection that banks do. The low leverage of firms arises from
two further reasons. First, a firm borrowing through a bank bears that bank’s default costs, and so
borrows less to effectively protect the bank (the strategic substitution effect). Second, the borrowing
firm captures only some of the tax benefits of debt as the rest are lost through the bank’s tax costs –
the financing supply chain is not completely efficient.

Third, firms that borrow through banks have lower leverage (37%) than firms with direct access to the
capital markets (55%).19 This is again in line with empirical evidence, such as Faulkender and Wang
(2006) who show that among firms with positive debt, those with bond market access have higher
leverage (28.5%) than those without (20.5%). A firm borrowing through a bank bears some of that
bank’s capital structure costs and so borrows less.

Importantly, bank default probability is highly sensitive to changes in borrower leverage, as illustrated
by Figure 4. Holding bank leverage at the benchmark optimum of 88%, we see that increasing firm
leverage can dramatically increase bank default probabilities. For example, increasing firm leverage
from 37% to 50% causes the bank’s one-year default probability to increase sixfold, from 0.53% to
3.18%. Increasing firm leverage to 75% causes the bank’s default probability to increase to 13.5%.
Both high firm leverage and high bank leverage are associated with more frequent bank defaults. As a
potential illustration, the run up to the recent financial crisis was associated with a dramatic increase
in the leverage of households. Banks that failed to appropriately model such an increase in leverage
would be extremely exposed to systemic shocks due to their unexpectedly inadequate seniority.


4.3    Impact of Systematic Risk

Varying the extent to which risk is systematic has a nonmonotonic effect on bank and firm leverage,
as illustrated by Figure 5. Low systematic risk leads to highly levered banks and firms because better
diversified exposures reduce systemic risk costs. In the extreme example of ρ = 0, the Diamond (1984)
case, banks are optimally fully levered as their risk is completely diversified. Adding systematic risk
causes a gradual decrease in both firm and bank leverage. There are two related effects. First, banks
reduce their leverage to protect against default as increasing correlation raises their portfolio volatility.
Lower bank leverage makes banks less effective at passing along the tax benefits of debt, which raises
  18
     Factors other than trade-off considerations likely influence firms with very low leverage. Strebulaev and Yang (2013)
report that the average leverage of public firms in the U.S. with the leverage above the 5% leverage ratio threshold is
37%.
  19
     Static trade-off models of capital structure typically result in much higher leverage. In these models, debt is issued
as a perpetuity, while in our case tax benefits effectively accumulate over a relatively short period of time. Thus, our
modeling of debt maturity is closer to dynamic capital structure models that produce much lower leverage.

borrowing costs for firms and reduces firm leverage in due turn. This once again demonstrates the
close interrelatedness between decisions of banks and firms in the economy. Second, because firms
internalize the costs of systemic failure they impose on banks, an increase in systematic risk causes
the firm to borrow less. More correlated firms implies banks need to hold more equity and charge
higher interest rates, which reduces firm borrowing.

As the level of systematic risk increases further, a marginal dollar of bank equity capital becomes less
and less effective at guarding against default. If risk is systematic, it is more efficient for firms to
increase their equity buffers than for the bank to increase its equity buffer by the same amount. One
way to visualize this is to imagine a system of dikes guarding against flood, with firm equity serving
as the first set of dikes and the bank’s equity as a second set of dikes, further inland.20 If the first dike
is likely to fail catastrophically with multiple breaches, the second dike is unlikely to be of much help
– the best way to protect against such flooding is to make the first dike stronger and higher. Such
a scenario is akin to an economy where firms have large systematic exposure. It is better to increase
firm equity and raise the first dike than to increase bank equity and raise the second dike. If instead,
breaches in the first dike are expected to be isolated and quickly repaired, a second dike could provide
valuable protection. This case corresponds to more moderate levels of ρ. We find that this comparison
between the flood-preventing dike system and bank-failure-preventing leverage system works rather
well in explaining the intuition behind our framework. For most of the values of systematic risk, the
“dike” system works well and banks rarely default.

For large values of systematic risk, trouble hits many firms in the economy at the same time. The
bank’s loans move together and the bank gets minimal diversification benefit. As such, the optimal
way to prevent bank failure is to lower the fragility of the downstream elements – the firms. For
levels of ρ near 1, firm performance is almost perfectly correlated and the bank’s portfolio is thus
extremely volatile. Low firm leverage becomes less effective at preventing bank defaults because bank
asset volatility is so high. The same effect eventually reduces the marginal benefit firms get from an
extra dollar of equity. As can be seen in Figure 5, this effect eventually causes firms to lower their
equity buffer as it is no longer effective.

In interpreting the parameter ρ, one needs to keep in mind that it can vary both with the nature of the
bank and with macroeconomic conditions. For a national bank, ρ would be the exposure of a bank’s
portfolio firms to systematic shocks. For a regional bank, ρ would also incorporate regional shocks
and so might be higher. We would expect such banks to pursue lower leverage or lend to safer firms
to compensate for their increased portfolio volatility. To the extent that asset comovement increases
during recessions, poor macroeconomic conditions would be associated with higher ρ.

    For example, the historic Dutch dike system included redundancy to improve safety. Large waker (watcher) dikes
took the first impact of the waves; if they crumbled, slaper (sleeper) dikes provided a second line of defense; in the
worse case scenario, dromer (dreamer) dikes provided protection for individual farms or even fields. Refer to Neave and
Grosvenor (1954) for more detail.

4.4     Impact of Asset Volatility

Figure 6 shows the impact of varying asset volatility σ on bank and firm leverage and default like-
lihood.21 Bank leverage decreases with higher volatility. This behavior is well documented in the
capital structure literature both theoretically and empirically (e.g., Leland (1994); Adrian and Shin
(2010)). As loan portfolios become more volatile, banks decrease their leverage to better protect
against default. Firm leverage follows a similar pattern.

Figure 7 shows the impact of varying asset volatility on leverage for three different values of systematic
risk, ρ=0, 0.2, and 0.4. As in Figure 6, we see that firms with more systematic risk borrow less. Also
visible is the non-convex path of firm leverage as σ varies. This pattern is most visible for ρ = 0,
because the effect of bank leverage is removed, but exist for every ρ as the result of three competing
factors. First, as volatility increases, the equity buffer needed to prevent default for a given systematic
shock increases. This causes a decrease in leverage for both banks and firms. Second, high volatility
increases the cost of avoiding default for any given shock. Firms and banks respond by protecting
against fewer shocks. This pushes leverage and default probabilities upward. This effect is stronger
for firms than banks because firm assets are much more volatile than a bank’s diversified portfolio.
Third, increasing volatility increases the value of equity relative to debt due to the call option nature
of equity. The patterns in firm leverage are a result of the juxtaposition of these effects: The first effect
is strongest for low volatility, the second for intermediate volatility, and the third for high volatility.

    Note that while we vary σ, we are interested in the impact of total volatility, σ T . The primary impact of varying
T is through its impact on total volatility; therefore, a chart that shows leverage and default probabilities as T varied
would be qualitatively similar to Figure 6.

Both Figures 6 and 7 suggest that asset volatility affects bank and firm leverage through several
pathways, including the value of tax benefits and the relative optionality of debt and equity market
values. Importantly, for all the values of asset volatility, bank leverage remains substantially above
firm leverage.

The right plot of Figure 6 shows the impact of asset volatility on equilibrium default probabilities. As
expected, increasing firm asset volatility dramatically increases the firm’s default rate. It also increases
the bank’s default rate, but not to the same degree, both due to the previously discussed seniority
and diversification mechanisms and due to the bank endogenously decreasing its leverage.

Although outside the current model, we can also comment on the effects of unexpected increases in
systematic risk and volatility. After banks and firms optimally choose their leverage, and assuming
there are frictions that prevent leverage adjustments, increases in systematic risk or volatility can
dramatically increase bank default risk. For example, increasing asset volatility by 50% from σ = 0.4
to σ = 0.6 raises the probability of bank default by an order of magnitude, from 0.53% to 15.30%.
Increasing the correlation between firms to ρ = 0.4 causes bank defaults to triple to 1.82%. Recessions
and economic downturns are often marked by unexpected increases in volatility and correlation, which
would lead to substantial systemic risk. Such parameter changes could dramatically increase bank risk
or push many banks into distress at the same time. This scenario could be modeled in our framework
by introducing parameter uncertainty.

4.5    Impact of Corporate Tax

Higher corporate tax rates increase firm leverage and have a nonmonotonic effect on bank leverage,
as illustrated by Figure 8. When tax rates are very low, neither banks nor firms get significant tax
benefits, which pushes firm leverage to zero. However, as firm leverage tends to zero, bank bankruptcy
costs decrease much faster than firm bankruptcy costs. Thus, when tax benefits are very low (but
strictly above zero), firms have low leverage and banks have high leverage. While banks get little
benefit from this high leverage, firm defaults are so rare that banks face almost no cost for their
indebtedness.

As tax rates rise from zero, firm leverage increases because firms issue more debt to take advantage
of the increased tax benefits. The tax benefit of debt also increases for banks; however, higher firm
leverage means bank portfolios are riskier, which pushes bank leverage down through the substitution
effect. Initially, the substitution effect dominates. As τ tends to one, the tax effect dominates and
bank leverage increases until the bank is fully levered.


4.6    Impact of Bankruptcy Costs

As shown in Figure 9, increasing the distress costs a firm faces decreases firm leverage but, surprisingly,
increases bank leverage. This second effect arises because the substitution effect overwhelms the
impact of firm bankruptcy costs on bank risk. High firm default costs reduce creditor recovery, but

the corresponding decrease in firm leverage means the bank’s portfolio volatility actually decreases.
This decreased portfolio volatility causes the bank to increase its leverage.

Higher bank default costs, on the other hand, reduce both bank and firm leverage, as Figure 10
illustrates. As bank default costs increase, the bank reduces its leverage to increase its equity buffer
and better protect against financial distress. This impairs the bank’s ability to pass the tax benefits
of debt to firms and increases the interest rates firms pay, in turn reducing firm leverage. Note that
even for very high bank bankruptcy costs, the bank still opts for relatively high debt levels due to the
supply chain mechanism and seniority and diversification effects.



5    Moral Hazard and Leverage

Government interventions such as bailouts and deposit insurance subsidize financial distress. We find
that such interventions can have a substantial impact, not only on bank behavior but also on the
capital structure decisions of the non-financial sector. Expectations of government support provide
banks with bad incentives, as well as changing the way banks price risk in a way that pushes firms
toward higher leverage. In Section 6, we extend this analysis to incorporate bank capital regulation.

5.1      Deposit Insurance

Government-backed deposit insurance protects bank depositors from the costs of bank failure. In the
U.S., the FDIC is a deposit insurance program guaranteed by the federal government that all deposit-
taking institutions participate in. Let D be the amount of insured depositors a bank has at date 0.
We assume that insured deposits make up a constant portion of the bank’s liabilities, D = γVBD .22
Because insured depositors are guaranteed to receive their investment back, their debt is risk-free and
at time T they are owed DeT rf by the bank.

The class of insured depositors can be thought of as a separate class of debt. The payout to the
residual debt holders (uninsured depositors and other creditors) is RB − DeT rf if the bank survives
and max 0, (1 − αB )B − DeT rf if the bank defaults. The value of the residual debt holders’ claim
         

at date 0 is

                   (1 − γ)VBD = e−T rf (RB − DeT rf )P [B ≥ RB ]
                                + e−T rf E max 0, (1 − αB )B − DeT rf I [B < RB ] .
                                                                              
                                                                                                                                   (23)
 22
      Assuming D is proportional to the bank’s assets produces similar results.




                                                            25
Adding this to the value of insured deposits, the total value of the bank’s debt is

                       VBD = e−T rf RB P [B ≥ RB ] + e−T rf E [(1 − αB )I [B < RB ]]
                             |                        {z                          }
                                                Debt value without deposit insurance

                                 + e−T rf E max 0, DeT rf − (1 − αB )B .
                                                                     

                                   |                {z                }
                                                Value of deposit insurance



Figure 11 and Table 4 show the impact of varying the amount of insured deposits on the leverage and
default likelihood of banks and firms. Two results can be gleaned from the figure. First, moderate
levels of insured deposits cause only slight changes in capital structure. Deposit insurance is essentially
a deep out of the money put option on the bank’s portfolio value. Section 3 shows that bank portfolio
volatility is low, which means this put option has little value because losses large enough to trigger
deposit insurance are unlikely. As with the deductibles seen in personal insurance markets, forcing the
claimant (the bank) to pay the first dollar of losses (using equity and uninsured debt) dramatically
reduces moral hazard. These same factors cause deposit insurance to have little impact on the financing
strategies of firms.

Second, high levels of insured deposits cause the bank to pursue high risk strategies by leveraging
to the hilt and gambling on excessively risky loans. For our benchmark parameters, it switches to
a risk-seeking strategy that exploits the government guarantee when insured deposits make up more
than 94% of its liabilities. Empirical evidence supports the idea that some banks pursue a risky
strategy while others pursue safer strategies. Lambert, Noth, and Schüwer (2012) find that while a
plausibly exogenous increase in loan risk causes well-capitalized banks to increase their capital buffers
and shift into less risky loans, poorly capitalized banks are less likely to follow this path. Increasing
borrower’s asset volatility and the correlation between borrowers makes banks more willing to gamble.
For example, increasing σ to 0.6 and ρ to 0.3 decreases the critical level of deposit insurance to 80%.

According to the FDIC data for 2013:Q1, the median bank in the U.S. has insured deposits equal to
79% of liabilities, with a 75th percentile bank having insured deposits equal to 85% of liabilities.23 Our
model suggests that this level of insured deposits is unlikely to generate substantial moral hazard for
a representative bank. However, 7% of banks have insured deposits that make up in excess of 95% of
bank liabilities and as such would face substantial moral hazard. These banks are predominantly small,
with the median having assets of only $52 million compared to $168 million for the full sample. Small
regional banks are likely to have more highly correlated loans, which would increase their portfolio
volatility and thus further increase moral hazard.

5.2     Bailouts

Bailouts of financial institutions can take many forms. At their root is a transfer of taxpayer funds
to support the assets or honor liabilities of a weakened financial institution.24 While taxpayers often
receive securities as compensation for this transfer, these securities are generally worth less than the
transfer, at least at the time of the bailout.

We consider two types of bailouts that shaped a number of recent interventions. First, the government
can guarantee a financial institution’s debt. Second, the government can buy a financial institution’s
equity at a below-market valuation. In either case, what is important for the ex-ante capital structure
decisions is ex-ante expectations of such bailouts by private decision-makers.


5.2.1     Debt Guarantees


At the time a bank issues debt, market participants may expect that if the bank finds itself in distress
and unable to fulfill its debt obligations, the government will step in and guarantee the failing bank’s
debt. This response may be contingent upon macroeconomic, macrofinancial, and political concerns.
Abstracting beyond those considerations, suppose that the market’s expectation is that with some
  24
    Some bailouts are accomplished through means other than an explicit transfer, or promise thereof, of taxpayer funds.
Coercion of private companies (e.g., the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle), printing money to buy
bank assets (one type of quantitative easing), or waiver of traditional competition laws (e.g., the Lloyds-HBOS merger)
can also aid failing banks and have a similar effect on bank capital structure as they all subsidize poor performance.




                                                                   27
probability, θ, the government will step in and guarantee a failing bank’s debt; otherwise that bank
will be allowed to fail.

If the government intervenes, the defaulting bank’s creditors recover the full value of their initial
investment, VBD , and are also paid the interest at a risk-free interest rate of rf . Note that the bailout
still results in creditors’ losses relative to the non-default state, because RB < VBD eT rf . The bank’s
date-0 debt value still increases because the possibility of a bailout increases the expected recovery in
default. The value of a bank’s debt when there is a θ probability of a government guarantee is then

    VBD = e−T rf RB P [B ≥ RB ] + e−T rf E θVBD eT rf + (1 − θ)(1 − τ )(1 − αB )BI [B < RB ] .
                                                                                           
                                                                                                      (25)


Guaranteeing debt creates moral hazard for the bank at the time of a capital structure decision,
because all the ex-post benefits of a bailout are internalized by the bank equity holders in the presence
of competitive capital markets. The bank is subsidized in the states of the world where it defaults,
and thus is incentivized to increase its leverage to take advantage of those subsidies. Figure 12
illustrates how bank leverage increases as bailouts become more likely. Firm leverage also increases
as bank bankruptcy costs become less material and the bank is able to pass along the tax benefits
of debt more effectively. If bailouts are seen as very likely (above about a 60% probability for our
benchmark set of parameters), the bank experiences extreme moral hazard. At this point, as the gains
from taxpayer-subsidized gambling overwhelm the gains from legitimate lending, the bank chooses to
pursue extremely high leverage and lend to very risky firms.

Table 4 shows that bank default risk quadruples from the baseline if the probability of a bailout is
50%. If the probability rises to 75%, the likelihood of bank default increases by a factor of seventy
and the bank shifts to a risk-seeking strategy with very frequent defaults.


5.2.2   Equity Injections


Alternatively, market participants may expect a bailout in the form of a purchase of a bank’s equity
at an above-market price. This form of bailout was frequently employed by regulators during the
recent financial crisis. For example, a number of U.S. financial institutions, such as Citigroup and
Bank of America, participated in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, in which the U.S. government
purchased common and preferred equity from distressed institutions. The Royal Bank of Scotland
received massive injections of equity in dire circumstances and is still majority owned, at the time of
writing, by the U.K. government.

We model this form of bailout as follows. Assume that if a bank’s portfolio value is so low that it
would otherwise default, the government purchases a fraction of the bank’s equity at an above-market
price. This equity injection occurs only if the bank is solvent after receiving the cash. Suppose that

when RB > B > RB − ν, the government steps in with probability θ and gives the bank’s equity
holders the tax-free amount of ν in exchange for m portion of the bank’s equity.25

If such a bailout occurs, the bank’s total value is equal to its portfolio value plus the value of the fresh
cash, ν + B. The bank does not default and the bank’s creditors are repaid the full RB they are owed.
The remaining ν + B − RB is split between the taxpayers and the bank’s original equity holders. The
bank’s equity holders are made better off at the expense of the taxpayers as equity holders would have
received nothing if the bank defaulted. Instead, they receive (1 − m)(ν + B − RB ) in default, with the
other m(ν + B − RB ) going to the government. The government pays ν for its equity stake, which is
strictly above its fair market value of (1 − m)(ν + B − RB ).

As the bank’s original equity holders benefit from bailouts, the possibility of bailouts changes the
bank’s time-0 equity value (9) to

                 VBE = e−T rf E [(B − τ max {0, B − VF D − RB + VBD } − RB ) I [B ≥ RB ]]
                              + e−T rf θ(1 − m)E [(ν + B − RB ) I [RB > B > RB − ν]] .                                                      (26)


The bank’s creditors also benefit as they are now fully repaid in some states of the world where
the bank would have defaulted. The bank’s debt value formula is adjusted to reflect the reduced
  25
   To prevent degenerate strategies, we assume the bank will not receive an equity injection if the amount it has
promised its creditors, RB , is greater than the RF it would receive from borrowers in the best state of the world.

This form of bailout also creates moral hazard. Figure 13 and Table 4 illustrate the leverage in the
economy as the size of the equity injection varies from 0 to 0.04. For this illustration, we hold the
probability of a bailout, θ, and the equity stake taken by the government, m, fixed at 0.5. As the size of
the potential equity injection increases, the bank increases its own leverage from 88% to 98%. Equity
injections subsidize risk taking and failure, and so banks take more risk. For any given leverage level,
increasing the size or frequency of equity injections reduces the bank’s default likelihood as the bank
is more likely to get an equity injection that allows it to repay that debt. However, the possibility of
bailouts causes the bank to take so much additional risk that the bank’s default likelihood actually
increases, despite the bank being saved from failure in some states of the world. Changing the other
bailout parameters has a similar effect to changing the size of the bailout: Increasing the probability
of a bailout or decreasing the equity stake taken by the government both increase bank leverage.

To summarize, both the bailouts we have considered generate moral hazard for financial institutions.
Small interventions have only a very small effect on risk taking, but sufficiently high bailout expec-
tations cause the bank to pursue destructive risk-seeking strategies. Government interventions may
be optimal ex-post to avoid bank bankruptcy costs; however, at least without capital regulation, the
ex-ante expectation of bailouts leads to higher bank leverage and so interventions end up increasing
the rate of bank failure.

6        Capital Regulation

Capital regulation that restricts bank financing is a key weapon regulators use to combat excessive risk
taking. Preventing a bank from issuing excessive debt reduces its incentive to risk-shift and insulates
its creditors from loss. Capital regulation policies, as well as their cost and impact, have been at the
center of recent debates by both practitioners and academics. We find that capital regulation reduces
bank leverage but it can increase firm leverage by changing the way banks price risk. The overall
efficiency impact of capital regulation is thus unclear.

While capital regulation takes many forms, the international standards laid out in Basel II and those
proposed in Basel III form widely accepted benchmarks. Basel II, and now Basel III, lays out different
capital requirements for banks of different size. The capital requirements for smaller and less sophis-
ticated banks are set using the Standardized Approach, which uses simple risk weights for different
types of assets. Larger banks are subject to the IRB Approach, where a bank’s equity requirements
are calculated using outputs from the bank’s own models.26 In the following sections, we apply these
two regulatory approaches to our model and examine how effectively these regulations combat the
incentive problems introduced by bailouts and deposit insurance. These regulatory structures are
complicated and thus we focus on equity standards and use simplified models; however, our results
are very general.


6.1      Basel Capital Regulation: Standardized Approach

Under the Standardized Approach of Basel II and III, banks need to hold equity capital equal to a
constant fraction of their risk-weighted assets. This section discusses the impact of such exogenous
limits on bank leverage. We model this type of limit by forcing the bank to have equity capital above
some h portion of its asset value, so that

                                                   VBE ≥ hVB .                                                   (28)

We set h to 8%, so that a bank needs to hold eight cents of equity capital for every dollar of assets,
in line with the Standardized Approach in Basel II and III.

There are three important remarks. First, capital regulation is usually defined in terms of the book
value of assets and the book value of equity. Under our model, the time-0 book values and market
values are equal for both equity and assets as the bank is zero profit, as mentioned in footnote 16.
Second, different assets have different risk weights with unrated corporate debt having a risk weight
    26
    The U.S. implementation of Basel III requires that the largest banks use the IRB Approach in addition to the Stan-
dardized Approach. See the report by the Office of the Comptroller (2013) for more details on the U.S. implementation
of Basel III.



                                                         31
of 100% and rated corporate debt having risk weight varying from 20 - 150% varying with rating. For
simplicity, we apply a 100% risk weight to all loans. To the extent that unrated bank loans comprise a
large fraction of bank assets, this serves as a useful approximation. Finally, we use an equity ratio of
0.08 as our base case. While this is the key equity ratio used by the Standardized Approach in Basel II,
the actual Basel II and Basel III frameworks are much more complicated. Banks face multiple capital
requirements, ranging from Basel II’s 4% tier one capital requirement to Basel III’s 13% maximum
mandate with full capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers.

Figure 14 illustrates the impact of imposing bank leverage limits. As in Section 3, bank and firm
leverage act as strategic substitutes for moderate capital regulation (relatively low values of h). Lim-
iting a bank’s leverage causes that bank to borrow less, but paradoxically causes its borrowers to
borrow more. This effect arises because a firm that borrows from a leverage-constrained bank pays
lower incremental costs for systematic risk and so faces incentives to become riskier. Our analysis
suggests that this effect dominates over the levels of capital regulation seen in practice. The shaded
region of Figure 14 corresponds to current Basel II and III capital ratio requirements. We can see that
such capital regulations may not bind, and if they bind they can increase firm leverage and default
risk. Capital regulation causes the real sector of the economy to borrow more and become riskier, as
witnessed by the higher default probability for firms. Note that capital regulation always increases
firm borrowing costs because a constrained bank is less efficient at passing down debt benefits.

Lax capital regulation makes firms less stable, which in its turn has an impact on the bank. The
plausible analogue of this that we can observe in practice is that a bank subject to capital regulation
may decide to circumvent the regulation by making riskier loans as a back door way to increase its
leverage. These capital restrictions distort bank lending preferences, which may cause a non-trivial
spillover into the real economy.

Our leverage limit of h = 8% does not bind for a bank not subject to moral hazard, but it can reduce
the risk taking associated with deposit insurance and bailouts, as shown in Columns 3 and 4 of Table
5. Setting h to at least 8% mitigates the risk-seeking strategies of the flavor discussed in Sections 5.1
and 5.2. Forcing the bank to maintain an equity buffer reduces its ability to exploit the advantages
proffered by government bailouts. However, Table 5 shows that the bank still experiences extreme
moral hazard if more than 95% of its liabilities come from insured deposits, a situation we earlier
argued was reasonable. Further, this form of capital regulation incentivizes banks to make riskier
loans, especially in the presence of bailouts.

Summing up, simple leverage limits may be ineffective, insofar as they encourage banks to make risky
loans and change the structure of borrowing in the real economy. In Section 6.4, we explore another
path a bank may take to increase leverage – hiking up the correlation risk of its loan portfolio.

6.2    Basel Capital Regulation: Internal Ratings-Based Approach

Simple leverage limits may push banks toward risky lending. One countermeasure is to risk-weight
better assets. Basel II and III include this type of capital regulation as an option for banks. The
risk-weighting formulas the regulatory framework employs is based on the Vasicek (2002) structure
that underlies our analysis. Each bank is required to maintain equity capital in excess of a formula-
imposed floor. This floor, K × VF D , is the value of the bank’s assets multiplied by an exposure-based
risk-weighting K, which is calculated as
        "            r                     s                    !               #
                          1                     ρ̂                                 1 + (T − 2.5)b
   K = LGD × Φ                Φ−1 (P D) +            Φ−1 (0.999) − LGD × P D                      , (29)
                       1 − ρ̂                 1 − ρ̂                                  1 − 1.5b

where P D is the default probability, LGD is loss given default, ρ̂ is the imputed correlation given by
Equation (22), and b, the maturity adjustment, is calculated as

                                                b = (0.11852 − 0.05478 ∗ ln(P D))2 .                                                   (30)




                                                                33
The formulas in Equations (29) and (30) are copied from paragraph 102 in the current Basel III
proposal from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2013).27 We calculate proxies for P D
and LGD from our model.28

As with the Standardized Approach, this form of capital regulation is not binding for our base case
parameters – a bank that pays its own default costs chooses a capital structure that already satisfies
this form of capital regulation. The real effect of this type of capital regulation is in preventing the
moral hazard induced by government interventions, as the last two columns of Table 5 show. With
IRB-style regulation, government interventions lead to at most a small increase in bank default rates.
Without capital regulation, the bank increases its leverage in order to benefit from the effective put
option the government provides with deposit insurance or bailouts, sometimes dramatically so. Note
that, as detailed in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, highly levered gambling strategies are only profitable in the
presence of very large government interventions.


6.3    Efficiency Cost of Capital Regulation

Capital regulation can substantially reduce moral hazard; however, any interference with bank financial
structure reduces the efficiency of the banking sector and increases the interest rates charged to
borrowing firms. This section looks at the trade-off between removing inefficient moral hazard and
the cost of capital regulation.

We find that capital regulation slightly increases the interest rates paid by borrower firms: Increasing
equity capital requirements by one percentage point increases firm interest rates by at most 1.5 basis
points, as illustrated in Figure 15. This estimate is almost an order of magnitude lower than that of
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2010) which assumes that a bank’s return on equity
is fixed and exogenous.29 This suggests that strengthening capital regulation may not be as costly
as sometimes argued. For example, recent attempts by regulators to tighten capital regulation led
  27
     There are two flavors of the Basel IRB Approach - Foundation and Advanced. Under the Foundation IRB Approach,
parameters such as loss given default and maturity are given by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The use
of these prescribed values (a maturity of 2.5 and, for unsecured exposures, a loss given default of 45%) may be optional
or mandatory depending on the national regulator. Refer to Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2002) for more
details. In the interest of space, we apply the Advanced Approach for our analysis; the Foundation Approach yields
similar values.
  28
     For simplicity, we calculate the loss given default and the probability of default using the pricing measure rather
than the real world measure. Real world values, as are used in regulation, would loosen the capital requirements and
reduce bank equity requirements; however, this effect is small for our parameters and reasonable equity risk premia.
  29
     Such an approach ignores the fundamental effects of bank leverage on the cost of equity as implied by Modigliani and
Miller (1958). Admati, DeMarzo, Hellwig, and Pfleiderer (2013a) and Admati and Hellwig (2013) provide an extensive
discussion of this error in the context of bank regulation.




                                                           34
them to be described as the “capital Taliban,” with the implication that such changes would starve
businesses of loans.30 Our model does not support this conclusion, at least in the long run.

Table 6 gives a more detailed breakdown of the costs of financial frictions with and without capital
regulation. In addition to a no-regulation case (column 1), we consider two regulatory setups: a simple
leverage limit as in the Basel Standardized Approach (columns 2 and 3) and a Vasicek model based
limit, as in the Basel IRB Approach (columns 4 and 5). For each of these approaches, we consider
the current regulation (h = 8%) and a hypothetical regulation with a doubled equity requirement
(h = 16%).

In Panel A of Table 6, we examine the effect of regulation on a bank without bailouts or deposit
insurance. Three patterns are apparent. First, the cost of bank bankruptcies is substantially smaller
than the cost of firm bankruptcies, because firms fail much more frequently than banks and corre-
spondingly firm failures destroy more value. Second, capital regulation may actually increase the
total value destroyed in bankruptcy. Simple leverage limits on banks, as in the Basel Standardized
Approach, cause firms to increase their leverage through the substitution effect. For our parameters,
this effect is strong enough to dominate the benefit of safer banks. Note that both this and the first
point take into account only the private costs of bank bankruptcy and ignore the potentially much
larger social costs of bank failure. Finally, the overall cost of capital regulation is relatively small, as
shown in Figure 15. Doubling the strength of current regulation would reduce the return on assets of
firms by at most four basis points.31

We repeat this analysis on a bank subject to bailouts and deposit insurance in Panel B of Table 6.
Specifically, we consider a bank with an insured deposit base equal to 85% of its liabilities, subject to
a debt guarantee with a 25% probability, and with a 50% probability of receiving an equity injection
of 1% of total assets in exchange for 50% of the ex post bank’s equity value, as described in Sections
5.1, 5.2.1, and 5.2.2, respectively. Adding moral hazard means that all forms of capital regulation
now bind; however, capital regulation is not especially valuable as the bank’s moral hazard is not
especially strong. The total value of debt guarantees, equity injections, and deposit insurance we
describe is relatively small compared to the tax benefits of debt.

Note that this analysis only considers the private costs of bank failure. The social costs of a failed bank
may be much greater and including these costs would increase the value of capital regulation. The
bank’s decision does not take into account such externalities. Regardless, the value of the tax benefits

story.
  31
     The difference between the 4 basis point figure here and the 1.5 basis point per percentage figure arises from two
sources. First, the impact on return on investment is lower than the impact on credit spreads because the denominator
of the former is assets and the denominator of the latter is debt. Second, the marginal cost of capital regulation is
increasing as additional bank equity capital increases tax costs at a constant rate and decreases bank default costs at a
decreasing rate.

to debt for a typical bank is larger than the value of deposit insurance or bailouts. If regulators want
banks to reduce leverage and risk, eliminating the distortions created by the tax benefit of debt may
be more important than reforming deposit insurance or the too-big-to-fail dimension of banks.


6.4     Systematic Risk as a Choice Variable

The Basel IRB Approach is effective at preventing bank failure in our model partially because the
bank’s portfolio value is modeled using the assumptions that underlie the IRB framework. In the real
world, substantial model risk exists. A bank faced with binding capital regulation may try to find
back doors to increase its risk.32 Under our base model, a bank that is subject to leverage limits
accomplishes this by lending to riskier firms. In this section, we examine the impact of allowing the
bank to directly increase the risk of its underlying portfolio by manipulating systematic exposure.

So far, the level of systematic risk, ρ, has been kept exogenous. In reality, a bank can choose not only
the riskiness of its individual loans but also its exposure to systematic risk. This might be achieved
by increasing exposure to borrowers with high systematic risk or simply similar risk. The Basel IRB
Approach uses a correlation based on default probability rather than true correlation, as in Equation
  32
     Acharya and Richardson (2009) suggest the pursuit of such back doors was one of the causes of the recent financial
crisis.


                                                                             36
(22), and so would not prevent this type of manipulation. Increasing systematic risk increases the
bank’s asset volatility. Outside of our model, a bank could similarly increase the volatility of its
portfolio through the use of financial derivatives, off balance sheet assets, or other risk exposures.
Increasing the bank’s risk makes the bank more likely to fail and the financial system somewhat more
fragile, but it also increases the attractiveness of the gambling strategy by allowing the bank to more
effectively exploit government subsidies such as deposit insurance and bailouts.

To consider an important example, suppose a bank can choose between two types of portfolio risk. It
can either make perfectly diversified loans with ρ = 0, a safe strategy, or make perfectly correlated
loans with ρ = 1, a gambling strategy. If the bank chooses ρ = 0 it can pursue high leverage with
no risk of default. If the bank instead chooses ρ = 1 it will face high default risk but be better able
to take advantage of deposit insurance or any bailouts. We focus on this rather extreme case, but in
the absence of readily available empirical data, it illustrates the type of behavior and risks that can
arise in our framework. Anecdotal evidence from the recent financial crisis indicates that financial
institutions can easily become overexposed to systematic risk if they wish to do so.

Giving a bank the option to increase systematic risk dramatically increases the moral hazard posed
by bailouts or deposit insurance, which makes capital regulation much more important. Figures 16
and 17 show how capital regulation impacts a bank’s choice between the ρ = 0 safe strategy and the
ρ = 1 gambling strategy. Without capital regulation, banks faced with generous bailouts or deposit
insurance will choose the gambling strategy in order to maximize the expected private benefits of these
interventions.

Tight capital regulation (high h) helps mitigate the additional moral hazard a choice of ρ creates and
makes banks less willing to gamble. Capital regulation increases tax costs and reduces the value of the
bank, regardless of which strategy it pursues. However, it reduces the payoff of the gambling strategy
by much more because high equity requirements increase the “skin in the game” of bank investors by
increasing the amount they lose in default. This makes the gambling strategy relatively less attractive
which makes the bank more likely to choose the safe strategy. A bank financed almost-entirely by
equity would not purse the gambling strategy even if all liabilities were insured. As capital regulation
is eased, banks pursue the gambling strategy more often. In the extreme, when there is no capital
regulation, a bank chooses the gambling strategy if more than 74% of its liabilities are insured deposits
or it has a 24% chance of receiving a debt guarantee in the event of failure.

An equity capital requirement of h = 8%, as in our model of the Basel Standardized Approach, means
that the bank gambles if insured deposits make up more than 71% of liabilities or the chance of a
bank debt guarantee is greater than 30%. Given that the average level of deposit insurance is well
above that and there is arguably a high chance of government bailouts, current capital regulation may
be insufficient, at least to the extent that banks can manipulate their risk. Unreported, when we
implement the same approach using the Vasicek-style IRB capital regulation, we get similar results


                                                   37
with less severe moral hazard. The efficiency cost analysis from the previous section indicates that
doubling current equity requirements would not be especially costly and Figures 16 and 17 show
strengthening capital regulation in this manner would curb a bank’s incentive to gamble.

Beyond the level of capital regulation, Figures 16 and 17 show that moral hazard increases with the
degree of bailouts and deposit insurance. To prevent misbehavior, a bank that faces higher moral
hazard needs tighter capital regulation. In particular, a bank that is funded primarily with insured
deposits would need to be subject to stricter equity requirements, as would a bank that is implicitly
too-big-to-fail. These banks have stronger incentives to misbehave, and capital requirements that
take this into account could increase efficiency. Basel III includes additional capital requirements for
systemically important financial institutions, and we suggest that subjecting banks funded primarily
by deposits to similar regulation may improve efficiency.33

Other parameters also influence a bank’s choice of strategy. For example, Figure 18 shows the impact
of asset volatility on the bank’s strategy choice in the presence of deposit insurance. When volatility is
very high, even small amounts of insured deposits incentivize the bank to pursue a gambling strategy.
As before, adding capital regulation into the mix reduces the relative attractiveness of gambling and
causes the bank to gamble only for higher levels of deposit insurance. However, a bank will still have
an incentive to gamble if it has highly volatile assets. In reality, asset volatility is time varying and
likely higher in recessions, so a bank would be more likely to pursue gambling strategies when the
economy is struggling. This suggests that current forms of capital regulation are likely insufficient to
curb these incentives, especially during recessions.



7        Bank Bargaining Power

Our base model assumes the banking industry is perfectly competitive, while in reality most banks
have pricing power. This section explores how changing the division of surplus between firms and banks
impacts financial decisions. We find that altering the bargaining power and hence the profitability of
banks has only a small impact on our results.

Let π be the excess of a levered firm’s value (21) over a comparable unlevered firm’s value:

                                             π = VF − (1 − τ )e−T rf .                                           (31)


This can be thought of as the total net benefit of debt in the economy. Of course, π is a function,
through VF , of firm and bank debt issuance.

for systemically important financial institutions.

Suppose the bank has bargaining power ω and can therefore capture an ω fraction of the time-0
surplus. A perfectly competitive bank is associated with ω = 0, while a bank that has full bargaining
power that captures all the surplus is associated with ω = 1. Changing the bank’s bargaining power
changes VF D , which affects the total surplus.

The last two rows of Table 4 show that giving a bank more bargaining power marginally increases
its leverage. A bank with higher bargaining power is more profitable and faces a larger tax bills that
pushes it towards more borrowing. Firm leverage also increases, as higher bank bargaining power
increases interest rates which leads to higher interest deductions. The size of the effect is small. In the
base case, bank leverage increases from 88.4% for a perfectly competitive bank to 89.9% for a bank
that captures all the surplus. The effect is small because the economic mechanisms we identified are
largely independent of the recipient of the profits. Moving profits from firms to the bank simply moves
the incidence of taxes up the financing supply chain. Net tax benefit creation is only impacted at the
margin and financial structure therefore changes minimally.



8    Bond Markets

Banks are not the only source of debt financing for firms. Trade credit and public debt also play an
important role. This section explores the implications of a richer firm financing structure, concentrating

                                                                     40
on corporate bond financing. Intuitively, the most important economic mechanism in play is the
seniority of bank financing. Banks are typically senior creditors and take losses only after other
creditors are wiped out, if the absolute priority rule (APR) is followed. Thus, effectively, we assume
the seniority of bank debt and explore how adding junior debt to the model changes bank and firm
financing and default patterns.

In the base model, where all firms borrows only from the bank, RF denotes each firm’s debt obligation
to the bank. With multiple sources of funding, we use RF as the total debt repayment promised by
the firm, and RL as the amount the firm agrees to repay to the bank. The remaining RF − RL of the
firm’s repayment is promised to the firm’s bondholders. If the firm is solvent at loan maturity (i.e.,
if F i ≥ CF ) the bank and the firm’s bondholders are repaid in full. Otherwise, the firm defaults. In
default, the bank’s seniority and the APR mean it is paid first and receives

                                     min RL , (1 − αF )(1 − τ )F i .
                                        
                                                                                                      (32)

The firm’s bondholders get the residual value, if any, that remains after the firm’s bank debt is paid:

                          (1 − αF )(1 − τ )F i − min RL , (1 − αF )(1 − τ )F i .
                                                    
                                                                                                      (33)

The payoff to the bank from a single loan is derived in a similar way as in the base model, with
Equation (2) adjusted by taking into account the bank’s added seniority:

                  B i = RL I F i ≥ CF + min RL , (1 − αF )(1 − τ )F i I F i < CF .
                                                                            
                                                                                                      (34)

The bank’s equity and debt values are then still given by Equations (9) and (10).

The value of the firm’s bond issuance, VM , is the discounted payoff of the residual debt claim:

 VM = e−T rf (RF − RL )P F i ≥ CF + e−T rf E max 0, (1 − αF )(1 − τ )F i − RL I F i < CF . (35)
                                                                                   



The firm’s total debt value VF D is the sum of the proceeds of its bond issuance and the value its loan
contributes to the bank:
                                       VF D = VM + VBE + VBD .                                     (36)

Consider a firm that chooses its debt to equity ratio but maintains a fixed debt structure with a
constant ratio of bonds to bank loans. Figure 19 shows how varying firm debt structure impacts the
financial system. As firms rely more on bond financing, the bank increases its leverage. Despite this,
the bank’s default rate decreases because of the seniority effect. Junior bondholders absorb the first
round of the firm’s losses, which gives the bank an additional buffer, or creates an additional dike,
against losses. This seniority makes the bank’s loan portfolio safer and allows it to increase its leverage
and enjoy a lower chance of default. For the benchmark parameters, if the firm relies equally on bond
and bank financing, banks increase their leverage from 88% to 93%. At the same time, because the

strategic substitution effect is weakened and the strategic complement effect is strengthened, firms
increase their leverage from 37% to 50%.

Unreported, adding public market debt as a junior claimant makes bank assets less volatile and reduces
the impact of bailouts and deposit insurance on bank leverage and lending decisions. Junior debt makes
the bank’s loan portfolio very safe. The Basel IRB Approach takes this into account and does not
bind, the more primitive leverage limit does and forces the already-safe bank to hold excessive equity,
which reduces firm borrowing slightly due to reduced tax benefits.



9    What Is Missing?

Perhaps the greatest advantage of our framework is that it can be readily used by policy-makers,
practitioners, and academics alike to quantify the impact of various regulatory measures on both the
financial and real sectors of the economy. Thus, it is important to mention several extensions to our
framework that would add further realism, but are outside the scope of this paper.

Our model uses constant and commonly known parameters; however, Bhamra, Kuehn, and Strebulaev
(2010) and others have shown that the time variation of parameters can be crucial, especially variation
of those parameters related to macroeconomic risk. For example, if volatility unexpectedly increases,
the incentives of firms and banks alike change and thus the effectiveness of time-invariant capital
regulation deteriorates. Considering such parameter variation would be an important extension. In
addition, most parameters are imperfectly known and learned over time by market participants (in-


                                                          42
cluding firms and banks). The impact of this learning on financial decisions and the systemic fragility
is another issue this model could be extended to explore.

A bank lends only to firms in our model. In many countries, including the U.S., lending against
real estate collateral, both residential and commercial, make up a larger fraction of bank assets. Our
mechanisms are generic enough to apply to mortgages and any other bank assets, but it would be
important to quantify their impact.

We also assumed that all firms are ex-ante homogeneous. Realistically, banks deal with heterogenous
firms and the shape of the distribution of firm leverage may have a non-trivial impact on our results.
Modeling firm investment decisions more directly would add a further layer of richness.

Tax benefits drive the debt decisions of banks and firms in our model. These are inherently private
benefits as they are a transfer from taxpayers to private agents. Thus, eliminating the tax deductability
of interest, or equalizing the tax treatment of debt and equity in some other way, would remove
all the wasteful distortions we consider. However, the economic mechanisms we consider (strategic
substitution and complementarity effects, diversification, and seniority) are more general and should
play a similar role with other incentives to issue debt. Thus, our upstream-downstream supply chain
model can be applied in the presence of other frictions that drive a wedge between bank equity and
bank debt.

Finally, we have considered only the private costs and benefits of defaults, interventions, and taxes.
The externalities imposed by bank failure, particularly systemic bank failure, are more important
considerations when setting policy. A more detailed analysis could extend our framework to multiple
banks in order to examine how bank incentives impact systemic risk.



10     Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a novel framework to model joint debt decisions of banks and borrowers.
Our framework combines the models used by bank regulators with the models used to explain capital
structure in corporate finance. This structure can be used to explore the quantitative impact of
government interventions such as deposit insurance, bailouts, and capital regulation.

We find that bank and borrower financial decisions are intertwined through a number of mechanisms.
Costly bank distress means that high bank leverage pushes firm leverage down and vice versa. At
the same time, a highly levered bank is better able to pass along the tax benefits of debt, raising the
debt of both banks and firms. These two supply chain mechanisms are accentuated by the bank’s
ability to diversify and bank debt being senior to equity and commonly senior to other forms of debt.
High bank leverage and low firm leverage emerge naturally from this strategic interaction. With our


                                                   43
benchmark parameters, firm leverage is 37%, while bank leverage is 88%, not dissimilar to what we
observe empirically.

Our model allows us to quantify the impact of deposit insurance and bailouts on bank risk taking. We
find that small probabilities of bailouts and moderate levels of deposit insurance have only marginal
effects on bank risk taking, but there is a tipping point beyond which expectations of intervention
lead banks to take on dramatically more risk. Many banks have enough insured deposits to face such
extreme moral hazard.

Capital regulation can be effective at reducing moral hazard but is subject to substantial model risk.
By inappropriately capturing borrower risk, some forms of capital regulation can make banks misprice
risk and lead to excessive borrower defaults. Capital regulation that is subject to gaming, as we argue
Basel II and III may be, is ineffective at preventing moral hazard.

Strong, targeted capital regulation increases efficiency. Banks funded primarily with insured deposits
or banks that are defacto too-big-to-fail have strong incentives to take on risk, incentives that could
be curtailed by appropriately targeted capital regulation. We calculate the costs of capital regulation
as modest – increasing bank equity requirement by 1% increases borrower cost by 1.5 basis points –
which suggests capital regulation could be substantially strengthened without undue economic harm.
Current capital requirements may be insufficient. We find that a 16% equity requirement using a
Basel-style IRB formula produces substantial efficiency gains by reducing bank defaults and forcing
banks to better price systemic risk.

Obviously, we have just scratched the surface of these issues. Regulators, academics, and practitioners
continue to have an discussion on bank capital structure, systemic risk, and capital regulation. The
framework we present is rich and flexible enough to address many of the unanswered questions about
these issues.

   at ρ = 0.2, these parameters vary in the other rows. We ignore tax and bankruptcy costs and use
   σ = 0.4, and T = 2.5 for this table. Redundant values are omitted for clarity.

 Table 5: Default Probabilities with Regulation and Government Intervention
Table 5 reports the default probabilities of banks and firms in an economy subject to government
interventions and Basel style capital regulation: either the Standardized Approach as in Section 6.1
or IRB Approach as in Section 6.2. The benchmark set of parameters is rf = 0.05, σ = 0.4, ρ =
0.2, τ = 0.25, αF = αB = 0.1, T = 2.5.

                      Table 6: Efficiency Cost of Capital Regulation
 Table 6 reports the costs and benefits associated with defaults and government policy. Values are
 reported in annual basis points of unlevered firm value. Panels A and B show results for, respectively,
 a bank without bailouts or deposit insurance and a bank with a 25% probability of a debt guarantee,
 insured deposits making up 85% of its liabilities and an equity injection with ν = 0.01, m = 0.5, θ =
 0.5. The first column gives results without regulation. The second and fourth columns provide results
 under the Basel Standardized Approach (h = 8%) and IRB Approach, respectively; the third and
 fifth columns redo that analysis after doubling the equity capital requirements of those regulations
 (h = 16% for the Standardized Approach). All cases are calculated using rf = 0.05, σ = 0.4, ρ =
 0.2, τ = 0.25, αF = αB = 0.1, T = 2.5.
