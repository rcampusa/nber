                    The Persistence of Volatility and
                        Stock Market Fluctuations



                                    ABSTRACT



     This paper examines the potential influence of changing volatility in stock

market prices on the level of stock market prices. It demonstrates that vola-

tility is only weakly serially correlated, implying that shocks to volatility do

not persist. These shocks can therefore have only a sinai]. impact on stock

market prices, since changes in volatility affect expected required rates of

return for relatively short intervals. These findings lead us to be skeptical

of recent claims that the stock market's poor performance during the 1970's can

be explained by volatility—induced increases in risk premia.

       This paper examines the potential influence of changing stock market vola-

tility on the level of stock market prices. It demonstrates that volatility is

only weakly     serially   correlated, implying that shocks to volatility do not per-

sist. These shocks can       therefore   have only a small impact on stock market pri-

ces, since changes in volatility affect expected required rates of return for

only short      intervals. These findings lead us to be   skeptical of recent claims

that   the stock market's poor performance during the 19T0's can be explained by
volatility—induced increases in risk preinia, as suggested by Malkiel (19T9) and
Pindyck   (l981). They also lead us to doubt that fluctuations in risk premia
associated with changing return volatility can account for mach of the observed
variation in stock prices. The finding that volatility is not highly serially
correlated is puzzling in light of Black's (1976) observation that stock market
returns and changes in volatility are negatively correlated.

       The paper is divided into five sections. The first clarifies the theoreti-

cal relationship between return volatility, the level of share prices, and

required rates of return. The second section examines the time series proper-

ties of stock market volatility as measured using both monthly and daily data.

The results suggest that although volatility is serially correlated, changes In

current volatility should have only a negligible impact on volatility forecasts

over Intervals as short as one or two years. The third and fourth sections use

data on   the   implied volatilities in option premia to re—examine the persistence

question, and again find evidence of only weak serial correlation. The conclu—

sion discusses the implications of our results for alternative explanations of

recent stock market movements and for our understanding of the sources of asset

price fluctuations sore generally.

 1.   Volatility1 Required Returns, and Stock Price Fluctuations

        This   section      discusses the relationship between changes in volatility and

changes    in the level of stock market prices. For simplicity we assume                        that
firms are not levered and                that   expected dividends grow        at   a constant rate. The

former    assumption allows us to ignore Black's (1976) important observation that
the level of share prices, by affecting the degree of leverage, should have a
direct impact on volatility. The latter assumption is maintained for con-
venience and        could   be relaxed easily. Because of the nature of the volatility

estimates used in our empirical work, we use a discrete time formulation.

        We assume that share prices satisfy the standard requirement that

where r is the risk—free interest rate,                         is the risk premium, and            is the
dividend paid in period t.                   Equivalently,   equation (i)   can     be written as
                     = (1 +
                                r    +            — Dt +   cP                                           (2)

able at time t. It reflects the impact of revisions in expectations about

future values of D, a, and r which take place between periods t and t+l.

subject to an appropriate transversality condition to yield

assume for simplicity that

where   y is a constant of proportionality that depends on investors' levels of

risk aversion.              Merton (1973,1980) derives a similar relationship between at

and   the variance of returns in                 a continuous—time rrode1.

      To   study the effect of changes in volatility n it is necessary to
adopt   some assumption about the evolution of a. We assume that                              follows

an AR(i) process:

             2                      2
                    =                       +
                            pO+


Evidence to support the AR(i) assumption                        is presented in subsejuerit sections.
 From (8) and (9), it immediately follows that                                      also follows an AR(1) process:



                                 Oplatl+t                                                                          (10)

where        =                    The mean       value      of            is therefore 1p0/(l—p1), and    the

        Equation (ii) enables us to simplify (5) substantially, since E(a+_                                              =

Not ice that the absolute value of the derivative of share prices with respect to

current volatility rises with P1. This result is intuitively natural. If

increases in volatility are        expected    to persist, they viii have a greater impact

on the discount factors applied to future cash flows, and therefore on share

prices.

       In order to examine possible relationships between volatility and the level

of share prices, it is useful to insert some plausible parameter values into

(is). The mean annual return on coinxn stocks for the period 19148_1983 was

ii.6 percent.i The mean nominal return on Treasury bills was 1e.6 percent per

year over the same period, implying an average value of 7.0 percent for a. The

average real    return   on Treasury bills, which we use to estimate       r, was    per.-
cent. The estimated variance of the market return, expressed at annual rates,

ranged from 26.83 in i964 to 638.57 in i971, averaging 238.3. The last sta—

tistic In conjunction with the mean estimate for a implies a value of .029             for
1.    Merton (1980) estimated this parameter to be .032 for the period 1952—1978.

The growth rate of nominal dividends on the S&P 500 during the 19148.-1983 period

was   5.2   percent annually. Combining this with our inflation rate of 4.2 percent

yields an average growth rate for real dividends, g, of .01.

      The effect of changes in volatility            on the level of share prices is very
sensitive to    the level of P1. The derivative In (is) equals —.070 when p10,

.131 when            and —.1L09   when P1=.9. We have      defined P3. as the serial corre—
                                      -6-

lation in annual volatility; an annual value of i .90      implies   a monthly auto—
correlation of more than .99. Stated another way, a 50 percent increase in
market volatility from its average level would reduce the value of the market by
3.5 percent   if p.   0, by 6.5 percent of P = .5, and by 20 percent if Pp.9.
It   is clear that if fluctuations in volatility are to play a significant role in
explaining market fluctuations, then P1 must be quite large. The next two sec.-
tions examine the serial correlation properties of several measures of volati-
lity.

 2. Serial Correlation in Market Volatility

       As    emphasized in Merton (1960), a great deal of            work remains to be done on

variance     estimation. In     thiB 8ection,   we use      crude   estimators for the variance
of market returns to study       the   serial correlation properties of volatility.2 We
use two estimators of market variance, a. and a, computed respectively from
monthly and daily returns data. While daily data are preferable for variance
estimation, they were available        to us only       for the 1968—84 period. Monthly
returns     data were available from 1926    to 1983.

2.1 Volatility Estimation Using Monthly Data.
       Our   first variance estimator, based on monthly data, was calculated as:

      In Table 1, we report sunnary       statistics        on      for two periods, 1926—1983

and 1948—83. It is immediately clear from the autocorrelogram and partial auto—

correlogram that there is no substantial positive serial correlation in market

volatility. For the 1948—1983 period, the first order autocorrelation coef-

ficient is only .114; for the longer 1926—83 period, it is .675.                    The high

autocorrelation coefficient for the whole period is sensitive to the inclusion

of the Depression years In the data sample. The                  first order autocorrelation for
the   sample period 1935—1983 is .50, and         for   the 1940—1983 period, the estimate

declines to .05. Results similar to those for the postwar period were obtained

Source: Annual volatility estimates were calculated as the average of twelve
         squared monthly values of the return on common stocks minus the return
         Treasury bills. These data were drawn from Ibbotson (19814) for the
         period 1926—1983, a total of 696 observations. The second sample, for
         the 19148—1983 period, contains 1432 observations. Standard errors are
         shown in parentheses. See text for further details.

using data for only the 1960—1983 period, when the estimated first order serial
correlation coefficient was .131. The hypothesis that annual volatility was a
white noise process could be rejected at standard levels in the 1948-1983 or
1960—1984     periods.4
       As   a further check on the autocorrelation properties of our volatility
estimates, we estimated some simple autoregressive models for          The results,
which are presented in     Table 2, corroborate the conclusions reached above. They
suggest     no great persistence in volatility, and indicate that the simple first

order autoregressive model used in the preceding section's theoretical develop-

ment fits the data quite vell.5 Higher order models did not yield appreciably

smaller sums of squared residuals for either sample period under consideration.

       The point estimates of Pifor each sample period are substantially less

than unity. They imply that volatility shocks do not persist for long periods.

For the 1926—1983 sample perod, where we find the greatest amount of per-

sistence, ninety percent of a volatility shock will have dissipated tr six years

after the shock. In the AR(2) case for this period, only four years are

required. The half life of the shock, the time required to move half way back

to the long—run equilibrium, is two years for both processes. In the postwar

period, the implied half life is much shorter ——    less than one year.6 These
results confirm Schmalensee and Trippi's (19T8) findings of relatively little

persistence in volatility for individual firms.

       The estimated autocorrelations all suggest little persistence in volati-

lity, and conventional t—tests reject the hypothesis that volatility is a random

walk        = 1). However, recent work on the estimation of time series models

with unit roots, such as Dickey and Fuller (1981), has shown that the actual

size of these tests may be substantially different from their nominal size.

Dicke3r and Fuller (1981) present tables of adjusted critical t—values for

various   sample sizes   to   test the hypothesis of      a unit root.       The last   column in

Table 2 shows that t—statistic against the hypothesis i =                i   along with the

appropriate critical t—value for the 95%         confidence    interval.7 In each case we

are able to reject the null hypothesis of a unit root.

       Our analysis so far has assumed that market volatility can be modelled as a

stationary time series. Some research, however, has suggested that volatility

may trend over time. If so, this would imply that our estimated autocorrela—

tions are biased upwards. The equations in rows 3,4,7, and 8                 of   Table 2 present

simple tests for the existence of trends over various sample periods. They

suggest a positive trend for the time period 1948—1983, and a negative trend for

1926—1983. However, the findings also show that the null hypothesis of no trend

cannot be rejected in the 1948—1983 period cannot be rejected.

       These results contradict Pindyck's (1984) claim that there has been a clear

upward trend in market volatility over the last thirty years. He pre—snooths

monthly volatility estimates by computing twelve-month noving averages before

looking for trends, and this makes his conclusions difficult to evaluate. Even

if there were trends, however, it is important to recognize that only unexpected

deviations from trend should affect asset returns. If the trend rate of volati-

lity growth rises abruptly, that should lead to a one—time adjustment in share

prices, but it cannot account for a low rate of return over an extended period.


2.2   Volatility Estimates Based on Daily        Data -

      Our second volatility estimator was based on daily data; it follows closely

on   Merton's   (1980) estimator.S Using daily returns on the Standard and Poor's

where   s is the daily return adjusted for non—trading days. In daily           data,

measuring the returns around the risk—free rate would have virtually no effect
on the estimated volatilities •        The   twenty—one trading day intervals which we
use correspond roughly to nxnths of calendar time.
     The autocorrelogram and partial autocorrelogram for this volatility esti-
mator are shown in Table 3. In this case, the data clearly exhibit positive
serial correlation. Again, the persistence of volatility is relatively unim-
portant from an economic perspective. The first order autocorrelation coef-
ficient obtained using xnth1y data is .596, which is equivalent to an
autocorrelation coefficient of only (.596)12, or .002, in annual data. This is
not inconsistent with the estimates obtained using the post—var monthly volati-
lity data in the last section, since we could not reject the null hypothesis
that there was no serial correlation in volatility.
     Table 14 shows estimated autoregressive models for the volatility series

calculated from daily data. Once again, the first or second order autore-

gressive process provides an adequate description of the data. The hypothesis

that the coefficients on all        variables   lagged more than two periods equalled

zero could never be rejected. Higher lagged terms have small, as well as sta-

tistically insignificant, coefficients. None of the estimates of P3 or pl ever

exceeded .10 in absolute value. The tests against the null hypothesis of P1=1

again clearly reject the hypothesis that volatility follows a random walk. The

half life for a shock in the A.R(i) model is less than three months.

     Substantive economic conclusions about the importance of volatility shocks

are unaffected by the choices between the different autoregressive nodels. Al].

of our results suggest very little persistence.9 Moreover, the results again

question   the iortance of trends in volatility. None of the estimated time

trend coefficients is statistically significant. In both the .AB(i) and AR(2)

cases, the estimate trend coefficients have t—statistics of less than unity and

the addition of trend variables has little effect on the other coefficients in

these equations.

3. Market Volatilities Implied by Option Premia
     The estimates presented in the last section suggest that volatility shocks
are short—lived. However, the estimated serial correlation parametera might be
biased   downward by measurement error, and they mey also fail to reflect market
participants' beliefs      about volatility persistence. To address these problems,

we   analyzed the persistence in volatilities inferred from option premia.
Unfortunately, options on stock market indices such as the S&P 500 have been
traded   for too short a period to make   analyzing    them informative. However, the

Chicago Board Options Exchange (cBOE)     has    computed an index of the price of a

standardized stock option on every Thursday since January 8, 19T6.l0

              ...the CBOE Call Option Index is an average of percent
              option premiums; for each CBOE underlying stock, a mar-
              ket premium is estimated for a hypothetical six—month,
              at the rxney option using the market premiums        of exist-
               ing option series • This estimated market premium is
               expressed   as a percentage of the stock price. The CBOE
              Call Option Index for a given day is the arithmetic aver-
              age of all such percent premiums on CBOE underlying
              stocks on that day. ECBOE(19T9), p. 1]
These   data are now available for a period of eight and one half        years and it is

possible    to analyze the persistence of volatility expectations using them.
      The CBOE Index does not correspond to the option premium of any traded
security.    It is a measure of this option premium on the "representative share"

for which options are traded on the CBOE. As such, the implied volatility

should be substantially higher than the volatility of the market, since the

market is a weighted average of many imperfectly correlated shares. While our

estimates of   the implied volatility on a      representative   share are not directly

comparable to the volatilities estimated in the last section, our assumption is

that their serial correlation properties should be        reasonably   similar.11
                                             —17—




       To estimate the volatility of       the "representative stock"     implied by the
CBOE index,     we assumed that   the   dividend yield on this   share   equalled that on
the   SlIP 500.12 We followed Black's (i9i6) suggestion for dividend adjustment and

subtracted the present value of dividend payments over the life of the option

from the price of the stock. We assumed that the option on the representative

stock waw priced according to the- B'lack—Scholes (1913) faiimiia,         and applied a
numerical     search algorithm to determine the variance of returns        which was   con-
sistent with    the observed option price, risk free rate, and market dividend
yield.   The CBOE Index is standardized to apply to an option on a stock with a

current price of $140.00, and since the index applies to at the money options,

the strike price is $140.00 as well. The weekly data on the CBOE Index, as well

as our estimates of the implied volatilities, are shown in the Data Appendix.

      The movements our implied volatilities were compared with those of six—

month ex post volatilitles estimated from daily returns on the S&P 500; the two
series cohere reasonably well. FIgure 1 shows the novments In these two series,
each divided by its mean, for the 1976—19814 period. A positive association bet-

ween the series is readily apparent. Both series rise throughout the late

1970s, and decline during the 1982—19814 period. The CBOE implied volatility does

not rise as dramatically as the ex poste volatility series during the 1981 stock

market rally, although it    does   increase.

      Table   5 shows the estimated autocorrelogram and partial autocorrelogram
for the implied volatility series. These are weekly data, and so the estimated
autocorrelations are higher than those in the earlier sections. The first order
autocorrelation,    for example, is .971. However, these results confirm the

Source: Estimates of volatility forecasts were determined by inverting the
        Black—Scholes option valuation formula to obtain the volatility implied
        by CBOE option premia indices. These data were available for the period
        1976:]. to 1984:26, for a total of 14147 weekly observations. See appendix
        for further details and data description. Standard errors are shown in
        parentheses.

earlier conclusions that        volatility   changes are not persistent. One year after

a shock to volatility, expected volatility will exceed its mean by only         (.971)52
-.22, or twenty two percent, of the initialshock. The partial autocorrelogram-

again suggests that a first order autoregressive representation is appropriate

for this series.       The statistical insignificance of partial autocorrelations at

lags of more than one week is indicative of an AR(l) structure in these data.

        Table 6 reports estimates of several time series models for these data.

Equations for our entire data period, comprising 14e1 weeks, are reported in

the first four rows of the table. The hypothesis that the residuals from the

AR(1) model are white noise is nearly rejected at standard levels, as shown by

the reported Q—statistics. The AR(2) results do not suffer from this dif-

ficulty. The higher order (third and fourth order) eutocorrelation parameters

are never statistically significant. The implied responses to a volatility

shock   are similar in all of the estimated models. They suggest that the half
life    for a volatility shock is about six months.l3 Although the estimated weekly

autocorrelation is near unity, the last column of the table shows that the

hypothesis of a unit     root   is still rejected in each case.

        Because each weekly observation on the CBOE Index depends on forecasts of

volatility for each of the next twenty six weeks, two consecutive observations

on the implied volatility will have twenty five weeks of forecast volatilities

in common.    This   uy bias our estimated autocorrelations. We therefore esti-

mated autoregressive models using non—overlapping data periods, corresponding to

every twenty—sixth observation in our data set. The estimated AR(1) and AB(2)

models are reported in the last two rows of the table. The estimated six-month

autocorrelation coefficient from these data is .3, which is only    slightly   lower

than the six—month autocorrelation implied by cxir   weekly estimates. The results
again   suggest thatover-•half of avolatility shock vanishes within six months.

1, The Term Structure of Implied Volatilities

       The CBOE Call Option Index data provide strong support for the transient

character   of    volatility- shocks. However, they do not permit us to directly      -




investigate how long—term expectations of volatility respond to changing short-
term volatility expectations. A second source of option data can illuminate
this issue. Since 1979, Valueline has computed indices of option premia at
three and six month nturities. We inverted these option premia indices using
the same procedure which we applied to the CBOE data.114
       The availability of two different maturity option indices provides an
opportunity   for additional tests of the persistence hypothesis. The implied

volatility for the six month options was assumed to equal the average of the

expected three month volatilities for the next three months as veil as the three

months following them:


                  =
          t,6°t       t,3°t + t,3t+l3'2    •                                     (18)


In this notation, s,k° is the volatility expected to prevail, as of time t, over

the k months beginning in week s. The assumption in (i8) allows us to solve for

an estimate of the implied forward volatility which is expected to prevail for

the   three month period beginning three months from the current week:
                                      "2
          t+13,30t       2t,6°t —                                                  (19)


      We can use the estimated forward volatilities to study the change in the

implied forward volatility which occurs when the current three—month "SpOt"

implied   volatility changes.       The results of this estimation are shown below:
                                        —24—




                                        +              -
      t+13,3°t t+12,3°t-l =
                              (.0769)       (,50)t3t       t-l,3°t-l                 (20)


These results indicate that when current volatility expectations change,

expected volatility in future periods also changes. However, they also consti-

tute further evidence for our contention that volatility shocks are not per-

sistent. One year after a volatility shock, these estimtes imply       that   only
seven percent of a shock 'will still persist. The half life of a volatility

shock according to these data is just over three nrnths. One year after a ten

percent shock to volatility-, the three—month forecast of volatility would only

be 1.3 percent greater than in the initial period.

 5.   Conclusions   and Implications
     Our findings suggest that shocks to stock market volatility are not per-
sistent. This is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the impulse response
 functions corresponding to several of the estimated time series models for vola-
tility. These functions, which show        the    moving average representation of each

process,   depict the evolution of volatility following a "shock" equal to ten

percent of the steady—state value of volatility. While the speed with which the

shock dissipates varies across models, the half         life   of the shock never exceeds

two years. For the equations corresponding to the CBOE and daily            volatility
estimators, the half—life of a volatility shock is less than half a year.

       Our empirical results suggest that changes in volatility should affect

expected required returns for periods not substantially greater than two years.

This means that they can     only have   a very   limited   impact on the level of share

prices. A doubling of volatility would reduce the level of the market by only

about nine percent.].5 Since actual volatility fluctuations are usually smaller

than this, we doubt that changing volatility accounts for any large fraction of

market fluctuations. This observation applies both to the problem of explaining

recent events and to the deeper problem of explaining the sources of stock price

fluctuations

      Our work deepens the puzzle of explaining the strong negative correlation,

observed by Black (1976) and Schinalensee and Trippi (19T8), between stock market

returns and volatility.      Black (1976) showed that the inverse correlation

between volatility and returns was so strong that a positive one percent return

on a stock implied more than a one percent reduction in volatility; this

implies that raising the share price actually reduces the dollar volatility of

the   stock. The finding that volatility is not highly persistent       suggests that

autonomous   changes 'in volatility should have only a relatively small effect on
share prices. It Black's    (19T6)   "leverage   effect" explanation of the rela-
tionship between returns and volatility were correct, then one would expect to
observe that volatility, like prices, would follow a random walk.
       One possible explanation for the observed data is that the same events

which sake the returns to capital more uncertain also reduce their expected

value. This coincidence in the arrival of stochastic shocks would lead to an

apparent relationship between volatility changes and      share   prices, although in

fact no such causal link exists. Another possibility is that when adversity

strikes, firms are expected to respond with new strategies. Between the time

the market anticipates that some new policy will be chosen and the time this

policy is actually announced, uncertainty and therefore volatility may

increase.

    1. These data are based      on Ibbotson (1981e).

   2. To the extent that there is measurement error in our estimates of volati-
lity, the estimated serial correlation coefficients ny be biased downward. In
the next section we use estimates of volatility expectations which are less
susceptible to these difficulties.

   3. Mci-ton (1980) observes that although estimators of the variance which
center the estimated returns around a point which is not their sanle mean will
be biased, these biases are trivial. He estimates variances using uncentered
returns; Pindyck (1984) estimates variances for twelve lx)nth periods by com-
puting second noments centered around the overall mean return in his sample.
   4.   We   used Box—Jenkins (1970) Q—statistlcs to test the null hypothesis of no
serial correlation of up to fifth order. The values of the test statistics were
32.9 for the 1926—1983 period, 14.70 for 1948—1983, and 4.147 for 1960—1983. The
critical value for rejecting the null hypothesis of at the .05 level is 12,59.
   5. The finding that low—order autoregressive processes provide an adequate
description of the variance of market returns suggest that it may be possible to
apply the econometric techniques for time—varying heteroscedasticity, suggested
by Engle(1982), when studying the behavior of security returns.

    6. The same conclusion emerged when we examined changes in volatility. This
is shown by the following equation, estimated for the 1948—1983 period:
       2    2
                = 1083.3                     2
       t—       (3079.1)
                           —  .438 12
                            (.155)
                                          —
                                                2
The coefficient on the lagged volatility change is negative and has a t—value of
2.83, clearly different from zero.
   7. Critical values of the unit root tests             are drawn   from   Dickey and   Fuller
(1981), Tables I and II.

   8. Merton (1980, Appendix A) discusses two adjustments to estimated volati-
lity series. The first, for nontrading days, is implemented in our study. The
second, which corrects for nontrading shares in the stock index, nliltiplies the
estimated volatility by a constant. Since our study is concerned with the auto—
covariance and not the level of the volatility series, and the former is unaf-
fected by multiplication by a constant, we did not make the correction.

   9. The     results of   estimating a nodel in changes were:

             °   —     = l.44x10        —    .315         1—   °2
                           (3.42x106)       (.068)
Again, this suggests negative serial correlation.
  10.   A further description of this series may          be found   in CBOE(1979).

  11. Latan and Rendelman (1976) computed implied standard deviations for a
series of options over a thirty nine week period and discovered that these
implied standard deviations tended to move together. Schmalensee and Trippi
(1978) found similar results. These coincident movements in volatility are the
market—wide volatility shifts we hope to capture.

  12. We assumed that dividends were paid as a continuing flow at rate A   per
year, where A is the current yield on the S&P 500.

  13. We also considered the serial correlation of changes for the non—
overlapping differences:

                Line data were available for the period 1980:16 to 19814:26;
this constitutes a total of 220 weeks. However, there were 17 weeks of missing
data. This precluded calculating the long autocorrelograins which are reported
for the other volatility series. However, the first order autocorrelations for
these series, .88 for the three month implied volatility and .87 for the six
month, were roughly consistent with earlier findings.

  15. This calculation is based on P1 = .21, the estimate from the CBOE
implied volatilities, and the other parameter values described in Section 1.
