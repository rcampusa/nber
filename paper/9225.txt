       Employers routinely provide financial support for their employees who pursue post-

secondary education despite the fact that it represents perhaps the classic example of a “general

skill” that costs the employer money and raises the market wages of employees who possess it. The

analysis below examines why employers provide such support, and the results suggest that

employees do not pay for tuition assistance through below market or training wages, the typical

arrangement for funding general skills training. Instead, tuition assistance appears to select better

quality employees who stay on the job longer, at least in part to keep making use of that benefit.

                              Why Do Employers Pay for College?



Introduction:

       The tuition assistance that employers provide for their employees who pursue post-

secondary education is a ubiquitous and crucial element in the resources that support students. It

is not obvious why employers provide such support, however, because post-secondary education

represents perhaps the classic example of a “general skill” that raises market wages. The analysis

below examines why employers provide support for the education of their employees and may

shed some light on the more basic question as to why employers invest in the general skills of

their employees.



The Nature of Employer Support:

       A range of evidence suggests that employer assistance represents a central part of the

portfolio of resources that pay for post-secondary education. The American Council of

Education estimates, for example, that roughly 20 percent of graduate students are receiving

some financial assistance from their employer to attend school (cited in Babson 1999), and

roughly 6 percent of the much bigger pool of all undergraduates receive such aid as well (Lee

and Clery 1999). As many as one-third of undergraduates in fields like business and engineering

receive financial assistance from their employers. If one looks only at adult students, who are

more likely to be employed when they are in school and therefore have the possibility of

receiving aid from employers, data from the National Center on Educational Statistics’ Adult

Education Survey found that 24 percent of adults in post-secondary education programs of the

kind that offered credentials (e.g., degrees or certificates) were receiving tuition assistance from
                                                                                                          3


an employer, and 53 percent were either receiving tuition support or paid time off from work

(Hudson 2001). The Bureau of the Census estimates that financial assistance from employers is

the most common source of financial aid. The average level of employer-provided assistance per

recipient was equal to about one-third of the average annual cost paid by post-secondary students

(Bureau of the Census, 1994).2

        The extent to which employers provide assistance can be measured more directly from

surveys of employers, and those results suggests that employer-provided support is ubiquitous.

For example, a 1992 survey by Coopers and Lybrand of 209 employers found 86 percent

offering tuition reimbursement plans (BNA 1992a); a 1993 Hewitt Associates survey of 858

employers also found 99 percent using tuition reimbursement and about 6.5 percent of all

employees in those firms taking them up at any point in time (Hewett Associates 1993); another

survey the same year of 335 companies reports that while most companies offered tuition

reimbursement, 93 percent went further and offered other types of financial assistance for

education as well as tuition (IFEBP 1993). A more recent 2002 survey by the Society for Human

Resource Management of 510 employers found a somewhat lower number, 79 percent offering

educational assistance of various kinds (SHRM 2002). These surveys are based on samples of

convenience and of very large employers, however, and therefore may not accurately represent

the true level of participation among all employers. The data used here (see below) will report

levels somewhat below these estimates but still suggest that a substantial majority of employers

offer such plans. Whichever figures one uses, it is clear that most employers do help pay for

their employees to receive post-secondary education.

2
 A calculation of tuition assistance as a proportion of total post-secondary expenses must be somewhat
indirect: Census calculates that half of all students (including, of course, those who are not working)
receive some aid and one-third of students who received aid got some from their employer. Therefore,
                                                                                                        4


        This conclusion is interesting because it is something of a surprise that any employers

should offer such support, let alone that most employers do. Post-secondary education

represents the classic example of the type of investments in employees that we would not expect

employers to make because the skills and knowledge it produces are general skills useful to other

employers. As Becker (1964) first made clear, the benefits of such general skills flow to the

employees who possess them and not to the employers who provided them: Because these

general skills are useful elsewhere, the current employer has to pay the market wage for

employees who have them or risk losing those workers to competitors who will pay that market

wage. The employer who pays for the cost of general skills training would then also have to pay

the employee a higher wage equal to the improvement in marginal product that such training

generated, making it difficult or impossible to recoup that investment. The skills provided

through post-secondary education are arguably the most general as they enhance many basic

skills, such as communications and analytic skills, which are broadly useful. Even occupationally

specialized programs, such as nursing or computer programming, are valuable to a great many

employers. Course work tends to be reasonably standardized, and transcripts certifying

knowledge of at least some level of the material being taught are readily available to potential

employers.

        There are clearly variations in the level and type of support that employers provide to

their student employees, but the main type of support is tuition assistance to pay some or all of

the direct costs of coursework. Surveys of employers who offer such plans find that, while there

is considerable variation across plans, the benefits are not trivial and are often quite generous.3


roughly 17 percent of all students received employer assistance. If employers paid one-third of the costs
for these students, then they are paying about 5 to 6 percent of all post-secondary expenditures.
3
  77 percent of employers pay expenses beyond tuition (seven percent even pay for parking), and 72
percent have no limit on the number of courses that employees can take (Hewitt 1998). The average
                                                                                                            5


Even where the skills being acquired are useful in current jobs, the benefits associated with the

employee’s increased marginal productivity should flow to the employee as long as those skills

are general and useful elsewhere. Nor is it the case that employers who need certain general

skills in their workforce have to send their current employees to college to get them. The obvious

alternative is simply to hire employees who already have those skills. The employer has to pay

the market wage for general skills when they hire such workers, but at least they do not have to

pay for the skills and pay the market wage as they presumably do when they provide tuition

assistance for current employees. So the question remains, why do employers do it?4



Why Employers Support General Skills:

        Evidence from employee surveys suggests that most training may be general in the broad

sense of being useful elsewhere (Barron, Berger, and Black 1999). There is now a large

literature attempting to explain why employers in fact provide general skills training of all kinds,

and some of those explanations may apply to employer support for post-secondary education as



employer payment through tuition assistance plans is $3906 per year while the modal payment is $5,000
(IFEBP 2002). Eighty percent of employers in this same survey allow their employees to take any courses
regardless of subject matter or eventual degree, therefore in some cases paying for skills that have no
benefit to them. The others restrict the content in various ways, typically to programs and courses that
have some relevance to the company and the employee’s work there. Such restrictions make it more
likely that the skills the employees acquire will be of some use to the employer.
4
  Perhaps the simplest explanation might be that tuition assistance is just a tax-free benefit that employers
offer as a form of cost-effective compensation. Employee payments for their own tuition are only tax
deductible under limited circumstances (i.e., for coursework directly related to their job), but employers
can provide their employees with up to $5250 toward tuition costs without the employees having to pay
income tax on those benefits. Similarly, the employers can avoid paying FICA contributions on those
payments that they would otherwise have to pay on compensation, arrangements known as Section 127
Benefits. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 kept all undergraduate tuition reimbursements tax exempt to
recipients but made graduate reimbursements taxable unless they were for courses related to work, a
criterion that has been interpreted broadly. But any utility in terms of additional compensation for the
workforce would be greater for other employee benefits that are used by more employees, such as
expanded healthcare. So it is not at all obvious why employers who were motivated to offer tax-free
compensation would choose this benefit as opposed to others.
                                                                                                    6


well. Ultimately, employers have to recoup the investment in training through a gap between

what workers produce and what they are paid. The question is how that happens.

       Among the possible explanations is the argument put forward by Katz and Ziderman

(1990) suggesting that, in practice, information about general skills provided by one’s employer

is not readily available to other employers. While such skills may be valuable to other

employers, if they cannot be easily identified by other employers, then other job offers will not

be forthcoming. Employers can therefore provide general skills training because those skills will

raise the productivity but not the marketability and wages of their employees.

        This explanation does not seem to apply to post-secondary education, however, because

such education creates general skills that are easily identifiable in the market place. Indeed,

education is probably the most readily identifiable credential for skills because it is widely

recognized not only by employers but by virtually everyone. The credentials are issued by

independent organizations, typically by colleges and universities, which are certified in various

ways to ensure that the skills being taught conformed to standardized criteria. Indeed, post-

secondary institutions sometimes compete with each other on their ability to raise the wages of

their students, and the relatively higher wages of those who attend college (especially for those

who graduate, given that degrees represent the clearest signal of skills to the market) is one of the

most important stylized facts in the labor market. So it seems unlikely that the decision to help

pay for the education of employees can be explained by asserting that the skills provided cannot

be observed in the market.

       Arguably the best-known explanation for funding general skills training and the one

outlined by Becker is to have the employees pay for it explicitly by accepting “training” wages

that are below their marginal product, and typically below the market wage, while they are being
                                                                                                       7


trained. Apprenticeship-type arrangements are the best example, and there are many descriptions

of similar arrangements (see, e.g., Leuvan, 1999).

       Other studies have shown that workers receiving general skills training do not necessarily

receive lower training wages (see Bishop 1996; Baron, Berger, and Black 1997), however, and

there are reasons for believing that training wages are unlikely to be the explanation for tuition

assistance. There are no arrangements with which I am familiar in companies to hold down or

reduce wages explicitly while employees are receiving tuition benefits as there are with tuition

programs.5 So the question would be whether tuition benefits are used at a point where wages

are otherwise held below their productivity, such as at the beginning of their career as many

models assume (whether there is evidence that wages are in fact below marginal products then is,

of course, a separate empirical question).

       There are at least two reasons for thinking that this is not the mechanism that funds

tuition assistance. First, most employers prohibit access to tuition benefits for new hires, when

one would think of the employees as being “trainees” who are still learning their jobs. Fifty-

seven percent make employees wait a year or more of service before they can receive such

benefits (IFEBP 2002). That may not seem like a significant delay, but it is important to

remember that most employees do not stay long with a given employer: Over the past twenty

years, one in five employees had tenure of less than one year (Jaeger and Stevens, 2000), and

forty-five percent stay four years or less (Neumark, Polsky, and Hansen 2000).

       Second and most important, once employees are eligible for these programs, with few

exceptions (e.g., approval required for certain courses) the employees themselves decide when to


5
 I put this question to a group of 41 human resource managers at the 2002 Society for Human Resource
Management (SHRM) Annual Conference program on business strategy (June 22 2002). None of their
companies had any arrangements where it was possible to explicitly lower the wages of workers using
TAPs,, and none had heard of any arrangement like those elsewhere.
                                                                                                     8


use the benefits. The typical model of tuition assistance, where employers pay some or all of the

tuition costs and employees attend classes on their own time, cannot be used for employer-

mandated training because of various legislative restrictions governing training and tuition

assistance. (If the training is required and the employer mandates it, then the employer must pay

the full cost of the training, provide it during working hours, and pay non-exempt workers their

full wage while receiving the training. See footnote 14.) After meeting the minimum tenure

requirements, employees can use tuition assistance whenever they want. So the question is

whether employees voluntarily and systematically happen to use them at points when we might

believe wages are otherwise held down. Back-loaded models of compensation assert that this

period would be at the beginning of their career.

       There are no systematic data on tenure and use of tuition plans, but I investigated through

contacts with human resource departments the pattern of usage at several organizations. These

may be representative of arrangements in the population. At my University, for example, the

benefits office reports that the average employee who uses tuition benefits for their own

education has five years of tenure while the average tenure for all employees is nine years.

United Technologies reports that their average tuition benefit recipient has five years with the

company; average tenure there is closer to 15 years. Xerox Copier Division says that their

average user is over 30 years of age while the average worker in the Division is closer to 40.

Harleysville Insurance, which has a remarkable 30 percent of all employees currently using

tuition assistance, reports that the distribution of usage by tenure and age is roughly

proportionate to that of the workforce as a whole. All of these organizations note that there is a

wide distribution of use by age and tenure levels – some of the oldest and most senior employees
                                                                                                  9


use them as well. And employees seeking degrees may use the plans for many years, given that

they are by definition attending school part time and may be seeking degrees.

       Tuition assistance users may be somewhat younger and less senior than the workforce as

a whole, but they are not new hires, and many senior workers use them as well. Further, the data

presented earlier suggests that only a fraction of the workforce is using these benefits at any

point in time. It is extremely difficult to imagine any wage structure that would hold down

wages selectively for workers who use these plans without holding down effectively most of the

wages for the firm. It might be, of course, that employers who use these plans systematically

have below-market wages, a possibility that is examined below.

       Acemoglu and Pischke (1999) put forward a different explanation, that workers pay for

general skills after the fact by having marginal products that exceed their wages. Their

explanation relies on compressed wage structures where wages for higher skilled workers are

artificially held down relative to their own marginal products. Market imperfections in various

forms could prevent wages from rising and make it possible for the employers to recoup tuition

investments by having worker productivity exceed their wages. Given that tuition assistance

programs operate so broadly across the economy and that employees use them at any point in

their career, it seems unlikely that market imperfections as one usually thinks of them (e.g.,

collective bargaining agreements) would explain their wide-spread use. One type of market

imperfection, imperfect information, may be a promising explanation for the use of tuition

assistance in that it could be wide-spread enough to explain the results.

       Specifically, tuition assistance may create private information by sorting out

heterogeneity and information asymmetries among job applicants. We know that applicants who

are interested in being trained may be systematically better workers in ways that are useful to the
                                                                                                                 10


employers as compared to employees who do not have that interest. Acemoglu and Pischke

(1998) and Autor (2001) provide evidence that firms offering general skills training do attract

better quality workers and argue explicitly that self-selection mechanisms are part of the story.

Employers who offer training may therefore have an advantage in recruiting over those who do

not because better quality applicants self-select to apply for those jobs (Stevens 1994).

        Self-selection seems especially applicable to tuition assistance because the general skills

provided by post-secondary education are the ones that employees understand will benefit them

most. Poorer-quality applicants who lack the ability, discipline, or motivation to take succeed in

post-secondary education will see no advantage from taking jobs with such a benefit (unlike

most employer-provided general skills training, it is possible to fail post-secondary courses). And

unlike most other employee benefits, employees must share in the costs of using tuition

assistance through an investment of their time and effort, typically outside of work hours, as well

as some of the financial costs (few plans pay the entire cost of tuition, fees, books, etc.). So the

usual requirement of signaling models, that there be a “separating equilibrium” whereby it is

easier or more desirable for high ability applicants to signal their ability, seems to apply here. A

lower initial or “training” wage as in other models of general training may not be needed to

dissuade lower ability workers from applying.

        Uncovering better quality workers could allow firms to earn a return if the information

about the superior abilities of those workers is not publicly available: Their market wage does

not rise if the information is not readily available even though their marginal product is higher.6


6
  It is possible that merely being hired at a firm that offers tuition assistance could send a signal to other
employers that one is a better worker. But quitting that first firm to take advantage of offers from other
firms could also send a negative signal about one’s capabilities (e.g., that the employee had problems at
work) that makes them less attractive. As Greenwald (1986) observed, the fact that the first employer
knows who is a good worker, presumably keeping the good ones and firing the poor ones, generates
adverse selection in the outside or second-hand market.
                                                                                                   11


If their productivity is above market levels, employers could earn a margin on them even while

paying the market wage. Employers may even have an incentive for rent sharing, raising wages

somewhat above the market rate, in order to induce these good workers to stay with the firm.

       Turnover should be lower as well where employees use tuition assistance. Part of the

explanation is obvious: As noted above, many employers require that employees be with the firm

for some period before they receive tuition assistance. A smaller percentage require employees

to sign contracts that make them reimburse the costs of the tuition benefits should they quit

before some specific date. About 20 percent of U.S. employers have such requirements, and the

average length of stay required is six months (IFEBP 2002). The requirement across the

population of all employers who offer tuition assistance, therefore, would average out to roughly

36 days. Together these arrangements no doubt have some effect on increasing average tenure

and reducing turnover.

       The more important explanation for lower turnover is what one might label an “efficiency

wage” mechanism: Employees stay with the firm longer because they want to keep using the

tuition assistance benefit to complete their education, a process that could take many years.

Receiving a post-secondary education is a time-consuming process, especially if one is going to

school while working. The shortest course that is typically possible, a single semester class of

roughly 14 weeks, is more than double the 36 day requirement noted above, and the coursework

required for even an Associate’s Degree could easily exceed the tenure of the average employee.

If employees who use tuition assistance are tied to their firms during the period when they are

using the plans, then employers are able to hold down wages somewhat during that period, at

least relative to worker’s marginal productivity. And the common requirement to serve some
                                                                                                      12


period of time before tuition assistance can be used prevents employees from finishing their

education by jumping to a competitor.

       A related possibility is that firms that offer tuition benefits and the workers who select

into them are distinctive in ways that create better matches between jobs and workers. A good fit

or “match” between distinctive jobs and distinctive workers leads to higher performance without

necessarily raising market wages because the match is not transferable elsewhere. Employers

have an incentive to share some of the rents generated by this better performance in order to help

retain the good matches, so wages rise above market levels and turnover falls as a result

(Jovanovic 1979; see also Bowlus 1995 for wage effects and Hersch and Reagan 1990 and

Simon and Warner 1992 for tenure effects). Empirical models of match quality have fallen

somewhat out of favor, however, because it is difficult to identify the mechanisms through which

superior matches would take place and essentially impossible with most data to examine the

quality of matches per se. And the predictions of higher wages and lower turnover are often

consistent with other models. In this case, the selection/efficiency wage argument above is

simpler and makes the same predictions. While we cannot explore the match quality hypothesis

explicitly, it is worth bearing in mind that it could present an alternative interpretation for the

analyses below.



A Simple Theoretical Model of Tuition Assistance:

       In the model below, workers who have greater ability and motivation self-select into

firms with tuition assistance plans. Their marginal productivity, other things equal, is above

average levels in the market. Information about their superior ability is at least not immediately

or perfectly available to other firms (the signal comes when they actually begin using tuition
                                                                                                    13


assistance), and so their market wage does not rise to the level of their marginal productivity.

Because their productivity is above market levels, employers can pay them the market wage and

still earn a margin on their performance. (The workers might have been willing to accept wages

below market levels in return for tuition benefits, but the fact that employers are earning a return

on the workers even at market levels sufficient to fund the tuition benefits combined with labor

market competition among employers pushes the wages higher.) The employees who receive

tuition assistance are tied to the firm for many years. In part requirements of the tuition

assistance plans may tie them there, but mainly they stay in order to make use of the benefits and

receive their education, a process that can take years. Once they finish their education, their

market wage rises to reflect the level of their new general skills and their greater ability and

motivation as signaled by essentially working their way through school using tuition assistance.

At that point, their market wage rises to their true marginal productivity, and the employer no

longer earns a return that could be used to pay off the tuition benefits.

        Consider the match between a firm and its employees where one looks at match quality

from the perspective of the firm, instead of the usual focus at the individual level, where the

concern is with the average quality of matches across the workforce.

        The match quality m depends on a firm’s general recruiting and work practices and on its

educational policy, including tuition reimbursement for general skills training in the form of

post-secondary education. Let t denote tuition reimbursement for employees, and i denote the

combination of all other characteristics of a firm that affect its overall match quality. It is

assumed that the two partial derivatives of m(t,i): mt(t,i), mi(t,i), and the cross second derivative

mti(t,i) are all positive.
                                                                                                     14


        Because i defines many of the attributes of a firm, it no doubt has an important influence

on recruiting and on the average match quality of its employees. Tuition reimbursement

encourages employees to increase their stock of general skills and of human capital more

broadly, which increases their ability to perform better on the job. At least some part of the cost

of acquiring those general skills is borne by the student/employee through time and effort spent

learning outside of working hours. Assume also that firm-specific skills are seen as compliments

to general skills and that higher levels of general skills induce the firm to invest more in specific

training. The more crucial the human resources are to a firm’s success, the bigger the influence

that tuition reimbursement will have on the firm’s overall productivity.

        Let h0 be an employee’s initial human capital when joining the firm. The tuition

reimbursement encourages the employee to increases his/her human capital to h= h0 + t. Suppose

all competing firms have the same technology represented by a production function f(h) without

loss of generality. We index each firm by its characteristics i so that firm i’s production function

is m(t,i)f(h). The wage rate is denoted by wi . The objective function of a firm i is

(1)                     max m(t,i)f(h) – wi h – c (t)

with respect to t, taking other parameters as given. Here c (t) is the cost of tuition reimbursement.



The first order condition about t is

(2)                     mt(t,i)f(h)+ m(t,i)f’(h) - wi – c’ (t) < 0 if t=0;

                               mt(t,i)f(h)+ m(t,i)f’(h) - wi – c’ (t) = 0 if t>0;

It is not difficult to see that a firm with a higher i is more likely to reimburse tuition for its

employees under reasonable assumptions.
                                                                                                          15


          Instead of providing tuition reimbursement to encourage employees to increase their

human capital, a firm could hire a new employee with the same level of human capital, say, the

same as h= h0 + t and dismiss the original employee with h0. Suppose the cost of doing so is r.

The profit level of a firm i in this situation is

(3)                              m(0,i)f(h) – wm h – r,

where wm is the market wage. By the first order condition of optimization with respect to h, we

have the following condition held,

(4)                              wm = m(0,i)f’(h).



Firm i compares these two schemes -- tuition assistance to improve the human capital of current

employees v. hiring new employees. The firm chooses the more profitable one to implement.

Let D denote the difference of the two levels of profit,

(5)                      D = m(t,i)f(h) – wi h – c (t) –[ m(0,i)f(h) – wm h – r]

                         =[ m(t,i)f(h)– m(0,i)f(h)] – (wi h – wm h)– (c (t) – r)



The wage rate wm is also the one faced by employees in firm i if they choose to quit after taking

the tuition reimbursement. To prevent quitting, the wage rate wi should be higher or equal to wm

.This   means the wage rate for current employee should be at least equal to or greater than that for

a new hire with the same human capital level. The reason here is that current employees have

accumulated some firm-specific human capital than the new hires.

          It is easy to see that if the gain in productivity m(t,i)f(h)– m(0,i)f(h) is high enough such

than the cost c (t) – r, which is true with appropriate parameters, then D > 0 so that the firm will

choose to provide educational support to current employees instead of hiring new ones. And the
                                                                                                  16


wage rate in this case is not lower than the market rate. Accordingly the turnover rate should be

lower because employees have no incentive to quit. Further, the rate of involuntary turnover is

also lower because firms do not need to layoff current employees and hire new ones. The

comparative statics show that D increases with the initial human capital h0 , which implies a

positive correlation between h0 and tuition reimbursement t.

       We can examine the extent to which tuition assistance programs affect the ability to hire

better workers as well as employee outcomes that are seen as indicating the presence of better

matches.



The Data:

       The ideal data for this study would be longitudinal data on individuals who use tuition

assistance that includes their wages and their marginal productivity in order to measure the

margin between the two before and using tuition assistance. Such data would have to include

controls for employer characteristics and practices, and marginal productivity data has to be

measured at the firm. No such data exist – there are not even any individual-level data on the use

of tuition assistance. What we do have is data about employers, their use of tuition assistance

and other practices, and average characteristics of their workforce including wages. The

National Employer Survey II administered by the U.S. Bureau of the Census provides such

information. The survey was conducted in August of 1997 (NES II) via Computer Assisted

Telephone Interviewing (CATI). The sampling frame was drawn from the Standard Statistical

Establishment List, arguably the most comprehensive list of establishments available. Public

sector employees, not-for-profit institutions, and corporate headquarters were excluded from the

sample. Although the survey excluded establishments with less than 20 employees (which
                                                                                                     17


represent approximately 85 percent of all establishments in the U.S.), the sampling frame

represents establishments that employ approximately 75 percent of all workers (because most

workers are employed in larger establishments). The survey over-sampled the nation's largest

establishments and those in the manufacturing sector. Weights were constructed for the data by

the Census to approximate the true distribution of establishments (by size and industry) in the

economy. The target respondent in the manufacturing sector was the plant manager and the local

business site manager in the non-manufacturing sector.

       The sample for the NES II Public Use File used here has approximately 3,000 completed

interviews that comprise a representative sample of the United States. The usual reason given by

employers as to why they would not participate in the survey was that they did not participate in

any voluntary surveys or were too busy to participate. Probit analysis conducted by Lynch and

Black (1995) of the characteristics of nonrespondents from the initial NES survey in 1994, a

similar sampling frame, indicates that there was no significant pattern at the two-digit industry

level in the likelihood of participating in the survey. The only differentiating characteristic of

establishments less likely to participate was that manufacturing establishments with more than

1000 employees, 0.1 percent of the sample, were less likely to do so.

       The survey asks a series of questions about employer practices with respect to issues like

recruiting, the terms and conditions of employment, and – most important – whether the

employer provided tuition assistance. Many of the questions collect information about practices

for five separate occupational categories: managers and professionals, supervisors, technicians,

office/clerical/sales/and customer support, and production workers. Observations are removed

from the analysis when data for any variable used in it is missing in order to keep sample sizes
                                                                                                         18


the same for all coefficients in the analysis. As a result, sample sizes tend to fall the more

variables used and will differ across models.

        Information about tuition assistance comes from the following question, “Do you

reimburse the cost of tuition for an approved course for a. managers and professionals;

b.supervisors; c.technical and technical support; d.office, clerical, sales; and e.customer

service/production workers?”7 No doubt other information about tuition assistance would be

interesting as well, such as how much assistance the employer provides or what kind of

restrictions are put on the courses for which reimbursement can be received. But the basic issues

concerning tuition reimbursement raised earlier all turn on why employers provide any such

assistance, not how much they provide or how tightly they restrict it, and those issues can be

addressed with information from this question.

        Table 1 provides some simple descriptive information about the incidence of tuition

assistance at the establishment level and how it varies by industry and by the size of the

establishment. Perhaps the most remarkable statistic is simply how wide spread tuition

assistance is, mirroring the results of earlier surveys noted above. Eight-eight percent of

establishments say they reimburse tuition for approved courses, a figure roughly in the middle of

the estimates from earlier ad hoc surveys. In some industries, the practice seems close to

universal. The fact that so few establishments do not provide assistance limits the variance in

this variable. Fortunately, the power of statistical tests is based not on the percentage of

observations that vary, which is small (only 12 percent not providing tuition), but on the absolute

number in the smallest cell (i.e., the smaller of the “yes” or “no” response), which is relatively


7
 The question does not ask about college course work per se, but the issues would be identical if the
responses included secondary or high school education, which provide equally general skills. Virtually
all part-time secondary education is free, including evening schools and General Education Degree
programs (GED’s), though, and the word “tuition” seems associated with post-secondary programs.
                                                                                                 19


large (181 in the survey). Variables with small cells are not a problem when used as independent

variables, as used here, as long as they are not collinear with the other predictor variables.

                                               Table 1 Here

       The other variables used in the analyses that follow include a range of control variables

based on characteristics of the establishments, such as their industry and size, and characteristics

of their workforces, as well as information about specific employment practices related to the

arguments above. These variables, their means and standard deviations, are provided in Table 2

and are discussed below in the context of the analyses where they are used.

                                               Table 2 Here

Analyses:

        Before examining the hypotheses outlined above, I consider a simple check on the

usefulness of the data with respect to the question about tuition reimbursement. Presumably

tuition reimbursement as an employer policy matters if it causes employees to undertake more

education than they otherwise would. It is difficult to argue with the conceptual notion that

reducing the price of education should increase employees’ use of it, although one might imagine

scenarios where policies of tuition reimbursement may not work (e.g., employers may restrict the

use of their policies so tightly that the policies have little effect). The arguments and hypotheses

presented above, though, are based on the assumption that at least some employees actually use

these policies to increase their level of education beyond what it otherwise would be. And a

positive relationship between tuition reimbursement programs and the educational outcomes of

employees would make us much more sanguine about that assumption as well as about the

usefulness of the data.
                                                                                                         20


        It is not obvious from prior research exactly how one should model the relationship

between tuition assistance and the educational attainment of an employer’s workforce. One

complication is that tuition assistance may well affect the overall level of education in a

workforce by attracting applicants who already have more education, an issue examined

explicitly below. Indeed, the level of education that workers have when they are hired may be

the most important component of average education levels in the workforce. However, we

would like to examine how tuition assistance affects the educational attainment of current

employees, that is, whether it leads to additional education after they are hired.8 Fortunately, the

NES asks employers not only about the average educational level of their workers but also about

the average educational level of new hires. By examining the relationship between tuition

assistance programs and average education levels while controlling for the average education of

new hires, we can get a reasonably accurate sense of whether such assistance affects the

educational levels of current employees. Because these measures aggregate from the attributes of

individual employees, it seems reasonable to include demographic characteristics of the

employees as control variables.

    (6) I estimate an equation of the form: Edi = α + Tiβ + Xiγ + εi , where we are estimating

        the causal effect of T, tuition assistance, on average education levels, Ed, and where X

        denotes a vector of factors that may affect educational attainment but are not related to

        the central hypothesis. The specific variables included as controls in X are industry,

        employment size (by category), manufacturing as a category, the percentage of the

8
 The complication here in sorting out heterogeneity associated with recruitment is that policies of tuition
reimbursement may also attract applicants who are more interested in getting additional education. Even
controlling for the level of education of recruits therefore does not completely control for the effects of
recruitment on total educational attainment. On the other hand, attracting applicants more interested in
education would be a crucial outcome of tuition assistance policies. Sorting out how much of the effect is
                                                                                                        21


        workforce who are women and the percentage who are minorities, the distribution of

        employment by occupational category, and – most importantly – the average educational

        level of new hires.

        The results of simple OLS regressions are reported in Table 3. The relationship between

average education levels and tuition assistance programs, other things equal, is positive and

significant, although the significance declines once controls for industry and employment size

are added. These results are supportive of the notion that tuition assistance does influence the

educational level of workers once they are hired. One could also use these coefficients to

calculate something about the magnitude of education that workers receive as a result of these

plans if one had good data on the percentage of workers across establishments who have ever

used of tuition assistance, information that is unfortunately unavailable. If we assume that 10

percent of current employees have used them (the figure at one of the employers discussed

earlier), then a coefficient of approximately 0.15 implies that those employees who have used the

plan have on average 1.5 years more education as a result.

                                                  Table 3 Here



        Evidence for Selection: A first step in considering the model described earlier is to see

whether tuition assistance is associated with hiring more qualified applicants. There may be a

wide range of attributes associated with better quality applicants, and no doubt it would be

interesting to explore many of them. But the attribute that has arguably been seen as most

important, particularly in human capital models, is the educational level of new hires. Education

levels may also serve as a proxy for other desirable characteristics, such as persistence and


due to these inclinations and how much to the reduced cost of education associated with tuition assistance
plans would go beyond the limits of these data, however.
                                                                                                           22


general cognitive ability, that also raise performance. If applicants with more education are also

ones with a greater interest in further education, then we might expect tuition assistance plans to

be especially attractive to such applicants. We test whether the average education of new hires,

controlling for other characteristics, is higher at establishments that offer tuition assistance with a

simple model where the average education level of new hires is regressed against the incidence

of tuition assistance plans:

        (7) HEdi = α + Triβ + Xiγ + εI where the average education level of new hires is a

        function of the incidence of tuition assistance plans and a vector of control variables

        which includes the distribution of employment by occupation, the percentage of workers

        who are women and who are minorities, industry, establishment size, manufacturing as a

        category, and, most important, the establishment’s annual expenditures on recruiting new

        employees expressed as a percentage of labor costs.9 Such expenditures are a good

        measure for other efforts that may attract better quality applicants to the establishment.

        OLS results in Table 4 suggest that there is a positive relationship between tuition

assistance and the education level of new hires. Tuition plans, therefore, may help employers

attract a more educated and better quality pool of workers.10

                                          Table 4 Here

9
  In equation 6, it is clearly important to control for new hire education when examining whether the
average education of current workers is higher because new hire education so clearly influences average
education. It is not at all clear how the average education of the workforce should affect the average
education of new hires, however, except in a spurious sense.
10
   One issue is whether average education levels at each establishment should be included as control
variables. While such levels may well send signals affecting who applies at that establishment, the
empirical problem is that new hire education and average education are endogenous for the reasons noted
earlier. One attempt around that problem is to regress average education on new hire education and use
the residual as an independent variable in a subsequent equation modeling new hire education. The
results of that exercise, available on request, lead to positive and relationships with tuition assistance of
roughly the same size and of greater significance as those reported here. Results by occupation find the
size of the manager and supervisor coefficients essentially the same as those in Table 4, considerably
                                                                                                         23


         Do employees pay for tuition? The next step in the analyses is to examine relationships

with wages. The model and evidence above suggests that because more productive workers

come to establishments that offer tuition assistance and that information about their ability is

private, employers can earn a margin while paying market wages. Evidence that wages are at or

above market levels, other things equal, would be consistent with the view that workers are more

productive in establishments where tuition assistance is offered. Wages below market levels, on

the other hand, would be consistent with the most common explanation for general skills

training, that workers pay for it through below market, training wages. The test is based on

examining a simple wage equation of the form:

(8) Wi = α + Tiβ + Xiγ + εI where the intent is to model the relationship between tuition

    assistance T on wages W while controlling for a vector of other factors that may affect wages

    X.

    Control variables include the average education levels of the workforce (aggregated by each

occupational group), the distribution of employment across those occupational groups, whether

the establishment’s employees are represented by a union, the industry and size of the

establishment, the percentage of the workforce who are women, and the percentage who are

minorities. Although the data used here are cross-sectional, that would appear to be less of an

issue than might typically be the case because the hypotheses being considered is not necessarily

causal: Independent of which came first, tuition plans or below-market wages, once these plans

exist, are they paid for by holding wages below market levels?

    The results of this wage equation for establishment wages are presented in Table 5. Overall,

the model compares well in terms of explanatory power to a typical individual-level model (a


greater for clerical workers (.59), and roughly has as big for production workers (.18) and office workers
(.15). The relationships for the latter are insignificant.
                                                                                                   24


standard human capital wage equation using Current Population Survey data, e.g., explains

roughly a third of the variance in wages across individual workers).

                                                Table 5 Here

       The results show a positive and significant relationship between wages and tuition

reimbursement plans. Because the model controls for workforce education levels, it is not the

case that the higher wages can be attributed to the fact that tuition assistance plans raise

education levels. The finding of a wage premium associated with tuition assistance plans is

inconsistent with a model where wages are held below market rates either before, such as

apprentice or training wage arguments, or after workers received tuition benefits. Other things

equal, wages would have to be lower on average if employers were paying for tuition assistance

by holding wages below market levels (if wages were lower at some point but offset by higher

wages at another, the employer would have no margin from which to fund tuition assistance).

The finding is consistent, however, with a model where marginal productivity is higher than

market wages. Indeed, above average productivity is required for that result. Exactly why

employers would set wages above market levels in these firms is something of a puzzle, though,

not predicted by the model above. Rent-sharing in order to improve retention and keep morale

high is one explanation; another is that some of the information about the superior productivity

of these workers is public and affects their market wages; some omitted variable (e.g., the jobs

are more demanding) is always a concern as well. It is impossible to sort out these explanations

with the data available here.

       A different argument from the prior literature noted earlier makes an explicit assertion

about the direction of causation in the relationship between wages and tuition assistance. It

asserts that the presence of compressed wage structures provides the opportunity to introduce
                                                                                                   25


and recoup investments in college education by holding down wages after receiving education.

One needs longitudinal data before and after the introduction of tuition assistance plans for a

truly accurate test, and the cross-section data available here can at best provide only suggestive

evidence about that hypothesis.

       In order to identify those situations where wage structures are compressed and below

market levels, I first calculate the residuals from the wage equation (2) (but in this case

excluding the tuition assistance variable from that equation) and use them as a measure of the

extent to which wages are compressed or held below comparable rates elsewhere. Those

residuals are then used to predict the incidence of tuition assistance plans. Wage residuals make

it easier to interpret the coefficient as a test of the depressed wage argument.

       (9) I estimate a model of the form: Ti = α - Wriβ + Xiγ + εI where the incidence of

       tuition assistance is estimated as a function of average wage residual at that establishment

       when controlling for a vector of other factors X that may affect tuition assistance.

       In addition to controls for industry and size, I also include a measure counting up the

number of employee benefits offered at each establishment from a standard list of thirteen in the

NES on the grounds that tuition assistance may operate as another form of employee benefit.

Union coverage and the average education levels of new hires are included as other factors that

affect market wages as well as industry, manufacturing as a sector, and average size control

variables.

       The results of Probit analyses, also presented in Table 5, indicate that wage residuals are

positively related to the incidence of employer-provided tuition assistance programs. Although

equation 9 is clearly not the same as equation 8, it would have been surprising given the cross-

sectional nature of the data if the results were qualitatively different. Wages below prevailing
                                                                                                         26


levels at other employers do not seem to be driving the use of tuition reimbursement plans. In

fact, the opposite appears to be true: Higher wages seem to be associated with the incidence of

these plans.11

        One issue with establishment-level data such as these concerns the possibility of

weighting the observations in the analyses based on their probability of appearing in the sample.

OLS inconsistency can arise if the probability that a given observation in the population is

included in the sample is related to the dependent variable such that the expected value of the

product of the independent variables and the error term (conditional on being included in the

sample p) is not equal to zero. That probability is interpreted as the inverse of the weight

associated with that observation. WLS is a common choice if OLS is not consistent. But the

drawback to WLS is that it can have a high variance due to the large variation in weights,

variation that may have nothing to do with the bias in OLS. In this situation, the weights were

generated by Census to make the data more representative of the population of all establishments

and vary by industry and size of establishment. Because establishment employment in particular

ranges from 20 to over 5000, the weights may have a large variation.

        Hausman tests between OLS and WLS are performed on the results outlined below as an

initial test of the consistency of OLS. For the OLS results presented in Tables 3 and 5, the

coefficients of OLS and WLS are virtually identical. In Table 4, the differences between the two

are significant. But this difference might be the result of the large variance in WLS rather than

11
  The coefficients by occupation are essentially the same in terms of magnitude for (ln) wages as that in
Table 5 but were insignificant for managers. For the equation with wage residuals, the coefficient was
virtually twice as large (1.33) for production workers and roughly half as large (.27) for supervisors. For
coefficients were roughly similar for managers (.52), office workers (.78), and technicians but were
insignificant for supervisors and technicians. The residual equation is the only one in the analyses here
where tuition assistance is the dependent variable and where the small percent of “yes” responses might
conceivably affect the analysis. But because there are a relatively large number of such responses (117)
                                                                                                   27


the bias of OLS. The 2STEP method proposed by Magee et al. (1998) is designed to address this

situation and is used here. The results, presented in the Appendix, show that the 2STEP

coefficients of interests are almost the same as the OLS in the sense that they have the same sign

and significant levels. Thus, the unweighted results presented here seem appropriate. (There is

no corresponding method for assessing the appropriateness of weights for logit and Tobit

regressions, although the 2STEP above when applied to those regressions also suggests no

difference between the weighted and unweighted results.)

        Tests of Employee Turnover: The next test is to see whether these plans are associated

with lower levels of employee turnover, the proxy here for tenure. Turnover and employee

tenure are not the same, of course. Average tenure can be affected by hiring rates as well as by

employee quits (including retirements) and dismissals/layoffs. Quits and dismissals are the

mechanisms behind turnover. They are also the mechanisms associated with the model above

where both quits and dismissals should be lower where better quality workers self-select and stay

with the firm longer to make use of tuition assistance. Employee turnover is made up of

voluntary turnover (employee quits) and involuntary turnover (dismissals and layoffs) and is

measured by the percentage of the workforce that leaves their employer in a given year. The

NES II does not measure employee tenure but does report both measures of turnover by

establishment, and they are combined here into a single turnover measure. Employers may pay

higher wages in order to reduce turnover, but the hypothesis presented above suggests that

workers will stay longer to make use of tuition assistance and predicts that turnover should be

lower even independent of higher wages.




given the sample size of 963, there are a reasonable number of such observations per independent
variable.
                                                                                                  28


       There is a large literature on employee turnover using the individual as the unit of

analysis, but there is not a large literature to use as a guide in modeling employee turnover at the

employer level. Cappelli and Neumark (2001) build such a model, and it is the basis for the

analysis here.

       (10) I estimate a model of employee turnover of the following form: Turni = α + Tiβ +

       Xiγ + εI where average annual turnover (Turn) is regressed against the incidence of

       tuition assistance and a vector of control variables that includes industry and

       manufacturing sector, size, average education levels, the distribution of employees across

       occupational categories, the percentage of women and the percentage of minorities, union

       coverage, and average wages, a factor seen as crucial in many prior studies of turnover.

       Additional control variables found useful in the Cappelli and Neumark (2001) study --

on-the-job training (average time to become proficiency), the extent of teamwork, the amount of

time needed to fill a typical vacancy, the number of candidates interviewed (measures of

recruiting selectiveness), and the use of “benchmarking” as a technique to learn best practices

from other organizations – are added as well. These variables are described in Table 2. Because

turnover is measured as a percentage and, in some establishments, turnover rates are at or near

zero, I use Tobit estimation techniques to correct for possible left-censoring of the data.

                                           Table 6 Here

       The results presented in Table 6 find a negative relationship between tuition assistance

plans and employee turnover in all of the specifications. (Column 2 examines the equation

without wages to see whether the relationships change: we know from prior research that wages

drive turnover and from the results in Table 5 that wages covary with the incidence of tuition

plans.) Analyses conducted separately for voluntary turnover and involuntary turnover, available
                                                                                                         29


on request, indicate that the relationships with tuition are always negative and strongly

significant for involuntary turnover regardless of specification; the relationships for voluntary

turnover, in contrast, while always negative, are more sensitive to specification. The overall

pattern of results suggests that tuition assistance plans are associated with lower rates of turnover

even independent of any wage effects. While self-selection arguments may cause employers to

raise wages to reduce turnover, there is also evidence for a simple efficiency wage-type

explanation, that employees stay longer to use the tuition assistance.

        Alternative Interpretations: In all analyses, there is the possibility that other factors

omitted from the model are explaining the results, omitted variables that are correlated with both

the dependent variable and the relevant independent variables. Because there are no other

systematic studies of tuition assistance plans, it is difficult to generate a list of what practices and

policies might be correlated with them and with the independent variables above. Two may be

worth investigation, however. The first, which relates only to the turnover results, questions

whether some form of back-loaded or deferred compensation is the true cause of lower turnover

for establishments that use tuition assistance. Under this explanation, employers who use tuition

assistance also back-load compensation as a way to retain employees. Employers still have to be

earning a return on the tuition investment in order to have an incentive to retain these workers

because back-loading compensation per se does not generate a margin.12 But it would represent

an alternative to the efficiency wage argument that workers are staying in order to use the tuition

assistance benefit.



12
  Workers will obviously not remain if an employer holds their wages below market levels and then
simply pays back the difference (or worse some fraction) in the future. If the argument is that employers
hold down wages while tuition assistance is being used and then later pay workers the marginal product
of their education, this is identical to the apprenticeship model described earlier. For the reasons noted
there, it seems virtually impossible to use with tuition assistance.
                                                                                                         30


        We can and do test the back-loaded compensation hypothesis empirically. While it is

very difficult to establish the extent to which wages in any context are back-loaded, the most

obvious form of such arrangements are pension plans. Is it the case that employers who use

tuition assistance plans also use pension plans? The data used here do include whether

establishments had pension plans. It would of course be helpful to know the details about these

plans, information that is unfortunately not available. The correlation between having tuition

assistance plans and pension plans is only 0.05, however. And when pensions are added to the

turnover equation, the results are unchanged.13

        A second alternative hypothesis, which relates to the wage and turnover results, questions

whether employers who use tuition assistance are also making greater investments in training. If

so, training could be causing wages to be higher (rent sharing) and employees to stay longer

(match quality). The argument that training and education may be complements in terms of

generating productivity is well-established, but it is not so obvious that employers care about the

source of education when making investments in training: specifically, why would they invest

more in training when education was provided by tuition assistance programs as opposed to

when employees paid for it themselves?

        Nevertheless, we can also test this hypothesis. The NES data includes a measure of

average hours of training per year for each establishment. Its correlation with the incidence of

tuition assistance in these data is actually negative, -0.16, suggesting the reasonable

interpretation that the postsecondary education provided through tuition plans might be a




13
  I estimated various turnover models including the pension variable. When included with other
employee benefits, for example, the pension coefficient was –0.28 and S.E. 5.84. In all cases, the tuition
assistance variable remained strongly significant, never less than: coefficient –2.9 and S.E.=1.5.
                                                                                                           31


substitute for at least some employer-provided training.14 Including training does not change the

relationships with tuition assistance in any important way in the wage or turnover equations.15

        A final, alternative explanation for these results turns not on potential omitted variables

but a different explanation for the employee responses to tuition assistance. Could it be a “gift

exchange” (Akerlof 1981) in the sense that the tuition assistance benefits are seen by employees

as a gift that generates a sense of obligation on their part and, in turn, leads to greater

attachment/lower turnover? Because such an explanation turns on how workers interpret this

benefit and what is going on inside their heads, it is essentially impossible to test it or

differentiate it empirically from more rational self-interest explanations without very

sophisticated experimental data. But there are logical grounds for thinking that tuition assistance

is unlikely to generate much of a gift-exchange response. First, if an employer truly wanted to

generate reciprocity-based loyalty through some gift exchange, they would choose a mechanism

that looks more like a gift: Tuition assistance involves considerable effort and initiative on the

part of the worker, unlike virtually all other benefits. It is also common enough that it is less

likely to be seen as unusual – if it is typical and expected, can it be a gift? – and cannot be used

14
   The training variable retained a negative sign, although rarely significant, in preliminary models
estimating the incidence of tuition assistance. There may be good institutional reasons for a negative
relationship between training and tuition assistance. Under the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, employers
who require that their covered employees (so-called “non-exempt” workers) receive training – even
general skills training where the employee benefits -- must pay the full costs of such training, including
the wages of those being trained. Employers can avoid that requirement by encouraging their workers to
take skills training in the form of course work at colleges through tuition support. In this case, the
employer may only be paying a portion of the tuition and other direct costs of these courses, and
employees may be attending classes and doing homework on their own time. The employee’s share of
the investment is therefore much greater. Presumably employers could offer optional training in house
and ask the employees to pay, but it may be less complicated to essentially outsource the operation and
make it appear more like a benefit and less like a cost. It may also be cheaper to essentially outsource
some skills training to colleges, especially community colleges and state-supported institutions where
tuition and other direct costs are substantially subsidized through taxes.
15
   The tuition coefficient in the wage equation falls trivially but retains the same level of significance (
0.52 S.E.=0.22). In the turnover equation, the tuition coefficient becomes slightly larger and trivially
more significant (-4.42 S.E. = 2.07).
                                                                                                    32


until an employee has already put in some time in the organization. Employees also know about

it when they sign on with the employer. Second, if tuition assistance could indeed generate this

sense of loyalty, then presumably so would every other employee benefit including virtually

everything that employers do for employees. If so, then there would be no unique behavior

associated with tuition assistance. “Gift exchange” if it existed would simply be an attribute of

being employed.



Conclusion:

       Although the results of the above analyses are perhaps more suggestive than definitive of

an answer as to why employers provide tuition assistance to their employees, they point to some

reasonably clear conclusions. Employers must generate the resources to pay for these plans

somehow. The institutional evidence suggesting how these plans work in practice makes it

difficult to believe that wages are artificially held down while employees use them. And the

evidence of wage premia associated with their use conflicts with the simple explanation that

tuition assistance is paid for by holding wages below market levels through apprenticeship or

training wage arrangements. Instead, the results appear more consistent with the view that

workers who use tuition assistance have productivity that is above market levels. One reason for

their greater productivity might be their better quality when hired, as the above results indicate.

Employers can therefore pay the market wage and still earn a margin to recoup tuition assistance

costs, although exactly why they are paying a wage premium remains something of a puzzle for

future research. Turnover is lower, even independent of wage premia, and that result seems

consistent with the view that workers stay with firms longer in order to make full use of tuition

assistance plans. The fact that turnover is lower helps the employer pay for tuition benefits by
                                                                                                  33


earning a margin longer. Lower turnover in itself is a source of cost savings for employers by

reducing search and hiring costs.

       The fact that tuition assistance plans appear to be so common raises the question as to

whether effective self-selection can be going on. One shortcoming of the data used here is that it

only captures whether employer have tuition assistance and not the characteristics of what they

offer. There is considerable and important variation across these plans with respect to how well

they support employee education, as the descriptive data presented earlier suggests. Some meet

only a fraction of the costs and are limited to a narrow range of job-specific courses while others

cover virtually the entire cost of post secondary education, even for degrees unrelated to current

jobs. As a practical matter, therefore, worker self-selection may be driven by the characteristics

of plans and not simply whether an employer has one. If every employer had identical plans, of

course, there would be no selection effects, although it might still make sense to have tuition

assistance. They could represent an equilibrium employment condition, much like a market

wage, that would make an employer stand out in a negative way if they did not offer them.

   Important questions for further research include examining how characteristics of tuition

reimbursement plans affect the outcomes noted here and differentiating more clearly the source

of benefit from these plans to employees.
