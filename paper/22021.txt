Economic Policy Uncertainty and the Credit Channel: Aggregate and Bank Level U.S. Evidence

                                               ABSTRACT

Economic policy uncertainty affects decisions of households, businesses, policy makers and Financial
intermediaries. We first examine the impact of economic policy uncertainty on aggregate bank credit
growth. Then we analyze commercial bank entity level data to gauge the effects of policy uncertainty
on Financial intermediaries' lending. We exploit the cross-sectional heterogeneity to back out indirect
evidence of its effects on businesses and households. We ask (i) whether, conditional on standard macroeconomic
controls, economic policy uncertainty affected bank level credit growth, and (ii) whether there is variation
in the impact related to banks' balance sheet conditions; that is, whether the effects are attributable
to loan demand or, if impact varies with bank level financial constraints, loan supply. We find that
policy uncertainty has a significant negative effect on bank credit growth. Since this impact varies
meaningfully with some bank characteristics – particularly the overall capital-to-assets ratio and bank
asset liquidity–loan supply factors at least partially (and significantly) help determine the influence
of policy uncertainty. Because other studies have found important macroeconomic effects of bank
lending growth on the macroeconomy, our findings are consistent with the possibility that high economic
policy uncertainty may have slowed the U.S. economic recovery from the Great Recession by restraining
overall credit growth through the bank lending channel.

1       Introduction

Recent literature emphasizes how uncertainty matters for economic decision-making. For example,
Stokey (2008) devotes an entire book to theoretically analyzing “[T]he Economics of Inaction.”
Bloom (2009) develops a tractable model in which uncertainty results in a central region of inaction
for hiring and investment, with this zone of inaction expanding when uncertainty is higher because
nonconvex adjustment costs increase. Recently, new methodologies have enabled researchers to
better measure macroeconomic (Jurado, Ludvigson, and Ng, 2015) and economic policy uncer-
tainty (Baker, Bloom, and Davis, 2015). And at the macro-level, Karnizova and Li (2014) find
that economic policy uncertainty helps predict recessions in the presence of now-standard finan-
cial variables. Less well explored are the more specific channels through which economic policy
uncertainty may affect the macro economy.
    This is particularly the case with the recent weak recovery of U.S. bank lending, as evidenced by
a lower path of real total bank loans following the Great Recession than in earlier recessions since
1969-70 (Figure 1). Following the Great Recession, bankers complained that delays implementing
financial reform under the Dodd-Frank Act created regulatory policy uncertainty (Koch, 2012) that
restrained lending, which, in turn, slowed the economic recovery. Indeed, three years after Dodd-
Frank became law, rule-writing regulatory agencies set only about one-half of the new regulations
and reporting requirements have continued to increase (Figure 2). At the same time, the index
of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) based on newspaper wording (“EPU index”, Baker, Bloom,
and Davis, 2015) had been at elevated levels during the Great Recession and the early part of the
economic recovery, generally exceeding the cyclical averages seen in the first four years following
the onset of the five prior recessions (Figures 3 and 4).1
    These developments naturally raise the questions: Did economic policy uncertainty restrain
U.S. bank lending during the prolonged recovery from the Great Recession and what role has it
played in other periods? To address these issues, we analyze data for the banking industry in its
entirety and individual banks separately to empirically assess whether the EPU index contains
    1
     The index measures the number of articles that include the words (1) ‘uncertain’ or ‘uncertainty’, and (2)
‘economics’, ‘economy’, ‘business’, ‘commerce’, ‘industry’, or ‘industrial’, and (3) ‘Congress’, ‘legislation’, ‘White
House’, ‘regulation’, ‘Federal Reserve’, or ‘deficit’. Source: http://www.policyuncertainty.com/us_historical.

marginal information about the growth of bank lending, controlling for variables ranging from
interest rates and GDP growth to controls for early regulations that affected the bank lending
decisions such as Regulation Q (Aron, Duca, Muellbauer, Murata, and Murphy, 2012; Koch, 2015)
and the credit controls of 1980. We exploit the cross-sectional heterogeneity to back out indirect
evidence of EPU’s effects on bank lending. We ask (i) whether, conditional on standard macroe-
conomic controls along with ones for regulation, did economic policy uncertainty affect bank level
credit growth, and (ii) whether there is variation in the impact related to banks’ balance sheet
conditions, i.e., whether the effects are attributable to loan demand or, if the impact varies with
bank level financial constraints, reflect individual bank loan supply effects.
   We find that policy uncertainty significantly slows U.S. bank credit growth, consistent with it
having an effect on broad loan supply and demand. We find that lagged changes in the EPU index
are negatively and significantly linked to the growth rate of bank lending both at the aggregate
and cross-sectional levels. For the latter, we construct a bank level data set from call reports that
has commonly been used in bank level studies of the credit channel of monetary transmission, see,
for instance, Kashyap and Stein (2000), Kishan and Opiela (2000), Ashcraft (2006) or Bluedorn,
Bowdler, and Koch (2014).
   Using aggregated data, economic policy uncertainty is highly significant in quarterly models of
real per capita bank loan growth spanning 1961 to 2014. This result is robust to the inclusion or
exclusion of macroeconomic controls (lags of GDP growth and changes in the real fed funds rate),
direct regulatory controls (a measure of the effects of deposit regulations and an episode when the
Federal Reserve implemented credit controls in 1980), lags of the forward-looking (expectations)
index of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, and other macro variables which
may be correlated with economic policy uncertainty. We also find that innovations to EPU also
have significant effects on GDP and bank loans in VARs, consistent with the battery of VARs of
Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2015) who do not focus on bank lending.
   A robust impact of EPU on loan growth also arises when individual bank data are analyzed
in models that use a general specification better suited to cross-sectional data. The cross-section
enables us to more convincingly identify a role for loan supply factors by examining how individual



                                                  3
bank asset characteristics are linked to the impact of economic policy uncertainty.
   In particular, three statistically and economically meaningful results arise using relative indexes
of individual bank asset characteristics. First, the negative effects of economic policy uncertainty
(EPU) on loan growth are greater for larger-sized banks. One explanation for the size effect is
that it may reflect a greater importance of national uncertainty for larger banks that tend to be
more geographically diversified than smaller banks. Second, the negative effect of economic policy
uncertainty on bank lending growth is smaller in magnitude for more highly capitalized banks.
This suggests that the shock-absorbing buffer effects of greater capitalization that tend to reduce
economic policy uncertainty effects outweigh the potential offsetting selection effects, the latter
of which reflect that higher capitalization rates could be associated with greater risk aversion
among banks.2 Third, the depressing effect of economic policy uncertainty on bank lending is
significantly but quantitatively only somewhat smaller at banks with more cash assets, with no
significant correlation with differing levels of securities holdings. These three results are robust to
the inclusion or exclusion of different control variables (e.g., lagged GDP growth, changes in the
real federal funds rate, deposit rate and credit controls, and consumer sentiment).
   The results have several important implications. First, statistical evidence suggests that eco-
nomic policy uncertainty has affected bank lending in the U.S., which other studies have found to
have important effects on economic activity and which we also find. This could have implications
for Europe, where the Baker-Bloom-Davis (BBD) index of economic policy uncertainty rose more
than in the U.S. during the post-crisis slump (Figure 5) and the economies are more bank depen-
dent. More recently, the EPU index in Europe has not recovered as quickly as in the U.S., where
the subsequent recovery in bank-lending growth has been stronger as has been the overall recovery
in GDP growth. Second, we find that the national economic policy uncertainty is associated with
larger declines in bank loan growth at larger U.S. banks, weakly capitalized banks, and at banks
holding less cash. This provides evidence of loan supply side-effects at the level of individual banks
and suggests somewhat mixed evidence of the impact of recent financial reforms. On the one hand,
    2
      A priori, the negative impact of economic policy uncertainty on bank lending could be greater at more risk-
averse banks that to be better capitalized. Well-capitalized banks may be more risk-averse because the implicit
subsidy from deposit insurance is a decreasing function of capital (Flannery, 1989; Gennotte and Pyle, 1991) or
because they want to reduce the probability of not meeting capital requirements (Dewatripont and Tirole, 1994).



                                                       4
higher capitalized banks and to a lesser extent those with more cash tend to reduce lending less
in response to greater economic policy uncertainty, but on the other hand, the effects do not sig-
nificantly differ in magnitude across banks with differing portfolio shares in securities. Together,
these empirical findings that economic policy uncertainty affects financial flows via a bank lending
channel are consistent with the view (1) that the elevated levels of economic policy uncertainty
that often accompany recessions and periods of slow economic growth have contributed to weak
bank loan growth, and (2) that the implications of financial reforms for financial stability should
be evaluated from a holistic perspective.
    Furthermore, our findings suggest that the initial announcement or implementation effects of
stricter liquidity and capital requirements on banks likely muted the depressing effects of policy
uncertainty associated with the post-crisis slump. Because other studies have found important
macro-economic effects of bank lending growth on the macro-economy, this may help account for
the delayed and weak recovery of U.S. bank loan growth following the Great Recession and is
consistent with more recent signs of an upturn in bank lending that has followed the recent decline
of U.S. economic policy uncertainty to levels predating the Great Recession and the transition to
a more highly capitalized banking system.
    To establish these findings, the study is organized along the following lines. Section 2 lays
out the specifications used to analyze U.S. bank loan growth at the national and individual bank
levels, while Section 3 briefly describes the data and variables. Section 4 presents the empirical
results for the U.S., Section 5 highlight important robustness checks and Section 6 examines the
impact of EPU on bank credit standards to help gauge the macroeconomic impact of EPU. Section
7 concudes by discussing and interpreting their implications.



2     Empirical Specifications

The empirical analysis employs a combination of aggregate and bank level auto-regressions of
real bank loan growth, using quarterly data back to 1961. The main sets of regressions use the
historical, newspaper version of the BBD EPU index that is available over a longer sample period.
The models of disaggregated loan growth are able to incorporate some bank-level characteristics

                                                 5
and examine how the sensitivity of loan growth at individual banks is associated with different
aspects of bank balance sheets.


2.1    Empirical Specification for Aggregate Loan Growth

The baseline specification for total aggregate bank loans is:
                                  n
                                  X                    n
                                                       X                 n
                                                                         X
                  ∆lnLt = α +           ρ` ∆lnLt−` +         β` Mt−` +         γ` EPUt−` + εt   (1)
                                  `=1                  `=1               `=1

Aggregate level quarter-over-quarter real per capita growth in bank loans held in portfolios is
regressed on a constant, its own lags ∆lnLt−` (throughout the paper lags are indexed by the
subscript `), macroeconomic and regulatory controls (Mt ), and economic policy uncertainty (EPU).
Macroeconomic controls include the growth rate of real GDP and the change in the real federal
funds rate (defined using the year-over-year smoothed GDP inflation rate). Regulatory controls
include (1) a dummy for quarter when credit controls were in effect in 1980 and (2) Duca and
Wu’s (2009) measure of how binding Regulation Q ceilings were on time deposit interest rates at
banks. The specification also includes quarterly dummies to capture lending seasonality and a
time-trend. The expected conditions index of consumer sentiment from the Michigan index was
used to control for the expected economic outlook in some empirical models.

Following the literature on the lending channel, we estimate specification (2) across a panel of U.S.

                                                                                                    

where annualized quarter-over-quarter real loan growth at bank i in percentage points is regressed
on a constant, its own lag ∆Li,t−1 , macroeconomic controls such as the quarterly growth rate of
                                                                         real
GDP ∆ytl , and the quarterly change in the real federal funds rate ∆RF Ft−1   . We also include
a time-trend, quarterly dummies, and bank specific quarterly dummies as controls commonly
used in the literature: Assets denotes appropriately normalized total bank assets, Equity denotes
capital-ratios, Cash is the cash plus reserves ratio, and Securities denotes the securities-ratio.
The balance sheet ratios are demeaned within quarter and normalized within quarter by dividing
them by one standard deviation. In contrast, the bank size variable is first transformed to an
integer denoting its within-quarter-size percentile. We then subtract 50, so the integer is between
-49 and 50, and then divide by one hundred. Thus, a zero entry designates a bank at the size
median in the respective quarter, 0.50 a bank in the top asset size percentile within the quarter
and -0.49 for the smallest banks in the bottom asset size percentile in the respective quarter. To
ensure that our results are not driven by other macroeconomic or regulatory variables, we include
such macro variables and regulatory variables in several robustness checks. To test for the effect

of any particular macro variable, we report tests on several null hypotheses:

                                        X

                                        `=1

In order to understand how the impact of economic policy uncertainty varies with bank level
proxies for financial constraints, we test:
                                       4
                                       X
                                H0 :          τk,` = 0       with    k = 1, 2, 3, 4                       (4)
                                        `=1

taking into account level heterogeneity across the respective characteristics via the parameters δk
in specification (2).



3       Data and Variables

This section describes the (i) economic policy uncertainty variable, macroeconomic and regulatory
controls, and (ii) entity level data underlying the subsequent empirical analysis.


3.1     Economic Policy Uncertainty

We employ three indexes of economic policy uncertainty (EPU ) constructed by Baker, Bloom,
and Davis (2015). The first is their historical, newspaper based index that measures the frequency
of references to economic uncertainty and policy in leading newspapers. From 1900 to 1984, the
index is based on six newspapers and in 1985 expanded to cover four additional newspapers, with
break adjustments for changes in the composition of newspapers in their index.3 Examining the
information content of the historical series enables us to analyze a long time series on bank lending
extending back to 1961 that covers a number of business, interest rate, and credit cycles.
    As a robustness check on our findings for the longer-sample historical series, we also examine
two other EPU indexes of Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2015) that cover the shorter sample period
of 1985 to present. These are their new overall EPU index (EPU1985 ) and a component of
it that covers uncertainty regarding finance (EPUFin)–including monetary policy and financial
    3
    The six original newspapers are the Boston Globe, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, the New York
Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post. The four additional newspapers are the Dallas Morning
News, the Miami Herald, the San Francisco Chronicle, and USA Today.

                                                         8
regulation. The appeal of analyzing EPU1985 is that it is a more comprehensive measure of
economic policy uncertainty than the newspaper based historical series. Nevertheless, these series
are highly correlated since 1985. The advantage of assessing the information content of their
financial EPU index (EPUFin) is that this index focuses on the sort of uncertainty that intuitively
would affect bank lending more–interest rates and financial regulation–and is less prone to reflecting
endogenous, general business cycle factors that may be correlated with more general measures of
economic policy uncertainty.


3.2    Macroeconomic and Regulatory Variables

The macroeconomic data that we employ in our analysis include several types of variables. To
deflate aggregate bank loan levels, we use the GDP chain price deflator. Nonregulatory factors
are captured by including lags of real GDP growth (∆y) and the change in the real federal funds
rate (∆RF F , defined using Hodrick-Prescott filtered year-over-year percent change in the implicit
GDP price deflator). Our measure of the real federal funds rate does account for the zero lower
bound by setting the nominal federal funds rate equal to the Wu and Xia (2014) shadow federal
funds rate after policy rates hit the zero bound. Some empirical models include two variables to
control for regulatory induced effects on bank lending. One is a measure (RegQ) of how binding
Regulation Q deposit ceilings were on banks (Duca and Wu, 2009) to control for built-in regulatory
drags on lending growth in an era (pre-1984) when loan securitization markets were too poorly
developed to offset Regulation Q induced disintermediation. The other is a dummy for the Carter
credit controls of early 1980 (CCon = 1 from March to June 1980), which induced banks to
sharply curtail lending growth and provoked a sharp recession, before the controls were removed
in mid-1980. Because such regulations have not occurred in the U.S. since 1983, including RegQ
and CCon helps control for pre-1983 regime shifts in the longer sample used in the aggregate
level models. A final variable–the percent change in the expectations component of the University
of Michigan’s Index of Consumer Sentiment (∆Conf Exp) regarding the future (the expectations
index)–we found outperformed lags of the slope of the Treasury yield curve and the percent change
in the index of leading economic indicators.


                                                  9
3.3     Bank Level Data

We construct a bank level data set from regulatory filings, the Report of Income and Conditions
(call reports), commonly used in bank level studies of the credit channel of monetary transmission
(Kashyap and Stein, 2000; Kishan and Opiela, 2000; Ashcraft, 2006; Bluedorn, Bowdler, and Koch,
2014). We construct entity level measures of bank size by assets (call report variable rcfd2170),
capitalization (rcfd3210), liquidity composed of cash (rcfd0010) and securities (currently rcfd1754
and rcfd1773; see the footnote for historical details).4 We restrict the sample to insured commercial
banks.5 We also remove banks that had been involved in a merger in the previous four quarters.
The data span more than 50 years of entity level data, from 1961 Q4 to 2014 Q3. Bank i assets
(Asset) are normalized within each quarter, to be uniformly distributed between -0.49 and +0.5;
this was done by assigning each bank a percentile ranking, subtracting 50, and then dividing by
100. The bank balance sheet ratios for capitalization (bank capital divided by unweighted total
assets, Equity), the asset portfolio share of bank reserves and cash (Cash) and that of securities
(Securities) were normalized by subtracting the within-quarter mean and dividing by the within-
quarter standard deviation. The last two interactive terms allow for the sensitivity of bank loan
growth to economic policy uncertainty to vary with the relative liquidity of assets across banks.



4       Results from Modeling U.S. Bank Loan Growth

We first review findings from modeling aggregate bank lending, which has the appeal of internaliz-
ing substitution or shifts in lending among banks. Then, results from bank level specifications are
reviewed, which have the advantage of offering stronger evidence of loan supply shift identifica-
tion and limiting observational equivalence by drawing upon individual bank characteristics that
likely proxy for bank level financial constraints. We remove banks involved in mergers in the prior
four quarters. In order to deal with other exceptional movements in the data, we follow Ashcraft
(2006) and Bluedorn, Bowdler, and Koch (2014) in fitting all regressions through OLS for the

4.1     Aggregate Level Results, 1961 – 2014

Results from quarterly models of aggregate, real per capita bank loan growth spanning 1961 Q4
to 2014 Q3 are summarized in Table 1, which reports sums of coefficients on lags of EPU and the
standard errors for each of those sums in the first row. Estimated coefficients are multiplied by
100 so that coefficients represent the loan growth response in terms of basis points. Four models
are presented, starting with a baseline model (Model 1), which only includes lags of loan growth
and EPU. Model 2 also includes lags of changes in the real federal funds rate and real GDP growth
(“nonregulatory controls”), to which Model 3 adds the lagged deposit regulation (RegQ) and the
credit control variable (Ccon), and to which, in turn, Model 4 also adds lags of the Michigan index
of consumer sentiment expectations.6 These models are estimated for four categories of bank
loans, reported in the rows across Table 1 in the following order: total, commercial and industrial
(C&I), real estate, and consumer loans. For each model, the Akaike Information Criterion is used
to choose the common lag length on included variables.
   In each of the four models presented for total loan growth, sums of coefficients on lags of EPU
are jointly significant and negative, indicating a near term depressing effect of economic policy
uncertainty. For total loan growth, this result is robust to including no controls (column 1), two
macro controls (lags of real GDP growth and changes in the real fed funds rate, in column 2),
macro and regulatory controls (a measure of Regulation Q effects and a dummy for the Carter
credit controls of 1980, in column 3), and additionally lags of the forward-looking (expectations)
index of consumer sentiment (column 4). Lags of the change in the real federal funds rates and
those of the deposit regulation and credit control variables were jointly statistically significant,
   6
     This index easily outperformed the insignificant slope of the Treasury yield curve and the percent change in
the index of leading economic indicators.


                                                       11
with estimated negative effects, while lags of consumer sentiment were positively and significantly
correlated with loan growth.
   The estimated effect appears to work primarily through commercial and industrial loans. As
shown in the second row set of results in Table 1, these qualitative and significant results hold up
for C&I loans across all four models. However, the impact of EPU on the particular categories
of real estate and consumer loan growth is generally insignificant, perhaps reflecting the greater
volatility of consumer loans and the longer maturity of real estate loans. The last characteristic
which would tend to make the growth rate of the stock of real estate loans less reflective of recent
conditions than shorter-lived business loans whose loan interest rates also tend to be indexed to
short-term interest rate benchmarks more than real estate loans.


4.2    Bank Level Results, 1961 – 2014

We find substantial heterogeneity in the effects of economic policy uncertainty on different com-
mercial banks. Results from quarterly models of bank level loan growth spanning 1961 Q4 to 2014
Q3 are summarized in Table 2, which presents results from four sets of two models that parallel
the four models in Table 1 for total loans. We present a lag length of four quarters, consistent
with most cross-section studies of bank lending, as the common lag length on included variables.
Table entries report the estimated joint coefficients on the different lags of each variable with the
standard error in parentheses. Models 1 and 2 have no extra controls, with Model 2 differing by
also including interactions of EPU with the relative ranking of banks by asset size, normalized
capitalization, cash share of assets, and the securities’ share of assets. The second set of models (3
and 4) adds lagged real GDP growth rates and changes in the real funds rate, to which the third
set (models 5 and 6) add lags of the Regulation Q and credit control variables and to which, in
turn, the fourth set of models adds the expectation component of the Michigan sentiment index.
In each set, the even numbered model includes the four interactive terms, which are omitted from
the odd-numbered model.
   Comparing across each row of Table 2 reveals a robust pattern of results. For example, the first
row indicates a significant and negative impact of EPU lags with coefficients (multiplied by 100) in


                                                 12
a reasonably similar range, varying between -2.6 and -4.3. The second row reports estimates from
models that explore how these effects relate to bank size. The negative effect of policy uncertainty
is greater in magnitude for larger banks and less in magnitude for smaller banks. This is evidenced
by a negative and significant coefficient on the variable interacting EPU, with an indicator of
relative bank asset size (Assets reflects the percentile ranking of each bank’s asset size in each
quarter) in the second row.
   To interpret the coefficients, recall that bank i assets are normalized within each quarter to be
uniformly distributed between -0.49 and +0.50 (done by assigning each bank a percentile ranking,
subtracting 50, and then dividing by 100). So the coefficients in the right-most column of Table 2
imply that a one hundred point increase in the EPU index, over the course of four quarters, would
reduce the level of lending by the largest banks in the 100th percentile by -4.2 percentage points
(≈ -3.17 + (-1.81 × 0.50)), whereas the smallest banks in the 1st size percentile would only see a
2.3 (≈ -3.17 + (-1.81 × - 0.49)) percentage point fall in lending growth. One explanation for the
size effect is that it may reflect greater importance of national uncertainty for larger banks that
tend to be more geographically diversified than smaller banks.
   The impact of greater capitalization and higher asset-side liquidity with the sensitivity of loan
growth to EPU are highlighted by the third through fifth rows of Table 2. Regardless of the
controls, the variable interacting EPU with a bank’s normalized level of capitalization (third row)
is significant and positive, working to partially offset the direct negative and significant effect of the
sum of coefficients on the non-interacted EPU lags in the first row of Table 2. This pattern implies
that the negative impact of EPU on bank loan growth is significantly smaller as bank capitalization
increases, consistent with the positive capital buffer effect outweighing any negative selection and
the reduced risk-taking incentive effects of higher capitalization. For example, the coefficient in
the third row, right-most column of Table 2 implies that the impact of EPU on the median-sized
bank is -3.17 b.p. with the effect being 0.63 smaller (larger) in size for the banks one standard
deviation above (below) the quarterly cross-sectional mean in terms of their capitalization.
   The role of balance sheet liquidity depends on its type – cash and securities play very different
roles, a fact consistent with findings in Bluedorn, Bowdler, and Koch (2014). The variables inter-



                                                   13
acting EPU with a bank’s rank by asset liquidity are mixed, with the interaction of EPU with
Cash being significant and positive and that with Securities being statistically insignificant, as
reported in the fourth and fifth rows of Table 2, implying that the negative impact of EPU on
bank loan growth is significantly smaller as the cash share of a bank’s assets increases. We find a
shielding effects from cash, but not from securities holdings. For example, the coefficients in the
right-most column of Table 2 imply that the impact of EPU on the median-sized bank is -3.17
b.p. with the effect being 0.25 b.p. smaller (larger) for the banks one standard deviation above
(below) the cross-sectional mean in terms of cash as a share of total assets.
   Table 2 also provides detail on the effects of other variables for these models, finding significant
and positive effects of real GDP growth along with significant and negative expected effects of
changes in the real funds rate, the degree to which Regulation Q was binding, and the credit
controls of 1980. We emphasize that these effects are robust to the inclusion of consumer sentiment,
which has a highly significant and positive coefficient in both models 7 and 8. The robustness of
the bank level findings for total loan growth was assessed for the three large loan categories of C&I,
real estate, and consumer loans using the same eight model specifications of Table 2. To conserve
space, Table 3 reports the findings for EPU and its interactions with bank-specific balance sheet
variables.
   Three general patterns are revealed in Table 3. First, a significant and negative impact of EPU
lags is consistently observed across all the models for each loan category. Second, the qualitative
findings for balance sheet interactions are maintained for three of the four types of variables: EPU
has stronger negative effects on larger-sized banks and less negative effects on banks that are either
more highly capitalized or have higher portfolio shares in cash. Third, the insignificance of EPU
interacted with banks’ portfolio holdings of securities holds up for C&I and consumer loans, but
EPU has significantly less negative effects on real estate lending for banks with greater securities
holdings (the interactive effect is significantly positive). This slight difference may arise because
a more liquid portfolio may induce banks to adjust their holdings of long-maturity real estate
holdings less in response to higher economic policy uncertainty.
   Although the estimated effects of EPU on bank total loan growth are statistically significant,



                                                 14
it is unclear how economically meaningful these effects are from Tables 1 and 2 alone. To gauge
this, we conduct two exercises which measure the extent to which economic uncertainty exceeded
its pre-crisis level of 101.9 in 2007 Q2, just before the turbulence that began in August 2007 when
several hedge funds froze redemptions on subprime-related investments. As shown in Table 4, EPU
averaged 81.0 index points above its 2007 Q2 level from 2007 Q4 to 2011 Q4, 83.1 index points
above that level from 2007 Q4 to 2012 Q4, and 80.7 index points above that level from 2007 Q4
to 2013 Q4. Using the estimated effect of EPU on the median bank with average characteristics
(Model 8 in Table 2) implies that since the start of the Great Recession (2007 Q4), the high levels
of EPU have lowered quarterly, real annualized loan growth by an average of 2.6 percentage points
in each of these periods, as reported in the middle column of Table 3.
   These figures may actually understate the effect during the current recovery because banking
concentration has increased substantially in recent decades (Fernholz and Koch, 2016). During the
recovery about one-half of the banking system’s assets were held at the four largest banks. The
estimates from Model 8 indicate a stronger negative effect of EPU on loan growth at banks in
the top percentile of asset size. As discussed earlier and from inspection of row 2 in Table 3 the
net EPU effect on them equals the -3.17 plus (0.5 × −1.81) for a total of about -4.2. Weighting
marginal increase due to bank size by 50 percent and the median figure by 50 percent implies a
weighted average EPU effect of about -3.62. As shown in the right-most column of Table 4, this
value implies that since the start of the Great Recession (2007 Q4), the high levels of EPU and
combination with the very concentrated bank assets at few large banks have lowered quarterly, real
annualized loan growth by an average of 2.9 percentage points through 2011 Q4, 3.0 percentage
points through 2012 Q4, and 2.9 percentage points through 2013 Q4. These impacts are large
relative to actual real per capita loan growth, which averaged near 0.5 percent in the last period
and a shade below zero percent during the first two of these periods. Our back-of-the-envelop
illustration from Table 4 and our broader historical findings are in line with recent research that
focuses on very specific effects of financial regulatory uncertainty in the aftermath of the Great
Recession for instance on “qualified mortgages” as in Gissler, Oldfather, and Ruffino (2016).

5     Robustness Checks Using Post-1984 Economic Policy

      Uncertainty Series

This section discusses three types of robustness checks. The earlier sections used BBD’s historical,
news-based series. This section presents results from re-estimating the aggregate and bank level
models replacing the historical news-based EPU series first with BBD’s post-1984 total measure
of EPU (EPU1985 ) and secondly with the post-1984 economic policy uncertainty component
that reflects uncertatinty regarding the financial sector (EPUFin). In addition, these findings are
provided for total, C&I, real estate, and consumer loans.


5.1    Aggregate Level Results, 1985 – 2014

Results from quarterly models of aggregate, per capita bank loan growth spanning 1985 Q4-2014
Q3 are summarized in Table 5, which reports sums of coefficients on lags of EPU1985 or EPUFin
and the standard errors for each of those sums in the first row. Estimated coefficients on EPU1985
and EPUFin are multiplied by 100 to normalize them. Models 1, 2, and 4 are repeated from
Table 1 and appear as Models 1-3 for the models using EPU1985 and 4-6 for the models using
EPUFin, respectively. Because the shorter sample occurs after deposit deregulation and the 1980
credit controls, Model 3 from Table 1 corresponds to Models 2 and 5 in Table 5 and Model 4 from
Table 1 corresponds to the post-1984 versions of Models 3 and 6 in Table 5, except that the Table
5 models omit the two regulatory variables. Another difference from Table 1 is that the results
are now reported for four categories of loans: total, C&I, real estate, and consumer. Generally
mirroring the results using the historical EPU series, lags of the post-1984 overall and financial-
sector oriented EPU series have statistically significant and negative effects on aggregate level,
total loan growth, but generally insignificant effects on the three major loan categories. The EPU
series focusing on financial policy uncertainty tended to have effects on total loan growth that
were statistically more significant than the overall EPU series, reflecting much smaller standard
errors. This finding suggests that policy uncertainty effects on bank lending likely emanate from
more financial-related uncertainty rather than reflecting a more general sense of uncertainty which


                                                16
could be more endogenous to the general business cycle.


5.2    Bank Level Results, 1985 – 2014

Bank-level variants of models 1-3 from Table 5 with and without the same set of four interactions
of EPU and bank balance sheet characteristics from Table 2 are presented in models 1-6 in Table
6, where the EPU variable is the new, broader based BBD series (EPU1985 ). In the table, only
coefficients are reported on EPU variables to conserve space, and the models are presented in
four blocks corresponding to total, C&I, real estate, and consumer loans. Table 7 mirrors Table 6
except that it reports results from models replacing EPU1985 with the financial economic policy
uncertainty index, EPUFin. These models are estimated with data spanning 1985 Q1 to 2014
Q3, where the end of the sample corresponds to the availability of the historical news-based EPU
series. (Estimating with data through 2015 Q2 yielded similar results).
   Three general patterns arise across the models in Table 6. First, as with the historical EPU
series, across all models and for each loan category, lags of EPU1985 have negative effects that are
jointly significant, while this variable’s interaction with the relative capital position of a bank has
a positive sign–indicating that EPU has less negative impact on better capitalized banks. Second,
while the interaction of bank asset size with EPU has a negative and jointly significant effect for
total, real estate, and consumer loans, the variable is significant with the opposite signed effect for
C&I loans. Third, in contrast to the historical EPU series that is estimated over a longer sample
with an earlier start date, the interaction of EPU1985 with the variable tracking the relative size
of securities in bank balance sheets is significant and positive using EPU1985, whereas it was
insignificant for models using the historical EPU series.
   The patterns of results in Table 7 using EPUFin more closely match those reported earlier for
using the historical EPU index in several ways. First, lags of EPUFin are jointly significant with
negative effects in every model. Second, for every loan type and in each model, the interaction of
EPUFin with bank asset size tends to reinforce the negative effect of EPU on lending, while the
lags of the the interaction of EPUFin with a bank’s capital position continue to have a significant
and positive coefficient. These results indicate that financial economic policy uncertainty has larger


                                                  17
negative effects on bank loan growth at larger and less-well capitalized banks. Third, the negative
impact of EPUFin is smaller at banks with larger security holdings (the interactive variable has
a positive sign), but this effect is not robust across all models and for every major loan category
assessed. The interaction of EPU with cash holdings continued to be generally insignificant, once
again mirroring the qualitative pattern of findings using the historical newspaper-based EPU series.



6      Economic Policy Uncertainty and Bank Credit Stan-

       dards

To examine EPU ’s links to bank lending and the macroeconomy, we review two types of evidence.
In particular, we analyze the overall impact of historical, newspaper-based EPU shocks in a VAR
and then try to gauge its effects on GDP by relating EPU to the VAR results of Bassett, Chosak,
Driscoll, and Zakrajšek (2014) who assess the impact of changes in bank lending standards on
GDP.
    The impact of EPU innovations is examined in a quarterly VAR which contains, in the following
order, shocks to GDP, the GDP price deflator, the nominal federal funds rate, aggregate bank loans,
and EPU. While Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2015) also analyze the impact of EPU shocks on GDP
in a VAR, the exercise here also examines the bank lending channel. A lag length of 4 is chosen
and the model is estimated over 1965 Q1 – 2014 Q3. Figure 6 depicts the impact of a one-standard
deviation shock to EPU, with peak effects on GDP and bank loans after five and nine quarters,
respectively. A one-standard deviation shock to EPU (about 20 index points) lowers GDP by a
peak effect of about 0.25 percentage point – broadly consistent with the Baker, Bloom, and Davis’s
(2015) findings – and reduces bank loans by as much as 0.5 percentage point on average – which
is consistent with other results presented below. Between 2007 and 2010, the EPU index rose
by about 80 index points – roughly four times a standard deviation shock to the index. Because
some of this 80 point swing is endogenous to other factors in the VAR, it implies an upper limit
of one and two percentage point respective declines in real GDP and bank loans. Of course these
estimated effects on GDP include all the channels through which EPU innovations affect aggregate


                                                18
output.
   To gauge how much may be through the bank lending channel, we draw on Bassett et al.
(2014), who estimate the impact of a diffusion index (DI) of changes in bank lending standards on
GDP, finding that variation in this index accounts for about 20 percent of the variation in GDP
between 1991 and 2012 in a VAR framework. Their index of overall credit standards weights bank
survey responses about changes in credit standards on different loan types–business, consumer,
and real estate (residential and commercial)–by the size of loans on bank balance sheets from Call
Reports. Their series (Figure 7) indicates that credit standards were tightened in the early 2000s
and during the recent housing and financial crisis period. Relevant to our study is whether EPU
helps determine changes in overall bank lending standards as tracked by the Bassett et al. (2014)
DI measure.
   The limited structural evidence on what drives bank credit standards indicates that the deter-
minants suggested by theory are likely to have a contemporaneous rather than a leading effect,
leading some to estimate such effects and then remove them from an index of credit standards (e.g.
Aron et al., 2012). In screening models of credit, such as that of Stiglitz and Weiss (1981), credit
standards should be tightened when the real riskless rate rises and the macroeconomic outlook
worsens. Following Aron et al. (2012), we track the former with the first difference of the real
federal funds rate (∆RF F ), the nominal federal funds rate accounting for the zero lower bound
as discussed earlier using Wu and Xia’s (2014) shadow funds rate, minus the HP-filtered chain
price GDP deflator, and the latter with the two-quarter percent change in the index of leading
economic indicators (∆2 LEI) in our model of the diffusion index of changes in credit standards.
We include three other variables to control for factors affecting loan quality and risk. The first is
the spread between three-month interest rates on financial commercial paper and Treasury bills
(CP T R), which may reflect near-term risk premia for both making and funding bank loans–a
variant of Friedman and Kuttner’s (1998) paper-bill spread. The other two variables track loan
quality at banks and are the year-over-year change in the overall delinquency rate on bank loans
(∆4 DEL, Federal Reserve Board) and the t−1 lag of the two-quarter change in the home mortgage
foreclosure rate (∆2 M F ore), where the extra lag reflects that foreclosure data are released with a



                                                 19
longer lag. Since each of these three reflects greater risk or incidence of problem loans, they are
expected to be positively related to a gauge reflecting tightening bank credit standards, such as
DI. To these we add contemporaneous EPU :

  DIt = β0 + β1 ∆RF Ft + β2 ∆2 LEIt + β3 CP T Rt + β4 ∆4 DELt + β5 ∆2 M F oret−1 + β6 EP Ut (5)

where, except for the constant and β2 , the other β’s are expected to be positive. Estimating the
model from 1991 Q2 to 2014 Q3 with an AR(1) correction yields:

                   DIt = − 0.040 + 0.035∆RF Ft − 0.793∆2 LEIt∗∗ + 0.138CP T Rt∗∗                             (6)

                           (3.21)         (2.64)                (2.02)

   where absolute t-statistics are in parentheses, R2 = 0.901, AR(1) = 0.83** (11.49), equation
standard error = 0.078, LM(2) = 2.51 and Q(24) = 21.55. The coefficients have the expected signs
and all but the change in the real federal funds rate are significant.7
   The positive coefficient on contemporaneous EPU is consistent with economic policy uncer-
tainty inducing tighter credit standards, which after a short lag slows loan growth consistent with
both our finding of a significant impact of 4 lags of EPU on bank loan growth and Bassett, et al.’s
(2014) result that loan growth slightly lags credit standards. We calculate by how much elevated
levels of EPU resulted in tighter-than-otherwise changes in credit standards by multiplying the
estimated coefficient on EPU in equation (6) by the actual levels of EPU minus the average of
the series between 1991 Q1 and 2007 Q2, just before the start of the financial crisis in August
2007. As shown in Figure 7, although economic policy uncertainty had little visible effect on credit
standards during the Great Recession, its elevated levels during the recovery are estimated to have
resulted in less credit standard easing (negative readings in the index) as reflected by the adjusted
line being below the actual.
   When coupled with Basset, et al.’s (2014) finding that a one standard deviation shock to
the credit standard variable lowers GDP by about a maximum of 0.8 percentage points after 10
quarters, our findings suggest that elevated levels of economic policy uncertainty, via the bank
   7
     The insignificance of ∆RF Ft may reflect a short sample and lack of variation from the zero lower bound on
the nominal funds rate. In longer samples, Aron et al. (2012) find that ∆RF Ft is highly significant in a similar
model.

lending channel, restrained GDP growth in the sluggish recovery from the Great Recession. To
provide a rough gauge of the magnitude, note that from just before the financial crisis’s onset,
2007 Q2 to 2010, the EPU index rose 80 points, translating into an estimated .0524 higher average
level of the credit standard index. Scaled by the standard error in the model of equation 6, the rise
in EPU between 2007 and 2010 translates into about a 2/3 of a standard deviation shock to credit
standards. In the model of Bassett et al. (2014), the peak effect of a shock of this magnitude would
lower GDP by about 0.5 percentage points, implying that tighter-than-otherwise credit standards
noticeably restrained economic growth – among other factors8 – during the sluggish recovery from
the Great Recession. Coupled with the earlier VAR results, this suggests that about half of the
impact of EPU on GDP occurs through the bank loan channel.



7       Conclusion
This study finds that economic policy uncertainty is strongly associated with slower real loan
growth at both an aggregate level and across individual banks in the U.S., a qualitative finding
that is robust to the inclusion of a set of significant economic and regulatory control variables
and to using three different indexes from Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2015): their newspaper-based
historical index, their shorter sample but more broadly defined index, and their index focused
on finance-centric economic policy uncertainty. This implies that economic policy uncertainty
affects the economy through a bank lending channel, and is consistent with the interpretation that
the more elevated levels of economic policy uncertainty that tend to accompany recessions and
recoveries restrained bank loan growth and, thus, economic activity.
    Furthermore, the results have nuanced implications for financial reform and financial stability.
These mainly arise from the finding that there is a smaller negative impact of economic policy
uncertainty on loan growth at banks that are well capitalized, with less robust evidence that
uncertainty effects are less negative at banks holding more cash. Most prominently, this evidence
of loan supply side-effects at the level of individual banks suggests that moving to a more highly
capitalized banking system could make economies more resilient to economic policy uncertainty–
this is more so the case if countercyclical capital and liquidity buffer provisions prevent regulations
    8
     For example, uncertainty effects on investment (Bloom, Bond, and Van Reenen, 2007) and hiring (Leduc and
Liu, 2013), and as well as other effects on credit availability (Bassett et al., 2014) and wealth (e.g., Aron et al.,
2012, and Mian and Sufi, 2011).

from having pro-cyclical effects.9 Our results also imply that bank lending growth may have
recently been aided in the U.S. by progress since early 2014 in allaying economic policy uncertainty
following the transition to higher bank capital ratios induced by the Dodd-Frank Act. Because
other studies have found important macro-economic effects of bank lending growth on the macro-
economy,10 our findings are consistent with the view that high economic policy uncertainty may
have slowed the U.S. economic recovery from the Great Recession by restraining overall credit
growth through the bank lending channel.

from tougher regulations could conceivably be offset by negative effects from increased regulation on long-run
growth.

      Source: Bassett, et al. (2014) and authors' calculations. The adjusted index equals the index of credit standards minus the product of the
      estimated coefficient on EPU in eq. (4) and the level of EPU minus its 1991-2007q2 average . The green line being below the black line
      reflects that had EPU not been above its pre-crisis average, credit standards would not have been as tight during the sluggish economic
      recovery from the Great Recession.
