If voters are fully rational and have negligible cognition costs, ballot layout should not affect election
outcomes. In this paper, we explore deviations from rational voting using quasi-random variation in
candidate name placement on ballots from the 2003 California Recall Election. We find that the voteshares
of minor candidates almost double when their names are adjacent to the names of major candidates
on a ballot. Voteshare gains are largest in precincts with high percentages of Democratic, Hispanic,
low-income, non-English speaking, poorly educated, or young voters. A major candidate that attracts
a disproportionate share of voters from these types of precincts faces a systematic electoral disadvantage.
If the Republican frontrunner Arnold Schwarzenegger and Democratic frontrunner Cruz Bustamante
had been in a tie, adjacency misvoting would have given Schwarzenegger an edge of 0.06% of the
voteshare. This gain in voteshare exceeds the margins of victory in the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election
and the 2004 Washington Gubernatorial Election. We explore which voting technology platforms
and brands mitigate misvoting.

I. Introduction

         In this paper, we use the quasi-random variation in layouts of 150 types of ballots used in

the 2003 California Recall Election to study how different ballot designs led to systematic

deviations in the voteshares of candidates. We refer to votes for a candidate that are solely

attributable to that candidate’s favorable position on the ballot as misvotes because differences in

ballot layout should not affect the decisions of fully rational voters.1 Previous literature has

focused on position misvotes – when candidates receive more votes because they are listed first

on the ballot page or column. In this paper, we consider another type of misvote: adjacency

misvotes – when candidates receive more votes because they are adjacent to a popular candidate.

         Adjacency misvotes can occur if voters accidentally select candidates adjacent to their

preferred choices.       Evidence from simulated voting experiments suggests that some voters

become confused by the ballot layout and voting technology and, as a result, cast accidental but

valid votes for candidates adjacent to the intended choice of the voter (e.g., Roth 1998). These

adjacency misvotes are especially likely if the ballot columns are unclearly marked, the ballot

text is small, the punch card grid is confusing, or if voters slip while marking their ballots. See

Appendix 1 for sample ballots that may produce adjacency misvotes.2

         Misvotes are important for two reasons. First, and at a more fundamental level, misvotes

provide insight into human cognition: While Simon’s (1955) seminal article has spurred much

research on the limits of rational decision-making (see Conlisk 1996 for an overview), relatively

few papers examine which types of individuals are most prone to behavioral anomalies. We


1
  We use rational in the traditional sense of the term: someone who has a preference ordering over candidates that is
complete and transitive over the candidates. Implicit in this definition is that choice is not affected by cognition
costs.
2
  It is also conceivable that adjacency misvotes can occur if voters scan quickly for popular candidates and then give
increased consideration to candidates listed near the popular candidate. In Table 3, we show that accidental voting
rather than increased consideration is likely to be the primary cause of adjacency misvotes. However, our findings
hold regardless of which process drives adjacency misvotes.


                                                          1
examine how ballot design alters voting behavior and for which types of voters these effects are

strongest. Following List and Reiley (2002), we assume that the rationality of voter behavior

decreases with the cognitive cost of processing complicated ballot design. We examine how

variation in cognitive costs across demographic groups can affect the probability of casting a

misvote and thereby determine election outcomes. Our paper thus contributes to a relatively new

literature that examines demographic variation in people’s decision-making abilities in real

world situations (e.g., Madrian 2001, Choi et al. 2004, Thaler and Benartzi 2004, and Lusardi

and Mitchell 2006).

       Second, misvotes can change election outcomes. Previous literature on position misvotes

has predominantly focused on who gains from misvotes. King and Leigh (2006), Koppell and

Steen (2004), and Miller and Krosnick (1998) show that candidates gain up to 2% in voteshare if

they are listed near the start of the ballot. However, the gain from being listed near the top of the

candidate list tends to be much smaller in well-publicized elections featuring party labels, and

well-known or incumbent candidates (e.g., Ho and Imai 2005, Koppell and Steen 2004, Miller

and Krosnick 1998, and Taebel 1975). Further, the bias caused by position misvotes can be

minimized if the list of candidate names is randomized and rotated through voting districts as is

done in states such as California, Ohio, and Kansas. Therefore, what often matters more for the

outcome of major U.S. elections is which of the two front-runners systematically loses more

votes to misvotes. This point is perhaps best illustrated by the unexpected large number of votes

that Patrick Buchanan received on the “butterfly ballot” used in Palm Beach County, Florida

during the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election. While even Buchanan himself acknowledges that




                                                 2
most of the 3,407 votes he received in Palm Beach County are due to voter mistakes,3 the bigger

question is whether these misvotes came sufficiently more from Al Gore than from George Bush

to overturn Bush’s 537 vote margin of victory. Numerous studies using demographic trends and

Buchanan’s performance in surrounding counties indicate that this was likely the case (e.g.,

Wand et al. 2001, and Smith 2002).

        Unlike position misvotes, adjacency misvotes can offer insight into differences in

voteshare lost by major candidates. Voteshare gained by a candidate adjacent to a major

candidate is voteshare lost by the associated major candidate. We assess which of the major

candidates disproportionally loses votes to adjacent candidates in two ways. First, we examine

whether minor candidates in the vicinity of one major candidate gain as much voteshare as minor

candidates in the vicinity of another major candidate. Second, we relate the extent of misvoting

in each election precinct to precinct demographic characteristics and estimate whether major

candidates that appeal to voters with certain demographic characteristics lose more votes to

adjacent candidates. To our knowledge we are the first study that does this for a major election,

and both methods indicate that one of the major candidates disproportionally loses votes due to

misvoting.

        We measure adjacency misvoting by exploiting the rotational structure of ballots used in

the 2003 California Recall Election. Candidates in the Recall Election are listed in order

according to a randomized alphabetization in District 1, and then rotated one position at a time in

subsequent districts. Due to the interaction between ballot rotation and each county’s unique

page layout, there exists significant exogenous variation in whether a minor (unpopular)

candidate’s name is adjacent to that of a major (popular) candidate. The increase in voteshare

3
 In an appearance on the “Today” show on November 9, 2000, Buchanan said, “When I took one look at that ballot
on Election Night … it’s very easy for me to see how someone could have voted for me in the belief they voted for
Al Gore.”


                                                        3
experienced by a minor candidate when she is adjacent to a major candidate is an estimate of

adjacency misvoting. We then use precinct-level voting results and demographic data to test if

certain demographic groups are more likely to cast misvotes than others. Finally, we test if,

controlling for demographic characteristics, certain kinds of voting technologies correspond to a

reduction in the level of misvoting.

        The Recall Election has several desirable characteristics. First, California contains a large

number of counties and districts that use a variety of voting technologies and ballot formats,

allowing for maximal variation in whether a minor candidate is adjacent to a major candidate.

Second, California rotates the long list of candidates (135 in total) one candidate at a time by

district. This, again, allows for greater variation in terms of adjacency. Finally, a gubernatorial

election is relatively important and well covered by the media and therefore may offer insights

that can be extended to other major elections.

        We find that the voteshares of minor candidates almost double when their names are

adjacent to the names of major candidates. Misvotes account for at least 0.25 percent of all votes

cast during the Recall Election.4 We find that the amount of misvoting depends on the voting

technology used; punch card technologies yield about twice the level of misvotes compared to

optical scan and touch screen platforms, which confirms findings by Dee (2006). The amount of

misvoting also varies with voter characteristics. Using precinct-level voter registration and

Census data, we find that adjacency misvoting is strongest in precincts with high percentages of

Democratic, Hispanic, low-income, non-English speaking, poorly educated, or young voters.

After controlling for the relative popularities of the two major candidates, we find that the

voteshare lost by the Democratic frontrunner, Cruz Bustamante exceeds the voteshare lost by his


4
  This is a lower bound because we only consider votes gained by candidates immediately adjacent to the top three
frontrunners in our calculation of misvotes.


                                                        4
Republican rival, Arnold Schwarzenegger, by 63%. While Schwarzenegger beat Bustamante by

a comfortable 17.0 percentage points in the Recall Election, the disproportionate misvoting

would have given Schwarzenegger a 0.06% advantage if both had been tied at 47% of the vote.

This margin is larger than the margins of victory in the 2000 U.S. presidential, 2004 Washington

gubernatorial, 1974 New Hampshire senatorial, and 1985 Indiana representative elections.

Schwarzenegger’s advantage over Bustamante is also not much smaller than the margins of

victory in several close U.S. elections including the 1880 and 1884 presidential elections and the

2000 Washington and 1998 Nevada senate elections, all of which had margins of victory of less

than 0.1%.5 Further, our estimate of the difference in voteshare lost by the major candidates

underestimates the difference that might occur in elections in which two major candidates are

adjacent to each other, as is the case in many U.S. presidential elections. In such situations, not

only does one major candidate lose more votes to adjacent candidates, these losses are accrued

by her opponent, thereby exacerbating differences in voteshare.

         Adjacency misvotes pose a unique challenge to policy makers. While candidate list

rotation by district can eliminate the bias posed by positional misvoting, rotation does nothing to

reduce the bias caused by adjacency misvoting. No matter how a candidate list is randomized

across districts, major candidates will continue to lose votes to adjacent candidates. Our results

suggest two strategies that may reduce the level of adjacency misvotes. First, some voting

technologies (electronic voting and certain brands of optical scan ballots) lead to lower levels of

misvoting. Second, we find that adjacency misvotes are most prevalent when it is difficult to

discern which candidate selection box is associated with a given candidate name. For example,

on multi-column ballots, a single candidate name might be bordered by two selection bubbles.

5
 Of course, adjacency misvoting is also present in elections outside the United States. Differences in voteshare lost
by major candidates could have determined outcomes for close international elections such as the 2006 Italian and
Mexican General Elections, both of which were decided by less than 0.1% of the popular vote.


                                                          5
Thus, clearer separation of the selection boxes corresponding to each candidate’s name may

reduce the level of adjacency misvotes.



II. The California Recall Election Dataset

   A statewide special election was held in California on October 7th 2003 concerning the recall

of Governor Gray Davis. Voters were presented with two recall questions:

   1. “Should Gray Davis be recalled (removed) from the office of Governor?” Yes/No
   2. Candidates to succeed Gray Davis as Governor if he is recalled: Vote for one”
      [List of 135 names]

Voters were asked to respond to the second question regardless of their response to the first

question. If more than 50% answer “Yes” to the first question, the candidate with the plurality of

the vote on the second question becomes governor. Perhaps due to the low entry requirements

(one needed only to obtain 65 signatures and pay the $3500 registration fee), a total of 135

candidates ran to replace Governor Gray Davis. The resulting candidate list was extremely

diverse and included such personalities as actor Gary Coleman, erotic actress Mary “Mary

Carey” Cook, and sumo wrestler Kurt E. “Tachikaze” Rightmyer.

       Ballot format in the Recall Election was also extremely diverse. The ballot layout and

technology was determined at the county level (58 counties). The ballot ordering of candidates

varied by assembly district (80 districts). Because multiple counties can lie in the same district

and vice versa, the Recall Election used 157 different ballots (county-district combinations).

Candidates      were       ordered        according     to      a      randomized       alphabet,

“RWQOJMVAHBSGZXNTCIEKUPDYFL” in the first assembly district and then rotated one

candidate at a time by district. Thus, in District 1, the order was alphabetical according to this




                                                6
randomly drawn alphabet: Robinson, Roscoe, Ramirez, …, Leonard. In District 2, Robinson

becomes last, and all others move up by one. This rotation continued through all 80 districts.

         Gray Davis was recalled as Governor of California (55% of voters voted to recall him).

Table 1 shows the distribution of voteshares among the candidates running to replace him. The

top three candidates captured a total 93.56% of the voteshare, leaving an average voteshare of

0.05% for the remaining 132 “minor” candidates. For the remainder of this paper, we consider

the three frontrunners, Arnold Schwarzenegger (R), Cruz Bustamante (D), and Tom McClintock

(R) as major candidates. Inclusion of the next most popular candidate, Peter Camejo, as a major

candidate does not significantly change the baseline results. All candidates other than the top

three are included in the analysis as minor candidates.6

         California uses three types of voting technology platforms: punch card, optical scan, and

touch screen. Punch card technology requires that voters use a stylus to punch out a pre-scored

hole corresponding to the desired candidate. Some forms of punch card technology require that

voters search for the candidate’s number on a separate punch card grid while others place the

pre-scored hole next to the candidate name. Optical scan technology requires that voters fill in an

oval or other marking to the left or right of each candidate’s name. Finally, touch screen

technology requires that voters touch a box on the computer screen in order to select their desired

candidate. After selection, the screen asks the voter to confirm her choice. Technology is

determined at the county level. Approximately 40 percent of all counties use punch card, 40

percent use optical scan and 20 percent use touch screen technology. Each technology platform

has several technology brands. The distribution of each brand is presented in Appendix 2.


6
  Results do not change significantly if (a) Peter Camejo is dropped from the dataset, (b) all observations
representing minor candidates earning more than five percent of the voteshare in a precinct are dropped from the
dataset, or (c) the definition of minor candidates is restricted to include only those candidates in the lower half of the
voteshare distribution.


                                                            7
         We utilize copies of sample ballots mailed to voters for 150 county-district combinations

to code which candidates had which type of advantaged position in each count-district.7 We

obtain precinct-level statements of vote and registration data from the Institute of Governmental

Studies (IGS) at the University of California, Berkeley. The statement of vote data has precinct-

level vote tallies for every candidate.8 The precinct-level registration dataset contains precinct-

level (not individual-specific) registration data such as voter party registration, race, and age

group. Because registration data does not include other important demographic variables such as

income and education, we merge precinct-level data with U.S. Census data from 2000 at the

blockgroup level using conversion files available from IGS. Summary statistics of these

demographic variables are available in Appendix 2.



III. Empirical Strategy

         In general, it is difficult to measure the level of adjacency misvotes because misvotes are

recorded as valid votes. This may be the reason why previous literature (e.g., Alvarez et al. 2001

and Brady et al. 2001) has predominantly focused on the residual vote – votes that are discarded

because of hanging chads or other mismarkings. To our knowledge, Dee’s (2006) innovative

paper is the only paper that analyzes adjacency misvotes directly. Dee argues that the positive

correlation between the voteshares of a major candidate and the voteshares of “bookend

candidates” – minor candidates listed immediately before or after the major candidate – is

evidence of voting mistakes. Dee shows that voteshares of bookends increase by roughly 1/1000



7
  The actual ballots used during Election Day are identical in layout to the sample ballots. In the case of touch screen
technology, voters viewed electronic screens which displayed candidate names in the same layout as that presented
on the sample paper ballots. We have been unable to collect sample ballots from Stanislaus and Imperial Counties
(which account for 1.4% of the vote).
8
  Precinct-level data from IGS is at present incomplete. Full statement of vote and registration data along with
matching files account for 84% of all votes cast in the Recall Election.


                                                           8
of a percentage point for every percentage point increase in the adjacent major candidate’s

voteshare. However, Dee restricts his analysis to candidates who are almost always adjacent to

major candidates and therefore cannot test voteshare gains caused by variation in when a minor

candidate is adjacent to a major candidate. Thus, the critical assumption behind his results is that

the voteshares of the four bookends are not correlated with the voteshares of major candidates

due to reasons other than misvotes. However, this assumption may be reasonable in the context

of Dee’s paper, which focuses on which technologies mitigate misvoting rather than which

demographic groups are most prone to misvoting and how misvotes can affect elections.

Consistent with our findings, he finds that punch card technologies lead to significantly higher

levels of misvoting.

       To better capture variation in adjacency, we define an adjacent candidate as any minor

candidate that vertically or horizontally borders a major candidate on a particular ballot (see

sample ballots in Appendix 1). We call these adjacent candidates north, south, east, and west

adjacent following a standard compass diagram. For example, the candidate directly above a

major candidate is north adjacent. Identification of adjacency misvoting results from random

variation in when a minor candidate is an adjacent candidate. North and south adjacent

candidates are identified due to candidate name rotation through page and column breaks.

Because north and south adjacent candidates are located in the same column as the major

candidate, they are always present and the same unless column and page breaks cause the major

candidate to be listed at the top or bottom of a column. For example, minor candidates Burton

and Bly-Chester are listed before and after major candidate Bustamante according to the

candidate name list. They are always north and south adjacent unless they are separated from

Bustamante by a page or column break.




                                                 9
        Identification of east and west adjacent candidates occurs because column length varies

by county. In the sixty percent of counties that use multi-column ballots, the candidates

horizontally adjacent to the major candidates depend on the county’s column length. For

example, if Schwarzenegger is listed in the middle column on a three-column ballot, he has east

and west adjacent candidates. If Schwarzenegger is listed in the left-most column on a two-

column ballot, he only has an east adjacent candidate. Further, this east adjacent candidate may

not be the same east adjacent candidate as in the previous ballot if the two ballots have columns

of differing lengths. Statistics describing the identification of each type of adjacent candidate are

available in Appendix 2.9

        Combining district-level candidate name rotation and county-level variation in ballot

layout, we identify 68 minor candidates that are adjacent to a major candidate in some but not all

county-districts. We use this variation to answer the following four questions:

        1. Is there evidence of voter irrationality as measured by increased voteshares of minor
             candidates located in favorable positions?
        2. How does misvoting affect the relative voteshares of major candidates?
        3. What demographic characteristics correlate with the amount of misvoting?
        4. What voting technologies correspond to a reduction in the level of misvotes?

To examine adjacency misvoting, we use the following baseline specification:

(I)     Votesharepdc = β0 + β1×Adjacentpdcm + controls + εpdc ,

        where

        Adjacentpdcm ≡ Idcadjacent × Major Candidate Votesharepdcm


9
  We also identify a special class of adjacent candidates with numbers located in squares adjacent to the number
corresponding to the major candidate on a punch card (See Appendix 1). These punch card adjacent candidates only
exist in the 19% of counties that use the Votomatic or Pollstar brands of voting machines. Because column length in
the punch card grid differs from column length in the ballot text, a candidate can be punch card adjacent without
being adjacent on the regular ballot and vice versa.


                                                        10
An observation is a minor candidate c in a precinct p, with voting technology and ballot layout

varying by county-district d. Each observation is weighted by the number of votes cast in

precinct p.10 Votesharepdc is defined as the share of votes candidate c receives in precinct p in

county-district d. We do not use the log of voteshare as the dependent variable because the

voteshare gained by an adjacent candidate should be a level effect, and should not depend on the

average voteshare of the minor candidate.11 Idcadjacent is a dummy variable equaling one if

candidate c is adjacent to a major candidate in county-district d. In modifications of the baseline

regression, Idcadjacent may represent specific types of candidate adjacency (e.g., the minor

candidate listed directly above major candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger) or a vector representing

several types of candidate adjacency. If minor candidate c is adjacent to a major candidate in

precinct p in county-district d, then Major Candidate Votesharepdcm equals the voteshare in

precinct p of the major candidate m to whom the minor candidate is adjacent. Adjacentpdcm is

defined as the product of Idcadjacent and Major Candidate Votesharepdcm. Finally εpdc is an error

term that we allow to be clustered by county-district-candidate because the primary right hand

side variable of interest, Idcadjacent, is constant within a county-district for a given minor candidate.




10
   Weights account for the fact that an observation representing a large precinct is more precise because it is an
average taken from a larger sample of voters. Thus, larger precincts should be weighted more heavily in the
regression.
11
   This is verified empirically by a regression of minor candidate voteshare on a dummy variable equaling one if the
minor candidate is adjacent to a major candidate and an interaction term between the dummy variable and the
precinct-level voteshare of the minor candidate. The coefficient on the interaction term is insignificant and close to
zero.


                                                         11
         In the baseline specification, β1 represents the gain in voteshare experienced by an

adjacent minor candidate when the corresponding major candidate’s voteshare increases by one.

In other words, β1 measures the percentage of voters originally intending to vote for a major

candidate that end up voting for each adjacent minor candidate. (The total percentage of voters

that misvote is not β1 but rather the product of β1 and the average number of minor candidates

adjacent to major candidates per ballot.) Implicit in this interpretation of β1 is that adjacency

misvoting is a positive function of the popularity of the associated major candidate; i.e. if

Schwarzenegger is more popular in precinct A than in precinct B and Schwarzenegger’s voters

are equally likely to misvote in precincts A and B, then candidates adjacent to Schwarzenegger

should gain more voteshare in precinct A than in precinct B.

         Our sample consists of observations at the candidate-precinct level. There are 132 data

points per precinct, one for each minor candidate. This results in a total of 1,817,904

observations, covering 13,772 precincts corresponding to 80 districts and 55 counties.

         We also introduce the following set of controls to the baseline regression and all

extensions of the baseline regression: candidate ballot location controls (dummy variables for

first and last on the ballot overall, ballot page, and ballot column), candidate fixed effects,

candidate fixed effects interacted with demographic controls, and candidate fixed effects

interacted with the voteshares of the major candidates.12 Altogether, 2250 control variables are

included in our baseline specification to ensure correct identification of adjacency misvoting.

         The ballot location controls are county-district-candidate-level dummy variables that

equal one if the minor candidate is located first or last overall, on a page, or in a column on the


12
  The addition of county-district fixed effect does not significantly change baseline results. They are omitted from
the analysis in order to reduce computational demands on statistical software. Because the dependent variables sum
to the total voteshare of minor candidates, county-district fixed effects only control for the relative popularity of all
minor candidates compared to major candidates in each county-district.


                                                           12
ballot. These ballot position controls ensure that adjacency misvotes are not incorrectly identified

off of position misvotes. The candidate fixed effects control for differences in the popularity of

minor candidates that could lead to bias if relatively popular minor candidates happen to be

adjacent to major candidates on a disproportionate share of the ballots. We also control for

candidate fixed effects interacted with precinct-level demographic characteristics. This controls

for how precinct-level demographic characteristics influence the popularity of each minor

candidate. It ensures that adjacency misvoting is not incorrectly identified from precinct

demographic characteristics, which, by chance, might favor candidates that are adjacent in that

precinct. Similarly we control for candidate fixed effects interacted with the precinct-level

voteshare of each major candidate to control for the correlation between the popularity of each

minor candidate and the popularity of the major candidates.

       In the Results section, we introduce several modifications of the baseline specification to

check the robustness of the baseline results. We also further explore adjacency misvoting as it

relates to voteshare lost by the major candidates, precinct-level demographic characteristics, and

voting technology.



IV. Results


1. The Baseline Result

       Regression (1) in Table 2 shows the results of the baseline specification. It is a least

squares regression of precinct-level voteshares of each minor candidate on Adjacent, a variable

equal to the voteshare of the associated major candidate if the minor candidate is adjacent to a

major candidate and zero otherwise. Because voteshares of major candidates are expressed as

fractions and voteshares of minor candidates as percentages, the coefficient on Adjacent



                                                13
represents the percentage of voters that misvote for each minor candidate adjacent to their

preferred major candidate. Regression (1) reveals that each minor candidate adjacent to a major

candidate will experience an increase in votes equal to 0.104% of the intended votes for that

major candidate. This result is significant at the one percent level and is clear evidence of the

bounded rationality of some voters.

       Regression (2) in Table 2 decomposes adjacency misvoting by major candidate. It shows

a regression of minor candidate voteshare on the interaction between Adjacent and a vector of

dummy variables representing each major candidate. It shows that Bustamante loses 0.143% of

his vote to each of his adjacent minor candidates, but that the corresponding figure is only

0.088% for Schwarzenegger and 0.107% for McClintock. This result is striking because it

implies that Bustamante voters are 63% more likely to misvote than are Schwarzenegger voters.

Thus, if Bustamante had received as high a voteshare as Schwarzenegger, Bustamante’s adjacent

candidates would have gained 63% more misvotes relative to Schwarzenegger’s adjacent

candidates. This result has important consequences because voteshare gained by an adjacent

candidate is voteshare lost by the associated major candidate. In later regressions, we present

evidence that Bustamante lost more votes than the other major candidates because he attracted

voters from demographic groups associated with high levels of misvoting.

       Regression (3) in Table 1 shows a variation of the baseline regression in which minor

candidate voteshare is regressed on Adjacent Dummy, a dummy variable equaling one if a

candidate is adjacent to a major candidate. The coefficient on Adjacent Dummy represents the

average gain in voteshare a minor candidate experiences when she is adjacent to a major

candidate. Results show that minor candidates gain 0.037 percentage points in voteshare if they

are adjacent to a major candidate. Given that the average voteshare of minor candidates is 0.05%




                                               14
percent, being adjacent to a major candidate nearly doubles a minor candidate’s voteshare. A

calculation taking into account the magnitude of adjacency misvoting for each type of adjacency

(i.e. north, south, east, and west), along with the average number of adjacent candidates per

ballot (see Appendix 3), reveals that misvotes accounted for at least 0.25% (SE=0.03%) of all

votes cast in the Recall Election. Further, if Schwarzenegger and Bustamante had received equal

shares of the votes received by the major candidates, misvotes would have given

Schwarzenegger an edge of 0.06%.

       Table 3 presents a series of regressions that support the robustness of our primary

findings. Regression (1) in Table 3 shows a regression of minor candidate voteshare on Adjacent

Dummy, a dummy variable equaling one if a minor candidate is adjacent to one of the major

candidates and Adjacent, equal to the product of Adjacent Dummy and the precinct-level

voteshare of an adjacent candidate’s associated major candidate. Regression (1) tests our

assumption that adjacent candidates gain voteshare as a positive function of the popularity of the

major candidate. Results suggest that our assumption is valid – adjacent candidates earn only

0.010 percentage points in voteshare (a result that is not significantly different from zero at the

10% level) if they are adjacent to a major candidate that earns zero voteshare in a precinct.

Further, adjacent candidates gain an additional 0.00082 percentage points for each additional

percentage point gained by a major candidate. This result is significant at the 1% level.

       Regression (2) in Table 3 tests that our primary results are driven by variation in when a

candidate is adjacent to a major candidate rather than by variation in the voteshares of associated

major candidates. Instead of regressing minor candidate voteshare on the product of an adjacency

dummy and the precinct-level voteshares of associated major candidates, Regression (2) uses the

product of an adjacency dummy and the statewide voteshares of the associated major candidates




                                                15
as the independent variable. By substituting statewide major candidate voteshare for precinct-

level voteshare, we retain our assumption that adjacent candidates should gain more votes when

they border more popular major candidates. However, now the only variation in the independent

variable is caused by the adjacency of minor candidates to major candidates. The coefficient on

Adjacent Dummy×CA Voteshare is 0.112 and significant at the 1% level. More importantly, it is

very similar in magnitude to the coefficient of 0.104 on Adjacent in Regression (1) of Table 1,

confirming that our results are driven by variation in the adjacency status of minor candidates.

       Regression (3) in Table 3 decomposes adjacency misvoting by type of adjacency. We

define a minor candidate to be adjacent if she borders a major candidate to the north, south, east

or west. This regression shows that misvoting is strongest when a minor candidate is east

adjacent and weakest when a minor candidate is west adjacent; 0.143% of voters misvote for east

adjacent candidates, only 0.038% of voters misvote for west adjacent candidates, while 0.082%

and 0.111% of voters misvote for north and south adjacent candidates respectively. We explore

why east adjacent candidates gain more in voteshare than west adjacent candidates in our

discussion of Regression (6). For now, we note that Regression (3) shows that adjacency

misvoting is not driven merely by name confusion. One might think that voters vote for north

and south adjacent candidates because candidates are listed in order (according to a randomized

alphabet) down a column. For example, on the majority of ballots, the south adjacent candidate

for Arnold Schwarzenegger is George Schwartzman. Voters may mistakenly vote for

Schwartzman because his last name somewhat resembles “Schwarzenegger.” We use candidate

fixed effects to control for the direct effect of name confusion, but one might believe that it is the

interaction between name confusion and adjacency that drives adjacency misvotes. However,

east and west adjacent candidates are one column off from a major candidate and therefore have




                                                 16
last names that are dissimilar to the names of their associated major candidates. The fact that

these adjacent candidates also gain voteshare of comparable magnitude suggests that it is

adjacency rather than name confusion that drives adjacency misvotes.

       Regression (4) in Table 3 explores the voteshare gained by candidates that are diagonally

adjacent to major candidates. Diagonally adjacent candidates are one row and one column off

from their associated major candidate. Regression (4) shows that diagonally adjacent candidates

earn much less in voteshare than candidates that are horizontally or vertically adjacent. 0.002%

of voters misvote for each diagonally adjacent candidate compared to the 0.104% of voters that

misvote for each vertically or horizontally adjacent candidate. Further, the coefficient on

Diagonally Adjacent is not significant at the 10% level. Low voteshare gains for diagonally

adjacent candidates likely occur because voters are less likely to misvote for candidates one row

and one column removed from their intended choices. Because diagonally adjacent candidates

gain very little in voteshare, we restrict our analysis to vertically or horizontally adjacent

candidates.

       Regressions (5) and (6) offer insight into what causes misvotes. We find that misvotes are

primarily caused by accidental mistakes rather than the increased consideration voters may give

to candidates adjacent to their preferred major candidates. Regression (5) in Table 3 explores

misvoting for candidates adjacent to major candidates on punch cards. Nineteen percent of

counties in California used punch card voting machines that require each voter to search for her

desired candidate and that candidate’s associated number from a booklet of candidate names.

Each voter then punched out the desired candidate’s number on a separate punch card. A sample

punch card is provided in Appendix 1. Because the length of columns on the punch card differs

from column length in the text ballot, a minor candidate can be punch card adjacent without




                                               17
being adjacent on a regular ballot and vice versa. The punch card lists only numbers, so

voteshare gained by punch card adjacent candidates should represent gains due to voting

mistakes. Voters are unlikely to first locate a preferred major candidate and then to give

increased consideration to numbers adjacent to the major candidate’s number if they do not see

any names associated with those numbers. Regression (5) shows that, controlling for the

adjacency of minor candidates on the regular ballot, 0.030% of voters misvote for each punch

card adjacent candidate. This result is only significant at the ten percent level, perhaps because

our limited observations involving punch card adjacency do not have enough power to yield

significant results. Nevertheless, this result supports our hypothesis that adjacency misvotes do

not derive only from increased consideration of adjacent candidates.

       Regression (6) in Table 3 presents additional evidence that adjacency misvotes are driven

by accidental votes rather than by increased consideration of adjacent candidates. We regress

minor candidate voteshare on Adjacent and Adjacent×Confusing Side. Confusing Side is a

dummy variable equaling one if the minor candidate is horizontally adjacent to a major candidate

and listed in the column with selection boxes closest to the name of the major candidate. For

example, in a single row, we might read from left to right: bubble, minor candidate, bubble,

major candidate, bubble, minor candidate. See the figures in Appendix 1 for examples. In this

case, the bubble for the east adjacent candidate is very close to the name of the major candidate

and a voter may accidentally fill in the east adjacent candidate’s bubble believing that she has

cast a vote for the major candidate. Thus, confusing side equals one if a horizontally adjacent

candidate is listed in a position that may be most confusing to the voter. After controlling for the

effects of north and south adjacency, we find that the coefficient on Horizontally Adjacent is

0.031 while the coefficient on Horizontally Adjacent×Confusing side is 0.123. This implies that




                                                18
0.031% of voters misvote for each horizontally adjacent candidates not on the confusing side

while 0.031%+0.123%=0.154% of voters misvote for each horizontally adjacent candidate on

the confusing side. Thus, voters are five times more likely to misvote for candidates listed on the

confusing side. This implies that adjacency misvotes are, in large part, driven by accidental

voting mistakes, because increased consideration should not depend on how each candidate’s

bubble is located relative to the major candidates. Regression (6) may also explain why the

coefficient on East Adjacent is stronger than the coefficient on West Adjacent in Regression (3).

For 63% of the multi-column ballots used in the Recall Election, selection boxes were placed to

the left of each candidate’s name. Therefore, the selection boxes of east adjacent candidates were

usually closest to the names of the major candidates.

         Regression (6) also delivers clear policy implications. Adjacency misvoting is extremely

high in cases when it is ambiguous which selection boxes correspond to each candidate’s name.

Therefore, adjacency misvoting may be reduced if columns and rows are spaced farther apart, so

that there is a clear separation between the each candidate’s selection box and all other selection

boxes.


2. Demographic Characteristics

         The cognitive costs of voting, given complex ballot designs and voting technology, may

be higher among certain demographic groups than others. This leads to systematic disadvantages

for major candidates that attract groups more likely to misvote. Below, we show how the amount

of misvoting varies with precinct-level demographic characteristics. We find that voters from

precincts with high misvote rates disproportionally favored Democratic candidate Cruz

Bustamante and that voter demographics may explain why Bustamante lost a higher proportion

of his votes to adjacent candidates than did Schwarzenegger or McClintock.



                                                19
        A growing literature suggests that the level of residual votes, i.e. votes that are discarded

because voters vote for more than one candidate, leave hanging chads, etc., depends on the racial

and socioeconomic composition of each precinct. Tomz and Van Houweling (2003) use precinct-

level data from South Carolina and Louisiana’s 2000 Presidential Election to find that in areas

with punch card or optically scanned ballots, the Black-White gap in residual voteshare ranged

from four to six percentage points. In comparison, lever and touch screen machines cut the gap in

residual voteshares by a factor of ten. Tomz and Van Houweling do not control for income,

education, and other demographic variables in their analysis. However, even controlling for

socioeconomic differences, the racial gap remains significant. Knack and Kropf (2003) use

county-level data from the 1996 Presidential Election to find that counties with more Black or

Hispanic voters have higher residual vote tallies, controlling for income, education and voting

technology.

        To our knowledge, no research has yet explored how the prevalence of misvoting varies

by demographic characteristics. To test how misvoting varies by precinct-level demographic

characteristics, we interact the variable Adjacent with precinct-level demographic characteristics

Demopd, and add this interaction to the baseline specification.13 If Demopd represents a single

variable, then the coefficient on Adjacent×Demopd represents the additional gain in voteshare

caused by adjacency misvoting when Demopd and all other demographic variables positively

correlated with Demopd increases. Meanwhile, if Demopd represents a vector of demographic

characteristics, the coefficients on Adjacent×Demopd represent the marginal change in the gain in

voteshare caused by adjacency misvotes for an increase in each demographic variable, holding

the other measured demographic variables constant. This distinction is important in cases in


13
  The direct effect of Demopd is absorbed by the Demopd×candidate fixed effects interactions that are already
included in the baseline specification.


                                                        20
which the partial effect differs from the overall change. For example, we find that adjacency

misvoting is stronger in precincts with many registered Democrats. However, this overall effect

is driven by the fact that many registered Democrats have other characteristics (such as less

education) that may cause them to make more voting mistakes. If we hold these characteristics

constant, we find that the partial effect of a greater percentage of registered Democrats does not

increase misvoting.

       When exploring the impact of demographic characteristics on adjacency misvoting, we

use the same set of controls as in baseline specification. In addition, we control for Demopd,

Techd and Adjacent×Techd where Techd is a vector of technology dummy variables representing

the brand of technology used in each county-district. The controls for technology ensure that our

demographic estimates are not biased because of a possible correlation between precinct-level

demographic characteristics and the voting technology of the precinct’s corresponding county.

       There are two caveats to the demographic results. First, even if a demographic

characteristic such as low education is correlated with higher levels of misvoting, lack of

education may not be the cause of adjacency misvotes. For example, it is conceivable that

education is positively correlated with experience taking standardized exams, and experience

with standardized exams is what truly reduces levels of misvoting. Second, the ecological

fallacy, as explained by Achen and Shively (1995), states that analysis using precinct-level data

does not necessarily imply direct links between individual demographics characteristics and the

magnitude of adjacency misvoting. For example, a regression might show that a precinct with a

60% Asian and 40% White population casts misvotes at a higher rate than does a precinct with a

10% Asian population and a 90% White population. This does not necessarily imply that Asian

voters are more likely to cast misvotes. It could instead be the case that the White voters who




                                               21
choose to live in predominantly Asian precincts cast misvotes at a higher rate. Nevertheless, we

argue that precinct-level demographic data offers important insights. Precinct-level demographic

data reveal which types of precincts exhibit stronger adjacency misvoting.

       Regression (1) in Table 4 shows that a one percentage point increase in the number of

voters with a high school degree corresponds to a 0.0062 percentage point fall in the percentage

of voters that misvote for each adjacent candidate. This result is significant at the five percent

level. The coefficient on Adjacent×%College Graduates is similar with value of -0.0056,

suggesting that, holding high school education constant, college education has no additional

impact on misvoting. Thus, precincts with high percentages of high school graduates (including

college graduates) cast significantly fewer misvotes. The calculations in the last three columns of

Table 4 show the difference in the percentage of voters that vote for each adjacent candidate for

precincts at the 5th percentile of a demographic variable compared to precincts at the 95th

percentile. Holding the fraction with a college education constant, the percentage of voters that

misvote for each adjacent candidate is 0.22 percentage points lower in precincts at the 95th

percentile of high school education than in precincts at the 5th percentile. This difference is

double the average percentage of voters that misvote for each adjacent candidate. This result is

consistent with evidence from Lusardi and Mitchell (2006) and Benjamin et al. (2006). Lusardi

and Mitchell also find that lack of education is a strong predictor of making mistakes, but in the

context of simple questions about interest, inflation and risk diversification. Benjamin et al.

present experimental evidence that lower cognitive ability, rather than lack of schooling per se, is

a powerful predictor of behavioral anomalies.

       Regression (2) in table 4 shows that, holding the percentage of precinct residents that are

Black and Asian constant, a one percentage point increase in the number of Hispanic residents




                                                22
corresponds to a 0.0038 percentage point increase in the percentage of voters that misvote for

each adjacent candidate. This result is significant at the one percent level. Meanwhile, the

coefficients on Adjacent×%Black and Adjacent×%Asian are small with standard errors near

zero, implying that precincts with high percentages of Black or Asian residents do not behave

significantly differently from precincts with high percentages of White residents (the omitted

category). Holding the percentage of Black and Asian residents constant, the percentage of

voters that misvote for each adjacent candidate is 0.23 percentage points higher in precincts at

the 95th percentile of percent Hispanic than in precincts at the 5th percentile. This difference is

also double the average percentage of voters that misvote for each adjacent candidate.

       Regression (3) in table 4 shows how misvoting varies by the party registration of voters.

The coefficients on Adjacent×%Republican and Adjacent×%Independent are -0.0025 and -

0.0068, respectively, while the coefficient on Adjacent×%Other Party is not significantly

different from zero. Since the omitted category is %Democrat, these results show that precincts

with high percentages of Republican or Independent voters misvote at significantly lower rates

than precincts with high percentages of Democratic or Other Party voters. A one percentage

point increase in the number of registered Republicans corresponds to a 0.0025% point fall in the

percentage of voters that misvote for each adjacent candidate. Holding the percentage of

Independent and Other Party voters constant, the percentage of voters that misvote for each

adjacent candidate is 0.128 percentage points lower in precincts at the 95th percentile of percent

Republican than in precincts at the 5th percentile. Similarly, holding the percentage of

Republican and Other Party constant, the percentage of voters that misvote for each adjacent

candidate is 0.170 percentage points lower in precincts at the 95th percentile of percent




                                                23
Independent than in precincts at the 5th percentile. These differences are greater than the average

percentage of voters that misvote for each adjacent candidate.

         Table 5 presents regressions exploring how adjacency misvotes vary with five other

precinct-level demographic variables: median household income in thousands of U.S. dollars,

percent living below the Census poverty line, percent lacking English fluency, percent over the

age of 65, and percent between the ages of 18 and 24. All specifications show a significant

coefficient on the interaction term, Adjacent×X where X represents the demographic

characteristic of interest. These coefficients imply that precincts with high percentages of

residents between the ages of 18 and 24, living below the poverty line, or lacking fluency in

English14 exhibit higher levels of misvoting. Precincts with high percentages of residents above

the age of 65 also exhibit higher levels of misvoting, although the effect is smaller than for the

other characteristics.15 Conversely, precincts with high median household income exhibit low

levels of misvoting. Calculations in the last three rows of Table 5 estimate the difference in the

magnitude of adjacency misvoting between precincts at the 5th and 95th percentile in terms of X,

the demographic variable of interest.              These calculations reveal that differences in these

demographic characteristics correspond to large changes in the magnitude of adjacency

misvoting. The results for low income precincts are consistent with Madrian and Shea (2001),

Choi et al. (2004), and Thaler and Benartzi (2004), who in different settings, find that lower-


14
   We also test how the relationship between the percentage of voters lacking English fluency and adjacency
misvoting changes conditional on the availability of foreign language ballots. During the Recall Election, 80% of
precincts offered Spanish ballots while 40% of precincts offered ballots in at least one Asian language. Results show
that adjacency misvoting is stronger in precincts that offer Spanish ballots. In addition, the availability of foreign
language ballots does not significantly change the relationship between English fluency and adjacency misvotes.
However, it is difficult to draw causal conclusions from these results because the availability of foreign language
ballots is endogenously determined by each county.
15
   Age 65 was chosen as the cutoff because voter registration data does not distinguish age groups for ages greater
than 65. Voter registration data may provide a better estimate of actual voter demographics than Census data
because a higher percentage of registered voters vote on Election Day. However, results do not significantly change
using older age cutoffs derived from Census data.


                                                         24
income employees are more likely to conform to the default savings options by their employers,

which is likely because these employees have a higher cognition cost of making the optimal

savings decisions.

         Table 6 shows the results of a regression of minor candidate voteshare on Adjacent and

the interaction between Adjacent and a vector of precinct-level demographics. The coefficients

on the interaction terms are partial effects; they represent the change in the magnitude of

adjacency misvoting for a change in a single demographic characteristic when the other

demographic characteristics are held constant. We find that the partial effect of the percentage of

registered Democrats is not significantly different from the partial effects of other political

affiliations.16 Altogether, the demographic interactions show that misvoting increases with the

fraction Hispanic or Asian, the fraction elderly and the fraction in poverty, while it decreases

with the fraction with at least a high school degree, and the fraction lacking English fluency.17

         These demographic trends shed light on why, relative to Schwarzenegger and

McClintock, Bustamante lost more votes to adjacent candidates. If the three candidates had been

equally popular, Bustamante would have lost 63% more votes than Schwarzenegger and 34%

more votes than McClintock. Using demographic trends, we estimate how much of the

difference in voteshare lost by each major candidate can be accounted for by differences in the

demographic characteristics of each major candidate’s voting base.18 We find that, compared to


16
   The percentage of voters registered with the Democratic Party is negatively correlated with median household
income and the percentage of residents with high school diplomas, both of which are associated with lower levels of
misvoting. This explains why the percentage of registered democratic voters has a positive overall effect on
misvoting (Table 4) but a non-significant partial effect (Table 6).
17
   The percentage of voters lacking English fluency is negatively correlated with income and education. Further,
over 80% of voters had access to foreign language ballots. This may explain why the percentage of voters lacking
English fluency has a positive overall effect on misvoting (Table 5) but a negative partial effect (Table 6).
18
   We first estimate the number of misvotes cast in each precinct using each precinct’s demographic characteristics.
The estimated number of misvotes in each precinct multiplied by each major candidate’s performance in a precinct
(as a fraction of the total votes for the three major candidates) is an estimate of the number of misvotes lost by each
major candidate. After adjusting for the relative popularities of the major candidates, we find that demographic


                                                          25
Schwarzenegger and McClintock, Bustamante attracted voters most likely to misvote.

Differences in the observed demographic characteristics of each major candidate’s voting base

can explain roughly one half of the difference in voteshare lost. Our calculation is actually a

lower bound for the explanatory power of demographic characteristics. Since our data is at the

precinct level, we need to assume that, within a precinct, Schwarzenegger, Bustamante, and

McClintock voters are equally likely to misvote for adjacent candidates. This is likely to be false

– within a precinct, Bustamante voters are probably more likely to cast misvotes. Therefore, we

underestimate the extent to which demographic characteristics can account for differences in

voteshares lost by the major candidates.




3. Voting Technology

        Numerous studies and policy initiatives have explored the effect of voting technology on

the number of discarded ballots, also known as residual votes. These studies consistently find

that, relative to optical scan and electronic technology platforms, the punch card technology

platform is associated with the greatest number of residual votes. Brady et al. (2001) summarizes

the current research relating to voting technology. On average, residual votes account for two

percent of all votes in presidential races. Using county-level data from the 2000 U.S. Presidential

Election, Brady et al. find that touch screen and optical scan voting technology yield half the

level of residual votes found in elections using punch card technology. Alvarez et al. (2001)

employ similar methods to find results generally consistent with those of Brady et al.




characteristics predict that Bustamante lost 24% more votes than Schwarzenegger and 19% more votes than
McClintock. Thus demographic characteristics can account for at least 39% of the difference in votes lost by
Bustamante and Schwarzenegger and 57% of the difference in votes lost by Bustamante and McClintock.


                                                        26
       While numerous studies have explored the relationship between technology and the

residual vote, much less research has explored the relationship between technology and

adjacency misvotes. Dee (2006) finds that punch card technology increases the voteshare gained

by “bookend” candidates, i.e. candidates vertically adjacent to major candidates. Using county-

level data from the 2003 California Recall election, Dee shows that, relative to touch screen and

optical scan technology, punch card technology increases the voteshare of bookends by 0.04

percentage points on average, an increase of more than one-third of the mean voteshare of the

bookends. We extend Dee’s analysis to a precinct-level dataset that measures adjacency misvotes

based upon variation in when candidates are vertically and horizontally adjacent to major

candidates. We also extend Dee’s analysis by exploring whether technology differences are

driven by platforms (i.e. punch card) or by individual technology brands. Further, we control for

precinct-level demographic characteristics – this will better control for the possibility that

technology is correlated with demographic characteristics that influence misvoting.

       To study the relationship between technology and adjacency misvoting, we interact the

variable Adjacent with a vector of technology dummies Techd representing technology platforms

or technology brands. We add this interaction and Techd itself to the baseline specification. By

platform of technology, we refer to broad categories of technology such as touch screen, punch

card, or optical scan technology. By brands of technology, we refer to specific brands of voting

machines, e.g., the Diebold AccuVote-TS that uses the touch screen technology platform. For a

summary of the availability of each type of technology, see Appendix 1. In addition to the large

set of controls included in the baseline regression, we now add controls for Adjacent×Demopd,

where Demopd is a vector of precinct-level demographic variables. This specification controls for




                                               27
the possibility that voting technology is correlated with precinct-level demographic variables and

separates technology effects from demographic effects.

       Regression (2) in Table 7 shows the relationship between voting technology platform and

adjacency misvoting. Our results indicate that 0.197% of voters using punch card technology

misvote for each adjacent candidate compared to only 0.100% and 0.065% of voters using

optical scan and touch screen technology respectively. Further, the coefficient on

Adjacent×Punch Card is significantly different from the coefficients on Adjacent×Optical Scan

and Adjacent×Touch Screen at the five percent level. These results suggest that touch screen and

optical scan technology cut the prevalence of misvoting roughly in half relative to punch card

technology. This result is consistent with the large literature (e.g., Alvarez et al. 2001 and Brady

et al. 2001) arguing that punch card technology causes the greatest number of residual votes.

After all, residual votes are examples of detected voting mistakes while adjacency misvotes are

largely undetected voting mistakes.

       Regression (4) in Table 7 shows the relationship between the brand of voting technology

and the magnitude of adjacency misvoting. Eleven brands of voting technology were used during

the Recall Election. Each brand corresponded to one of three technology platforms: optical scan,

touch screen, or punch card. Further details concerning the distribution of technology brands are

included in Appendix 1. Results from Regression (2) reveal that, controlling for the impact of

demographic characteristics, brands tend to have the same rate of misvoting within each

technology class, with three notable exceptions: the optical scan Diebold Accu-Vote-OS has a

level of misvoting that is comparable to typical punch card voting technologies, the punch card

Datavote brand has a level of misvoting that is comparable to most optical scan and touch screen




                                                28
technologies,19 and the touch screen Diebold AccuVote-TS is associated with an insignificantly

low level of misvoting.

        Results from regressions (2) and (4) are very similar to results from regression (1) and (3)

in which we do not control for precinct demographic characteristics. This supports evidence by

Knack and Kropf (2002), Garner and Spalaore (2005), and Card and Moretti (2005) showing that

areas with low levels of education and income, and high levels of Black or Hispanic voters are

not more likely to have “inferior” technologies such as punch card voting. Of course, it is

possible that precincts in counties that choose to adopt each brand of voting technology have

other characteristics not already accounted for by the demographic controls that influence the

magnitude of adjacency misvoting. We cannot simply conclude that touch screen technology is

“better” than punch card technology because technology may be endogenously chosen.

However, the technology brand analysis does suggest that a simple switch away from the punch

card technology platform may not automatically reduce the level adjacency misvoting. Careful

consideration of inter-brand differences may be necessary.




4. Applications and Extensions

        While the small but significant loss of votes to adjacent candidates did not change the

outcome of the Recall Election, it may have important implications for elections in general.

Numerous presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial elections have been determined by very

slim margins of victory. The margins of victory of the popular vote in the Presidential Elections


19
  The Datavote punch card brand distinguishes itself from the other two punch card brands in that it allows voters to
punch out their selections on the regular ballots (rather than requiring the use of punch card ballots in addition to
regular text ballots). Thus, the low level of misvotes associated with the Datavote machine suggests that the act of
“punching” out pre-scored holes may not be the cause of misvoting. Instead, higher levels of misvoting associated
with punch card technology by may be driven by the use of separate punch card ballots.


                                                        29
of 1880, 1884, 1960, and 2000 were all less than one-quarter of a percent.20 Recently, the 2004

Washington gubernatorial, 2000 Washington senatorial, 1998 Nevada senatorial, and 2002 South

Dakota senatorial elections were determined by voteshare margins of less than one-tenth of a

percent. Major candidates that attract voters that are more likely to cast misvotes would suffer

key disadvantages in these close elections.

         However, one may wonder if results from California’s gubernatorial recall election can

be applied to other major elections. The Recall Election was unique in that it featured an

unusually large number of candidates, 135 in total, competing in a single race. The advantage is

that the large number of candidates combined with variation in ballot layout and candidate order

provides the best available identification of adjacency misvoting. The disadvantage is that most

major elections feature far fewer candidates competing in a single race. For example, while a

total of 72 candidates ran for President in at least one state during the 2004 Election, the majority

of states listed fewer than ten candidates. Even primary elections, known for their large candidate

pools, typically feature fewer than thirty candidates per race.21 This does not imply, however,

that the California Recall Election ballots were unusually confusing. Ballots used in major

elections contain numerous races (e.g., President, Senate, House, assembly district, county,

municipality, etc.) and propositions, and thus do not significantly differ in length or complexity

from Recall Election ballots. However, adjacency misvoting may depend on the length of the

candidate list for a single race. Therefore, future research may wish to explore whether misvoting

occurs at comparable levels in elections featuring fewer candidates.



20
   Outcomes of presidential elections are officially determined by the Electoral College. For a majority of U.S.
states, the popular vote by state determines how state electoral votes are distributed in the Electoral College. In each
of the presidential elections listed above, the margin of victory was less than a quarter of a percent in the popular
vote of at least one state with enough electoral votes to determine the outcome of the election.
21
   Data for presidential elections and primaries are drawn from state election websites.


                                                          30
       Future nationwide studies of adjacency misvoting may be particularly beneficial because

adjacency misvoting could have a large impact on major elections outside of California. Unlike

California, many states in the U.S. do not rotate candidate name order on ballots. Rather,

incumbents are listed first, followed by a long list of minor candidates. This implies that the

candidate adjacent to a major candidate could be another major candidate. If this is the case,

votes lost by one major candidate are systematically accrued by another major candidate. For

example, suppose that, relative to the Republican frontrunner, the Democratic frontrunner

attracts voters that are more likely to cast misvotes. Further suppose that the two frontrunners are

adjacent to each other on the ballot. Then the Democratic frontrunner would not only lose more

votes to adjacent candidates. Her loss would actually go to her opponent, thereby magnifying her

electoral disadvantage.



V. Conclusion

       This paper tests the hypothesis that minor candidates experience gains in voteshare when

their names are listed near the name of a major candidate on a ballot. We refer to votes for minor

candidates resulting from adjacency misvoting as “misvotes” because ballot layout should not

impact the voting choices of fully rational voters with negligible cognition costs.

       We test adjacency misvoting using a unique dataset combining precinct-level voting

results from the 2003 California Recall Election with precinct-level Census and voter registration

data. Because ballot layout and candidate order are determined at the county-district level, there

exists random variation in when a minor candidate is adjacent to a major candidate. The gain in

the total voteshares experienced by minor candidates that are adjacent is an estimate of the

number of misvotes. We find that the voteshares of minor candidates almost double when their




                                                 31
names are adjacent to the names of major candidates and that misvotes accounted for at least

0.25% percent of all votes cast during the Recall Election. Misvotes are most prevalent in

precincts with high percentages of Democratic, Hispanic, low-income, non-English speaking,

poorly educated, or young voters, suggesting that these groups may face higher cognitive costs of

voting. We also find that, relative to the punch card technology platform, the use of the optical

scan or touch screen technology platforms generally corresponds to a reduction in the number of

misvotes. However, even within technology platforms, there are some notable performance

differences across voting machine brands.

       Adjacency misvoting has important electoral implications because votes gained by

adjacent candidates are votes lost by major candidates. A major candidate that attracts voters

from precincts that cast high levels of misvotes suffers systematic electoral disadvantages. In the

case of the California Recall Election, precincts that were most affected by adjacency misvoting

also showed the strongest support for Democratic candidate Cruz Bustamante. This may explain

why, relative to Republican candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bustamante lost 63 percent more

of the votes intended for him to his adjacent candidates. Although this difference in lost votes

represents a small fraction of the total voteshare, the loss exceeds the margins of victory in

several recent elections, including the presidential election of 2000 and the Washington

gubernatorial election of 2004. Thus, adjacency misvoting is powerful enough to determine

outcomes in important highly-contested close elections.

Appendix 1: Sample Ballots




The image above shows the upper portion of a multi-column optical scan ballot used in Alameda
County. Consider major candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger, located in the middle column, third
from the bottom. Because the columns are not clearly separated by boundary lines, voters
intending to vote for Schwarzenegger may accidentally fill in the bubble corresponding to
Ronald Palmieri, Schwarzenegger’s east adjacent candidate, instead of the correct bubble to the
left of Schwarzenegger’s name.




                                              35
The images above show a single-column ballot and a punch card grid used in Sacramento
County. Voters searched for the number corresponding to the desired candidate’s name using
standard text ballots. Each voter then used a stylus to punch out the desired candidate’s number
on a separate punch card grid. The small print suggests voters may accidentally punch out
numbers corresponding to candidates adjacent to major candidates on the punch card.




                                              36
The image above shows a multi-column touch screen ballot used in Riverside County. Voters
selected their desired candidates by touching the desired candidates’ corresponding circles. A
second screen then asked voters to confirm their choices. This ballot also shows how column
breaks allow identification of vertically adjacent candidates. Minor candidate George
Schwartzman normally follows major candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger in the candidate list.
However, Schwartzman is not south adjacent on this ballot because he is separated from
Schwarzenegger by a column break.

                                                              39
Appendix 3: Calculation of the Number of Misvotes

       Results from the regression, Votesharepdc = B0 + B1×Idcadjacent + controls + εpdc, can be

used to estimate the total number of misvotes cast by voters in the Recall Election. Let Idcadjacent

represent a vector of adjacency dummy variables,

       (Inorth AS adjacent, Isouth AS adjacent, Ieast AS adjacent, Iwest AS adjacent,
       Inorth CB adjacent, Isouth CB adjacent, Ieast CB adjacent, Iwest CB adjacent,
       Inorth TM adjacent, Isouth TM adjacent, Ieast TM adjacent, Iwest TM adjacent).

By separately measuring adjacency misvoting for each major candidate and adjacency type, we

identify the unique gain in voteshare when, for example, a candidate is north adjacent to Arnold

Schwarzenegger. This distinction is necessary because not all types of adjacency exist with

equal frequency.

       Let F be a vector equal to:

       (Fnorth AS adjacent, Fsouth AS adjacent, Feast AS adjacent, Fwest AS adjacent,
       Fnorth CB adjacent, Fsouth CB adjacent, Feast CB adjacent, Fwest CB adjacent,
       Fnorth TM adjacent, Fsouth TM adjacent, Feast TM adjacent, Fwest TM adjacent).

For example, Fnorth AS adjacent represents the average number of minor candidates that are located

directly north of Arnold Schwarzenegger, weighted by the total votes cast in a precinct. In a

given precinct, Schwarzenegger either has no north adjacent candidates (if Schwarzenegger is at

the top of a ballot column) or one north adjacent (if Schwarzenegger is not at the top of a ballot

column). Since F is an average across all precincts, F ranges between 0 and 1. One can think of

F as correcting for the fact that adjacent candidates exist with unequal frequency. For example,

north and south adjacent candidates always exist unless the major candidate is at the top or

bottom of a column respectively. However, east and west adjacent candidates only exist on

multi-column ballots. See Appendix 2 for detailed frequency statistics.




                                                             40
       If β1 is the coefficient vector derived from the regression specified above, misvotes as a

percentage of total votes cast is equal to β1F. A simple calculation reveals that β1F equals 0.25

with a standard error of 0.03. Thus misvotes accounted for 0.25% of all votes cast in the 2003

California Recall Election.
