                 Monetary Policy in the Large Open Economy


                                 ABSTRACT


       This paper discusses recent evidence on the imperfect international

substitutability of goods and assets and the implications for conduct of

monetary policy in a major   industrial country. A simple model is developed
for   analysis of the simultaneous determination of money growth and the

balance of payments under pegged exchange rates. Parallels are drawn to

the importance of expected depreciation in determination of floating

exchange rates. An assessment is made of the extent to which a central

bank can simultaneously pursue both exchange rate and money supply goals

through sterilized intervention. The paper concludes with the role of

saving rate differences in determining nonzero equilibrium trade balances.

     Economists are fond of downward sloping demand curves and upward sloping

supply curves except when describing a nation's international economic

relations. In that case these curves are generally assumed to be either

horizontal or vertical as required to describe a perfectly open or perfectly

closed economy. The reason for this exceptional behavior on the part of

economists is easy to see: Simple models can be used in either extreme case,

but the analysis becomes rather complex in the intermediate case in which

economies are open but far from perfectly so.' This paper will first report

on recent empirical research that rather conclusively rejects either extreme

model for the major (noncommunist) industrial nations. The implications of

imperfect openness for their central banks' monetary policies will then be

     'Microeconomists are accustomed to choosing either the competitive or
monopolistic model according to the problem at hand; they thus generally avoid
the numbing complexity and inconclusiveness of the various oligopolistic
models. Unfortunately, such a choice between the extren macroeconomic models

monetary policy in the major industrial countries. Fortunately, the
complexity of the intermediate model appears less severe than in the case of
oligopoly.

        I. Goods and Assets as Imperfect Substitutes Internationally



     Either or both of two major assumptions have been used to characterize

perfectly open economies: goods are perfect substitutes internationally or

securities are perfect substitutes internationally. This section reports on

recent empirical work which decisively rejects both hypotheses. Most of the

work summarized here was done as part of the NBER's International Transmission

Project and will be reported by my collaborators and self in Darby, Lothian,

Gandolfi, Schwartz, and Stockman (1983).



Goods Substitution

     The "global monetarists" like Laffer (1975) argued that internationally

traded goods are, for all practical purposes, perfect substitutes across

borders with prices rigidly linked by arbitrage.2 Factor competition between

tradable and nontradable goods was used to extend this arbitrage relation to

the "law of one price level" which held that purchasing power parity

continuously attains — not just in the long—run as in the Huuiean

tradition.3 Previous empirical research, such as Isard (1977), Kravis and

Lipsey (1977, 1978),. and Richardson (1978), has concluded that goods are

substitutable internationally, but far from perfectly so.




     2The term in quotation marks was introduced in Whitman's (1975) survey
article. In the relevant sense, price arbitrage requires that domestic prices
be strictly proportional (not necessarily equal) to the exchange rate
converted foreign prices. This implicitly assumes proportional shipping costs
and tariffs and that each good is always shipped in the same direction.

     3Fausten (1979) persuasively distinguished the Humean tradition from the
law of one price level.
                                       4



     The International Transmission Project results support that conclusion.

In a medium—scale simultaneous equation model of Canada, France, Germany,

Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States

estimated for 1957—1976, the relative—price effects on the balance of trade

implicit in export and import equations are small in the initial quarter

although they do increase over time.4 In bivariate Granger causality tests

between domestic and foreign inflation for the same eight countries, lagged

foreign inflation was generally insignificant. Furthermore, there was no

evidence that price changes led money changes in nonreserve countries under

pegged exchange rates as suggested by analyses based on the law of one price

level.5 Only weak and far from universal foreign—price effects were found in

reduced—form price equations estimated for the same eight countries.6 Thus

our results confirm the previous conclusion: Goods are imperfect substitutes

internationally.



Asset Substitution

     The central bank's monetary policy may affect substantially and

immediately the balance of payments through asset flows even if the balance of

trade initially responds only weakly. Indeed in view of the previous

empirical rejection of perfect good substitution, perfect asset Bubstitution

     5Darby, Lothian, et al. (1983, Chapter 4 by Cassese and Lothian). The
tests were run for periods ending 1971, 1973, and 1976.

has become the usual defining characteristic of a perfectly open economy.7 In

this context, perfect asset substitution means that the domestic interest rate

is equal to the foreign interest rate minus the expected appreciation (per

annum) of the domestic currency over the term to maturity of the securities.

In contrast, imperfect asset substitutability implies that there is a risk

premium between the two interest rates which varies with the relative stocks

of domestic and foreign assets and which hence responds to international

capital flows. Thus, lower domestic interest rates could induce finite

capital outflows which raise the risk premium on foreign assets enough that no

further flows are induced by the yields on domestic securities which are lower

than the expected yields on foreign securities.8

     The International Transmission Project approached this question in a

number of ways. Cassese and Lothian found that lagged as well as current

American interest rates had significant effects on the other seven countries'

interest rates during the pegged period; indeed generally the lagged effects

were more important quantitatively in contradiction to perfect short—run asset

substitution.9 In the structural model the estimated interest—rate effects on

capital flows were small; simulations confirmed that monetary policy changes




     7Asset substitution is used here to refer to various national interest—
bearing securities; there is little if any evidence for the large industrial
nations of direct substitution in demand of the national moneys ("currency
substitution"). See also Cuddington (1983).

     8lmperfect asset substitution results in the portfolio—balance models
pioneered by Branson (1968, 1970) and discussed at length below.

     9Darby, Lothian, et al (1983, Chapter 4 by Cassese and Lothian).

 did not induce very large short—run balance of payments effects under
                                                                       pegged
 exchange rates.'°

      An indirect approach provided
                                      strong evidence against perfect asset
 substitution for the seven nonreserve countries
                                                      under pegged exchange rates.
 As demonstrated in Section II below, this condition is sufficient to render

 their domestic monetary policy impotent under pegged exchange rates. It
                                                                         was
 shown that domestic policy goals were in fact significant determinants of

 these countries' money supply growth.11       Daniel Laskar estimated the fraction
 of a shift in the money supply reaction
                                           function which would be reflected in
 the domestic money supply given the induced capital flows and the

 sterilization behavior of the central bank. For all seven nonreserve

 countries under pegged exchange rates this fraction
                                                         significantly exceeded 0
 but did not significantly differ from i.12      Thus the actual exercise of short—
run monetary control during the Bretton Woods era is inconsistent with the

usefulness of the perfect asset substitution hypothesis.

     Moreover, the International Transmission Project's
                                                             strong results are
consistent with the best recent empirical work reported in the literature.

Geweke and Feige (1979), Hansen and Hodrick (1980, 1982), Bilson (1981), and

Cumby and Obstfeld (1981, 1983), for example, all reject the hypothesis that

the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate as

Chapter 7 by Darby).

it would be under perfect asset substitution.'3 Dooley and Isard (1979) and

Frankel (1982) have in contrast reported an inability to relate risk premiums

to outstanding bond supplies, but these results may well be explained by the

rather low power of their tests.'4 Furthermore, these tests all examine the

floating period in which assets should be relatively better substitutes than

under pegged rates when capital controls — and the risk of their imposition

—   were more significant factors and international financial markets were less

well developed. The new evidence in Darby, Lothian, et al. (1983) appears

virtually to eliminate perfect asset substitution as a viable hypothesis.




     '3Covered interest arbitrage imposes the condition that the domestic and
foreign interest rates will differ only by the discount or premium implicit in
the forward rate. Under imperfect asset substitution, the forward rate will
differ from the expected future spot rate by a risk premium that varies as
capital flows change outstanding holdings of bonds. This risk premium is
normally related to the role of exchange rate risk in the modern theory of
finance (Solnik 1973), but Dooley and Isard (1980) argue that political risk
of capital controls varies with the stock of outstanding debt. This factor
may well be the ire important.

     '4Michael Melvin in Chapter 13 of Darby, Lothian, et al. (1983) was
rather more successful in applying Solnik's (1973) international asset pricing
model to explaining international capital flows.

          II. Independent Monetary Policy under Pegged Exchange Rates



      The fact that for large industrial countries such as Japan or Germany

neither goods nor assets are perfect substitutes internationally implies that

changes in the central bank's reserves will permit it —    within   limits

discussed below —   to   pursue simultaneously monetary and exchange—rate

goals. Indeed, even under pegged exchange rates independent monetary policy

is, to an extent, feasible in the short run. Although the floating—rate

regime is of most interest currently, it is helpful to first consider the

simpler case of pegged exchange rates.'5

      In Darby, Lothian, et al. (1983, Chapter 10), I propose a simple

graphical device for analyzing the simultaneous determination of the balance

of payments and nominal money supply in a large, imperfectly open economy

maintaining a pegged exchange rate. The model combines the central bank's

reaction function with the semi—reduced form equation describing the economic

environment within which the bank operates.

      The central bank's reaction function provides a formal statement of the

behavior of the monetary authorities working through the banking system. It

may be written compactly as



                                B
(1)
                    logM=a+X+u




     '5it could well be argued that a number of major European nations are de
facto pursuing pegged exchange rates with the German mark which in turn floats
relative to the U.S. dollar, the yen, and other major currencies. The ndel
would apply directly to these countries.
                                       9



where M is the nominal money supply, B/H is the current period balance of

payments surplus divided (or scaled) by nominal base (high—powered) money, X

is a vector of all other variables which systematically affect the central

bank's behavior, and u is a random disturbance. Note particularly that lagged

values of B/H or scaled reserves may appear in X. Here we are concerned with

monetary independence within the short period, but the short—period curves may

well shift in the next period in response to what happens this period. The

parameter cx measures the extent to which the central bank sterilizes reserve

flows within the period: If a is 1, there is no sterilization while if a is 0

sterilization is complete.16 In other words, a represents the fraction of

the current balance of payments which the central bank allows to be reflected

in base money. 17

     Although a complete structural model of the economy will not be produced

here,18 it is useful to define parity money growth (log M) as that change




     16lndependent estimates reported in Chapters 6 and 11 of Darby, Lothian,
et al. (1983) places a between 0 and 0.2 or 0.3 for all seven nonreserve
countries; only for Germany and perhaps Japan and the Netherlands
does a significantly exceed 0 for quarterly observations. Generally lagged
adjustments are found to be substantial, however. Examples of other authors
who report evidence of substantial short—run sterilization are Herring and
Marston (1977), Hilliard (1979), Connolly and Taylor (1979), and Obstfeld
(1980, 1982b). Laney and Willett (1982) present a tabular survey of estimated
sterilization coefficients reported through 1980.

     7Some authors prefer to cast the central bank's reaction function in
terms of the scaled change in domestic credit:

                        (a1) +       + u

However, in the presence of even partial sterilization (a<l) domestic credit
has no substantive role in either theoretical or empirical analysis and is
accordingly dropped. Its computation is straightforward for the interested
reader. Note that if a = 1, scaled growth in domestic credit is X ÷ u.

     18See, however, Darby, Lothian, et al. (1983, Chapters 5 and 6) for
Stockman's and my attempt to do so.
                                       10




consistent with substituting in the money demand equation the exchange—rate

converted foreign price level and foreign interest rate:19



(2)                (t1og M) = Z6 + c



Money growth faster than (ilog M) will be associated with domestic interest

rates lower and prices higher than their international parity values. Lower

interest rates will induce capital outflows while higher prices will reduce

the trade balance; thus money growth in excess of (Alog H) will reduce the

balance of payments surplus. Formally, we can write the semi—reduced form for

the scaled balance of payments as



(3)




where S is a vector of all other factors affecting the balance of payments

such as those contained in the trade supply and demand equations.

Specification of S is not of concern for the current analysis. Our primary

concern is the function e which determines the derivative of the scaled

balance of payments with respect to money supply growth.




     19A minor complication arises if the nominal money supply has a
contemporaneous effect on real income. A considerable complication of the
analysis arises if we consider the following (second—order) effect which
arises when assets are imperfect substitutes: In that case a change in
central bank reserve holdings moves the equilibrium domestic interest rate
relative to the foreign interest rate. Then monetary policy could affect the
money stock and output without affecting prices. This point, which is due to
Maurice Obstfeld, suggests a way in which monetary policy would not be
entirely impotent (given imperfect asset substitution) even if goods were
perfect substitues. I assume here that the money demand effects of the
balance of payments through both the interest rate and output channels are
negligible in the short period being analyzed.

      The scaled balance of payments is, by the accounting identities, the

difference between the scaled trade balance CT/H) and the scaled net private

capital outflows (C/H):2°



                   B_T C
                   HH  H
Scaled net private capital outflows will be a function of the current covered

interest differential (adjusted for expected exchange rate changes) and other

variables which may be taken as given for the current period:21



(5)                =f(R_p_RF)

where p is the expected depreciation of the exchange rate (p < 0 implies an

expected appreciation), R is the given foreign interest rate, and so ft is

negative. We find e' by differentiating equation (4):




     20The variable C/H is here defined as minus the net cash flow from
international investment —— that is, as net foreign investment less net
securities income. However, we neglect within the short period the second
order effect oflower domestic interest rates increasing net securities income
and hence lowering C/H; portfolio adjustments are assumed to overwhelm this
effect.

     21Among these other variables is, of course, the lagged covered interest
differential since changes in the differential will cause portfolio revisions
and hence net capital flows. These other variables are predetermined within
the period and so Implicit in the function f( ). As discussed in footnote 19,
the balance of payments will have a direct effect on the partiy value of the
domestic interest rate under imperfect asset substitution so that we might
prefer C/H = f(R+y[B/H]—p—R ). However, this nrely requires substitution of
E(dp/d(B/H)) — yl for    dp/d(B/H) in equation (7). Since either term is
definitely negative, none of the qualitative results are affected whether we
think of the balance—of—payments effect on domestic interest rates as
reflecting only an expected depreciation factor or also a portfolio—balance
factor.

The multiplier 11(1 —
                                 d (-9y)   states    that if the expected depreciation p

responds to the size of the balance of payments (as an indicator of the

probability and size of a revaluation), then the direct trade and capital flow

effects will be reinforced by induced "speculative" capital flows.22 These

induced speculative capital flows will be overwhelming unless



(8)                     '    d (B/H) <



Thus expected depreciation, which plays such an important role in recent

analyses of floating exchange rates, is potentially important under pegged

exchange rates also.

     22Given the (predetermined) lagged value of scaled reserves, B/H tells us
the value of current scaled reserves which Bilson (1979) and Harberger and
Edwards (1982) argue is an important indicator of the probability of
devaluation. Bilson also proposes a monetary indicator which can be
interpreted as the integral of log N — Zô —     this is subsumed in the total

of payments relative to its parity value SX are associated with decreases in

morley growth relative to its parity value. Figure 1 plots equations (1) and

(9) on the same graph to illustrate the simultaneous determination of

equilibrium money growth (t,log )e and the balance of payments (/H)eq• The

equation (1) line would be vertical if the central bank completely sterilized

the contemporaneous balance of payments; its positive slope here indicates

partial sterilization is practiced. The (9) line would be vertical If

condition (8) was not met or under perfect international substitutability of

goods or assets;24 the line is drawn here as negatively sloping in the

relevant region.25 Unless the two lines happened to coincide, there would be

no equilibrium if both lines were vertical. The intersection of the (1) and

(9) lines gives the short—period equilibrium values of the scaled balance of

payments and money growth.26

     Suppose that economic conditions characterized by X1 include higher

domestic unemployment than those in X0 and that this increases the money

growth desired by the central bank for any given value of the balance of

payments (X1 > X0). As illustrated in Figure 2, this shift in domestic

policy goals induces an increase in money growth and decrease in the balance

of payments. The more open is the economy, the steeper will be the downward

sloping line which represents the central bank's payments—balance/money—growth

tradeoff, and the greater will be the balance of payments effect and the

     25The multiplier of equation (7) is positive with condition (8) holding
while — < [d(T/H)/d(log N)] < 0 and       > [f'dR/d(ilog M)] > 0 under
imperfect substitution. Therefore - < 8' < 0 which implies — < 4' < 0.

     261f this also corresponds to a long—period equilibrium, it should be
along a line from the origin with slope less than 1. In that case money
growth derives from growth in both reserves and domestic credit.

 lesser the money growth effect of any given shift in the central bank's

 reaction function. 27

      The graphical analysis did not take account of the possibility that both

 the probability and the size of a devaluation may increase with the absolute

value of B/H or its deviation from its parity value SX.   If this is so

dp/d(B/H) will approach the critical value 1/f' for large absolute values of

B/H and therefore the tradeoff will worsen as in Figure 3•28 This

possibility, as well as the implied effects on future tradeoffs, would limit

the range within which the central bank would choose to operate. The size of

this range remains unknown, but the evidence in Darby, Lothian, et al. (1983)

suggests that a ten percent deviation of the actual from the parity level of

nominal money is near the limit of monetary independence for large open

economies which maintain a pegged exchange rate. Furthermore, this deviation

cannot be maintained Indefinitely because of the cumulative effect on reserves

of continuing large balance—of—payments deficits or surpluses.   Ultimately
either monetary policy or the exchange—rate peg must be adjusted.




     27However, in choosing a and p the central bank is aware of the
(expected) tradeoff which it faces, so generally alternatively shaped
tradeoffs would induce alternative reaction functions. Lucas's (1976)
critique implies that the shape of the tradeoff surface may also depend upon
the central bank's choice of a and p. Furthermore, a government pursuing a
nationalistic monetary policy may offset the balance—of—payments effects of
the policy by changes in, say, commercial policy which affect SX so as to
shift the (9) line upwards.

     28Thjs analysis provides a rather simpler explanation of when balance—of—
payments crises occur than that suggested by Krugman (1979). As the central
bank moves money growth further from the parity value, the stability condition
(8) is finally violated and speculative capital flows become overwhelming. In
the medium scale model reported in Darby, Lothian, et al. (1983), dp/d(B/H)
does increase In absolute value with t(B/H)I, but the stability condition
appears to hold except at the time of actual balance—of—payments crises.

     III. Monetary Policy, Floating Exchange Rates, and the Trade Balance



      The theoretical and empirical analysis of the effects of monetary policy

under floating exchange rates has not progressed to the point that neat

summary diagrams can be produced to illustrate major results. Indeed we seem

to know disappointingly little despite the expenditure of much talent and

effort. If this section seems maddeningly tentative to the policyinaker, it

must be recalled that false knowledge is far more dangerous than an awareness

of ignorance.

     Broadly speaking, economists' prior expectations of the results of

widespread floating among major currencies have been confirmed in two major

respects, but economists have been surprised in one important aspect.

Generally economists were correct in their expectations of long—run neutrality

and enhanced monetary independence but erred in predictions that exchange

rates would gradually move in reflection of relative inflation rates.

     The long—run neutrality of the economy with respect to monetary policy is

perhaps our most secure result: That is, an increase in the level of money

will ——   in   the long run and with other things equal —— be reflected in an

equal increase in prices and the nominal exchange rate with no effect on real

output or the real exchange rate.29 Superneutrality is rather less

secure:3° First, as in any closed economy, higher money growth and hence




     29The nominal exchange rate is measured as domestic currency units per
unit of foreign currency. The real exchange rate (also known as the
purchasing power ratio) is the nominal exchange rate times the ratio of the
foreign to the domestic price level.

     30Superneutrality implies that the real variables in the economy (e.g.,
real output and the real exchange rate) are unaffected in long—run equilibrium
by changes in the trend growth rate of nominal money.
                                       19




inflation may shift the aggregate production function downward, increase the

investment—income ratio, and decrease labor input;31 real output, the real

interest rate, and the real exchange rate may be changed in either direction

depending upon the relative importance of the various effects and upon

parameters describing the economy. Furthermore, if increased money growth is

accomplished through increased purchases of foreign reserves this will tend to

depreciate the real exchange rate.32

     My colleague James Lothian (1983) has recently made some calculations

which demonstrate both the strength of the neutrality results and the relative

unimportance of any deviations from superneutrality. In this work he analyzed

for various variables the differences between their average growth rates for

1956—1973 and 1974—1980. Having obtained data on these "growth shifts" for

twenty OECD countries, Lothian showed that the growth shift in prices matched

that in money while there was essentially no correlation between growth shifts




     31The aggregate production function shifts are discussed in the
traditional literature on the costs of inflation. Tobin (1965) inItiated
consideration of possible capital deepening, and Friedman (1977) introduced
the possibility that higher unemployment is caused by higher inflation rates.

     32The argument is that increased government flow demand for foreign
securities will increase equilibrium net exports which can only be
accomplished (under imperfect long—run goods substitutability) at a higher
real exchange rate. Recent discussions of central—bank demand for foreign
reserves under floating exchange rates include Hailer and Khan (1978) and von
Furstenberg (1982). However, Obstfeld's (1982a) results would imply here that
equilibrium net exports would not increase if individuals viewed the
government's holdings of foreign securities as equivalent to their own. A
full steady—state analysis requires consideration of the service—account
effects of the government purchases (which would ultimately reduce net
exports) discussed by Obstfeld (1981). Further, long—run price elasticities
may be much larger than the short—run elasticities so that long—run perfect
goods substitutability may be a close approximation to the truth.

in output and money growth shifts. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate these striking

results.33 These results demonstrate that any shifts in levels of y and P due

to failure of superneutrality are negligible (when averaged over seven years)

in comparison to either random fluctuations in the growth rate of real output

or to the changes in the growth of prices induced by the growth shift in

money. Similarly, Lothian finds that the growth shifts in either relative

inflation or relative money growth have an effect on the growth shift in the

exchange rate which differs insignificantly from one. Having thus noted that

neutrality and even superneutrality hold to an acceptable degree of

approximation, we can concentrate on the independence of monetary policy and

the reasons why its exercise might have a short—run impact on real output and

the real exchange rate even in the absence of any long—run effects.

     Although frequently reacting in the same way to international events,

those central banks which have not attempted to maintain pegs with other

currencies after the breakdown of the Bretton—Woods system have certainly

demonstrated their ability to pursue independent monetary policies.34 The

primary impact on real exchange rates of unexpected changes in monetary policy

has been associated with the liquidity (or real—interest—rate) effect of these



     33The lines are drawn through the sample means with the theoretical
slopes (under neutrality and superneutrality) of 1 and 0, respectively.
Lothian's regression analysis indicates that we cannot reject at the 5%
significance level either that the coefficient of trM is 0 in a linear
regression explaining Ary or 1 in a similar regression for rP, where M' means
"the growth shift in" and where y, M, and P are real GNP (or GDP), narrow
money, and consumer prices, respectively. He also ran U.S. dollar exchange—
rate (E) equations of the forms tE a + b(rM—rM5),

      a + b(til'M—trM5) + c(sry—try5), and M'E =   a + b(trP—FP); as reported
in the text, in each case b differed from 1 insignificantly at the 5% level.

     34See, for example, Darby and Lothian (1983) for our analysis of British
monetary policy under Margaret Thatcher.

monetary shocks.35 The basic idea is a simple one: An unexpected change in

the interest rate at home relative to abroad will induce incipient capital

flows. If a positive money shock lowers the domestic interest rate, for

example, a capital outflow would be induced, all other things equal. In order

for this capital outflow to be stanched, the exchange rate must rise

sufficiently that anticipations of later decreases in this variable reduce or

eliminate the decrease in the interest rate differential adjusted for expected

depreciation. If assets were perfect substitutes internationally, the

adjustment in expected depreciation would have to exactly offset the change in

the interest rate. A smaller adjustment is required if assets are imperfectly

substitutable internationally and some change in capital flows actually occurs

because of either contemporaneous adjustment in the trade balance or changes

in central bank reserve purchases.

     Suppose that increased money growth were perfectly anticipated so that

equal contemporaneous changes occurred in the actual and expected inflation

rate and growth rate of the nominal exchange rate. Then there would be no

n1tal jump n the exchange rate along the lines just suggested. Thus it is

seen that the movements in the nominal and real exchange rates associated with




     35A vast listerature has blossomed from Dornbusch's seminal contribution
(1976), but see also Dornbusch (1980, 1982). Home (1983) reviews the
empirical research to date and concludes that 'the evidence of the 1970s
supports the portfolio balance model" which is presented here.
unexpected changes in monetary policy are due to movements in the real

interest rate,36

     This impact effect of monetary policy on the real (and nominal) exchange

rate might be quite large. For example, Goodhart and Temperton (1982)

attribute nearly all of the 30 percent fluctuation in the British real

exchange rate over 1979—1981 to monetary policy.37 This exchange—rate impact

adds a channel of influence for monetary policy not present under
                                                                    pegged

exchange rates: Unexpected decreases in money growth immediately reduce the

demand for traded goods and hence aggregate demand.38 The immediate effect on

the trade balance of these movements in the real exchange rate is estimated to

be close to nil.39 It is the lagged effects which apparently influence the

adjustment process.

     When we move from consideration of the initial impact of monetary shocks

to the subsequent adjustment process, our empirical base becomes weak, but

some suggestive comments can be made. First, the initial movement of the real




     361f assets were perfect substitutes internationally, the home nominal
(real) interest rate would equal the foreign nominal (real) interest rate plus
the growth rate of the nominal (real) exchange rate. Thus a policy which
caused the domestic real interest rate to fall relative to the foreign real
interest rate by an average of 3% per annum for three years would induce an
immediate 9% real depreciation so that the real exhhange rate could be
expected to decrease (i.e., appreciate) by 3 percent per annum for the next
three years. Isard (1982) has in particular argued that the long—run value of
the real exchange rate is fixed by trade balance considerations (on which, see
Section V below) while Dooley and Isard (1981) extend the argument to apply
qualitatively in an imperfect—substitution or portfolio—balance model.

     370i1 price movements (the prime alternative explanation) were found to
have had a negligible impact.

     38Under pegged exchange rates, prices of traded and nontraded goods move
much more synchronously in the absence of a revaluation.

     39That is, within the current quarter the changes in the quantities of
exports and imports are approximately offset by the changes in their domestic—
currency prices.
                                          25



exchange rate is gradually eliminated over time, but whether this adjustment

is smooth or involves overshooting depends on the adjustment path of the real

interest rate. The trade balance increases over time in response to a

positive monetary shock, but then the price advantage of an increased

(depreciated) real exchange rate is eliminated over time. Note, however, that

the temporarily increased trade balance implies private (or government) net

accumulation of foreign securities in excess of what would otherwise be the

case. Once this accumulation becomes important, it implies a lower domestic

interest rate relative to the expected—depreciation—adjusted foreign interest

rate. Unfortunately the implications of this asset accumulation are far from

well understood, but apparently depend in part on whether they are ultimately

reversed for reasons discussed in Section V below. 40

        Sterilized intervention in the foreign exchange market — a continuing

central—bank exchange of foreign for domestic securities — can be used to

moderate the required initial movement in the real exchange rate. This would

be attractive, for example, if the otherwise disproportionate share of the

costs   born by   the traded goods sector would make an antlinflationary policy

politically unacceptable.41 The same factors which     permit a degree of
independence   to monetary policy under pegged exchange rates permit the

simultaneous pursuit of monetary and exchange—rate goals under floating

exchange rates; in each case the reserve movements must be accepted as the

cost of the central bank's influence on the second variable. Again, the

effect of these flows on the expectation that the operations will be abandoned




        40See, however, the pioneering effort by Henderson (1980).

     41i am unaware of any attempt to compare the relative costs of sterilized
intervention with direct subsidies to traded—goods producers.
and the exchange rate change which would ensue would limit the central bank's

freedom to pursue the secondary goal.

     In summary, floating the exchange rate eliminates the short— and
                                                                      long—run
limits on monetary growth, but also changes the
                                                  impact of monetary policy by
speeding and increasing the impact on the traded—goods sector. This

difference can be ameliorated by sterilized intervention to sot extent. But

ultimately choice of a pegged exchange rate is a decision to restrict monetary

growth to a range — determined by the reserve country ——
                                                           within   which the
traded—goods sector can be protected by sterilized intervention.    Abandonment
of that complete protection is the cost of monetary independence.

                IV.   Some Rational—Expectations Considerations



     Thus far we have been concerned with the feasible set from which the

central bank can select combinations of money growth, reserve flows, and

exchange rates and with the results of that choice. Expectations have been

left largely in the background except for the expected rate of depreciation.

But much recent macroeconomic research has demonstrated the importance of

expectations in determining the point of departure relative to which we have

been comparing the effects of unanticipated policy changes. This research

cautions us that the short—run impacts of the policies considered depend

crucially upon the unexpected nature of these policies. Therefore the short—

run impacts on the real economy would not exist if the central bank

systematically attempted to exploit, say, the beneficent effects of

accelerated money growth on the traded—goods sector under floating exchange

rate system.

     Some economists working in the strict rational—expectations tradition

associated with Robert Lucas and Thomas Sargent have gone beyond these well

known cautions against attempts to exploit effects associated with policy

innovations. In particular, they have attempted to analyze the variance of

output implied by simple nxdels under alternative exchange—rate/monetary—

policy regimes.42 These authors show that an optimal portfolio of foreign

disturbances may reduce the variance of output and thus stabilize the economy

relative to a policy regime which more effectively insultates the economy from

foreign disturbances. Some authors emphasize the private sector's adjustment




     42See, for example, Saidi (1980), Weber (1981), Flood and Marion (1982),
Flood (1982), and Kimbrough (1983).
                                      28




in the output—inflation tradeoff as the regime changes while others emphasize

potential informational content of exchange rate movements.

     The rational—expectations models remain very simple and cannot yet

provide any practical guidance to policymakers. They do raise the issue,

however, of whether the relevant questions concern the feasibility and effect

of a particular money growth under a particular exchange rate regime or the

stochastic structure of the economy which would result from alternative rules

for choosing monetary growth.

       V. Capital Flows, the Trade Balance, and the Real Exchange Rate

                            in Long-Run Equilibrium



     The discussion so far has treated the trade balance as predetermined with

capital flows and depreciation—adjusted interest rates adjusting to maintain

equilibrium. The concept of an autonomous trade balance has little appeal

once we move beyond the initial short period. Indeed the long—run equilibrium

is better characterized by autonomous net capital outflows and passively

adjusting trade balance and real exchange rate.

     This is seen most easily by noting that only one real exchange rate is

consistent with a given trade balance in long—run equilibrium.43 Therefore

expected real depreciation is inconsistent with long—run equilibrium, and

capital flows must be responding to actual differences in real interest

rates. Suppose Japan has a high saving—income ratio relative to the rest of

the world and the United States a relatively low one. If both economies

always maintained zero trade balances and capital flows, the real interest

rate would become low in capital—rich Japan and high in the U.S.44 Instead

capital outflows and trade surpluses for Japan and capital inflows and trade

deficits for the U.S. have achieved a more efficient world distribution of the

capital stock. However, these flows will not continue forever: As Japanese




     431f goods are perfect substitutes internationally, an infinity of trade
balances will be associated with the single equilibrium real exchange rate.
If goods are imperfect substitutes internationally even in the long run, then
higher (more depreciated) real exchange rates will be associated with higher
trade balances. In a growing economy, the trade balance is best measured as a
ratio to GNP.

     44To the extent that Japan specializes in highly capital—intensive goods
and the U.S. in less capital—intensive goods, this tendency is ameliorated.
An alternative, complementary basis for net capital inflows to the U.S. is the
political security of private investments there.
                                      30



wealth rises, its growth rate (saving/wealth) will fall until it converges to

the growth rate of output in the world economy.45 Eventually, assuming this

growth rate is less than the real return on capital, Japan's foreign

investment income will exceed its net foreign investments and the difference

will finance — indeed force — a trade deficit. Throughout the adjustment

process and in very long—run equilibrium, the excess saving in Japan (or

saving shortage in the U.S.) determines the equilibrium net capital outflows

and hence the trade balance and real exchange rate. Commercial policy can

only alter the composition of the trade balance by affecting relative

delivered prices and hence apparent comparative advantage.46

     If then we adopt the view that in the long run national capital stocks

and wealth will be unaffected by unexpected money growth, we must conclude as

suggested in Section III that the adjustment process to a monetary shock

cannot be characterized by smooth adjustment. The abnormal capital flows

induced by initial movements in the real exchange rate must ultimately be

undone by offsetting movements. We conclude that it will be some time before

a full understanding of the intermediate effects of monetary shocks is

achieved.47




     45Japanese wealth was abnormally low in the early postwar period both
because of wartime devastation and because of the rapid growth in Japanese
human capital.

     461t is curious that U.S. labor unions would focus on the "jobs lost" due
to the excess of imports over exports rather than the corresponding gain in
employment and real wages due to the capital inflows financed by the trade
deficit.

          exploratory effort integrating trade and capital flows in a full
adjustment analysis is reported in Darby, Lothian, et al. (1983, Chapter 12 by
Dan Lee).

     The Bretton Woods System afforded the major nonreserve central banks a

range for independent monetary policy which was neither negligible nor

unlimited. The banks' resistance to accelerating American inflation in the

late 1960s ultimately broke down and the resulting burst of inflation in the

early 1970s led to the collapse of the Bretton Woods System.48 The ensuing

decade of generalized floating among major currencies (or currency blocs) has

presented some surprises and so engendered much theoretical and empirical

research.

     The work to date suggests that the major source of instability in real

exchange rates has been instability In monetary policy. The Federal Reserve

System has long been infamous for accelerating money growth to reduce

unemployment and then causing a recession to control the resultant

inflation.49 The high inflation legacy of the Bretton Woods System has left

the other major central banks with a similar dilemma and unfortunately similar

results. One aspect of the exercise of independent monetary policy is the

major impact on the traded—goods sector which is both quicker and stronger

than that associated with the sorts of unexpected money growth which could

occur under the Bretton Woods System.




     48A detailed discussion is provided by Darby and Lothian in Darby,
Lothian, et al. (1983, Chapter 17).

     49Wlether this reflects a defect in the Federal Reserve System or in the
American political system is not addressed here.
