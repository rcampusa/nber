We use a variety of different data sets from Thailand to study not only the extremes of micro and
macro variables but also within-country flow of funds and labor migration. We develop a general
equilibrium model that encompasses regional variation in the type of financial friction and
calibrate it to measured variation in regional aggregates. The model predicts substantial capital
and labor flows from rural to urban areas even though these differ only in the underlying financial
regime. Predictions for micro variables not used directly provide a model validation. Finally we
estimate the impact of a policy counterfactual, regional isolationism.

1         Introduction
Big data and big theory are increasingly used together to construct economic models that
defy more traditional boundaries. Big data is frequently thought of as the use of large
administrative data sets, though it includes other types of data, and also refers to studies in
which there is both a complexity and variety of data that need to be linked, connected, and
               1
correlated.        The term “big theory” is used by West (2013) as a counterweight, arguing that
without a unified, conceptual framework, big data loses much of its potency and usefulness.
        In this paper we use a variety of different data sets from Thailand to study not only
the extremes of micro and macro variables but also the meso data in between. By meso
data we mean variables that are aggregated up from the underlying individual agent data
to some degree, to village/town, county or region but not all the way to economy-wide
aggregates. Our focus in fact is within-country flow of funds and labor migration. We use
findings in the underlying micro data to infer cross-regional variation in financial frictions,
use this variation in model formulation, calibrate the model around parameter estimates in
the micro data and measured variation in regional aggregates, and then make predictions.
The model predictions run the entire range from macro to the key flow of funds and labor
migration variables, and back to variables at the micro level. The latter is part of model
validation, especially when we make predictions for micro variables not used directly in
the model formulation and calibration. We also show that if we had followed much of the
literature on financial frictions, and just assumed those frictions, rather than what we see
or infer on the ground, then we would not be able to simultaneously match salient features
of both the meso- and micro data. Finally we use the structural model to perform various
counterfactual policy experiments.
        Our principle findings are as follows. First, we compute steady state solutions to a
model with heterogeneous producers with two regions that differ in the underlying financial
regime. More precisely, we build on evidence from Thai micro data that moral hazard fits
best in urbanized areas and in the Central region whereas limited commitment is a better
fit in rural areas and in the Northeast.2 Second we calibrate the model economy parameters
around measured difference across these regions in income, consumption to income, capital
to income, wealth, and the incidence of enterprise; we then find that parameter estimates for
    1
     See the review by Einav and Levin (2014).

     Throughout the paper we will interchangeably use the terms urban vs rural areas (using official geopolit-
ical identifiers, metropolitan vs village) or regions (which indicates geographical variation, with six regional
groups: Central including greater Bangkok, Northern, Northeast, Western, Eastern, and South).



                                                       2
preferences, technology and the degree of constraint from limited comment are well within
plausible ranges (i.e. consistent with parameter values in the literature.) Third, at calibrated
values the model predicts substantial flow of capital from rural to urban areas even though
the two areas differ only in the underlying financial regime: 23 percent of capital in urban
areas is imported and rural areas loose 40 percent. Fourth, at the same time, there are huge
flows of labor in the same direction; 75 percent of labor in the urban areas comes from this
migration and rural areas loose 85 percent. Findings three and four can be summarized to
say that the urban areas uses 79 percent of the economy’s capital and 65 percent of its labor
even though urban areas are only 30 percent of the population (a number from the data).
Fifth, at the micro level we see that net savings differences across regions are consistent
with micro facts in the data; over the relevant range, credit is increasing with assets in the
Northeast region and constant or decreasing with assets in the Central region. Sixth, there
is much more persistence of capital in rural areas than in urban areas. These two facts,
five and six above, are consistent with the micro data and indeed were some key findings
used to motivate the variation in financial obstacles across regions in the first place. There
are also predictions for new moments/facts. We predict that the growth of net worth is
more concentrated in the Central region, and this is consistent with the data. Seventh,
predictions for firm size distribution by capital are quite consistent with the data, in that
the moral hazard regime has a skewed right tail as do urban areas relative to rural areas.
   As noted, we find that making up financial obstacles cannot fit meso resource flows
and the micro data jointly. In particular, we show that it is key that the type of financial
regime varies across regions, as opposed to urban and rural areas being subject to the same
financial regime but with differing tightness of the financial constraint. To make this point,
we conduct the following experiment. We suppose that, instead of moral hazard, the urban
area is subject to the same form of limited commitment as the rural area but with a higher,
more liberal maximum leverage ratio. We show that to do as well as our benchmark economy
in terms of matching observed factor flows, we have to raise the urban leverage ratio to well
beyond reasonable levels. At the same time, the fit to micro data deteriorates: we lose the
fit of our baseline model to the distributions of firm size by region.
   Finally, in a counterfactual experiment we explore the effects of wedges, which may re-
flect both frictions and policies, that restrict cross-regional factor flows. We consider the
extreme case of completely shutting down resources flows and moving to regional autarky
and show that this has interesting implications for regional aggregates, inequality, factor
prices, and TFP. In particular, a move to autarky would be associated with households in


                                               3
rural areas experiencing increases on average in consumption, income, wealth; increases in
labor and capital used locally; but decreases in the wage (and in the interest rates); and
drops in TFP. Local inequality also decreases. For urban areas it is the reverse though
notably the movements in each of these variables is much more extreme. Local inequality
increases substantially. At the national level, results are mixed: though aggregate consump-
tion, wealth, and capital decrease; labor supply, income, and TFP each increase. National
inequality increases, though by considerably less than in urban areas.
   The micro- and meso data we use here come from both the Townsend Thai Project and
a variety of secondary data sets. The Townsend Thai project began in 1997 and include two
provinces in the Central area near Bangkok which are relatively highly developed, industrial,
and two provinces in the more rural Northeast, largely agricultural but with small business
enterprise. The information gathered includes interviews with households, joint liability
groups, 1 village financial institutions, and key informants. There are annual and monthly
data that constitute an ongoing panel. The detailed monthly data allowed the creating of
complete household-level monthly financial accounts: accrued income, balance sheet and
statement of cash flow. See Samphantharak and Townsend (2009). From these village-level
income and product accounts, NIPA, balance of payments and flow of funds were created
(Paweenawat and Townsend, 2012). Secondary data include a Community Development
Department village level Census (CDD), Population Census, Labor Force Survey, and the
Socio-Economic survey (SES) on income and expenditure. In sum, we use data on many
different variables from a variety of different sources to motivate and discipline our theory,
big data motivating the theory so to speak. We report the Townsend Thai project in more
detail in section 2 below.
   We are of course joining others who have taken the route of exploring the implications
of meso data or of thinking about capital and labor flows. As Donaldson (2015) argues
in his review of the literature, much recent work in international trade exploits a funda-
mental symmetry between intra- and international trade, to learn about the fundamental
drivers of exchange of commodities among locations, whether across international borders or
not. A bit closer to our topic, there is a huge literature studying international capital flows
often stemming from differences in financial obstacles across countries. For example, Gour-
inchas and Jeanne (2013) study the negative correlation of TFP and capital flows among
OECD countries and identify a savings puzzle. Buera and Shin (2009) study differences in
the tightness of collateral financing constraints in the U.S. vs. emerging market countries:
heterogenous producers and an underdeveloped within-country capital market are used to


                                              4
explain the joint dynamics of TFP and cross-country capital flows.
       Our paper here is different from this work on trade and capital flows. In some ways we
are more limited. We focus on steady states rather than transition dynamics, which are hard
to compute for us given our realistic heterogeneity and variation in financial obstacles.3 But
part of this comes from our strength: we focus on varying types of diverse obstacles, not just
quantified cross-sectional difference in one supposed common obstacle but rather inferred
differences in obstacles from the micro data. We also examine within-country flow of funds
which arguably is a key measurement in mapping financial system of a given country. Finally
we couple this with a traditional development issue, labor migration and the composition
of the work force. Both capital and labor flows together are an integral part of the unified
conceptual framework of our model.
       Of course, in practice there are many other factors that distinguish cities from villages
and industrialized from agricultural areas (for example, cities have better infrastructure,
higher population density, and regions vary in resource base etc). While we consider these
factors to be of great importance for explaining inter-regional flow of funds, we purposely
exclude them from our theory and focus on differences in financial regimes only. This is
because of the question we are interested in: how large are the capital and labor flows that
arise from regional differences in financial regimes alone? In our model, without regional
differences in the financial regimes, urban and rural areas would be identical with no factor
flows occurring between the two regions. One of our main results is that we can generate
a number of observed rural-urban patterns by letting only the financial regime differ across
these areas.
       We begin in Section 2.1 with a somewhat detailed report on a series of separate papers
that use structural models in combination with diverse micro data from the Townsend Thai
project. Strikingly, there are common conclusions, despite the use of different data in each
study, different variables, and the use of different models: limited commitment or a buffer
stock model with credit limits is the prevalent financial friction in the Northeast region or in
   3
     An equilibrium in a heterogeneous agent models with financial frictions like ours is a fixed point in prices
such that factor markets clear. While solving for a stationary equilibrium is relatively straightforward, solving
for transition dynamics is challenging. This is because an equilibrium is a fixed point of an entire sequence
of prices (Buera and Shin, 2013). There are three main reasons why computing such transition dynamics are
hard in our setup. First, in contrast to the existing literature, our framework features two financial regimes
thereby doubling the computational burden of computing optimal policy functions for a given sequence of
prices. Second, the moral hazard regime is particularly computationally intensive. This is because as part
of the optimal contract we need to allow for lotteries to “convexify” the constraint (Phelan and Townsend,
1991). Third, the relevant state variable in the moral hazard regime – the joint distribution of wealth and
productivity – is extremely slow moving so the transitions are very slow and the price sequences that needs
to be iterated on are too long.


                                                       5
the rural areas, whereas moral hazard or other information problems are more pronounced
in the Central region or in the urban areas. The models and data used range from a model
of occupational choice and financing constraints in combination with the 1997 baseline and
retrospective data, to a theory of repayment rates among joint liability groups of a govern-
ment development bank disciplined by both the household data and a joint liability group
specialty survey, and a model of household/firm dynamics with variation in consumption,
income, capital and investment in the rural and urban surveys over multiple years.
    These papers using the Thai data are of course not the only papers trying to assess the
importance of various possible obstacles or to distinguish between them. Most of the existing
literature works with collateral constraints that are either explicitly or implicitly motivated
as arising from a limited commitment problem.4 In contrast, there are fewer studies that
model financial frictions as arising from moral hazard.5 But few authors use micro data
to discipline their macro models.6 Even fewer (perhaps none?) use micro data to choose
between the myriad of alternative forms of introducing a financial friction into their model.
    The microeconomic literature is somewhat more advanced in terms of taking seriously
different micro financial underpinnings and trying to distinguish between them in the data.
For example, Albuquerque and Hopenhayn (2004) and Clementi and Hopenhayn (2006) argue
that moral hazard and limited commitment have different implications for firm dynamics (see
also Schmid (2012)). Krueger and Perri (2011) compare and contrast the permanent income
hypothesis versus a model of self-insurance with borrowing constraints and conclude the
former explains the dynamics of their data better, and Broer (2013) compares a model with
self-insurance to one with limited enforcement. Abraham and Pavoni (2005), Doepke and
Townsend (2006) and Attanasio and Pavoni (2011) discuss how consumption allocations
differ under moral hazard with and without hidden savings versus full information.
    At the meso level we report what we know in Thailand in Section 2.2, namely factor
flows within Thailand. More generally, there is an existing (though limited) literature on
   4
     See e.g. Evans and Jovanovic (1989); Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian and Rosen (1994); Banerjee and Duflo
(2005); Jeong and Townsend (2007); Buera and Shin (2013); Buera, Kaboski and Shin (2011); Moll (2014);
Caselli and Gennaioli (2013); Midrigan and Xu (2014).

     Notable exceptions are the early contributions by Aghion and Bolton (1997) and Piketty (1997), and
Ghatak, Morelli and Sjostrom (2001). Also see Shourideh (2012). Related, some papers study environments
with asymmetric information and costly state verification (as in Townsend, 1979), but there are again few of
these (Castro, Clementi and Macdonald, 2009; Greenwood, Sanchez and Wang, 2010a,b; Cole, Greenwood
and Sanchez, 2012). Finally, Martin and Taddei (2012) study the implications of adverse selection on
macroeconomic aggregates, and contrast them with those of limited commitment. Of course, moral hazard
plays a lead role in the macro financial literature on regulation. See Kareken and Wallace (1978) onward to
the present day.
   6
     One exception is Midrigan and Xu (2014).


                                                     6
flow of funds within countries. Indeed the use of flow of funds accounts were central in
macroeconomics a few decades ago, as in the seminal work of Brainard and Tobin (1968)
and the contributions in Berg (1977). Unfortunately this had fallen out of fashion, until
recently.7 Using data from Mexico, an ongoing study by Serrano, Salazar-Altamirano and
Baez (2015) finds that municipalities (counties) with cities of more than 300,000 inhabitants
tend to borrow from municipalities with smaller or no cities. This is consistent with the
capital flows that arise in our model.8 Within-country labor migration, in contrast, is a
widely studied issue. We report, again in section 2.2, what we know from Thailand. More
generally, labor migration has been a key part of the development literature since the seminal
contributions of, e.g., Lewis (1954), Ranis and Fei (1961) and Harris and Todaro (1970).9
        The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes what we know from Thai data
about financial obstacles and meso-level factor flows. Section 3 develops our theory, and
section 4 discusses the calibration. Section 5 examines the flow of funds in an economy
where individuals in urban areas are subject to moral hazard and those in rural areas are
subject to limited commitment. Section 6 compares the model’s predictions to micro data
from Thailand, and Section 7 explains why different financial regimes across regions are
necessary. Section 8 discusses what would happen if the rural and urban areas stopped
trading with each other and moved to autarky, and Section 9 concludes.



2         Micro/Meso Data Motivate Key Model Ingredients

2.1        Micro Data and Financial Obstacles

Here we describe a series of papers using data from the Townsend Thai project that docu-
ment that even within a given economy, individuals face different types of financial frictions
depending on location. In particular, several studies using a variety of data, variables, and
approaches reach the same conclusion, namely that moral hazard problems are more pro-
nounced in the Central region and in urban areas whereas limited commitment is the relevant
    7
     See e.g. Chari (2012) and Carpenter et al. (2015).
    8
     There is relatively more work, following Feldstein and Horioka (1980), that tests whether there is a
correlation between regional saving and investment (with perfect capital markets this correlation should be
zero). For China Chan et al. (2011) find provincial-level savings investment correlations that are diminishing
over time, presumably due to increasing interprovincial flows. Studies from developed economies typically
find low correlation, presumably because capital markets are sufficiently advanced (see e.g. Sinn, 1992; Dekle,
1996).
   9
     Also see the more recent theoretical contribution by Lucas (2004). Kennan and Walker (2011) and Bryan
and Morten (2015) study internal migration, the former in the United States and the latter in Indonesia.

constraint in the Northeast region and in rural areas.
   All papers we describe below use data from the Townsend Thai project which first started
collecting data in 1997. The initial sample in 1997 was a stratified clustered selection of
villages, four randomly selected villages in each tambon (a small sub-county), 16 tambons
chosen at random with a province, and four provinces deliberately selected based on a
pre-existing socio-economic income and expenditure survey, the Thai SES survey, to take
advantage of existing government data. Two provinces were selected in the relatively poor
agrarian Northeast and two in the developed Central region near Bangkok, to make sure we
had cross-sectional variety of stages of development. Within each village, households were
selected at random from rosters held by the Headman. In addition to the household survey,
with 2,880 households, there are instruments for the headman in each of the 192 villages, 161
village-level institutions, 262 Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC)
joint liability groups, and 1,920 soil samples. The first collection of data was in April/May
of 1997. With the unanticipated Thai financial crisis, and the goal of assessing the impact of
this seemingly aggregate shock, we began in 1998 the first of many subsequent rural annual
resurveys in 4 tambons (16 villages) in each of the original four provinces, chosen at random.
The scale then expanded to more provinces, so as to be more nationally representative:
Two provinces in the South in 2003 and two in the North in 2004. An urban baseline and
subsequent annual resurveys were added beginning in 2006, in order to be able to compare
urban neighborhoods to villages in the same province. Finally, an intense monthly rural
survey began in August of 1998 in a subsample of the original 1997 baseline, 16 villages and
960 households, half in the Central region and half in the Northeast, to get the details on
labor supply, use of cash, crop production, and many other features that are only possible
to get accurately with frequent recall, high frequency data.
   Several papers make use of these data to infer financial obstacles on the ground. A
brief summary is as follows. Paulson, Townsend and Karaivanov (2006) estimate the finan-
cial/information regime in place in an occupation choice model and find that moral hazard
fits best in the more urbanized Central region while limited commitment regime fits best
in the more rural Northeast. Karaivanov and Townsend (2014) estimate the regime for
households running businesses and find that a moral hazard constrained financial regime fits
best in urban areas and a more limited savings regime in rural areas. Finally, Ahlin and
Townsend (2007) with alternative data find that information seems to be a problem in the
Central area, limited commitment in the Northeast.
   We now describe each of these papers in more detail. Paulson, Townsend and Karaivanov


                                              8
(2006) and Paulson and Townsend (2004) focus on occupation choice and financing. The
limited commitment model of Evans and Jovanovic (1989) and the moral hazard model
of Aghion and Bolton (1997) and Piketty (1997) are taken to data and compared. The
structural model delivers a mapping from prior wealth to eventual business entry, where
businesses include shops, restaurants, commercial shrimp, and dairy cattle. In more reduced
form analyses it is found that assets and borrowing are positively related in the Northeast and
negatively correlated in the Central region. The mapping and these reduced form findings
are consistent with limited commitment (if not a mixed regime) in the Northeast and moral
hazard in the central region. If the limited commitment constraint is binding, then as assets
increase, borrowing increases. If the moral hazard constraint is binding, then due to a debt
overhang problem, the higher are assets the more can be self-financed rather than borrowed,
alleviating constraints.
       Likewise, Ahlin and Townsend (2007) study loan performance and repayment using the
1997 baseline data on 226 joint liability groups of the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural
Cooperatives (BAAC) in addition to the household survey. Four separate types of models
are taken to the data on repayment difficulties and various correlates: a Besley and Coate
(1995) model of repayment without commitment but with punishment which determines a
“default region”; the Banerjee, Besley and Guinnane (1994) model of monitoring of some
borrowers in a copperative group by savers, which delivers a “monitoring equation”; a Stiglitz
(1990) model on joint project choice, which determines a project switch line; and a Ghatak
(1999) model of matching which determines a “selection equation.” The Ahlin and Townsend
(2007) paper again finds that information seems to be a problem in the Central area, limited
commitment in the Northeast.10
       Finally, Karaivanov and Townsend (2014) study dynamics of consumption, income, cap-
ital, and investment in the panel data of both the rural and urban data.11 They compare
a wide variety of financial information regimes: autarky, savings only or limited borrowing,
full borrowing/lending, moral hazard with observed or unobserved capital, and full insur-
  10
     Variables in the Northeast capturing village penalties are positively correlated with repayments. Vari-
ables in the Central region capturing the extent to which groups using screening in ex ante selection, the
extent of covariance in returns in the project selection model, and the ease of interim monitoring of borrowers
are each positively related with repayment.
  11
     Karaivanov and Townsend (2014) use data from both the rural Monthly Survey and the annual Urban
Survey. The rural data consists of a balanced panel of 531 rural households who run small businesses
observed for seven consecutive years, 1999 to 2005. From the Urban Survey which began later, in November
2005, they use a balanced panel of 475 households observed each year in the period 2005 to 2009 from the
same four provinces as in the rural data plus two more, Phrae province in the North of Thailand and Satun
province in the South.



                                                      9
ance. Roughly speaking maximum likelihood functions estimation chooses parameters of
preferences and technology to match model-generated histograms with those generated in
the actual data. A savings-only model fits best in the rural data and a moral hazard regime
fits best in the urban data.


2.2     Meso data and Factor Flows

Direct and indirect evidence suggest large flows of capital and labor.


Capital. We also have some measurement within Thailand of the flow of funds across re-
gions, the meso level variables we referred to earlier. Paweenawat and Townsend (2012) show
how to use the integrated household financial statements of Samphantharak and Townsend
(2009) to construct the production, income allocation, and savings-investment accounts at
the village level. The balance of payment accounts also follow. Srisaket, the most rural
areas of the sample has been running a balance of payments surplus. In contrast Buriram is
running consistent deficits, but on the other hand, this has become a newly urbanized area.
Though Chachoengsao in the Central region runs a surplus on average, the decline in income
due to a shrimp disease was accompanied with an externally financed capital inflow and in-
vestment, as households switched to new occupations without dropping consumption. More
generally, savings out of income across the villages is quite high relative to cross-country
data.12 We also know from SES data that 24-34 percent of the population receive remit-
tances and among these households remittances constitute 25-27 percent of their income
(Townsend, 2011, p.71, based on Yang, 2004).


Labor. The Thai Community Development Department (CDD) data for 1986 show that
the fraction of households with migrant laborers increases from 22 to 34 percent, 1986-1998.13
  12
     As already discussed in the introduction Feldstein and Horioka (1980) and a large literature building
on their approach test in cross country data whether investment and savings commove. To test whether a
similar pattern exists in our Thai village economies, Paweenawat and Townsend (2012) regress investment
on saving (including village fixed effects). Changing from the saving level narrowly defined, where savings
and investment are uncorrelated to “saving-plus-incoming-gifts,” the regression coefficient on broader savings
increases to 0.277, with a difference that is significant at the 5 percent level. These results suggest that the
capital markets across village economies are highly integrated.
  13
     As a fraction of individuals rather than households the numbers are naturally lower, from 8-12 percent.
The National Statistics Office (NSO) Labor Force Survey, LFS, shows 5% of individual men age 16-60 have
moved in the previous year alone; the total number of people living away from home or those who have moved
at least once in their life is arguably substantially higher but unfortunately cannot be directly observed in
LFW. The LFS also ignores large seasonal variation but this is arguably quite substantial. The monthly
data of rural Thailand we use in this paper shows that about half of adults (900 out of 1850) in the sample


                                                      10
Migration can be from rural to urban areas within a province, for example, as it was early
on, and the number and fraction of migrants leaving their region have increased over time.
By 1985-1990 the largest flows are from Northeast to Central region and to Bangkok. By
one estimate in 1990, the regional population as a percent of total population varies from
11% to 35% or put the other way around, migrants to total population vary from 65% to
89% (Figure 3.6 in Townsend, 2011, based on Kermel-Torrès, 2004).



3     Model
We consider an economy populated by a continuum of households of measure one, indexed
by i ∈ [0, 1] and a continuum of intermediaries, indexed by j. As we explain in more detail
below, a fraction ϑ of households live in urban areas and are subject to moral hazard and
the remaining fraction 1 − ϑ live in rural areas and are subject to limited commitment.14
Time is discrete. In each period t, a household experiences two shocks: an ability shock, zit
and an additional “residual productivity” shock, εit (more on this below). Households have
preferences over consumption, cit and effort, eit
                                                    ∞
                                                    X
                                         vi0 = E0         β t u(cit , eit ).
                                                    t=0


Households can access the capital market of the economy only via one of the intermediaries.
Each intermediary contracts with a continuum of households and therefore also provides
some insurance to households. Intermediaries compete ex-ante for the right to contract
with households. Once a household i decides to contract with an intermediary j, he sticks
with that intermediary forever. At the same time, we assume that intermediaries can poach
customers from each other based on their observable characteristics (talent and wealth).
This means that for each such group of customers, net resource flows into the intermediary
must be zero.
    Households have some initial wealth ai0 and an income stream {yit }∞
                                                                       t=0 (determined be-
low). When households contract with an intermediary, they give their entire initial wealth
experienced at least one migration during 1998 and 2003. We can observe the period they left the villages
and the period they returned home. Actually, the average duration of temporal migration for those who
complete temporal migration during the survey is 5.6 months, which is short (Yamada, 2005).
  14
     To be clear, note that we focus on the equilibrium interaction of financial frictions rather than the
interaction of financial frictions at the individual level, i.e. the effect of subjecting a given individual to
the two frictions at the same time (see e.g. Paulson, Townsend and Karaivanov, 2006). In principle, our
apparatus is flexible enough to also conduct the latter exercise.


                                                      11
and income stream to the intermediary. The intermediary pools the income of all the house-
holds it contracts with, invests it at a risk-free interest rate rt , and transfers some con-
sumption to the households. An intermediary together with the continuum of households
it contracts with therefore forms a mutual fund or a “risk-sharing group”: some of each
household’s risk is shared with the other households in the group according to an optimal
contract specified below. Denote by ajt and yjt the pooled wealth and income in risk-sharing
group j (that is, run by intermediary j). Then the risk-sharing group’s budget constraint is

                                    ajt+1 = yjt − cjt + (1 + rt )ajt .                                  (1)

The optimal contract between intermediary and households maximizes the households’ utility
subject to this budget constraint (and incentive constraints specified below). Because net
resource flows into the intermediary must be zero for each group of individuals with the
same observed characteristics (here wealth ait and talent zit ), this problem is equivalent
to maximizing expected utility for each of these groups. Risk-sharing groups make their
decisions taking as given current and future time profiles of wages wt and interest rates rt
respectively and compete with each other in competitive labor and capital markets. Mostly,
however, one treats these factor prices as a constant (over time), namely wage and interest
rate w and r respectively. We here assume that the economy is in a stationary equilibrium
so that factor prices are constant over time. Again, this is mainly for simplicity. Our setup
can easily be extended to the case where aggregates vary deterministically over time at the
expense of some extra notation.


3.1     Household’s Problem

Households can either be entrepreneurs or workers. We denote by xit = 1 the choice of being
an entrepreneur and by xit = 0 that of being a worker. First, consider entrepreneurs. An
entrepreneur hires labor `it at a wage wt and rents capital kit at a rental rate rt + δ and
produces some output.15 His observed productivity has two components: a component, zit ,
that is known by the entrepreneur in advance at the time he decides how much capital and
labor to hire, and a residual component, εit , that is realized afterwards. We will call the first
  15
    We assume that capital is owned and accumulated by a capital producing sector. This sector rents
out capital to entrepreneurs in a capital rental market, and also holds the net debt of households (or more
precisely, of the risk-sharing groups the households belong to) between periods. See Appendix B for details.
That the rental rate equals rt + δ follows from a standard arbitrage argument. This way of stating the
problem avoids carrying capital, kit , as a state variable in the dynamic program of a risk-sharing group.



                                                    12
component entrepreneurial ability and the second residual productivity. The evolution of en-
trepreneurial talent is exogenous and given by some stationary transition process µ(zit+1 |zit ).
Residual productivity instead depends on an entrepreneur’s effort, eit , which is potentially
unobserved, depending on the financial regime. More precisely, his effort determines the
distribution p(εit |eit ) from which residual productivity is drawn, with higher effort making
good realizations more likely. We assume that intermediaries can insure residual productiv-
ity εit . In contrast, even if entrepreneurial ability, zit , is observed, it is not contractible and
hence cannot be insured. An entrepreneur’s output is given by

                                                  zit εit f (kit , `it ),

where f (k, `) is a span-of-control production function.
       Next, consider workers. A worker sells efficiency units of labor εit in the labor market
at wage wt . Efficiency units are observed but are stochastic and depend on the worker’s
true underlying effort, with distribution p(εit |eit ).16 The worker’s true underlying effort is
potentially unobserved, depending on the financial regime. A worker’s ability is fixed over
time and identical across workers, normalized to unity.
       Putting everything together, the income stream of a household is

                    yit = xit [zit εit f (kit , `it ) − wt `it − (rt + δ)kit ] + (1 − xit )wt εit .    (2)

The joint budget constraint of the risk-sharing group consisting of households and inter-
mediary is given by (1) where yjt is the sum over yit of all households that contract with
intermediary j.
       The timing is illustrated in Figure 1 and is as follows: the household comes into the period




                                                Figure 1: Timing

with previously determined savings ait and a draw of entrepreneurial talent zit . Then within
  16
    The assumption that the distribution of workers’ efficiency units p(·|eit ) is the same as that of en-
trepreneurs’ residual productivity is made solely for simplicity, and we could easily allow workers and en-
trepreneurs to draw from different distributions at the expense of some extra notation.

                                                           13
period t, the contract between household and intermediary assigns occupational choice xit ,
effort, eit , and – if the chosen occupation is entrepreneurship – capital and labor hired, kit
and `it , respectively. All these choices are conditional on talent zit and assets carried over
from the last period, ait . Next, residual productivity, εit , is realized which depends on effort
through the conditional distribution p(εit |eit ). Finally, the contract assigns the household’s
consumption and savings, that is functions cit (εit ) and ait+1 (εit ). The household’s effort
choice eit may be unobserved depending on the regime we study. All other actions of the
household are observed. For instance, there are no hidden savings.
   We now write the problem of a risk-sharing group, consisting of a household and an
intermediary, in recursive form. The two state variables are wealth, a, and entrepreneurial
ability, z. Recall that z evolves according to some exogenous Markov process µ(z 0 |z). It will
be convenient below to define the household’s expected continuation value by
                                                                  X
                                             Ez0 v(a0 , z 0 ) =        v(a0 , z 0 )µ(z 0 |z),
                                                                  z0


where the expectation is over z 0 . A contract between a household of type (a, z) and an
intermediary solves
                                    X
                                        p(ε|e) u[c(ε), e] + βEz 0 v[a0 (ε), z 0 ]

  v(a, z) =         max                                                                         s.t.   (3)
              x,e,k,`,c(ε),a0 (ε)
                                    ε
  X                            X
        p(ε|e) c(ε) + a0 (ε) =
              
                                 p(ε|e) {x[zεf (k, `) − w` − (r + δ)k] + (1 − x)wε} + (1 + r)a         (4)
    ε                                    ε


and also subject to regime-specific constraints specified below.
   The contract maximizes a household’s expected utility subject to a break-even constraint
for the intermediary. This is because competition by intermediaries for households ensures
that any intermediary has zero net capital inflows in expectation. Note that the budget
constraint of a risk syndicate (4) averages over realizations of ε; it does not have to hold
separately for every realization of ε. This is because the contract between the household and
the intermediary has an insurance aspect and there are a continuum of households, hence
no group aggregate risk. This insurance also implies that consumption at the individual
level can be different from income less than savings. Such an insurance arrangement can
be “decentralized” in various ways. The intermediary could simply make state-contingent
transfers to the household. Alternatively, intermediaries can be interpreted as banks that
offer savings accounts with state-contingent interest payments to households.
   In contrast to residual productivity ε, talent z is assumed to not be insurable. Prior to


                                                                  14
the realization of ε, the contract specifies consumption and savings that are contingent on ε,
c(ε) and a0 (ε). In contrast, consumption and savings cannot be contingent on next period’s
talent realization z 0 .17
       The contract between intermediaries and households is subject to one of two frictions:
private information in the form of moral hazard or limited commitment. Each friction
corresponds to a regime-specific constraint that is added to the dynamic program (3) and
(4). For sake of simplicity and to isolate the economic mechanisms at work, the only thing
that varies across the two regimes is the financial friction. It would be easy to incorporate
some differences, say in the stochastic processes for ability z and residual productivity ε at
the expense of some extra notation. We specify the two financial regimes in turn.


3.2       Urban Areas: Moral Hazard

In this regime, effort e is unobserved. Since the distribution of residual productivity, p(ε|e)
depends on effort, this gives rise to a standard moral hazard problem: full insurance against
residual productivity shocks would induce the household to shirk, to exert suboptimal effort.
The contract takes this into account in terms of an incentive-compatibility constraint:
  X                                                     X
         p(ε|e) {u[c(ε), e] + βEz0 v[a0 (ε), z 0 ]} ≥       p(ε|ê) {u[c(ε), ê] + βEz0 v[a0 (ε), z 0 ]} ∀e, ê. (5)
    ε                                                   ε


This constraint ensures that the value to the household of choosing the effort level assigned
by the contract, e, is at least as large as that of any other effort, ê. The optimal dynamic
contract in the presence of moral hazard solves (3) subject (4) and the additional constraint
(5). As already mentioned, to fix ideas, we would like to think of this regime as representing
the prevalent form of financial contracts in urban and industrialized areas.
       Relative to existing theories of firm dynamics with moral hazard, our formulation in (5)
is special in that only entrepreneurial effort is unobserved. In contrast capital stocks can
be observed and a change in an entrepreneur’s capital stock does not change his incentive
to shirk. More precisely, the distribution of relative output obtained from two different
effort levels does not depend on the level of capital. This is a result of two assumptions:
that output depends on residual productivity ε in a multiplicative fashion, and that the
  17
     The above dynamic program could be modified to allow for talent to be insured as follows: allow agents
to trade in assets whose payoff is contingent on the realization of next period’s talent z 0 . On the left-hand
side of the budget constraint (4), instead of a0 (ε), we would write a0 (ε, z 0 ) and sum these over future states
z 0 using the probabilities µ(z 0 |z) so that z 0 does not appear as a state variable next period, as its realization
is completely insured and that insurance is embedded in the resource constraint.


                                                         15
distribution of residual productivity p(ε|e) does not depend on capital (i.e. it is not given
by p(ε|e, k)). We focus on this instructive special case because – as we will show below – it
illustrates in a transparent fashion that moral hazard does not necessarily result in capital
misallocation but that it can nevertheless have negative effects on aggregate productivity,
GDP and welfare.
       The literature on optimal dynamic contracts under private information typically makes
use of an alternative formulation which uses promised utility as a state variable (Spear and
Srivastava, 1987) and features a “promise-keeping” constraint, neither of which are present
here. The connection between this formulation and ours is as follows. Consider first a special
case with no ability (z) shocks, and only residual productivity (ε) shocks. In this case, the
two formulations are equivalent, a result that we establish in Appendix C. In this sense, the
insurance arrangement regarding ε-shocks is optimal (again taking all paths of interest rates
and wages as fixed) . The equivalence between the two formulations no longer holds in the
case with both z-shocks and ε-shocks. This is because we rule out insurance against z-shocks
by assumption, whereas an optimal dynamic contract would allow for such insurance.18 We
would like to reiterate, however, that we do not limit insurance arrangements regarding ε-
shocks, as shown by the equivalence with an optimal dynamic contract in the absence of
z-shocks.
       When solving the problem (3) to (5) numerically, we allow for lotteries in the optimal
contract to “convexify” the constraint set as in Phelan and Townsend (1991). See Appendix
D.1 for the statement of the problem (3) to (5) with lotteries.


3.3       Rural Areas: Limited Commitment

In this regime, effort e is observed. Therefore, there is no moral hazard problem and the
contract consequently provides perfect insurance against residual productivity shocks, ε.
Instead we assume that the friction takes the form of a simple collateral constraint:

                                            k ≤ λa,       λ ≥ 1.                                         (6)
  18
     To see the lack of insurance against z-shocks, consider the case where residual productivity shocks
are shut down, ε = 1 with probability one. Then our formulation is an income fluctuations problem,
like Schechtman and Escudero (1977), Aiyagari (1994) or other Bewley models. One reason we rule out
insurance against z-shocks is that this assumption allows for a determinate stationary wealth distribution in
the absence of moral hazard or limited commitment. In that case, if z-shocks were insurable, the economy
would aggregate to a neoclassical growth model and in steady state only aggregate wealth (but not its
distribution) would be determined. That being said, in principle, we could handle insurance against z
shocks as described in footnote 17.


                                                     16
This form of constraint has been frequently used in the literature on financial frictions (see,
for example, Evans and Jovanovic, 1989; Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian and Rosen, 1994; Banerjee
and Duflo, 2005; Paulson, Townsend and Karaivanov, 2006; Buera and Shin, 2013; Moll,
2014; Midrigan and Xu, 2014). It can be motivated as a limited commitment constraint.19
The exact form of the constraint is chosen for simplicity. Some readers may find it more
natural if the constraint were to depend on talent k ≤ λ(z)a as well. This would be relatively
easy to incorporate, but others have shown that this affects results mainly quantitatively
but not qualitatively (Buera, Kaboski and Shin, 2011; Moll, 2014). The assumption that
talent z is stochastic but cannot be insured makes sure that collateral constraints bind for
some individuals at all points in time. If instead talent were fixed over time for example,
individuals would save themselves out of collateral constraints over time (Banerjee and Moll,
2010).
       The optimal contract in the presence of limited commitment solves (3) subject to (4) and
the additional constraint (6).


3.4       Factor Demands and Supplies

Risk-sharing groups interact in competitive labor and capital markets, taking as given the
sequences of wages and interest rates. Denote by kj (a, z; w, r) and `j (a, z; w, r) the common
(across risk-sharing groups) optimal capital and labor demands of households with current
state (a, z) in regime j ∈ {M H, LC}. A worker supplies ε efficiency units of labor to the
labor market, so labor supply of a cohort (a, z) is
                                                               X
                           nj (a, z; w, r) ≡ [1 − xj (a, z)]       p(ε|ej (a, z))ε.                        (7)
                                                               ε


Note that we multiply by the indicator for being a worker, 1 − x, so as to only pick up the
efficiency units of labor by the fraction of the cohort who decide to be workers. Finally,
individual capital supply is simply a household’s wealth, a.
  19
    Consider an entrepreneur with wealth a who rents k units of capital. The entrepreneur can steal a
fraction 1/λ of rented capital. As a punishment, he would lose his wealth. In equilibrium, the financial
intermediary will rent capital up to the point where individuals would just be on the margin of having an
incentive to steal the rented capital, implying a collateral constraint k/λ ≤ a or k ≤ λa. Alternatively, we
could have worked with a more full-blown dynamic limited commitment problem as is common in the optimal
contracting literature (for example Albuquerque and Hopenhayn, 2004). We choose to work with collateral
constraints, mainly because it facilitates comparison with the existing literature, and it also simplifies some
of the computations.




                                                      17
3.5    Equilibrium

We use the saving policy functions a0 (ε) and the transition probabilities µ(z 0 |z) to construct
transition probabilities Pr(a0 , z 0 |a, z; j) in the two regimes j ∈ {M H, LC}. In the computa-
tions we discretize the state space for wealth, a, and talent, z, so this is a simple Markov
transition matrix. Given these transition probabilities and initial distributions gj,0 (a, z), we
then obtain the sequence {gj,t (a, z)}∞
                                      t=0 from


                            gj,t+1 (a0 , z 0 ) = Pr(a0 , z 0 |a, z; j)gj,t (a, z).           (8)

Note that we cannot guarantee that the process for wealth and ability (8) has a unique and
stable stationary distribution. While the process is stationary in the z-dimension (recall that
the process for z, µ(z 0 |z), is exogenous and a simple stationary Markov chain), the process
may be non-stationary or degenerate in the a-dimension. That is, there is the possibility
that the wealth distribution either fans out forever or collapses to a point mass. Similarly,
there may be multiple stationary equilibria. In the examples we have computed, these issues
do however not seem to be a problem and (8) always converges, and from different initial
distributions.
    Once we have found a stationary distribution of states from (8), we check that markets
clear and otherwise iterate. Denote the stationary distributions of ability and wealth in
regime j by Gj (a, z). Then the labor and capital market clearing conditions are
              ˆ                                              ˆ

and that effort, e, can take values in some bounded interval [e, ē]. The parameter σ is the
inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution and also the coefficient of relative risk
aversion. The parameter ϕ is the Frisch elasticity of labor supply.20 The production function
is Cobb-Douglas

We assume that α + γ < 1 so that entrepreneurs have a limited span of control and pos-
itive profits. We assume the following transition process µ(z 0 |z) for entrepreneurial ability
following Buera, Kaboski and Shin (2011) and Buera and Shin (2013): with probability ρ a
household keeps its current ability z; with probability 1 − ρ it draws a new entrepreneurial
ability from a discretized version of a truncated Pareto distribution whose CDF is21

                                                        1 − (z/z)−ζ
                                             Ψ(z) =                  ,
                                                        1 − (z̄/z)−ζ

where z and z̄ are the lower and upper bounds on ability. We further assume that residual
productivity takes two possible values ε ∈ {εL , εH } and that the probability of the good
draw depends on effort as follows:

                                                          1    e−e
                                        p(εH |e) = (1 − θ) + θ        .
                                                          2    ē − e

The parameter θ ∈ (0, 1) controls the sensitivity of the residual productivity distribution
with respect to effort (and recall that e and ē are the lower and upper bounds on effort).
Note that under full insurance against ε, what matters for the incentive of a household as
agent to exert effort is only θ relative to the disutility parameter χ. That is, since χ scales
  20
      Our numerical results were computed using the separable utility function in (11). It is well-known that
in moral hazard problems, the functional form of the utility function can be important, in particular whether
it is separable. To explore this, we have also computed results for the case where the utility function takes
the non-separable form proposed by Greenwood, Hercowitz and Huffman (1988), i.e. there is no wealth
effect. This matters for some results but not for others. For example, the occupational choice patterns in
the MH regime are now different because there is no longer a wealth effect making rich individuals less likely
to exert effort and hence less likely to be entrepreneurs. It should also be relatively easy to compute results
for alternative (say CES) production functions, and talent and residual productivity distributions, but we
do not have any strong reasons to believe that these would yield different results.
   21
      The probability distribution of z 0 conditional on z is therefore µ(z 0 |z) = ρδ(z 0 − z) + (1 − ρ)ψ(z 0 ) where
δ(· − z) is the Dirac delta function centered at z and ψ(z) = Ψ0 (z) is the PDF corresponding to Ψ.

Calibrated Parameter Values Table 1 summarizes the parameter values we use in our
numerical experiments. We split the parameter values into two groups, corresponding to
panels A and B in the table. Those in the first group (panel A) are taken from other studies.
Those in the second group (panel B) are internally calibrated with a mean squared error
metric against regional aggregates, as we describe below. This division has in part to do with
the confidence we can place in earlier estimates in the literature and our desire to calibrate
ourselves key parameters that have to do with the damage caused by the various obstacles to
trade. We also wanted to limit the number of free parameters to no more than the moments
in the data we try to fit.22

standard values in the literature.23 The coefficients on capital and labor are 0.3 and 0.4,
coming from those in Paweenawat and Townsend (2012) and Banerjee, Breza and Townsend
(2016). This implies returns to scale equal to α + γ = 0.7 which is close to values considered
in the literature.24 The one-year depreciation rate is set at δ = 0.08.
    Two other parameters that are given here, z and εH , are normalizations that take on
meaning when their counterpart is calibrated below. Specifically the lower bound on en-
trepreneurial talent is set to z = 1 and the upper bound on talent is calibrated below;
likewise we set the value of the high residual productivity draw to εH = 2, and the lower
productivity draw is calibrated below. Finally we set the population fraction in urban areas
to ϑ = .3. This number comes from the Housing and Population Census of Thailand for
the year 2000 which reports an urban population share of .31 and we rounded this number
consistent with grids on the fraction ϑ we have been using.
    For our own calibration here we use a method of moments type estimation, that is
find parameter values which minimize a weighted normalized difference between certain key
regional aggregates in the model and the data. These are summarized in Table 2. We
here provide a brief overview and Appendix E provides additional details. The data for
income, (nondurable) consumption, capital and wealth come from the monthly data of the
Townsend Thai project, where we have complete financial accounts, as described earlier.
The difference between capital and wealth (net worth) is that the former is machinery and
  23
     Perhaps the most challenging among these is the Frisch elasticity ϕ. For instance Shimer (2010) argues
that a range of 1/2 to 4 covers most values that either micro- and macroeconomists would consider reasonable
(ϕ = 4 corresponds to the value in Prescott (2004)). Bonhomme et al. (2012) find even lower values in direct
use of the monthly labor data.
  24
     For example, Buera, Kaboski and Shin (2011) and Buera and Shin (2013) set returns to scale equal to
0.79.

equipment used in agricultural and business, excluding land whereas the latter covers all
assets and all liabilities. We distinguish the central developed region from the less developed
Northeast. Roughly, the variables are anywhere from 2 to 4 times larger in the Central region
(reported more precisely below).25 The means we analyze are time and household averages.
Of course there are outliers which influence the means so we have winsorized all variables
at the 95% level, except for capital, which has more extreme values, so we winsorized at the
90% level.
       The numbers for income, capital, and consumption in Table 2 are in nominal Thai baht
and we convert to model units by normalizing by income in the Central (moral hazard)
region, as we do in the model simulation. We also try to match only relative wealth, the
ratio of Northeast (rural) to Central (urban) since we remain worried about the levels which
as noted include land, something the model does not have. The percentage of entrepreneurs is
from the annual urban vs rural resurveys (de la Huerta, 2011) and requires no normalization.
The percentages are high, and surprisingly higher in rural areas relative to urban (though
rural includes farms). To summarize this discussion and calibration, and to report precise
values, the eight moments we attempt to match are in Table 2.
       A quick summary of the fitted values against the targets should include the fact that the
ratio of rural to urban income is about 1/4 in the data and 1/3 in the model.26 Consumption
in rural areas is close when comparing the model to the data, in urban areas less so. The
capital to income ratio in the model is high relative to the data in the Central region and lower
in the Northeast. Yet we do reasonably well with the relative wealth ratio, despite putting
lower weight on this moment. We are somewhat underpredicting the level of enterprise,
especially in rural areas (as anticipated).
       The best fitting parameter values are those in panel B of Table 1. The value for risk
aversion σ = 2.3 is in a reasonable range, in particular it is within the range estimated by
Chiappori et al. (2014) for Thailand. As noted earlier, under full insurance against ε only
the ratio of labor disutility to the productivity of effort matters, namely χ̃ = χ/θ matters
and our calibrated value of 0.89/0.44 = 2.02 lies in the range usually considered in the
literature.27
  25
      We have also checked these numbers against the annual urban vs annual rural data, and that the overall
patterns are similar, as are income and consumption in the Socio-Economic Survey (SES).
   26
      The model has a hard time getting close and we backed off setting the weight on this to one in our
calibration as it was driving other results.
   27
      The macroeconomics literature typically assumes that θ = 1 so that effort translates one for one into
efficiency units of labor. In this case χ̃ = χ and only this utility shifter has to be calibrated. See for example
Prescott (2004) and Shimer (2010) who use a similar value for χ̃ as we do.



                                                       22
       Next consider the parameters governing the ability and residual productivity processes.
The persistence of entrepreneurial talent is calibrated at ρ = 0.82. This is consistent with
empirical estimates (Gourio, 2008; Collard-Wexler, Asker and DeLoecker, 2011), and similar
to the parameter value used by Midrigan and Xu (2014) (0.74, see their Table 2). We
calibrate the tail parameter of the talent distribution to ζ = 1.17 which is only slightly
higher than what would correspond to Zipf’s law if the Pareto distribution were unbounded.
The upper bound of talent z̄ is 4.7 times the lower bound z. This talent range is in line with
that typically considered in the literature (for example see Buera and Shin, 2013; Buera,
Kaboski and Shin, 2011, although their Pareto distributions feature thinner tails).
       Finally, for our benchmark numerical results, we calibrated the key parameter λ gov-
erning the tightness of the collateral constraints, equation (6), to λ = 1.80. In our limited
commitment economy, this results in an external finance to GDP ratio of 2.057 which is
close to the values of the 2011 external finance to GDP ratios of Thailand (1.963) and China
(2.033).28



5        Flow of Funds and the Equilibrium Interaction of
         Financial Frictions

5.1       Interregional Flow of Funds

At these calibrated parameter values we compute the model’s steady state. See Appendix D
for details on the computations. We feature in Table 3 the variables for each of the two regions
separately, the overall economy-wide average, using population weights, and especially the
flow of capital and labor across regions. As is evident in Table 3 the (urban) MH area
has higher values of income, capital, labor, consumption, and wealth than the (rural) LC
area.29 All variables are expressed as ratios to the corresponding first-best values, each line,
  28
      These numbers are from Beck, Demirguc-Kunt and Levine (2000). External finance is defined to be the
sum of private credit, private bond market capitalization, and stock market capitalization. This definition
follows Buera, Kaboski and Shin (2011). See also their footnote 9.
   29
      Table 3 also reports numbers for aggregate and regional total factor productivity (TFP), a commonly
reported statistic in the macro-development literature. Aggregate TFP is computed as T F P = Y /(K ν L1−ν )
                                                                                                    α
where Y is aggregate output, K is the aggregate capital stock, L is aggregate labor and ν = α+γ        . Regional
TFP is computed in an analogous fashion. Somewhat surprisingly regional TFP in the LC region is 104
percent of first-best TFP. This is due to a better selection of entrepreneurs in terms of their productivity. This
is despite one force that lowers productivity under LC, namely, talented entrepreneurs who are constrained
by wealth. On the other hand, a force for lower productivity in the MH region is the lower effort due to that
moral hazard. Of course the distribution of firm level TFP is masked by the aggregation. More detailed
results available upon request.

one at time. The first-best economy eliminates the limited commitment and moral hazard
constraints in rural and urban areas, respectively, so they are identical and thus have the
same variable values – region labels loose any meaning in the first-best as one third of the
economy is just a clone of the other two thirds. In contrast, with the obstacles included,
we see in Table 3 the additional implication that the urban area consistently has values
higher than those of the rural area, i.e. more activity is concentrated there than in the
first-best, and less in the rural area. The top part of the table is thus a tell-tale indicator
of the relatively dramatic interregional flows at the bottom of the table. Urban areas are
importing 23% of the overall capital utilized and 75% of the labor. Likewise rural areas are
exporting 39% of their capital and 86% of their labor. This is consistent with the direct
and indirect evidence reported earlier in Section 2.2. Equivalently urban areas are 79% of
the economy’s capital and 65% of its labor even though they account for only 30% of the
population.30
       There are of course many other factors that distinguish cities from villages and indus-
trialized from agricultural areas, and we listed some of these in the introduction. While
we consider these other factors to be of great importance for explaining inter-regional flow
of funds, we purposely exclude them from our theory and focus on differences in financial
regimes only, in effect conducting an experiment that makes use of the model structure and
  30
     Our preferred interpretation of the labor flows from rural to urban areas is as temporary migration
which is a particularly wide-spread phenomenon in developing countries (see e.g. Morten, 2013). This
interpretation is consistent with our assumption that individuals are subject to the financial regime of their
region of origin rather than their workplace (e.g. individuals from the LC (rural) area are subject to limited
commitment and perfect risk-sharing of residual productivity even though they work in the MH area (city)).
An interesting extension would be to examine the feedback from temporary migration to participation in
risk-sharing arrangements back in the village as in Morten (2013).



                                                                        24
answers the following question: how large are the capital and labor flows that arise from re-
gional differences in financial regime alone? Our framework generates a number of observed
rural-urban patterns by letting only the financial regime differ across these regions. In our
model, without regional differences in the financial regimes, urban and rural areas would be
identical with no factor flows occurring between the two regions.
       To explain why this is happening we proceed in steps, first looking at the interest rate,
then the occupation choices and related variables in each region at the equilibrium interest
rate and wage (and of course at our calibrated parameter values).


5.2       Determination of the Equilibrium Interest Rate

The interest rate is depressed relative to the rate of time preference in both regions but as we
shall now see, there are pressures for it to be far lower in the LC rural area, if the domestic
economy were not open across regions.31
       Figure 2 graphically examines how the aggregate demand for and supply of capital at
various parametric interest rates, as if the regions were open to the rest of the world, and
thus illustrates the determination of the equilibrium interest rate (as in Aiyagari, 1994) for
each region separately, where the curves cross, as if it were a closed economy (no regional
nor international capital flows). Panel (a) plots capital demand and supply for the moral
hazard regime (solid lines) and contrasts them with demand and supply in the “first-best”
economy without moral hazard (dashed lines). For each value of the interest rate, the wage
is recalculated so as to clear the labor market. Panel (b) repeats the same exercise for the
limited commitment regime. The first-best demand and supply (the dashed lines) are the
same in the two panels and serve as a benchmark to assess the differential effects of the two
frictions on the interest rate.
       Consider first the moral hazard economy in panel (a). Relative to the first-best, moral
hazard depresses capital demand for all relevant values of the interest rate. This is because
moral hazard results in entrepreneurs and workers exerting suboptimal effort which depresses
the marginal productivity of capital. The effect of moral hazard on capital supply is ambigu-
ous and differs according to the value of the interest rate. It turns out that this ambiguity is
the result of a direct effect and a counteracting general equilibrium effect operating through
  31
    Some readers may wonder about its level, namely why real interest rates are negative. Interest rates
are bounded below by −δ and negative real interest rates due to depressed credit demand are a common
feature of models with collateral constraints (Buera and Shin, 2013; Buera, Kaboski and Shin, 2011; Guerrieri
and Lorenzoni, 2011). That being said, many alternative parameterizations (in particular those with lower
discount factor β) feature positive interest rates.

wages. For a given fixed wage, moral hazard always decreases capital supply, i.e. capital
supply shifts to the left. This is due to a well-known result: the inverse Euler equation of
Rogerson (1985) which states that the optimal contract under moral hazard discourages sav-
ing whenever the incentive compatibility constraint (5) binds and hence results in individuals
being saving constrained (see also Ligon, 1998; Golosov, Kocherlakota and Tsyvinski, 2003).
Lemma 1 in Appendix F.1 derives the appropriate variant of this result for our framework
and discusses the intuition in more detail.32 But counteracting this negative effect on capital
supply is a positive general equilibrium effect: labor demand and hence the wage fall relative
to the first best, resulting in more entry into entrepreneurship, higher aggregate profits and
higher savings.33 The overall effect is ambiguous, and in our computations capital supply
shifts to the right for some values of the interest rate and to the left for others.
                    Contrast this with the limited commitment economy in panel (b). Under limited com-
mitment, capital demand shifts to the left whereas capital supply shifts to the right. The
drop in capital demand is a direct effect of the constraint (6), and it is considerably larger
than the demand drop under moral hazard. That capital supply shifts to the right is due to
increased self-financing of entrepreneurs (Buera, Kaboski and Shin, 2011; Buera and Shin,
2013, among others). As a result the interest rate drops considerably relative to the first-
best, and more so than under moral hazard. Obviously the size of this drop depends on the
parameter λ which governs how binding the limited commitment problem is. The value we
               32
     In line with the inverse Euler equation, the finding that the introduction of moral hazard reduces capital
supply for a given wage and interest rate is present in all our numerical examples.
  33
     Lower wages also lead workers to save less but this effect is negligible in all our computations.



                                                                                  26
use in the figure is the one we calibrate, 1.80, but our findings are qualitatively unchanged
for many different values of λ.
       The finding that the equilibrium interest rate is lower under limited commitment than
under moral hazard is present in all our numerical experiments and under a big variety
of alternative parameterizations we have tried. In particular, and as discussed in Section
4, the value for λ can be mapped to data on external finance to GDP ratios. That the
interest rate under limited commitment is lower than that under moral hazard is true for
all values of λ that are consistent with external finance to GDP ratios for low and middle
income countries.34 This is not surprising, given that Figure 2 suggests that there are some
strong forces pushing in this direction. Foremost among these is that, under moral hazard,
individuals are savings constrained which, all else equal, pushes up the interest rate; in
contrast, limited commitment results in higher savings due to self-financing which pushes
down interest rates. Also going in this direction is that in practice, limited commitment
results in a greater drop in capital demand than moral hazard.35
       The bottom line from this analysis of the interest rate is that when the two regions are
opened to capital (and labor) movements, capital flows toward what would have been the
higher interest rate region, namely the MH urban area.36 Labor is complementary with
capital and so the wage would have been higher in the MH urban area, too, if it were not
for labor flows.



6        Back to the Micro Data
The model has implications not only for meso variables such as regional variables and in-
terregional resource flows but also for micro level data. We first check on model generated
  34
      In contrast, it is easy to see that for unrealistically large values of λ, the limited commitment interest rate
will necessarily be higher than that under limited commitment. This is because as λ → ∞, the equilibrium
under limited commitment approaches the first-best (the intersection of the dashed lines) which features an
interest rate that is strictly larger than that under moral hazard.
   35
      As already noted above, the demand drop under limited commitment is relatively large for values of the
parameter λ consistent with external finance to GDP ratios observed in the data. Similarly, the size of the
demand drop under moral hazard is always relatively small, except when residual productivity is extremely
responsive to individuals’ effort choice (both the support [εL , εH ] is large and θ is high).
   36
      Note that we assume throughout that, although there may be cross-regional factor flows, the economy is
closed to the rest of the world. See the market clearing condition 9. Of course, in reality the Thai economy
is not a closed economy. An extreme alternative would be to model a small open economy where individuals
can borrow and lend at a fixed world interest rate of r∗ = 1/β − 1. Under this alternative assumption, the
limited commitment (rural) area would experience massive capital outflows, and in particular ones that are
larger than the ones for the moral hazard (urban) area. In reality, the Thai economy is likely somewhere
intermediate between these two extremes, so that the insights from the closed economy carry over.

output for some of the micro facts which led to our choices of financial regimes, and then to
“out of sample” predictions, looking at variables we have not heretofore explored.
   First, in terms of adopted underpinnings we see in Figure 3 that borrowing is increasing in
wealth for the limited commitment regimes, at least at lower to mid-range values for wealth
(before a wealth effect on leisure kicks, resulting in lower effort, firm productivity, and indeed
entrepreneurship as in Figure 4). For the moral hazard regime, there is no relation between
wealth and borrowing in this range, that is, non-increasing. Consistent with this, Paulson
and Townsend (2004) found strictly increasing patterns in the Northeast and decreasing
patterns in the Central regional data.

            Another implication of the model is displayed in Figure 5, the high degree of persistence
of capital in the limited commitment regime relative to the moral hazard regime. Karaivanov
and Townsend (2014) found that the high degree of persistence in the rural data (see their
Figure 3) was the main reason the overall financial regime was estimated to be borrowing with
constraints if not savings only, whereas the moral hazard regime was the best fit statistically
in urban areas.

            Next, in terms of out-of-sample predictions for micro data, we see in Figure 6 that the
model-generated firm size distribution in the urban area has more mass in the right tail, as
is true in the data, in contrast with the rural area.37
            Finally, we examined the distributions of the growth rates of net worth and finds that,
as in the data, there is more dispersion in wealth growth rates in rural areas than in urban
ones.



7              Are Different Financial Regimes Necessary?
The limited commitment formulation of financial constraints is widely used in macro finance
literature, often but not always unquestioned. In this section, we show that if we had simply

    The plots use the 2005-2011 waves of the Townsend Thai Data from four provinces (Lopburi, Cha-
choengsao, Buriram, and Sisaket) which we described in detail in Section 2.1. Firm size is defined as the
sum of agricultural and business assets, and we drop households who report zero holdings of each category,
leaving us with 601 urban and 659 rural households. We chose assets as a measure of a firm’s size rather
than employment (as is perhaps more standard), because of the prevalence of self-employed individuals (i.e.
few paid employees) in the Townsend Thai data. For comparison with the rural data, the urban data are
winsorized at 1 million baht.

assumed the most commonly used financial obstacle in the literature, we would be led astray.
More precisely we cannot fit meso resource flows and the micro data jointly. In particular,
we show that it is key that the type of financial regime varies across regions, as opposed to
urban and rural areas being subject to the same financial regime but with differing tightness
of the financial constraint.
       We formalize that argument here in the context of our calibrated model with its realistic
estimated underpinnings. In particular, in this section we get rid of moral hazard and fall
back on the simple and widely used collateral constraint in (6) as part of each region. We
do not make the regions identical however. Rather, we try to generate factor flows of the
magnitude we computed for our benchmark. We thus make the urban region more and more
liberal by increasing λ, from our estimated (and reasonable) value of 1.8 to a value of 3, then
to 5 and finally to infinite (hence first best).
       Table 4 examines factor flows in these different economies. These should be compared
to the corresponding numbers for our baseline economy in panel (b) of Table 3. The table
illustrates that λ has to approach infinity for labor and capital flows to be large enough to
be comparable to our baseline.38

       Summarizing, it is possible to generate sizable factor flows in an economy with two limited
commitment regimes if the parameter governing the tightness of the collateral constraint, λ,
is large enough. However, as we now show, moving to such high values of λ implies that the
predictions for micro data deteriorate.
       First, we lose at λ = 3 and 5 the non-increasing relationship between wealth and bor-
rowing in the urban regime (which was flat in MH but is now increasing in the LC regime).
       Second, at yet higher λ values we lose the predictions for firms size in the urban area.
  38
       At λ = ∞, capital flow is larger but labor flows are less. At λ = 5, we are under on both.


                                                                   31
This is shown in Figure 7 which plots the firm size distribution for the case where λ = ∞
in rural areas (the figures for λ = 3 and 5 are qualitatively similar). Essentially at high λ
unproductive firms go out of business, eliminating the mass of small firms that we see in the
actual data. We also lose the implication for the growth of net worth that we see in the data,
that the extremes of wealth growth, in each of the tails, have higher mass in the rural data
relative to the urban data. The model at higher and higher λ start to produce the opposite.

8           Counterfactual: Moving to Autarky
In this section we conduct a counterfactual policy experiment using our structural model.
We start with our integrated economy with realistic regions and calibrated parameter values
and then introduce wedges, reflecting either frictions or policies, that restrict cross-sectional
factor flows. For simplicity we consider the extreme case of putting each region in autarky.39
We show that there are interesting implications for macro and regional aggregates and in-
equality. Table 5 plots our main variables of interest at the macro and meso levels for an
economy in which each region is in autarky. Comparing these with the corresponding num-
bers in our integrated baseline economy in Table 3, we can assess the effects of a hypothetical
   39
    Of course, we could also conduct less extreme counterfactual experiments in which regional factor flows
are only partially shut down.

       Shutting down resources flows and moving to regional autarky has interesting implica-
tions for regional aggregates, inequality, factor prices, and TFP. In particular, a move to
autarky would be associated with households in rural areas experiencing increases on aver-
age in consumption, income, wealth; increases in labor and capital used locally; but decreases
in the wage (and in the interest rates); and drops in TFP. The reason that rural aggregate
TFP decreases is simple: because rural capital and labor can no longer be employed in urban
areas, the supply of these factors is roughly eighty percent higher than in the integrated base-
line economy. While regional income in rural areas increases it increases by considerably less
than eighty percent and therefore aggregate TFP falls. Put differently, rural areas absorb the
increased factor supplies by allocating them to somewhat less efficient firms. Local inequality
also decreases. For urban areas it is the reverse though notably the movements in each of
these variables is much more extreme. Local inequality increases substantially. At the na-
tional level, results are mixed: though aggregate consumption, wealth, and capital decrease;
labor supply, income, and TFP each increase. National inequality increases, particularly at
the bottom of the distribution (which drives an increase in the Gini coefficient).




  40
    Note that, due to computational constraints discussed in footnote 3, we here do not take into account
transition dynamics following a move to autarky. Instead we simply compare steady states.


                                                                  33
9        Conclusion
More research is needed that takes seriously the micro-financial underpinnings for macro
models, that uses micro data to help pin down these underpinnings, that looks into the
possibility that obstacles might vary by geography, and that builds micro founded macro
models accordingly. We have done this for Thailand, an emerging market country, and
emphasized quantitatively large flows of capital and migration of labor from rural to urban
areas and that differential development of regions can be due to variation in obstacles, alone.
       One likely reason for the relative scarcity of such work is the lack of reliable data. The
Townsend Thai project data that we have used throughout paper is a notable exception.
We have encouraged the Thai National Economic and Social Development Board to bring
geography into the national flow of funds accounts. A related project on geographic flows
was carried out in Mexico, as noted in the introduction. More generally several countries
have expressed an interest in mapping their financial system, though of course the policy
motivation varies by country, given their current state of development and their history.
       Indeed there has been a surge of interest in local economies in the U.S., given the advent
of the financial crisis and troublesome response patterns thereafter. The level of geographic
dis-aggregation varies across these studies, in part depending on data utilized: from States,
to Commuting Zones, to MSA’s, to Zip codes. One can think about these as regions,
neighborhoods, or islands – different terms used by different authors for local area effects. For
us in this paper the relevant distinction is urban versus rural as these are official geopolitical
entities in Thailand and the data were gathered accordingly.41 Some of the data sets utilized
in the U.S. are those associated with Big Data, namely Federal Income Tax Records for
millions of people, though in this paper we have emphasized, as does this U.S. literature,
the variety and complexity of potentially interlinked data sets.
       Unfortunately, though we do not have in the U.S. the details down to individual actors
– for example not much is available for smaller household firms – nor do we have complete
household-level income and balance sheet data for wager earners. Key, of course, would
be variation by wealth though with limited data this typically requires imputation or a
proportionality assumption and some aggregation. Largely one has to aggregate up to a
hoped-for local representative consumer. The point here is that limited data makes it harder
  41
    As a whole, the U.S. literature is using geo-data on general consumer finance, e.g, credit and loans;
housing and mortgage data including house prices; interest and dividends as income flows to impute balance
items; local retail sales and prices; economic activity by sector such as manufacturing, construction, and
local retail: labor supply, wages, unemployment, non participation in the local population, and total local
population; and measures of consumption, expenditures, and sales.

to distinguish among various possible financial obstacles, in contrast to micro underpinnings
estimated with data from the Townsend Thai project.
       A related point is that we lack in most countries integrated financial accounts that link
the income statement to the balance sheet. There is of course an intimate connection across
these accounts, as savings as a flow on the accrued income statement is earnings minus
consumption, which of necessity must then adjust some of the line items in the balance
sheet. In particular, apart from firms and household enterprise which may reinvest back into
the business, savings must result in a net acquisition of financial assets, and deficits a sale
or increased borrowing. This indeed is the way the Flow of Funds accounts are constructed,
but unfortunately the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and most countries have not yet done this
by geography.
       In addition to more and better data, we also need more theoretical research in macroe-
conomics aimed at furthering our understanding of heterogeneous agent models and the
complexities these may entail. This is especially true when more realistic micro financial
underpinnings and elements from contract theory are incorporated, as in the present paper.
Largely the literature is using an incomplete markets framework and assuming some kind of
finance or liquidity constraint. We have shown in this paper that an incorrect guess about
the underpinning will matter, especially when we want the model predictions to be informed
by and consistent with both local and national level data.42
       Using our framework, we can in principle look at a financial reform or policy change
acting through underlying obstacles, hence different in different regions. This will set in
motion an intricate path of transition dynamics and reallocation, not only within regions
but across regions, as well. We are currently exploring these possibilities in on-going work,
and this includes work on numerical methods needed to compute solutions. Our current
paper already breaks new ground in incorporating into general equilibrium a dynamic moral
hazard financial regime. We are computing solutions with approximate linear programs and
value function iteration; though these techniques were used as well in partial equilibrium
micro data estimation, here we have endogenous wages and interest rates and allow factor
flows across regions. Allowing for a larger number of regions, a variety of obstacles within
regions, and more heterogeneity is a goal within reach.
       In summary we have joined in a developing country context what have been largely two
distinct literatures, macro development and micro development, and combined them into
  42
    This is also a point made by Beraja, Hurst and Ospina (2016) in the U.S. context, using the model with
data to distinguish local versus aggregate shocks.



                                                   35
a coherent whole. It is our view that the macro development literature needs to take into
account the implicit and explicit contracts we see on the ground and the micro development
literature needs to take into account general equilibrium, economy-wide effects of interven-
tions. This is what we have accomplished in this paper, in a particular context, though we
believe that the methods developed here will be applicable more generally.

B         Capital Accumulation
The purpose of this section is to spell out in detail how capital accumulation works in
our economy. We assume that there is a representative capital producing firm that holds
bonds, Bt , issues dividends, Dt , invests, It , to accumulate capital, Kt which it rents out to
households at a rental rate Rt . The budget constraint of the capital producer is then

                    Bt+1 + It + Dt = Rt Kt + (1 + rt )Bt ,            Kt+1 = It + (1 − δ)Kt

The entire debt of the representative capital producer is held by intermediaries that contract
with individuals and hold their wealth, a. Hence the debt market clearing condition is
                                               ˆ
                                        Bt +       adGt (a, z) = 0,     all t.                          (17)


       The capital producer maximizes
                                                    ∞
                                                    X         Dt
                                            V0 =          Qt             .
                                                    t=0    s=0 (1 + rs )


subject to
                            Kt+1 + Bt+1 + Dt = (Rt + 1 − δ)Kt + (1 + rt )Bt                             (18)

It is easy to show that this maximization implies the no arbitrage condition Rt = rt + δ.43
Therefore the budget constraint (18) is

                                  Dt = (1 + rt )(Kt + Bt ) − Kt+1 − Bt+1

and so the present value of profits is
                                 ∞
                                 X          Dt+s
                          Vt =         Qs                = (1 + rt )(Kt + Bt ) all t.
                                 s=0    τ =0 (1 + rt+τ )

  43
       Defining cash-on-hand, ϑt = (Rt + 1 − δ)Kt + (1 + rt )Bt , the associated dynamic program is

                Vt (M ) = max
                           0 0
                               M − K 0 − B 0 + (1 + rt )−1 Vt+1 [(Rt+1 + 1 − δ)K 0 + (1 + rt+1 )B 0 ]
                          K ,B


The first order conditions imply Rt+1 = rt+1 + δ.


                                                          41
Zero profits implies Kt + Bt = 0 for all t. Using bond market clearing (17), this implies that
the economy’s aggregate capital stock equals its total wealth
                                                ˆ
                                        Kt =          adGt (a, z),     all t.



C       Connection of Private Information Regime to Opti-
        mal Dynamic Contract
We here show how the our formulation of the contracting problem under moral hazard,
(3) to (5), is related to a more familiar formulation of an optimal dynamic contracting
problem under private information. In particular, we show that there is optimal insurance
against residual productivity shocks, ε, (in a sense defined precisely momentarily) but no
insurance against ability shocks, z. We show that for the special case in which there are
only residual productivity shocks and ability is deterministic,44 our formulation is equivalent
to an optimal dynamic contracting problem. That is, there is optimal insurance against
residual productivity shocks (subject to incentive compatibility) in this special case. The
more general formulation (3) to (5) is then simply this special case with uninsurable ability
shocks “added on top”.


C.1      Equivalence for Special Case with only Residual Productivity
         (ε) but no Ability (z) Shocks

Standard Formulation with Promised Utility. Consider the following problem: maxi-
mize intermediary profits (the PDV of income, yt given by (2), minus consumption transfers
to the agent, ct )
                                                       ∞
                                                       X        y − cτ
                                         Πt = E t             Qτ τ
                                                       τ =t    s=t (1 + rs )

subject to providing promised utility of at least Wt to the household
                                              ∞
                                              X
                                         Et          β τ −t u(cτ , eτ ) ≥ Wt
                                              τ =t

  44
    That is, the transition probabilities for entrepreneurial talent are degenerate, µ(z 0 |z) = 1 if z 0 = z and
zero otherwise.




                                                              42
and an incentive compatibility constraint for the household. Assume that there are only
residual productivity shocks (ε) and that entrepreneurial ability (z) is deterministic and
fixed over time. Without loss of generality, set z = 1. To simplify notation, define by Y (ε, e)
an household’s income given optimal choices for capital, labor and occupation

                   Y (ε, e) = max {x[εf (k, `) − w` − (r + δ)k] + (1 − x)wε} .
                                   x,k,`


If Wt = W is promised to the household, the intermediary’s value Πt = Π(Wt ) satisfies the
Bellman equation

   Equivalence: The joint budget constraint of a risk-sharing syndicate is

                                           at+1 = yt − ct + (1 + rt )at .

This can be written in present-value form as
                                                                            ∞

                0 = πt + at (1 + r),         for all t where πt ≡ Et               Qτ τ                    (19)
                                                                            τ =t    s=t (1 + rs )


are the intermediary’s expected future profits. Equivalently
                            ∞                                ∞
                            X             cτ             X         y
                  πt + Et          Qτ               = Et      Qτ τ           + (1 + rt )at .
                            τ =t      s=t (1 + rs )      τ =t  s=t (1 + rs )


which says that the intermediary’s expected profits plus the expected present value of future
consumption must equal total income of a risk-sharing syndicate. We can use (19) to establish
a useful equivalence result.

Proposition 1 Suppose the Pareto frontier Π(W ) is decreasing at all values of promised
utility, W , that are used as continuation values at some point in time. Then the following

       Proof: The proof has two steps.
       Step 1: write down dual to (P1). Because the Pareto frontier Π(W ) is decreasing at
the W under consideration, we can write the last constraint of (P1) (promise-keeping) with
a (weak) inequality rather than an inequality. This does not change the allocation chosen
under the optimal contract.45 The dual to (P1) is then to maximize
                                        X
           V (π) =         max0             p(ε|e) {u[c(ε), e] + βV [π 0 (ε)]}    s.t.
                         e,c(ε),π (ε)
                                        ε
            X                                                 X
                     p(ε|e) {u[c(ε), e] + βV [π 0 (ε)]} ≥          p(ε|ê) {u[c(ε), ê] + βV [π 0 (ε)]} ∀e, ê   (P1’)
             ε                                                 ε
            X
                     p(ε|e) Y (ε, e) − c(ε) + (1 + r)−1 π 0 (ε) ≥ π.
                           
             ε


where π = Π(W ). Because Π(W ) is decreasing, its inverse V (π) is also decreasing. We can
therefore replace the inequality in the last constraint of (P1’) with an equality.
       Step 2: express dual in terms of asset position rather than profits. Let

                                        π = −a(1 + r),       π 0 (ε) = −a0 (ε)(1 + r).                            (20)

Substituting (20) into (P1’) and defining v(a) = V [−(1 + r)a], yields (P2).
       The change of variables (20) simply uses the present-value budget constraint (19) to
express the problem in terms of assets rather than the PDV of intermediary profits.
  45
    Note that this would not be the case if Π(W ) would be increasing. In that case, replacing the equality
by an inequality would change the allocation because it would deliver strictly higher welfare to both parties.

subject to providing promised utility of at least Wt to the household
                                                  ∞
                                                  X

and an incentive compatibility constraint for the household. If Wt = W is promised to the
household and its current ability shock is zt = z, the intermediary’s value Πt = Π(Wt , zt )
satisfies the Bellman equation

Compare this formulation to the one used in the main text, (3) –(5). Note that under the
optimal contract (P3), utility W (ε) cannot depend on z 0 . That is, the principal absorbs all
the gains or losses from z shocks. In contrast, in the formulation in the main text, (3)–(5),
it is the reverse: the agent’s utility varies with z 0 and its wealth does not. Since agent
wealth is a negative scalar multiple of the principal’s utility (profits) this means that the
principal’s welfare is made independent of z 0 . Exactly the reverse as in (P3). To see this even
more clearly, shut down residual productivity shocks, ε = 1 with probability one. Then the
formulation in the main text, (3)–(5) is an income fluctuations problem, like Schechtman
and Escudero (1977), Aiyagari (1994) or other Bewley models. But (P3) is just perfect
insurance, with a risk neutral principal.

D.1      Numerical Solution: Optimal Contract with Lotteries

When solving the optimal contract under moral hazard (3)–(5) numerically, we allow for
lotteries as in Phelan and Townsend (1991). This section formulates the associated dynamic
program.


Simplification Capital, labor and occupational choice only enter the problem in (3)
through the budget constraint (4). We can make use of this fact to reduce the number
of choice variables in (3) from six (e, x, k, `, c(ε), a0 (ε)) to three (e, c(ε), a0 (ε)).
    Entrepreneurs solve the following profit maximization problem.
                                                                                          X

Note in particular that capital k and labor ` are chosen before residual productivity ε is
realized (see the timeline in Figure 1). With the functional form assumption in (12), the
first-order conditions are

The optimal occupational choice satisfies (note that agents choose an occupation before ε is
realized):
                                                       
                                x(z, e; w, r) = arg max xΠ̄(z, e; w, r) + (1 − x)wε̄(e)
                                                                x

Given a realization of ε, those who choose to be entrepreneurs realize profits of (21) and
those who choose to be workers realize a labor income of wε. Therefore, realized (as opposed
to expected) surplus is

                        S(ε, z, e; w, r) = x(z, e; w, r)Π(ε, z, e; w, r) + (1 − x(e, z; w, r))wε.

Using these simplifications, the budget constraint (4) can then be written as
                          X                                          X
                                p(ε|e) {c(ε) + a0 (ε)} =                      p(ε|e)S(ε, z, e; w, r) + (1 + r)a.                          (23)

As already noted, the advantage of this formulation is that it features three rather than six
choice variables.


Linear Programming Representation A contract between the intermediary and a
household specifies a probability distribution over the vector

                                                                    (c, ε, e, a0 )

Bounds on Consumption Grid To solve the optimal contracting problem, we follow
Prescott and Townsend (1984) and Phelan and Townsend (1991) and constrain all variables
to lie on discrete grids. In order for the discretized dynamic programming problem to be
a good approximation to our original problem, it turns out to be important to work with
relatively fine grids, particularly for consumption. To achieve this with a limited number
of grid points, we choose as tight an upper bound on the consumption grid as possible and
adjust it when prices change. In particular, given (w, r), the upper bound is chosen as

                                c̄(w, r) = rā + max{Π(εH , z̄, ē; w, r), wεH },

for any given (w, r), where a, ā and so on are the lower and upper bounds on the grids for
wealth and other variables, and where the profit function Π is defined in (21). These are
the minimum and maximum levels of consumption that can be sustained if the agent were
to choose a0 (ε) = a in (3). Note that this bound is tighter than what is typically chosen in
the literature. After solving the dynamic programming problem, we verify that consumption
never hits the upper bound. Table 6 lists our choices of grids.
  46
    (26) is derived from the timing of the problem as follows. A lottery with probabilities Pr(e) first
determines an effort, e, for each household. Then a second lottery with probabilities Pr(c, ε, a0 |e) determines
the remaining variables. Of course, nature plays a role in this second lottery since the conditional probabilities
p(ε|e) are technologically determined. It is therefore required that
                                           X
                                               Pr(c, ε, a0 |e) = p(ε|e).                                     (27)

E        Details on Calibration
In this Appendix we describe in more detail the calibration procedure we use to arrive at the
parameter values summarized in panel B of Table 1. We denote by Θ = (σ, χ, θ, εL , ρ, ζ, z̄, λ)
the 8 × 1 vector or parameter values, by m the vector of moments in the data and by d(Θ)
the vector of corresponding model-generated moments. We choose

                                                                                 d(Θ) − m

where Ω is a 8 × 8 positive definite weighting matrix. The reason for rescaling d(Θ) − m by
m is so as to make sure that different units across moments do not affect things too much.47
For the weighting matrix Ω, we choose a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements (ω1 , ..., ω8 )
so that (29) becomes

F     More Details on Moral Hazard vs. Limited Com-
      mitment
This Appendix summarizes additional implications of moral hazard for individual choices
and contrasts them with those of limited commitment. We relegated these to an Appendix
because many of these, particularly for limited commitment, are already well understood
from the existing literature.


F.1    Saving Behavior

We first present some analytic results that characterize differences in individual saving be-
havior in the two regimes. These are variants of well-known results in the literature.

Lemma 1 Let u(c, e) = U (c) − V (e). Solutions to the optimal contracting problem under



                                              50
moral hazard (3)–(5), satisfy
                                                                                                −1
                                   0                                                  1
                                 U (cit ) = β(1 + rt+1 )Ez,t                   Eε,t 0                      (30)
                                                                                   U (cit+1 )

where Ez,t and Eε,t denote the time t expectation over future values of z and ε.

       This is a variant of the inverse Euler equation derived in Rogerson (1985), Ligon (1998)
and Golosov, Kocherlakota and Tsyvinski (2003) among others. With a degenerate distribu-
tion for ability, z, our equation collapses to the standard inverse Euler equation. The reason
our equation differs from the latter is that we have assumed that ability, z, is not insurable
in the sense that asset payoffs are not contingent on the realization of z (see footnote 17).
Our equation is therefore a “hybrid” of an Euler equation in an incomplete markets setting
and the inverse Euler equation under moral hazard.
       If the incentive compatibility constraint (5) is binding, marginal utilities are not equalized
across realizations of ε. One well known implication of (30) is that in this case48

                                       U 0 (cit ) < β(1 + rt+1 )Ez,t Eε,t U 0 (cit+1 ).                    (31)

The implication of this inequality is that when the incentive constraint binds, individuals are
saving constrained. It is important to note that such saving constraints are a feature of the
optimal contract.49 The intuition is that under moral hazard there is an additional marginal
cost of saving an extra dollar from period t to period t + 1: in period t + 1 an individual
works less in response to any given compensation schedule. Therefore the optimal contract
discourages savings whenever the incentive compatibility constraint (5) binds.
  48
       This follows because by Jensen’s inequality (1/U 0 (cit+1 ) is a convex function of U 0 (cit+1 ))
                                                          1                     1
                                              Eε,t                  >                        .
                                                     U 0 (cit+1 )        Eε,t U 0 (cit+1 )


  49
    Some readers may have had the opposite intuition, namely that moral hazard reduces insurance thereby
strengthening precautionary motives for saving. But given that individuals’ actions are governed by an
optimal contract, the inverse the Euler equation says that this is not the case. See Rogerson (1985), Ligon
(1998) and Golosov, Kocherlakota and Tsyvinski (2003) for more detailed discussions of this idea.




                                                                    51
    With limited commitment, the Euler equation is instead50

                             U 0 (cit ) = βEz,t [U 0 (cit+1 )(1 + rt+1 ) + νit+1 λ]

where νit+1 is the Lagrange multiplier on the collateral constraint (6). If this constraint
binds, then
                                   U 0 (cit ) > β(1 + rt+1 )Ez,t U 0 (cit+1 ).                            (32)

Contrasting (31) for moral hazard and (32) for limited commitment, we can see that in
the moral hazard regime individuals are savings constrained and in the limited commitment
regime, they are instead borrowing constrained.51 Finally, note that under limited commit-
ment only the savings of entrepreneurs are distorted because only they face the collateral
constraint (6). In contrast, under moral hazard the savings decision of both entrepreneurs
and workers is distorted because both face the incentive compatibility constraint (5). As dis-
cussed in the main text, this is reflected in the equilibrium interest rate. Individual savings
behavior is one prediction in which the two regimes differ dramatically.




   50
      Note that in contrast to (30) no expectation over ε is taken here. This is because there is perfect
insurance on ε. Therefore marginal utilities are equalized across ε realizations. More formally, denote
by c(ε, z, a) consumption of an individual who has experienced shocks ε and z and has wealth a. Then
U 0 (c(ε, z, a)) = ψ(a, z) for all ε, where ψ(a, z) is the Lagrange multiplier on the budget constraint in (4).
Since this is true for all ε realizations, of course also Eε U 0 (c(ε, z, a)) = ψ(a, z).
   51
      In the case where the corresponding constraints do not bind, both (31) and (32) collapse to the standard
Euler equation under incomplete markets

                                     U 0 (cit ) = β(1 + rt+1 )Ez,t U 0 (cit+1 ).
