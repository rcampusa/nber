                                            ABSTRACT

We examine the labor supply of politicians using data on Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).
We exploit the introduction of a law that equalized MEPs' salaries, which had previously differed by
as much as a factor of ten. Doubling an MEP's salary increases the probability of running for reelection
by 23 percentage points and increases the logarithm of the number of parties that field a candidate
by 29 percent of a standard deviation. A salary increase has no discernible impact on absenteeism
or shirking from legislative sessions; in contrast, non-pecuniary motives, proxied by home-country
corruption, substantially impact the intensive margin of labor supply. Finally, an increase in salary
lowers the quality of elected MEPs, measured by the selectivity of their undergraduate institutions.

1        Introduction

The labor market for politicians is unlike that of most occupations: salaries are determined through

legislation rather than market forces and politicians vie for a fixed number of positions through

public competition, facing the possibility of dismissal only once each electoral cycle. Since politi-

cians’ salaries are a policy variable, it is particularly important to identify the role that financial

compensation plays in their labor supply. Moreover, given the visible nature of their duties, the

lack of direct supervision, and the public goods aspect of their jobs, it is also critical to understand

how social norms affect politicians’ behavior while they are in office.

        In this paper, we analyze the impact of both salary and social norms on the labor supply of

the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). We examine three aspects of politicians’ labor

supply: (i) the extensive margin (the willingness to run for office), (ii) the intensive margin (effort

exerted while in office), and (iii) selection effects (quality of elected candidates).

        Our main source of identification is a recent change in the way that MEP salaries are determined.

The European Parliament is the directly elected legislative chamber of the European Union. It is

currently composed of 736 MEPs from 27 constituent countries. MEPs are elected for 5-year terms

by voters from their home countries. Prior to 2009, each MEP received the same salary as the

members of the lower house of her home-country national parliament. This induced great variation

in MEPs’ remuneration. For example, in 2004, the highest paid MEPs (those from Italy) were

paid an annual salary of €144,084 while the lowest paid ones (those from Hungary) earned €10,080

per year. Even MEPs from similar countries received very different salaries. For example, Spanish

MEPs were paid €38,396 per year, roughly 75% less than Italian MEPs, despite the countries’ near-

identical levels of GDP per capita. In 2005, the two legislative chambers of the European Union

agreed on a salary harmonization: as of the first day of the parliamentary term starting in 2009,

almost1 all MEPs receive an identical salary of roughly €84,000. For some MEPs (e.g., those from

Italy) this change induced a large reduction in salary, while for others (e.g., those from Hungary

and Spain), it meant a big raise. At the same time, MEPs are drawn from a heterogeneous mix of

nations, which allows us to examine the supply of politicians as a function not only of income, but
    1
    As we will explain in greater detail later, there is a small fraction (4.5%) of MEPs for whom this salary change
did not apply.



                                                         2
of home-country norms as well. We can thus compare the effects of pecuniary and non-pecuniary

motivations of politicians.

       We measure the extensive margin of labor supply in three ways. First, we examine whether

incumbent MEPs seek reelection. Second, we look at whether MEPs quit before completing their

terms of office. Third, we identify the number of parties that field a candidate.2 We generate

two primary measures of the intensive margin of labor supply: the rate of absences from plenary

sessions, and a more direct proxy for shirking based on instances when an MEP signs the attendance

register (thus collecting a daily stipend) but fails to cast a single vote. Finally, we examine quality

of elected MEPs, as proxied by the selectivity of their undergraduate institutions.

       Doubling an MEP’s salary increases the probability she runs for reelection by 23 percentage

points and increases the logarithm of the number of parties that field a candidate by 29 percent of

a standard deviation. Moreover, an increase in salary substantially reduces the likelihood that an

MEP will quit before the end of her term. All of these results suggest that monetary remuneration

plays an important role in the willingness to hold political office. One one hand, these results may

not be surprising – higher salaries attract more applicants in other industries, so why should this

not be the case in politics? But, as we note at the outset, politicians’ labor supply may be governed

by distinct forces. Both non-pecuniary motivations and the role of post-political employment are

such that salary might be of secondary importance relative to other returns to holding office (see

Diermeier et al. 2005, who argue that this is the case in the U.S. Congress).3

       We do not find evidence that an increase in salary impacts the intensive margin of labor supply.

In contrast, we find a strong effect of non-pecuniary factors on whether MEPs exert effort while

they are in office. We use cross-sectional variation in corruption as a proxy for the strength of

home-country social capital and find that MEPs from more corrupt countries are more likely to

be absent from all votes on a given day. As well as indulging in more absences, MEPs from more

corrupt countries also exhibit a more explicit form of shirking. Each day they are present at the
   2
     Many countries in the European Union use closed-list voting systems where citizens cast votes for parties rather
than individual candidates. Consequently, we are not able to identify the number of individual candidates willing to
run for office in each country.
   3
     In interpreting our estimates, it is important to note that the elasticity of labor supply will in general depend on
the existence of substitute career options, and in our context, there is a political position that may be a reasonably
close substitute to being an MEP, namely serving in the home-country parliament. Consequently, the impact of
salary on the supply of political candidates may be somewhat lower in other settings.

parliament, MEPs are meant to sign a register to prove their attendance, entitling them to a daily

allowance of roughly €300.4 MEPs have sometimes abused this system, showing up only to sign

the register. Such behavior has been a source of scandal. In 2004, for example, Austrian MEP

Hans-Peter Martin filmed other MEPs signing the register shortly after 7am and then immediately

leaving the building. His footage was widely broadcast and caused a public uproar.5 Combining

data from the daily register with roll-call voting data, we identify for each MEP any days on which

she signed the register but was then absent from all votes that day. We find that a one standard

deviation increase in corruption in an MEP’s place of origin is associated with a 16 percent increase

in this form of shirking.

       Finally, we examine the impact of the salary change on the composition of elected officials.

Doubling the salary decreases the probability that an elected MEP attended a college ranked

among the top 500 in the world by 4.2 percentage points, or 14 percent.6 Moreover, a salary

increase seems to attract MEPs who shirk more, but this effect is not robust to inclusion of country

fixed effects. Overall, our evidence suggests that higher salaries lower the quality of elected MEPs.

       The identifying assumption underlying our results on pecuniary motivations is that the timing

of the salary reform is uncorrelated with other factors that would lead politicians from low-salary

countries to increase their willingness to be MEPs relative to politicians from from high-salary

countries. Another concern is that the reform may have been passed precisely when MEPs from

low-salary countries were more likely to run for reelection and thus were particularly motivated

to raise future salaries. Two sets of facts speak against this alternative explanation. First, such

reverse causality could not account for the increase in the number of parties that field candidates

when salaries increase. Second, we demonstrate that whether an MEP voted for or against salary

harmonization is uncorrelated with whether the proposal would raise or lower her salary.7

       A large literature examines the theoretical relationship between politicians’ wages, and their

quality, performance, and willingness to run for office. Caselli and Morelli (2004) consider a setting

      The size of the daily allowance changes somewhat over time.

      See, for example, “European Elections: Martin’s Travels,” The Economist, June 3, 2004.
    6
      College selectivity is highly predictive of market productivity (Kane 1998). It is not immediately clear, however,
whether it is also a good proxy for the quality of a politician. That said, we find that, conditional on running,
selectivity of an MEP’s college strongly predicts whether she will win a reelection. This patterns support our view
that college selectivity is a good proxy for MEPs’ quality.
    7
      Moreover, whether an MEP voted for or against salary harmonization is uncorrelated with whether that MEP
subsequently runs for reelection.

where market and political ability are correlated, so higher wages attract candidates with greater

political skill. Besley (2004) develops a model where higher wages compel politicians to care more

about reelection; an increase in wages thus induces politicians to cater more to voters’ preferences

while in office. Higher wages, however, might also create negative selection effects, as our results

suggest to be the case. New Hampshire has deliberately kept legislators’ salaries at $100 for their 45

days in session each year (with no per diem), reasoning that this system attracts a more committed

“citizen” legislature. Directly in line with this rhetoric, Besley (2004) discusses how the existence of

non-pecuniary incentives for “public spirited” candidates might cause higher wages to attract less

attractive candidates. Poutvaara and Takalo (2007), Mattozzi and Merlo (2008), and Gagliarducci,

Nannicini, and Naticchioni (2010) consider models where high-ability people self-select into politics;

consequently, higher wages lower the ability threshold at which potential candidates decide to seek

office.8

    In contrast to theoretical work, there is a relative paucity of empirical research on the labor

market for elected officials, owing in large part to the difficulty in credibly identifying a relationship

between pay and the supply of politicians. Outside of politics, one can often use exogenous shocks to

labor demand to identify the elasticity of labor supply, but this approach is not feasible in studying

the labor supply of politicians. Moreover, since salaries are typically set by those currently in office,

it is usually difficult to rule out the possibility that politicians’ skill affects their salaries rather

than vice versa. A pair of recent papers overcome these difficulties by exploiting discontinuities of

politicians’ salaries in population size: Ferraz and Finan (2010) and Gagliarducci and Nannicini

(forthcoming) examine the impact of wages on labor supply and performance of Brazilian municipal

legislators and Italian mayors, respectively, and find that higher wages attract more candidates and

higher quality candidates in both contexts. Ferraz and Finan (2010) also find evidence that higher

wages induce higher effort, while Gagliarducci and Nannicini (forthcoming) find this channel to be

unimportant. Kotakorpi and Poutvaara (2011) study the effect of a wage increase in the Finnish

National Parliament. Using candidates in municipal elections as a control group, they report that

the wage increase led to more educated female candidates but had no effect on the composition
    8
      Messner and Polborn (2004) study a model where candidates are motivated to run in part because they care
about political duties being executed effectively. In this setting, higher wages can decrease the quality of elected
officials since higher wages allow skilled individuals to more easily free-ride on participation of others.

of male candidates. Di Tella and Fisman (2004) present evidence that better state-level economic

performance allows U.S. governors to push up their own salaries, while Besley (2004) finds that U.S.

governors’ salaries increase when their policies are congruent with voter preferences. Groseclose

and Krehbiel (1994) and Hall and van Houweling (1995) report that U.S. congressmen respond to

changes in the financial incentives for retirement. The structural estimation exercise of Keane and

Merlo (2010) suggests that a reduction in congressional salaries in the U.S. would disproportionally

induce exit of skilled politicians.

      Closest to the context we explore in our paper is the concurrent work by Mocan and Altindag

(2011). They also study the impact of the change in European Parliament salary rules on the

behavior of MEPs. However, they examine the impact of the salary change only on whether MEPs

sign the daily register, while we focus on a broader set of outcomes (the willingness to run for

reelection, quality of MEPs, number of parties that field a candidate, absence from roll-call votes,

and so forth). Moreover, in contrast to their findings, we do not find that the salary change has

a significant impact on the tendency to sign the daily register. We replicate their point estimate,

which is quite small, and when we cluster our standard errors at the country level,9 the effect is

not statistically significant.

      Our paper contributes to the existing literature by providing a more complete view of politicians’

labor supply – in our setting, we can examine the impact of both pecuniary and non-pecuniary

factors, measure both the extensive and the intensive margin of labor supply, and also identify

selection effects. Furthermore, in contrast to most earlier work, the European Parliament wage

equalization provides us with a credible source of identification of the impact of salary changes.

Finally, some of the outcomes we analyze, such as the supply of political parties, have not been

studied at all in previous work.

      The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section we describe the data

and the institutional background. Section 3 presents the results. The last section concludes.

2     Data and institutional background

The European Parliament is the lower legislative chamber of the European Union. Since 1979,

Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have been elected every 5 years. The present paper

focuses on the 5th, 6th, and 7th parliaments, elected in 1999, 2004, and 2009 and consisting of 626,

732, and 736 MEPs, respectively.10 Throughout the paper, we will refer to the nth parliament as

EP n.

    Each EU member country elects its own MEPs in nationally held elections. The precise electoral

rules differ by country. Importantly for our purposes, many countries utilize closed-list electoral

systems where voters can effectively vote only for political parties as a whole, rather than for

particular candidates. In such countries, competition takes place at the party-level rather than at

the individual-level. Consequently, when we analyze the extensive margin of labor supply, we focus

on incumbents’ willingness to run for reelection and the number of parties that field at least one

candidate.11

    The work of the European Parliament is centered around the plenary sessions held once or

twice a month. These sessions consist of several daily “sittings” of debate and voting. MEPs sign

attendance registers on each day of a plenary session. The registers are subsequently published in

conjunction with the minutes of the sittings. Similarly, for those votes that are held as roll-call

votes, individual voting is registered and published.

    MEPs are remunerated through allowances as well as a monthly salary. Along with reimburse-

ment for travel, staff, and other expenses, MEP allowances include a stipend that is awarded for

each day of a session, if the MEP signs the attendance register. This daily stipend is reduced

by a half if the MEP votes on fewer than 50 percent of the roll-call votes that day. Signing the

register and then immediately leaving is frowned upon, as evidenced by the scandal discussed in

the introduction.

    Prior to EP7, MEPs were paid by the member states and earned the same salary as members

of the lower chamber of their respective national parliaments. This system was originally put in
  10
     When Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007, the total number of MEPs temporarily increased to 785
until the 2009 election.
  11
     An alternative would be to restrict our attention to countries with open-list electoral systems and utilize the
overall number of candidates on the ballot. There are only nine such countries in EP7 (Hix and Hagemann 2009),
however, which is insufficient for this approach.

place in 1979 as a placeholder until the European Parliament could decide on a uniform system

and level of salaries. Difficulties in agreeing to a uniform salary and its implementation, however,

resulted in the national parliament salaries remaining in place for nearly three decades. A new

system was finally agreed and voted upon on June 23, 2005 and became effective in EP7. The new

system established a uniform salary for all MEPs, paid from the European budget and equal to

38.5% of the salary of a judge at the European Court of Justice. The statute was passed with two

provisos: (i) if any member state wished all of its MEPs to continue to receive the old, national

salary, this would be permitted for a maximum of two parliamentary terms and would be paid for

by the member state, and (ii) any individual MEP who was already in office before the new statute

was passed could elect to continue to receive the old, national salary (paid by her own member

state) for as long as she continued in office. In practice, these provisions had little impact on the

implementation of a uniform salary because: (i) no member state elected to continue to pay the

old salaries for its MEPs, and (ii) only 33 MEPs exercised the option to retain the old national

salaries.12 We have been able to identify only 5 of these 33 MEPs, so we cannot exclude all MEPs

with unchanged salaries from our analyses. That said, they comprise less than 5 percent of the

sample, so their effect on our estimates is likely to be small. Moreover, since their salaries did not

actually change, they are likely to bias our estimates toward zero.

    The data employed in this paper are derived from a number of sources. We obtained data on

salaries from Corbett, Jacobs, and Shackleton (2005). We use the salaries as of December of 2004

as the measure of the salary level in the 6th parliament (2004-2008). Our key independent variable

∆lnSalaryc is defined as the logarithm of 84,000 (the post-change uniform salary level) minus the

logarithm of the salary for MEPs from country c as of December of 2004.13

    The measures of the extensive margin of labor supply are constructed using data available on

the web pages of the European Parliament.14 For EP6 and EP7, for each MEP who served in the
   12
      At first glance it might seem surprising that MEPs who received a pay cut would not elect to keep their old
salaries. Doing so, however, would require transferring the burden of payment from the European Parliament to
the taxpayers of one’s own country, which might not be popular with the electorate. More broadly, many legislative
bodies have the legal power to raise their own salaries and yet seldom choose to do so.
   13
      We also considered the tax-adjusted salary change, using the top marginal tax rate in the home country. Since
the tax rates are uncorrelated with initial salaries, this alternative measure yields very similar results.
   14
      Data on whether incumbent MEPs ran for reelection in 2004 was taken in July 2009 from
http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/archive/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&id=75. Information on whether
MEPs ran for reelection in 2009 was downloaded during the election in June 2009. Data on when MEPs
left the parliament was collected in August 2009 from the individual MEP pages on the EP website,


                                                        8
previous parliament, we define a variable ReRunip that indicates whether she ran for reelection (i

indexes the MEP and p indexes the parliament).15 For EP5 and EP6, for each MEP who served

in that parliament, we define an indicator variable P ostV oteQuitip which equals 1 if MEP i quit

her job before completing her term at some point after June 23rd of the second calendar year of

parliament p. For p = 6, this indicates that the MEP quit the parliament at some point after

the vote on the salary change. For p = 5, this indicates she quit the parliament during the same

segment of the electoral cycle but in the parliamentary session prior to the introduction of salary

change legislation. Finally, for EP6 and EP7, for each member country, we collected data on the

number of parties that fielded a candidate, taken from the European Parliament’s website.16 The

available data only include parties that received at least 0.5% of the vote. Accordingly, we define

lnN umP artiescp as the logarithm of the number of parties in country c that received at least 0.5%

of the vote for candidacy to parliament p. These three variables, ReRunip , P ostV oteQuitip , and

lnN umP artiescp , will be our measures of the extensive margin of labor supply.

    Building on a previous data collection effort by Hix, Noury, and Roland (2007), we also put

together comprehensive data on attendance and roll-call voting in the daily sittings of EP5, EP6,

and the first year of EP7.17 As mentioned previously, a sitting is a day-long meeting of the

parliament during which roll-call voting takes place. For each sitting, our data contain information

about whether each serving MEP signed the attendance register and how she voted (if at all) on

the issues that day.18 We focus on attendance and voting records during the first year of each

parliament, to avoid comparing behaviors across different points in the electoral cycle and further

to concentrate on behavior during the period of EP6 that occurred before the salary vote.

    Variable F ractionAbsentip captures the fraction of sittings in parliamentary session p during

     Data on voting and attendance in the plenaries of EP6 and EP7 was collected from the published daily minutes
on the European Parliament website, http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/plenary/home.do?language=EN, be-
tween February 2007 and October 2010. We also collected data on attendance in EP5 which we combined with voting
information from the Hix, Noury, and Roland (2007) data (downloaded in November 2007).
  18
     The published minutes of the meetings also contain information on so-called vote corrections where an MEP asks
to have her registered vote changed in the minutes (without affecting the actual outcome). In our empirical work we
focus on the pre-correction voting outcome but results are robust to considering corrected votes instead. There are
also some instances of secret ballot votes in the data, where each MEP’s vote is not made public. For these it is still
recorded whether each MEP voted.

which MEP i did not participate in any of the votes during the day. (An abstention counts as a

vote.) Variable F ractionSignedInip reflects the fraction of sittings in parliament p during which

MEP i signed the daily register. This outcome measure is difficult to interpret since it conflates

effort (showing up to work) and greed (signing the register even if you are not going to work), and

we use it primarily to compare our results to existing findings in the literature. Finally, motivated

by the scandals mentioned in the introduction, variable F ractionSignedInAbsentip is defined as

the fraction of those sittings in year t when MEP i signed the register but cast zero votes. There

are legitimate reasons an MEP might sign the register but fail to participate in votes – for example,

she might spend the entire day in meetings. That said, we are primarily interested in salary and

corruption as predictors of F ractionSignedInAbsentip , and there are no obvious reasons why these

variables would be correlated with such alternative uses of an MEP’s time. Moreover, if we focus

on days when the parliament voted on more contentious issues – those that passed or failed by

a margin smaller than 10 votes – we obtain very similar results. Variables F ractionAbsentip ,

F ractionSignedInip , and F ractionSignedInAbsentip are our measures of the intensive margin of

labor supply.

       We are also interested in the impact of salary change on the selection of politicians. We use

global rankings of colleges attended by MEPs as a measure of MEP quality. From MEPs’ individual

websites, we identified where each attended college. We were able to obtain this information for

nearly 90 percent of the sample. We merged these data with the 2010 Academic Ranking of

World Universities, which provides a rank for the top 500 universities in the world.19 The variable

F ractionRankedCollegecp is the fraction of MEPs from country c in parliament p who attended a

school ranked in the top 500.20 Most MEPs attend college in their home country, and countries vary

widely in their universities’ representation in the ranking. Consequently, F ractionRankedCollegecp

is not particularly useful for identifying cross-sectional variation in the quality of MEPs across

countries, but it does capture the change in quality of MEPs from a given country over time.

We could have also defined similar variables with a different cutoff, e.g., a fraction of MEPs who
  19
     Since rankings might change somewhat over time, it would have been more suitable to utilize the rank of a school
at the time when the MEP attended it, but the available data only go back to 2003 and many MEPs have been out
of college for more than seven years.
  20
     For our main specification, we simply drop the 10 percent of MEPs without education data and treat the
information as missing randomly. Including all MEPs in the analysis and coding those with missing data as having
gone to an unranked school strengthens our results.


                                                         10
attended a school ranked in the top 200, but since only about 29 percent of MEPs with available

education data attended a ranked school at all, F ractionRankedCollegecp captures most of the

relevant variation.

    MEPs’ individual websites provided us with data on each MEP’s age and periods in office,

on the basis of which we define self-explanatory variables Ageip , AgeSqip , and lnT enureip , which

reflect age and tenure the first year of parliament p. We gathered country-by-year data on GDP per

capita in constant 2000 U.S. dollars, and control for income at the beginning of each parliament

(lnGDP P Ccp ) from the World Development Indicators. Finally, as our measure of corruption

(Corruptioncp ) we use data from Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi (2010). These data consist

of a composite corruption index that is essentially the first principal component of a number of

other commonly used corruption indices, which are usually subjective measures based on surveys

of country experts and investors. For ease of interpretation, we reverse the sign of the original

measure so that higher values indicate greater corruption, and assign a value to each EP-country

observation based on the corruption index in the first year of the parliament. By construction, the

mean value of this measure across all countries in the global sample is zero with standard deviation

one; for our sample of European countries it ranges from -2.2 to -0.3. Table 1 reports summary

statistics for the variables used in our analysis.



3    Impact of salary and social norms on labor supply and selection

     of MEPs

As we mentioned earlier, in the past MEPs received the same salary as members of the lower house

of their own national parliament. Table 2 reports MEPs’ salaries by country as of December 2004,

during the 6th parliament. Starting with EP7, which began in July 2009, salaries were equalized to

roughly €84,000 for all MEPs. Our empirical strategy for estimating the impact of salary change

on labor supply is based on the assumption that the timing of this salary change is uncorrelated

with a change in omitted variables that would differentially influence the labor supply of MEPs

from countries that initially had low and high salaries.

    To identify the impact of social capital on labor supply, we rely on the cross-sectional variation



                                                     11
in corruption across countries. We take a broad interpretation of this country-level measure as

reflecting values of public service over private gain.


3.1      Extensive margin of labor supply

Our first specification examines the impact of the salary change on the willingness of incumbent

MEPs to seek reelection. We consider a linear probability model:21


            ReRunip = β0 + β1 × ∆lnSalaryc + β2 × EP 7p + β3 × EP 7p × ∆lnSalaryc + εip                    (1)


where p ∈ {6, 7}. The sample consists of all MEPs who served in EP5, and those MEPs who

served in EP6 and joined the parliament prior to the announcement of the salary change.22 EP 7p

is an indicator variable for whether p = 7. ReRunip denotes whether MEP i ran for reelection for

parliament p, and ∆lnSalaryc is the salary change instituted at the beginning of EP7, defined in

the previous section. In this specification, as in all others, robust standard errors are clustered by

country.

       Coefficient β1 captures the cross-sectional relationship between the salary in EP6 and the will-

ingness of MEPs who served in EP5 to run for reelection for EP6. Since ∆lnSalaryc is defined

as a constant (ln (84000)) minus log of salary in EP6, a negative β1 indicates a positive cross-

sectional relationship between salary and the extensive margin of labor supply. Coefficient β2 tells

us whether, in the absence of a salary change, MEPs are overall more likely to run for reelection

for EP7 or for EP6. The main coefficient of interest is β3 , which identifies the impact of the salary

change on willingness to run for reelection.

       Column (1) of Table 3 reports the results without controls. The estimate of β1 is −0.18

(p < 0.01) suggesting that MEPs from high-salary countries were more likely to run for reelection

for EP6. Note, however, that all of the MEPs in the sample had already expressed their willingness

to hold the office at the salary level offered by their country. Consequently, β̂1 should be interpreted

with caution. The estimate of β2 is −0.090 (p < 0.01) which means that, in the absence of a salary

change, MEPs were about 9 percentage points less likely to run for reelection for EP7 than for EP6.
  21
     Throughout the paper we use a linear probability model when the outcome variable is binary. We obtain very
similar results if we use logit or probit specifications instead.
  22
     This means that we exclude all MEPs from Romania and Bulgaria since they joined in 2007.


                                                      12
The estimate of β3 is 0.30 (p < 0.01). This implies that doubling an MEP’s salary (a magnitude of

change well within the range of salary changes observed in the data) increases the likelihood that
                                                                                       
the MEP runs for reelection by 21 percentage points ln (2) × β̂3 = 0.21 . Given that on average

57 percent of MEPs seek reelection (Table 1), this constitutes a 37 percent increase in labor sup-

ply. This magnitude is sufficiently large for β̂1 + β̂3 = 0.13 to be significantly higher than zero

(p < 0.01). This means that, even though all MEPs receive the same salary in EP7, those MEPs

who had previously received a higher salary in EP6 are less willing to run for office in EP7. This

could be caused either by selection (MEPs from higher salary countries have a higher reservation

wage), or by preferences that depend on salary changes as well as salary levels (Kahneman and

Tversky 1979).

    Countries in the European Union utilize three different types of voting systems. In open-list

systems, voters cast votes for particular candidates (most of whom are identified with a party). In

closed-list systems, voters vote for parties, each of which maintains a list of candidates. Finally,

in ordered-list systems, voters can either vote for a party or for an individual on a party list, but

a high proportion of votes is required to undo the party-mandated ordering of candidates. The

process of seeking reelection thus differs as a function of the electoral system employed: in an open-

list system, a candidate directly chooses to run while in a closed-list system she needs her party’s

approval to do so. In Figure 1, we plot the change in the fraction of MEPs who run for reelection

against ∆lnSalaryc . As the figure shows, the positive relationship between the two variables is not

driven by extreme observations, nor by countries with a particular electoral system.

    Column (2) of Table 3 adds country by EP controls (lnGDP P Ccp and Corruptioncp ) to Equa-

tion 1. These variables are measured in the last year of parliament p − 1, i.e., at the time when

the MEP was likely making the decision of whether to run for reelection. Column (3) adds MEP

by EP controls (Ageip , AgeSqip , and lnT enureip ), also measured in the last year of parliament

p − 1. Column (4) adds country fixed effects. The estimate of our key coefficient of interest, β3 , is

stable across these four specifications.23 The estimate in column (4), which contains our preferred

specification, implies that a doubling of MEP salary increases the likelihood of rerunning by 23
  23
     We also ran a specification that included the 2007-2009 change in lnGDP P Ccp interacted with EP 7 as a control,
to account for possible effects of the financial crisis on the decision to run for reelection. This had no effect on the
coefficients of interest in Table 3, or those in Table 4 below.

percentage points.

       A somewhat stronger way to express diminished interest in serving as an MEP is to quit before

the term expires. In Table 4, we consider a linear probability model:


       P ostV oteQuitip = β0 + β1 × ∆lnSalaryc + β2 × EP 6p + β3 × EP 6p × ∆lnSalaryc + εip                       (2)


where p ∈ {5, 6} and EP 6p is an indicator variable for whether p = 6. Recall that P ostV oteQuitip

equals 1 if MEP i quit her job before completing her term at some point after June 23rd of the

second calendar year of parliament p. For p = 6, this indicates quitting the parliament after the

vote on the salary change. For p = 5, this indicates quitting the parliament during the same

segment of the electoral cycle, but in the parliamentary session before the salary change had been

introduced. As in Table 3, Column (1) reports the baseline results, Column (2) adds country by

EP controls, Column (3) adds MEP by EP controls, and Column (4) adds country fixed effects.

The estimate of our key coefficient of interest, β3 , changes somewhat across the specifications, but

it is always negative and is statistically significant when we include MEP by EP controls and/or

country fixed effects, our preferred specifications. Overall, the results in Table 4 suggest that a

lower salary increases the likelihood that an MEP will quit her job before completing her term of

office.

       The results in Tables 3 and 4 focus on the willingness of incumbent politicians to continue to

hold their offices. More directly relevant for the welfare of the electorate is the overall supply of

potential candidates and platforms. It is not feasible to identify the overall number of potential

candidates, however, because only nine member countries have open-list electoral systems. We

therefore focus on the number of political parties that field candidates. This measure applies

equally well to countries that use closed-list and open-list electoral systems, since even in countries

with open-list systems almost all candidates are associated with some political party.24 In Table 5,
  24
    Readers familiar primarily with the political system of the United States should note that most European countries
have a large number of politically active parties and some of those parties are at the margin where they might focus
exclusively on national politics or might spend some of their resources vying for a greater role in European politics.
At the same time, in many countries small parties focusing only on European politics (and oftentimes on a single
political issue) also form to field candidates exclusively in EP elections.




                                                         14
we consider OLS specifications of the form:


   lnN umP artiescp = β0 + β1 × ∆lnSalaryc + β2 × EP 7p + β3 × EP 7p × ∆lnSalaryc + εcp                          (3)


where p ∈ {6, 7}. As Column (1) shows, β̂1 = −0.22 (p < 0.05), indicating that, in the cross-

section, countries that paid higher salaries to their MEPs in EP6 had more parties field candidates

for those positions. The estimate of β2 is very close to zero, suggesting that in the absence of a

salary change, there would have been no temporal trend in the number of parties fielding candidates

to the European Parliament. The estimate of β3 is 0.16 (p < 0.05). The standard deviation of

lnN umP arties in EP6 is 0.37,25 so β̂3 implies that doubling MEP salaries would increase the log

number of parties by about 29% of a standard deviation. In Column (2) of Table 5 we add country

by EP controls, and in Column (3) we add country fixed effects. The estimate of β3 is significant

in each of the three specifications.

       In Figure 2, we plot the change in lnN umP artiesc against ∆lnSalaryc , indicating electoral

system as open, closed, or ordered. As the figure shows, the positive relationship between the two

variables is not driven by extreme observations.

       The impact of salary on the number of parties that field a candidate suggests that increasing

politicians’ salaries provides the electorate with a broader choice of political platforms. As empha-

sized by the literature on the valuation of new goods (Bresnahan and Gordon 1997), this broader

choice set is likely to increase welfare.26 Since voters do not express their willingness to pay to

have one candidate over another, we obviously cannot compute the associated increase in welfare

in monetary terms.27 Moreover, an increase in the number of parties in the European Parliament

may have other, indirect, benefits besides providing the electorate with new platforms they prefer

over the existing ones. For instance, it could be that the presence of competing parties leads the

existing parties to become less corrupt or more responsive to voter preferences.28
  25
     This is somewhat different from the overall standard deviation of lnN umP arties reported in Table 1, since that
calculation includes observations from both EP6 and EP7.
  26
     For a caveat, however, see Kamenica (2008).
  27
     One possibility might be to use data on vote shares to estimate the fraction of the electorate whose preferred
choice is a new party whose participation was induced by higher salaries, but this approach is not feasible since in
many countries there is substantial entry and exit of parties that participate in European politics.
  28
     This is analogous to standard arguments in industrial organization. Even if few consumers buy products from a
new entrant, the entry can increase consumer welfare by lowering the prices of incumbent firms.



                                                         15
   Overall, our three measures of the extensive margin of labor supply, ReRunip , P ostV oteQuiteip ,

and lnN umP artiescp , suggest that the salary associated with a political office has a substantial

impact on the number of candidates willing to hold that office.


3.2   Intensive margin of labor supply

In this subsection, we study the effect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary incentives on the inten-

sive margin of labor supply. Our three measures, F ractionAbsentip , F ractionSignedInip , and

F ractionSignedInAbsentip , are defined in Section 2. We begin with our primary measure of the

intensive margin of labor supply, F ractionAbsentip , the fraction of sittings in parliament p during

which an MEP cast no votes (abstentions are included as votes cast). In Table 6, we consider OLS

specifications of the form:


F ractionAbsentip = β0 + β1 × ∆lnSalaryc + β2 × EP 7p + β3 × EP 7p × ∆lnSalaryc + εip . (4)


As noted above, we focus on the first year of each parliament to avoid comparing behaviors across

different points in the electoral cycle and further to concentrate on behavior during the period

of EP6 that occurred before the salary vote. The coefficient β1 captures any cross-sectional re-

lationship between pre-harmonization salaries and the tendency of MEPs to be absent. All of

the estimates of β1 are negative, but in each case, the coefficient is imprecisely estimated and

statistically insignificant. Estimates of β2 are also negative but insignificant.

   The point estimates on the main coefficient of interest, β3 , are positive and insignificant. In

some specifications, the positive estimate is close to conventional significance, but when we include

country fixed effects, the estimated coefficient drops to 0.00, with a standard error of 0.019. Thus,

while specifications with sparse controls might suggest that higher salary decreases effort, our

preferred specification implies that salary change has no effect. Moreover, as we shall discuss

below, any impact of salary on effort is likely to be driven by selection effects.

   We now turn to the impact of salary on F ractionSignedInip , the fraction of days an MEP

signed the daily register in parliament p. We include this specification primarily so we can relate

our analysis to the existing literature; as we mentioned earlier, this outcome measure is difficult to



                                                  16
interpret since it conflates effort (showing up to work) and greed (signing the register even if you

are not going to work). In Table 7, we consider OLS specifications of the form:


F ractionSignedInip = β0 + β1 × ∆lnSalaryc + β2 × EP 7p + β3 × EP 7p × ∆lnSalaryc + εip .(5)


In Column (1), we report the coefficients from the regression in Equation (5). Column (2) adds

country by time period controls. Column (3) adds MEP by time period controls. Column (4) adds

country fixed effects. In a concurrent paper, Mocan and Altindag (2011) also explore how salary

changes induced by the reform in the European Parliament affected the tendency of MEPs to sign

the register. Our specification is somewhat different from theirs, but it reveals roughly the same

pattern. Like Mocan and Altindag (2011), we find a small negative point estimate on β3 . Our

estimates are similar in magnitude to those of Mocan and Altindag (2011), but we find a far lower

level of statistical significance, presumably because we cluster our standard errors by country.

   Finally, we examine the behavior that was at the root of the scandals we discussed in the

introduction: the tendency of MEPs to sign the register and then immediately leave the building.

Recall that F ractionSignedInAbsentip is defined as the fraction of those sittings in year t when

MEP i signed the register but cast zero votes. In Table 8, we consider an OLS specification of the

form:


               F ractionSignedInAbsentip = β0 + β1 × ∆lnSalaryc + β2 × EP 7p

                                                   +β3 × EP 7p × ∆lnSalaryc + εip .                (6)


None of the coefficients of interest, β1 through β3 , is significant in any specification.

   Coefficient β3 in Tables 6 and 8 captures the overall impact (or lack there of) of salary change

on the intensive margin of labor supply. These coefficients, however, reflect both a treatment effect

(the impact on the MEPs who are in office) and a potential selection effect (the change in the type

of MEPs that hold office). In Table 9, we try to disentangle these two effects. In Panel A, we repeat

the analyses of Tables 6 and 8 limiting the sample to freshman MEPs in each parliament, while in

Panel B we use the sample of incumbent MEPs. To conserve space, we present only specifications

with country and individual controls, and those with country fixed effects. Overall, the estimate

                                                   17
of β3 is much greater in magnitude and has a smaller standard error in Panel A than in Panel B.

This pattern suggests that, to the extent that there is any impact of salary on the intensive margin

of labor supply at all,29 it stems from a higher salary attracting MEPs who exert less effort rather

than from a change in the effort of incumbent MEPs. We further examine the selection effects

induced by the salary change in the next subsection.

      One possible reason for the limited impact of salaries on the intensive margin is that politicians’

motivations to exert effort while in office may be dominated by non-pecuniary considerations. In

particular, the desire to perform one’s public duty combined with the fear of social sanction may

prevent shirking. Following the approach in Fisman and Miguel (2007), we use corruption as a

proxy for a country’s social norms. Looking back at Tables 6-8, we observe that home-country

corruption is consistently associated with lower attendance: MEPs from more corrupt countries

are more likely to be absent from roll-call votes; they are less likely to sign the daily register; and

conditional on signing the register, they are more likely to be absent. The estimates are large in

magnitude. For example, the point estimate on corruption in Table 8 (Column 2) implies that

a one standard deviation increase in the corruption level of an MEP’s home country increases

F ractionSignedInAbsentip (evaluated at the sample mean of 8.0 percent) by about 16 percent.

      It is worth noting that our results on corruption are identified from cross-sectional variation;

unsurprisingly, when we include country fixed effects, the impact of corruption is inconsistent in

magnitude and significance, as within-country variation in corruption ratings is essentially noise.

In contrast, we take advantage of a plausibly exogenous salary change to identify the sensitivity

of MEP behavior to financial incentives. Hence, our evidence on the effects of social norms may

be more vulnerable to omitted variable bias. That said, the coefficient on corruption remains very

stable in magnitude and significance as we include additional covariates. This stability suggests

that if the observable characteristics in our data are representative of the unobservables, omitted

variable bias is unlikely to drive our results (Altonji, Elder, and Taber 2005).
 29
      Note that β3 is not significant in any specification once we include country fixed effects.




                                                            18
3.3      Quality of MEPs

The fact that higher wages induce more individuals to seek a political office does not by itself imply

that the quality of elected officials will increase. In fact, as discussed in the introduction, there are

several theoretical models which suggest that a higher salary may lower the quality of candidates

and elected politicians. Moreover, Table 9 presented suggestive evidence that higher salary attracts

MEPs that are more prone to absenteeism and shirking. In this subsection, we analyze the impact

of the salary change on the quality of elected MEPs as proxied by the global rankings of the

undergraduate institutions they attended. Many studies have found that individuals who attend

more selective colleges have greater permanent income. For example, Kane (1998) shows that, in

the United States, attending a college with a 100 point higher average SAT is associated with 3

to 7 percent higher earnings later in life.30 Hence, MEPs who attended a more selective college

are likely to be more productive workers, and as long as market skill is positively correlated with

political skill, this would also mean they are likely to be more effective politicians. Moreover,

college selectivity of an MEP strongly predicts reelection conditional on rerunning – a pattern that

continues to hold if we include country fixed effects and/or controls for other MEP characteristics.31

This correlation further supports our view that college selectivity is a good proxy for MEPs’ quality,

particularly in the eyes of voters.

       In Section 2, we describe the construction of the variable F ractionRankedCollegecp . In Table

10, we consider OLS specifications of the form:


 F ractionRankedCollegecp = β0 +β1 ×∆lnSalaryc +β2 ×EP 7p +β3 ×EP 7p ×∆lnSalaryc +εcp . (7)


In Columns (1) through (3), we simply drop the 10% of MEPs where we could not identify their

undergraduate institutions. In Column (1), coefficient β1 is imprecisely estimated. Estimate of

β2 is positive and significant (p < 0.01) which means that, net of the impact of salary change, the

quality of MEPs in EP7 was greater than in EP6. The estimate of β3 is −0.06 (p < 0.01). This

implies that doubling an MEP’s salary reduces the likelihood than an elected MEP attended a
  30
      Most of the literature on this topic strives to disentangle the causal impact of college selectivity on future earnings
from selection effects (e.g., Dale and Krueger 2002). For our purposes, however, it does not matter whether college
selectivity causes or simply predicts high permanent income.

top university by 4.2 percentage points. Given that around 30% of MEPs overall attend a top

university, this is a reduction of 14 percent. In Column (2) we include country by EP controls. The

estimate of β3 is unaffected. Column (3) includes country fixed effects. This makes the coefficient

less precisely estimated, and thus no longer significant at the 5 percent level (p = 0.079). In

Columns (4) through (6) we redefine our outcome variable F ractionRankedCollegecp by including

all MEPs and coding those with missing education data as having gone to an unranked school.

This alternative specification slightly strengthens our results.

   Overall, our results provide support for the view, emphasized by theoretical work discussed

in the introduction, that higher salaries might decrease the quality of elected officials. Thus, at

least in the context of the European Parliament, this negative selection effect needs to be weighed

against the benefits of increased competition suggested by the results in Subsection 3.1.


3.4   Intensive margin of labor supply and election outcomes

Finally, we turn to the relationship between absenteeism and shirking, on one hand, and the

likelihood that an incumbent MEP gets elected conditional on running for reelection on the other.

In Table 11, we consider a linear probability model:


                       ReElectedip = β0 + β1 × AttendanceRecordip−1 + εip .                      (8)


The sample is the set of all MEPs who served in EP5 and ran for reelection for EP6 and MEPs who

served in EP6 and ran for reelection for EP7. ReElectedip is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the

MEP was elected to parliament p. We consider the same three measures of AttendanceRecordip−1

as in the previous subsection, but incorporate votes in all years, since there is no clear reason to

limit the sample to the first year of each parliament. In Columns (1), (3), and (5), we report the

coefficients from the regressions in Equation (8). In Columns (2), (4), and (6), we add controls for

EP 7, MEP by EP controls, and country fixed effects. Across all specifications, we find that MEPs

with better attendance records are significantly more likely to be reelected at the 5% level. The

only exception is the estimate in Column (4) where the point estimate on F ractionSignedInip−1

is only significant at the 10% level. Of course, the results in Table 11 should be interpreted with



                                                  20
considerable caution since we are looking at reelection results conditional on the fact that the MEP

chose to run for reelection. With that caveat in mind, these results provide suggestive evidence

that voters prefer MEPs who exert more effort while in office.

   If this relationship between electoral success and effort is assumed to be causal, it becomes

more difficult to reconcile our two earlier findings: higher salaries make the office of MEP more

desirable but do not decrease shirking. It may be, however, that the increased electoral incentive

is insufficient to induce higher effort, or that MEPs are myopic in their behavior between elections.


3.5   Endogeneity concerns

The validity of the analysis in the preceding subsections rests on the assumption that the timing

of the change in salary regime is uncorrelated with a change in other factors that differentially

affect MEPs from low-salary and high-salary countries. One concern would be that the salary

equalization proposal got passed precisely when the MEPs from low-salary countries were more

likely to run for reelection and thus particularly motivated to raise future salaries. There are two

sets of facts that alleviate this concern. First, this explanation could not account for the increased

number of parties that field a candidate when salaries increase. If anything, facing more motivated

incumbents would be a deterrent that would lead to fewer challengers. Second, as we report in

Table 12, whether an MEP voted for or against salary harmonization is uncorrelated with whether

the regime change would raise or lower her salary. Specifically, we let V oteF orSalaryChangei be

an indicator variable for whether MEP i voted for salary harmonization and we consider a linear

probability model:


                      V oteF orSalaryChangei = β0 + β1 × ∆lnSalaryc + εi .                        (9)


Whether we consider this baseline specification (Column 1), add MEP-level controls (Column 2),

or further include country-level controls (Column 3), the estimate of β1 is small and insignificant.

Similarly, if we include V oteF orSalaryChangei as a control to any of the regressions considered

above, the results are unchanged.

4    Conclusion

We provide evidence on the impact of pecuniary and non-pecuniary incentives on both the extensive

and the intensive margins of politicians’ labor supply. We take advantage of a unique set of

circumstances – a salary reform in the European Parliament that allows for a credible identification

of financial motives, and the cross-country nature of the parliament itself which provides variation in

the norms of politicians’ home communities. We also introduce an innovative measure of politicians’

shirking, based on signing the attendance register to collect a daily allowance, but not participating

in session votes.

    Our results imply that a higher salary: (i) attracts more candidates and more parties, (ii) has

no substantial impact on effort exerted while in office, and (iii) reduces the quality of elected MEPs.

Meanwhile, non-pecuniary factors seem to play an important role in inducing politicians to exert

effort while in office.

    There are many questions raised by these results. Most obviously, it would be important to

know the extent to which our set of findings would carry over to politicians in other places or

other levels of government. Furthermore, while we find that home-country social norms influence

the intensive margin of labor supply, we are unable to distinguish whether these norms operate

through politicians’ internal motivations or through social pressure from the electorate. By care-

fully considering how the media coverage of scandals affects MEPs’ behavior, one might better

understand the relative importance of these two channels. It may also be useful to understand

whether political institutions such as term limits and electoral rules interact with pecuniary and

non-pecuniary motives in influencing politicians’ behavior. Finally, given our preliminary results

on the role of selection effects in the behavior of elected MEPs, it will be important to assess the

impacts of salary changes in the longer run.

     A. MEP-Parliament Variables. Ageip and AgeSqip/100 are based on the age of MEP i in the first year of
parliament p. Tenureip is the number of years MEP i has been in office as of the first year of parliament p. ReRunip is
an indicator variable that equals 1 if MEP i served in parliament p – 1 and ran for reelection for parliament p.
ReRunip is missing for 16 observations. ReElectedip is an indicator variable for whether MEP i served in parliament p
– 1 and was reelected to parliament p. PostVoteQuitip is an indicator variable that equals 1 if MEP i served in
parliament p and quit before completing the parliamentary term at some point after June 23rd of the second calendar
year of parliament p. FractionAbsentip is the fraction of sittings in the first parliament year of parliament p during
which MEP i did not participate in any of the roll-call votes. FractionSignedInip is the fraction of sittings in the first
parliament year of parliament p during which MEP i signed the daily register. FractionSignedInAbsentip is the
fraction of sittings during which MEP i signed the register in the first parliament year of parliament p that she did
not participate in any of the roll-call votes. FractionSignedInAbsentip is missing for MEPs who never signed in.
     B. Country-Parliament Variables. lnNumPartiescp is defined as the logarithm of the number of parties in
country c that received at least 0.5% of the vote for parliament p. FractionRankedCollegecp is the fraction of MEPs
from country c in parliament p who attended a college ranked in the top 500 by the 2010 Academic Ranking of
World Universities.
     C. Country Variables. ΔlnSalaryc is defined as the logarithm of 84,000 (the post-change uniform salary level)
minus the logarithm of the salary for MEPs from country c as of December 2004. lnGDPPCc is the logarithm of the
GDP per capita in constant 2000 U.S. dollars in country c and year 2005 from the World Development Indicators.
Corruptionc is the measure of corruption in country c and year 2005 based on Kaufmann et al. (2010).

MEP-Parliament for EP6 and EP7. The sample consists of all MEPs in EP5 and those who joined EP6 before the
vote on salary change. The dependent variable in all regressions is ReRunip, an indicator variable that equals 1 if
MEP i served in parliament p – 1 and ran for reelection for parliament p. ΔlnSalaryc is defined as the logarithm of
84,000 (the post-change uniform salary level) minus the logarithm of the salary for MEPs from country c as of
December 2004. EP7p is an indicator variable for whether p = 7. lnGDPPCcp, Corruptioncp, Ageip, AgeSqip/100, and
lnTenureip are measured in the last year of parliament p – 1 and are defined in Table 1.

Linear probability model; robust standard errors clustered by country in parentheses. The level of observation is
MEP. The sample consists of all MEPs who were members of the Parliament at the time of the vote. The dependent
variable in all regressions is VoteForSalaryChangei, an indicator variable for whether MEP i voted for the salary
change. ΔlnSalaryc is defined as the logarithm of 84,000 (the post-change uniform salary level) minus the logarithm
of the salary for MEPs from country c as of December 2004. Agei, AgeSqi/100, Tenurei, lnGDPPCc, and Corruptionc
are measured in the parliament year of the vote on salary change (July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005) and are defined in
Table 1. * significant at 5 percent; ** significant at 1 percent.
