                                        ABSTRACT

Credit markets typically freeze in recessions: access to credit declines and the cost of credit
increases. A conventional policy response is to rely on monetary tools to saturate financial
markets with liquidity. Given limited space for monetary policy in the current economic
conditions, we study how fiscal stimulus can influence local credit markets. Using rich
geographical variation in U.S. federal government contracts, we document that, in a local
economy, interest rates on consumer loans decrease in response to an expansionary government
spending shock.

1. Introduction
Credit markets typically freeze in recessions: access to credit declines and the cost of credit
increases. A conventional policy response is to rely on monetary tools to saturate financial markets
with liquidity. Given limited space for monetary policy in the current economic conditions (e.g.,
interest rates remain low, additional rounds of quantitative easing may run into diminishing
returns, and liquidity is abundant), there is an urgent need to explore the potency of other tools for
restarting credit markets in economic downturns.
           Government spending has traditionally been considered a counterproductive policy tool for
stimulating credit. Standard Keynesian and neoclassical theories predict that an increase in
government spending raises interest rates, thereby lowering private-sector spending and investment.
But there is a dearth of evidence to support the notion that government spending tightens credit
markets (see Murphy and Walsh 2018 for a review). To the contrary, a growing body of evidence
from the United States and other advanced economies suggests that government spending can cause
a decline in long-term interest rates (e.g., Miranda-Pinto et al. 2019). These studies point to a gap in
economists' understanding of the relationship between fiscal stimulus and credit markets.
           In this paper we bring detailed panel data on Department of Defense (DOD) contracts
across U.S. cities to bear on the question of how government spending affects credit markets. We
merge our data on DOD contracts with RateWatch 1 data on interest rates for a range of consumer
loan products. After documenting tangible variation in interest rates across locations, we find that
increases in DOD spending in a city cause a significant decline in local interest rates. Given that
demand for credit--often proxied with car registrations--increases in response to government
spending shocks (e.g., Auerbach et al. 2019a), we infer that the rate reduction is due to an
expansion of credit supply.
           We propose and test two channels through which DOD spending could increase credit
supply. First, DOD spending could be associated with an injection of liquidity into the local
economy. If credit markets are segmented across cities (in particular, if local bank branches can set
rates that differ from national rates for similar consumer loans), then the injection should lower
interest rates broadly in its location. Second, DOD expansions can lower lenders' assessed riskiness

                                                   1
of local borrowers (e.g. by lowering the probability of a local recession), hence reducing local risk
premia. The second channel could operate even if credit markets are integrated across locations.
       A number of features of the data allow us to explore these channels. The DOD data include
information on the location of the contractor, the date the contract was signed, the amount of the
contract obligation, and the duration of the contract. From this information we construct a measure
of quarterly outlays. As discussed by Auerbach et al. (2019b, henceforth AGM), these outlays
include payments from the DOD for production that would have occurred anyway ("wealth
transfers")--either because the outlay was anticipated or because firms smooth production over
lumpy contracts--as well as payments for new production. We filter out the new production
component using a Bartik (1991) type instrument, as proposed by AGM, which allows us to
distinguish between the effects of anticipated outlays (liquidity injections) and the effects of new
demand for local production. The RateWatch data include a range of interest rates charged by local
lenders, including mortgages of varying duration, auto loans for new and used cars of varying
duration, and home equity lines of credit (HELOC) with different loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. By
combining the DOD data with the RateWatch data, we can examine how different components of
DOD spending affect interest rates for different types of loans.
       We find that outlays (which primarily reflect "wealth transfers") lower broad categories of
interest rates, indicating that outlays are associated with an inflow of liquidity into local credit
markets. We also find that DOD spending associated with new production lowers rates, and the
effect is approximately an order of magnitude larger than the effect of "wealth transfers". This
differential response is consistent with a decrease in local risk premia: outlays that are associated
with new production and increased worker earnings cause a stronger interest rate reduction than
liquidity injections. Furthermore, new production causes a stronger decline in interest rates that
tend to be risker. For example, we find that rates on (potentially higher-risk) loans for used
automobiles fall more strongly than rates on (potentially low-risk) loans for new automobiles.
       Our results indicate that government spending can indeed spur credit provision, both by
injecting liquidity through contractors' balance sheets and possibly by lowering risk premia. The
reduction in risk premia may be associated with lenders' upward revision in the likelihood that lenders
will repay, due to increased demand for local production and hence increased current and future
earnings. This mechanism is akin to the financial accelerator emphasized in Bernanke et al. (1999).



                                                  2
         In addition to providing new evidence on the effects of fiscal policy on credit markets, our
evidence contributes more broadly to the literature on regional credit market integration and the
role of local bank branches in provision of local credit. For example, recent work documents that
local liquidity shocks cause an increase in mortgage originations by banks that have branches in
the location (Gilje, Loutskina, and Strahan 2016). We examine credit responses among different
types of loans to both local production shocks and liquidity shocks, and we find that rates on the
types of loans that are less likely to be securitized (e.g., HELOC and auto loans) are more
responsive to local shocks. 2
         Our evidence also contributes to recent work on the effects of capital flows into a local
economy, as our measure of outlays is akin to capital injections that have been explored in the
empirical capital flow literature (e.g., Blanchard et al., 2016). We find that capital injections
expand credit markets even in a monetary and banking union, although the effect is smaller than
the effect of a production (export) demand shock.


2. Data and Methodology
Our analysis relies on regional variation in DOD spending. Apart from DOD contracts being
plausibly exogenous to local conditions, DOD spending does not directly influence utility of
households or infrastructure in an area receiving a DOD spending shock. These properties give us
a better chance to isolate potential channels of demand shocks. The main outcome variable in our
analysis is the price of consumer loans. We conduct our analysis at the unit of the city-quarter,
where city is defined as a core-based statistical area (CBSA). We restrict our analysis to cities with
population greater than 50,000. Descriptive statistics are reported in Appendix Table 1.


A.       Government Spending Data
Our data on DOD contracts is from USAspending.gov. The data contain detailed information on
contracts signed since 2000, including the date of new contract obligations, the duration of the
contract, the amount of the contract, and the zip code in which the majority of work is performed.
AGM and Demyanyk et al. (2019) use this information to construct annual outlays associated with


2
  Loutskina (2011), Figure 1 documents securitization rates among loans in the U.S. economy. Home mortgages
exhibited securitization rates of just below 60% in the 2000s, while securitization rates for other consumer loans were
below 30%.

                                                          3
each contract. We adapt their approach to construct a measure of outlays at the quarterly
frequency. 3 We then aggregate the quarterly series of contract-level outlays to the city level. AGM
and Demyanyk et al. (2019) provide additional details on the DOD data.
         As emphasized by AGM, DOD outlays consist of payments for new production as well as
payments for production that would have occurred anyway, either because the specific contract
was anticipated or because firms smooth production over lumpy contracts. We follow AGM and
extract the component of DOD spending that is associated with new production by instrumenting
for outlays with a Bartik-type instrument. We merge information on DOD contracts with employee
earnings by location from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which we
use to scale changes in DOD outlays.


B.       Data on Interest Rates
We use data provided by RateWatch to construct series of local interest rates. RateWatch surveys
bank branches across the country and gathers information on a wide spectrum of consumer loan
products and limited information on business loans. The RateWatch data begin in 2001 and include
information on the date on which an institution was surveyed, the specifics (including the interest
rate) of different loan contracts, and the identity of the branch responsible for setting the interest rate.
The reporting branch is in the same city as the rate-setting branch in approximately 90 percent of the
sample. For each type of consumer loan, financial institutions report the interest rate that applies to
their most credit-worthy borrowers. They also report other features of loans when applicable,
including fees, time to maturity, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, balloon rates, and other loan costs.
         We construct city-level series of broad categories of interest rates (e.g., Auto Loans), as well
as for rates on specific loan products (e.g., used car loans with a maturity of 60 months). For each
interest rate series, we take the average rate across surveyed institutions in a city-quarter. Figure 1
shows the historical distribution of various interest rates across cities since 2001. Appendix Figures
1 and 2 plot the distribution for more narrowly defined loan products (e.g., 30-year fixed mortgage
of $175,000). There is substantial regional variation in rates, particularly for HELOC (home equity
lines of credit) loans and auto loans. Rates on mortgages exhibit far less variation across cities, likely


3
 In particular, we divide the total amount of the obligation by the number of quarters specified in the contract and we
allocate outlays equally across quarters. For example, a contract that specifies $1 million to be paid over two years is
associated with $125,000 in outlays in each of the eight quarters.

                                                           4
due to the fact that mortgage loans are typically securitized rather than held on local banks' balance
sheet, which drives stronger integration of rates across locations. Appendix Figures 3-5 plot the
historical evolutions of cross-city coefficients of variation for broad categories of interest rates. The
dispersion in rates has increased since 2009, particularly for auto loans.


C.      Econometric specification
Following AGM, our baseline specification is a projection of interest rates on DOD outlays and
lags of outlays, lags of earnings, lags of interest rates, and city and time fixed effects:

                                         =1                          =1
                          
                                                                                                   (1)
                      +   ,- - ,--4  +  +  +  ,

where  and  index cities and time (quarters), , is the interest rate for a given type of consumer
loans, , is the DOD outlays, , is labor earnings, and  and  are city and time fixed effects.
Each of our data series exhibits seasonality, the strength of which varies across cities. To uniformly
account for this seasonality, we examine differences (or growth rates) over four quarters rather
than over a single quarter.
        The coefficient of interest is  , which estimates the effect of a percent (relative to lagged
labor earnings) increase in DOD outlays on the change in interest rates. We also examine
specifications in which we replace , - ,-4 with ,+4 - ,-4 as the regressand to examine
effects 4 quarters after the DOD shock.
        To isolate the component of DOD spending that is associated with new production, we
instrument DOD spending and its lags with Bartik (1991) shocks. Specifically, we instrument for

              (  {0,1,2,3,4}) with                                           , where  is the national

defense spending in quarter  and  is city 's average share of national DOD spending. AGM
provide a discussion of why the Bartik shock extracts the component of DOD spending associated
with new production filters out the "wealth transfer" component of DOD spending.

3. Empirical Results
Table 1 shows the contemporaneous effect of DOD outlays on various interest rate measures. 4
Column (1) reports the coefficient of interest from the OLS specification, which we interpret as
the effect of a DOD-induced liquidity injection. Column (3) reports the coefficient of interest from
the specification in which outlays are instrumented with the Bartik shock, which we interpret as
the effect of demand for new production.
         Interest rates fall for a range of consumer loans, with HELOC and auto loans exhibiting
the strongest responses. For example, a percent increase in DOD outlays (relative to local labor
earnings) is associated with a 0.24-basis-point reduction in auto loan rates and a 0.30-basis-point
reduction in high-LTV HELOC rates. Outlays associated with new production (column 3) cause
a stronger reduction in rates by an order of magnitude. Rates on short-term loans for used autos
decline the most, falling by 3.08 basis points in response to a percent increase in DOD spending.
There is some evidence of declines in mortgage rates in response to both wealth transfers and new
production, although the magnitudes are smaller than the declines in rates on other loans. We find
no statistically significant response for interest rates on credit cards.
          The results in Table 1 are consistent with the notion that government spending relaxes credit
markets, both through a liquidity injection channel and by reducing the perceived riskiness of
borrowers. The specifications in column (1) are based on raw (uninstrumented) DOD outlays (wealth
transfers) that are derived from prior contract obligations and are therefore potentially anticipated.
These transfers do not contain new information; nor do they have strong direct effects on labor
earnings of local workers (as documented in AGM). Therefore, they simply represent liquidity
injections into the local economy. We conjecture that these transfers might reduce local rates because
they are recorded as new earnings on the balance sheets of local contractors. The balance sheet
improvement for contractors is associated with improved balance sheets for local banks that lend to
the contractors, which facilitates an expansion of credit. 5 This expansion is particularly pronounced
for less-secure loans (e.g., loans for used autos and for high-LTV HELOC) for which local banks
are likely to have a comparative advantage in the provision of soft information (e.g., Ergungor 2010).

4
  The responses at a one-year horizon are reported in Appendix Table 2. The results are consistent with those in Table
1 although the effects are generally smaller and measured with less precision.
5
  Note that the balance sheet expansion here is different from a balance sheet expansion that operates through monetary
policy. Here, transfers appear as income on a contractor's balance sheet and lead to a corresponding increase in firm
equity (which in turn increases the value of loans on banks' balance sheets). In the case of liquidity injections from
the central bank, the liquidity injection to banks is associated with a corresponding reduction in illiquid assets.

                                                          6
       Risk premia also appear to decrease in response to DOD spending, particularly when the
spending is associated with new production. Spending associated with new production causes a
significant increase in workers' earnings (as documented in AGM). The stronger interest rate
response to new production compared to the response to transfers is consistent with new
production causing an increase in expectations of future income and wealth (Murphy 2015) and
lowering the risk of default. The strong reduction in interest rates in column (3) is especially
notable given that DOD production causes a strong increase in auto registrations (as documented
by Auerbach et al. 2019a), which is a proxy for consumption and loan demand. Thus, interest rates
fall despite an increase in loan demand, indicating a strong relaxation of credit markets due to a
downward revision in perceived risk.
       There is also some evidence for the risk premium channel in the differential response of
rates on loans for new cars compared to rates on loans for used cars. Loans for used cars are
potentially higher-risk, as they are backed by less-marketable collateral. Rates for short-term used
car loans fall by 3.08 basis points in response to new DOD production, compared to a decline of
1.13 basis points for short-term loans backed by new cars, indicating a strong decline in the risk
premium charged on (riskier) less-secure loans. Our evidence on risk premia is suggestive, as we
do not observe changes in the composition of borrowers. It is nonetheless informative because the
RateWatch data consist of interest rates charged to financial institutions' most credit-worthy
borrowers for any given loan, which to some extent mitigates concerns over compositional effects.


4. Discussion
Although credit markets are strongly integrated in the U.S., we find that, even in this environment,
anticipated local transfers by the federal government can have a stimulatory effect of the cost of
credit. Furthermore, our evidence that transfers have a stronger effect on rates for loans that are
more likely to be kept on local banks' balance sheets is consistent with recent evidence on the
importance of local liquidity and local banks in the provision of credit (e.g., Gilje, Loutskina, and
Strahan 2016, Ergungor 2010). Our evidence also suggests that government spending can have a
mitigating effect by reducing the perceived riskiness of loans to the private sector.
       The channels of credit market expansion that we document at the local level are relevant
for the national effects of government spending. A distinguishing feature of national spending
(relative to DOD spending in a location) is that national spending is financed within the economy,

                                                 7
typically through bond issuance. Although standard theories suggest that this bond issuance
increases demand for credit and raises interest rates, a number of mechanisms could operate in
general equilibrium to counteract this effect. For example, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2017)
document that, in a weak economy, a fiscal stimulus can lower the cost of public debt, consistent
with the stimulus reducing the risk of a deep slump. Miranda-Pinto et al. (2019) suggest that
government spending can relax credit markets by redistributing income to savers. Murphy and
Walsh (2018) posit that government spending transfers resources to the private sector and increases
their saving, offsetting the credit-market-tightening effects of government bond issuance. Our
results are consistent with these mechanisms and potentially point to a new mechanism based on
a reduction in risk premia. 6
        We conclude that fiscal stimulus can not only expand output but can also contribute to
lowering the cost of credit, a channel of fiscal policy transmission that has not been emphasized
before. There is thus scope for a financial accelerator of the initial stimulus through the credit
channel (as laid out, e.g., in Bernanke et al. 1999). This is a valuable effect when monetary policy
has limited ammunition.
        Furthermore, because market segmentation is amplified when financial markets are
disrupted, there are potentially more opportunities for targeted interventions (Gorodnichenko and
Ray 2017). Specifically, fiscal stimulus directed to areas particularly affected by a recession may
be especially effective. An alternative government intervention could be to introduce uniform
pricing of loans across locations--similar to the requirements imposed by Freddie Mac and Fannie
Mae on consumer mortgages--so that local business cycles are not propagated through variation
in local credit risk. Hurst et al. (2016) document that this policy helped redistribute resources to
areas hit by the Great Recession relatively strongly.

  There is more work to be done to isolate the risk premium channel and precise mechanisms through which risk
premia decline. One possibility is that government spending increases perceptions of households' and firms' future
income and wealth (Murphy 2015), which reduces the risk of default.

Notes: The table report estimated coefficient  in specification (1). Column (1) reports OLS estimates. Column (3)
reports instrumental variable estimates (Bartik instrument). Column (4) reports the Cragg-Donald Wald F-statistic for
the null hypothesis that the first stage is weakly identified. Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors are in
parentheses. Mortgage rates are for $175,000 loans. HELOC stands for home equity line of credit. High (low) LTV
correspond to $20,000 loans for a house with a loan(mortgage)-to-value ratio (LTV) greater (lower) than 80 percent
of home value. For auto loans, "New" indicates that a loan is backed with a new car. "Used" indicates that a loan is
backed with a used car (4 years old). "Short" and "Long" indicate the duration of loans: 3 years and 5 years
respectively. Interest rates are in the annual equivalents and reported in percent. ***, **, * indicate statistical
significance at 1, 5 and 10 percent levels.

Notes: The table report estimated coefficient  in specification (1) when the regressand is ,+4 - ,-4 . Column (1)
reports OLS estimates. Column (3) reports instrumental variable estimates (Bartik instrument). Column (4) reports
the Cragg-Donald Wald F-statistic for the null hypothesis that the first stage is weakly identified. Driscoll and Kraay
(1998) standard errors are in parentheses. Mortgage rates are for $175,000 loans. HELOC stands for home equity line
of credit. High (low) LTV correspond to $20,000 loans for a house with a loan(mortgage)-to-value ratio (LTV) greater
(lower) than 80 percent of home value. For auto loans, "New" indicates that a loan is backed with a new car. "Used"
indicates that a loan is backed with a used car (4 years old). "Short" and "Long" indicate the duration of loans: 3 years
and 5 years respectively. Interest rates are in the annual equivalents and reported in percent. ***, **, * indicate
statistical significance at 1, 5 and 10 percent levels.
