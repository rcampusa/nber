                                              ABSTRACT

This paper investigates whether exchanging the Social Security delayed retirement credit (currently
paid as an increase in lifetime annuity benefits) for a lump sum would induce later claiming and additional
work. We show that people would voluntarily claim about half a year later if the lump sum were paid
for claiming any time after the Early Retirement Age, and about two-thirds of a year later if the lump
sum were paid only for those claiming after their Full Retirement Age. Overall, people will work one-third
to one-half of the additional months, compared to the status quo. Those who would currently claim
at the youngest ages are likely to be most responsive to the offer of a lump sum benefit.

                 Will They Take the Money and Work?
     An Empirical Analysis of People’s Willingness to Delay Claiming
                Social Security Benefits for a Lump Sum

         Against the backdrop of global population aging, policymakers around the world are

actively seeking ways to reform their nations’ Social Security systems by encouraging delayed

retirement. Many countries have done so by requiring raising retirement ages and cutting benefit

payouts, but this is usually a politically fraught process.1 By contrast, the present paper explores

an alternative approach to encourage delayed claiming by offering people a lump sum. That is, we

investigate whether exchanging the Social Security delayed retirement credit -- currently paid in

form of an increased annuity benefit -- for an actuarially fair lump sum payment would induce

people to voluntarily delay claiming and work longer.

         Under the Social Security system’s rules currently in effect, i.e., the status quo, an eligible

individual can claim retirement benefits as early as age 62 or as late as age 70.2 His monthly benefit

paid for life depends on his earnings history and his claiming age, with a reduction if he claims

prior to his Full Retirement Age (FRA), and an increment for deferring claiming after that age. For

someone born in 1960 or later, for example, deferring the benefit from age 62 to his FRA of 67

would entitle him to an increase in monthly benefits of around 43 percent (see Table 1 below).3

Deferring claiming to age 70 would imply a 77 percent increase in lifetime monthly benefits.

  That is, the delayed retirement credit computation stops after age 69. This abstracts from any possible benefit
recomputation that could take place if the individual were to work after that age (see
http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/handbook/handbook.07/handbook-0722.html)

  For additional information on the status quo benefit formula, see http://www.ssa.gov/retirement/retirement.htm. The
Social Security delayed retirement credit was intended to be actuarially fair at the time the law was passed; this was
consistent with average mortality tables at the time, as well as a 2.9% real assumed interest rate. In this paper we
assume the same real interest rate. As Shoven and Slavov (2012) note, in such a case the delayed retirement credit
will be better than actuarially fair for most people, thus embodying additional incentives to defer retirement.
                                                                                                                   2


        Despite these rewards for delayed retirement, a large share of Americans claims benefits

and stops working around age 62.4 Several authors have offered behavioral explanations for this

phenomenon, arguing for instance that people are persuaded to claim early due to behavioral

framing considerations (e.g., Brown, Kapteyn, Luttmer, and Mitchell 2013). By contrast, here we

build on our previous theoretical paper on life cycle portfolio choice and claiming behavior (Chai,

Maurer, Mitchell and Rogalla 2013). There we demonstrated that rational consumers would, in

fact, optimally delay claiming their benefits when offered the chance to receive their delayed

retirement credits as a lump sum payment, instead of an increase in lifetime annuity benefits. The

present study seeks to put that hypothesis to a test by empirically evaluating who and how much

people might defer claiming for a lump sum in lieu of a higher monthly payment for life.

        To do so, we have developed a survey of U.S. residents within the framework of RAND’s

American Life Panel (ALP) and used it to assess how people might actually respond to having

access to the present value of the benefit increases resulting from longer work lives. We first

compute each respondent’s anticipated monthly Social Security benefit if he claimed at each age

from 62 to 70, which are, respectively, the earliest and the latest claiming ages under the status

quo system rules. Then given this information, we ask each individual to report his expected

claiming age (i.e., the Status Quo claiming age). Next, we present each respondent with two

alternative scenarios, and we again ask him to report his expected claiming age under both options.

In one case, he is told to assume that he would receive lifelong monthly income in the amount of

his age-62 Social Security benefit from his claiming date on, irrespective of when he actually

  Several studies have examined claiming patterns under the existing Social Security rules; see Gustman and
Steinmeier (2005); Chai, Horneff, Maurer, and Mitchell (2011); Chai, Maurer, Mitchell, and Rogalla (2013) and
Shoven and Slavov (2012). Other authors have taken a behavioral finance perspective to examine whether people
might be willing to give up some of their benefit stream in exchange for a lump sum; however they do not link this to
continued work; see Brown, Kapteyn, and Mitchell (2013).
                                                                                                                  3


claimed. This benefit would be paired with a lump sum payable as of his claiming date (i.e., the

Lump Sum claiming age), where the amount is equal to the actuarial present value of his delayed

retirement credit, i.e. the increase in lifetime retirement benefits generated by claiming after age

62. In the other case, he is told to assume that his monthly benefit would be adjusted upward for

delayed claiming, until his FRA as under the status quo. For claiming ages later than that, his

monthly benefit would be fixed at the FRA level, and he would receive a lump sum payable as of

his claiming date (i.e., the Delayed Lump Sum claiming age) equal to the present value of the

delayed retirement credit after the Full Retirement Age.5 Moreover, in each scenario we ask the

respondent to record how much additional work he would engage in, depending on the specific

scenario.

        Our findings show that people would voluntarily work longer if they were offered an

actuarially fair lump sum instead of a delayed retirement annuity under Social Security. The delays

in claiming are about half a year on average if the lump sum is paid on claiming after age 62, and

about two-thirds of a year if the lump sum is paid only for those claiming after their Full Retirement

Age. Moreover, those most responsive to these incentives turn out to be those who would claim

early under the status quo. We also find that people would voluntarily work about one-third of the

delay in claiming time in the Lump Sum scenario, whereas they would work almost half of the

additional time in the Delayed Lump Sum scenario. To the extent that workers can be incentivized

to voluntarily delay retirement in exchange for lump sums, they will also pay Social Security

payroll taxes for additional years which could help the system’s solvency. Moreover, there is some

  This scenario is not the same as the “File and Suspend” approach currently permitted under Social Security rules
(www.socialsecurity.gov/retire2/suspend), where a worker can file for a benefit at or after the FRA, and suspend his
payment. Later, he can then retroactively begin his benefit payment as of the filing data and receive a lump sum for
benefits foregone. This is not equivalent to our scenario because the “File and Suspend” lump sum is backward-
looking and it is not related to the delayed claiming adjustment that we focus on here.

evidence suggesting that continued labor force participation results in improved physical and

mental health among the elderly, which could improve both individual quality of life as well as

the financial status of healthcare systems such as Medicare and Medicaid (Sahlgren 2013).

         In the Social Security context, we are not the first to suggest that lump sum benefits could

be used to replace the delayed retirement credit under Social Security (Orszag 2001;

Fetherstonhaugh and Ross 1999). Nevertheless, neither previous study examined how the claiming

decision differs from the work effort decision, nor did they examine which individuals might be

more likely to change behavior given the opportunity to take a lump sum. Here we do both, using

a nationally representative sample of the American population to test hypotheses.



Study Design

        We use the American Life Panel (ALP) to implement our field experiment designed in a

survey setting. This is a nationally representative sample of 6,000 households regularly

interviewed over the Internet.6 We designed and implemented our module on a subset of 2,451

respondents, age 40-70, in which we ask them a number of questions regarding their economic and

demographic status. Following Brown, Kapteyn, and Mitchell (2013), we then take the

respondents through a set of earnings history questions and feed these into a benefit calculator

provided by SSA.7 This generates each individual’s “Primary Insurance Amount” (PIA), which is

the monthly benefit amount for life (adjusted for inflation) that he would receive if he were to


6
  One of many advantages the ALP has over other online panels is that it provides respondents who lack Internet
access with either a laptop and Internet access, or a so-called WebTV that allows them to use their television to
participate in the survey. That improves the nationally representative nature of the panel. More on how ALP
respondents are recruited is available on the American Life Panel website: https://mmicdata.rand.org/alp/index.php/.
7
  Specifically, we ask the respondent his age when he started working and divided the remaining years into subperiods;
in each of these, we asked average earnings and years when the respondent did not work for pay. This generated a
constructed earnings history which could be fed into the SSA calculator, which is available on the SSA’s website at
http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/anypia/anypia.html. For additional details see Brown, Kapteyn, and Mitchell
(2013a).
                                                                                                                5


claim at his FRA. To compute benefits for earlier or later claiming ages, we apply SSA’s actuarial

adjustment factors. Specifically, claiming prior to the FRA results in a benefit reduction of 5/9

percent per month for the first 36 months, and 5/12 percent per month thereafter until age 62.

Claiming after the FRA boosts benefits by 8/12 percent per month up to age 70. One’s FRA

depends one’s birth year: it is age 66 for workers born 1943-1954, rising gradually to age 67 for

the 1960 and later birth cohorts. Table 1 depicts the impact of claiming age on Social Security

benefits, for someone whose FRA is currently age 67.

Table 1 here

        Having done so, we ask each individual the following question to survey his expected

claiming behavior under the status quo rules: 8,9

            In the next few questions, we are going to ask you to make a number of choices
            about Social Security benefits. Please assume that all amounts shown are after tax
            (that is, you don’t owe any tax on any of the amounts we will show you). Think of any
            dollar amount mentioned in this survey in terms of what a dollar buys you today
            (because Social Security will adjust future dollar amounts for inflation).

            For the sake of these questions, assume that you are currently age 62 and single.
            You are thinking about when to claim your Social Security benefit.

            The Social Security system allows you to claim your benefit anytime between age
            62 and 70. On average, the Social Security system will neither lose nor make
            money no matter when people claim their benefit. If you claim your benefit at age
            62, you will receive an estimated monthly amount of ${SocSec62benest}10 for life.

            Please answer the following questions about the choice you would make.
            Now imagine you have the following choice:
            Either
            -    You can claim your Social Security benefit at age 62 and receive that $
                 {SocSec62benest} monthly payment for life.
            Or
            -    You can claim your Social Security benefit at a later age and receive a higher
                 monthly payment from that age on for life.

8
  Brown, Kapteyn, and Mitchell (2013) report that respondent expectations about claiming ages and actual claiming
behavior are highly correlated in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).
9
   See Figures A1-A4 in the Appendix for screenshots of the questions as presented to the participants.
10
   The variable {SocSec62benest} represents our estimate of each respondent’s estimated lifelong monthly social
security benefit when claimed at age 62. We calculate this by adjusting the PIA back to age 62 from his FRA, using
the     appropriate     adjustment      factors    which     depend      on    his      year     of     birth (see
http://www.ssa.gov/oact/quickcalc/earlyretire.html).
                                                                                                                      6



            Assume that you are free to choose your work effort (hours per week) until you claim
            your benefit. Based on this information, at what age would you plan to claim your
            Social Security benefit?



         The respondent is asked to click his mouse on a scale that represents the alternative

claiming ages in monthly steps from age 62 to age 70. When he clicks on the scale, he is then

shown his selected claiming age as well as the corresponding monthly benefit he will receive for

life from age onward. Finally, he has the opportunity to change that selected claiming age or submit

his response.11

         Subsequently, we ask each respondent about his expected claiming ages under the two

alternative monthly benefit/lump sum scenarios described above. To this end, we compute what

his benefits would be at alternative claiming ages, along with the actuarially fair lump sums.12 In

the Lump Sum case, if the individual were to defer claiming from age 62, he would receive a lump

sum at his claiming date plus monthly benefits in the amount of his age-62 benefit from said date

for life. We present each respondent with the following question to elicit his claiming age under

this scenario:

            Next we would like to show you some different questions about Social Security
            claiming choices. As before, please assume that all amounts shown are after tax,
            and think of any dollar amount in terms of what a dollar buys you today. Again, on
            average, the Social Security system will neither lose nor make money no matter
            when benefits are claimed.



11
   If a respondent indicated he believed he would never receive Social Security because of a short earnings history
(fewer than 10 years), we used HRS data to impute to him a PIA for someone with similar age, sex, and education,
and marital status as in Brown, Kapteyn, Luttmer, and Mitchell (2013). If the respondent indicated he thought that the
system would not be around to pay him benefits, we asked him to assume it would for the purposes of the analysis.
12
   Specifically, the lump sum is calculated as the actuarial present value at the claiming age of the increased lifelong
monthly retirement benefits - based on cohort-specific FRA factors according to the current Social Security rules -
relative to the benefits by claiming at age 62 (or at the FRA in case of the Delayed Lump Sum scenario). Annuity
factors are derived using the mortality probabilities used in the Social Security’s Trustees Report (SSA 2013). These
are transformed into unisex rates assuming 1,000 females for 1,050 males in every birth cohort (Bell, Bye and Winters
2008). We convert yearly to monthly rates assuming constant number of deaths per months. The interest rate to
discount future payments is 2.9% p.a. in compliance with the interest rate of the intermediate cost scenario in the
Social Security’s Trustees Report (SSA 2013).
                                                                                                                7

            Please continue to assume that you are currently age 62 and single. You are still
            thinking about when to claim your Social Security benefit.

            Now, imagine that you had the following choice:
            Either
            ‐    You can claim your Social Security benefit at age 62 and receive that $
                 {SocSec62benest} monthly payment for life.
            Or
            ‐    You can claim your Social Security benefit at a later age and receive the same
                 monthly payment of ${SocSec62benest} from that age on for life, plus an
                 additional lump sum payable at that later claiming age.

            Assume that you are free to choose your work effort (hours per week) until you claim
            your benefit. Based on this information, at what age would you plan to claim your
            Social Security benefit?
Again, the respondent is shown the monthly benefit and the lump sum amount corresponding to

the claiming age selected, and he can change or submit his selection.

        For the Delayed Lump Sum case, the respondent is told he would be entitled to status quo

benefit increments if he delays claiming to his Full Retirement Age. If he defers claiming beyond

that age, he will receive both the FRA benefit stream for life plus a lump sum equivalent to the

actuarial present value of the delayed retirement credit under the Status Quo scenario. The specific

language used to evaluate the claiming age in this case is as follows:

            Next we would like to show you some different questions about Social Security
            claiming choices. As before, please assume that all amounts shown are after tax,
            and think of any dollar amount in terms of what a dollar buys you today. Again, on
            average, the Social Security system will neither lose nor make money no matter
            when benefits are claimed.

            Or
            ‐ You can claim your Social Security benefit at a later age and receive a higher
               monthly payment from that age onward for life. This benefit will rise as you delay
               claiming up to a maximum of ${SocSecFRAbenest}13 if you claim at your full
               retirement age. However, if you claim your benefit after your full retirement age,
               you will receive that monthly payment of ${SocSecFRAbenest} for life, plus an

scenario and the two Lump Sum alternatives appears in Table 2. Here the monthly benefit payable

to a respondent who will claim at age 62 is assumed to be $1,500. Under the Status Quo scenario

(column 1), delaying claiming to age 63 will boost monthly benefits to $1,607. If he defers until

age 70, monthly benefits will mount to $2,657. By contrast, under the Lump Sum scenario (column

2), claiming at age 63 will result in the same monthly benefit of $1,500, along with a lump sum

equal to $20,208 at age 63. In this scenario, when deferring to age 70, the monthly benefit would

continue to remain constant at $1,500. The lump sum payable at age 70, however, would amount

to almost $178,000. The Delayed Lump Sum alternative for the same illustrative individual is

presented in Column 3. As claiming is delayed, monthly benefits increase as under the Status Quo

(Column 1) up to the Full Retirement Age, while the lump sum payment is zero. When claiming

at age 70, the individual receives monthly benefits equal to the FRA benefits of $2,143 plus a lump

sum of around $79,000.

Table 2 here

        In each case we also ask how much the respondent would work under that claiming

alternative. Specifically, the wording is as follows:

           Given that choice, about how many hours per week, on average, would you plan to
           work from age 62 to your claiming age at {ClaimAgeString_Del_LSFRA}14?

14
  The variable {ClaimAgeString_Del_LSFRA} represents the claiming age under the Delayed Lump Sum scenario
chosen by the respondent.
                                                                                                                   9



Once more, the respondent is asked to click his mouse on the scale representing the average weekly

work hours to his claiming age. On clicking, the respondent is shown his selected weekly work

effort, as well as the corresponding number of months of full-time work until his claiming age; we

compute months of full-time work by multiplying the weekly hours by the number of weeks until

his selected claiming age. As before, the respondent can change his selection before submitting his

final answer.

        In the survey, each respondent is first asked to select a claiming age under the Status Quo

scenario. Next we randomly assign respondents in terms of whether they first see the Lump Sum

or the Delayed Lump Sum alternative. Randomization in this form allows us to compare how

claiming ages would change across the Status Quo and both lump sum scenarios, as well as to

control for framing effects across respondents.15



Results for Changes in Claiming Ages

        In this section, we describe respondents’ claiming ages under the Status Quo, along with

the patterns under the two alternative scenarios. In each case we report how many months post

age-62 the individual selected as his target. The distribution of claiming ages is depicted in Figure

1. Here the box plots denote the 25th and 75th percentiles, with the intermediate lines in each case

reflecting the median; the dots indicate the mean claiming age. Claiming ages under the Status

Quo (top bar) range from 24 and 71 months past age 62; the mean is 45 months. When people can

receive part of their benefit as a lump sum instead of monthly payments, the distribution shifts to

the right, as shown by the second bar. Now people would claim 49.6 months beyond age 62 on

and Mitchell (2013) and Brown, Kling, Mullainathan, and Wrobel (2008).

average, and the difference to the mean claiming age under Status Quo is statistically significant

at the 1% level. Moreover, the claiming age distribution is compressed on the left, implying that

those who would have claimed quite young are also most likely to delay claiming when the lump

sum becomes available. Less change is evident on the right side of the bar, suggesting that those

claiming later under the status quo would change their behavior less. The final bar illustrates the

pattern of claiming ages when the lump sum is available only to those who claim after their Full

Retirement Age. The mean again rises, now to 53.3 months past age 62, with the difference vs. the

Lump Sum scenario being significant at the 1% level. In other words, the most substantial

behavioral change in claiming ages occurs if people were to be given benefit increments up to the

FRA, as now, and post-FRA, a lump sum instead of monthly benefit increments.

Figure 1 here

       To provide an idea of the sizes of the lump sums involved, Figure 2 reports the 25th, 50th,

and 75th percentiles along with the mean values of lump sums payable given peoples’ desired

claiming age patterns. Under the Lump Sum scenario, the mean lump sum would be $73,000, with

a median of $64,500; at the 25th percentile, this amount would almost equal $32,000, and the 75th

percentile value exceeds $105,000. Under the Delayed Lump Sum scenario, because people who

delay receive higher monthly benefits, the lump sums payable for deferring past the FRA are lower,

averaging $22,500, with a median of about $1,600. At the 25th percentile the value is zero, and it

is just over $37,500 at the 75th percentiles. All of these values reflect the actuarially neutral

calculations computed for each individual’s desired claim age.

Figure 2 here

       Table 3 provides additional detail on claiming ages for the Status Quo and our two lump

sum alternatives, analyzing average claiming behavior for different demographic groups. Factors
                                                                                                                   11


we use to differentiate respondents include proxies for their anticipated longevity including age,

sex, and marital status (Smith and Waitzman 1997; Zick and Smith 1991); education (Brown,

Hayward, Karas Montez, Hummer, Chiu, and Hidajat 2012); and subjective life expectancy (Hurd

and McGarry 2002, Hurd, Smith, and Zissimopoulos 2004).16 As discussed above, our respondents

indicate that they intend to claim 45 months post age-62 in the Status Quo setting, on average.

Splitting the sample by demographics, we find that men, singles, those younger than age 62, and

the better-educated all select higher claiming ages than their counterparts. Additionally, people

with optimistic estimates of their remaining life expectancy compared to standard mortality tables

also select later claiming ages.17 Results for the two lump sum scenarios tell the same story, where

all groups boost their claim ages. Moreover, claim ages are consistently the highest under the

Delayed Lump Sum scenario.

Table 3 here

        Thus far, we have focused on showing how claiming ages change depending on the

treatment people see, and by their demographic characteristics. Next we adopt a multivariate

regression framework to examine how individuals with particular characteristics might change

their behavior under the two lump sum policy alternatives, holding other factors constant. Results

are presented in Table 4. The three left columns report patterns for the change in claiming ages (in

months) when people see the Lump Sum scenario versus the Status Quo; the right three columns

compare claiming ages from the Delayed Lump Sum alternative versus the Status Quo. For each

dependent variable, the first model (columns 1 and 4) includes only those factors summarized in

Table 3 (sex, marital status, age, education, and whether the individual is optimistic regarding his



16
   While respondents’ current health status can also proxy for longevity expectations, we do not include this in our
list of controls as it is highly correlated with subjective life expectancy in our data.

   Variable descriptions appear in Table A1 in the Appendix.
                                                                                                  12


life expectancy). The second model (columns 2 and 5) adds a control for the respondent’s claiming

age selected under the Status Quo scenario. This permits us to test whether the lump sum policy

alternatives are likely to incentivize early versus late claimers under the current scenario to delay

claiming. In the third model (columns 3 and 6), we add an additional control for whether the

respondent sees the Lump Sum treatment first (versus the Delayed Lump Sum treatment), as well

as economic covariates: wealth (French 2005); our estimate of the respondent’s age-62 Social

Security benefit; whether the respondent had some other annuity; an indicator for long job tenure;

and a dummy variable indicating the respondent had liquidity constraints (High Debt).

Additionally we have indicators of peoples’ attitudes and preferences including risk aversion,

planning horizon, financial literacy, and an indicator that the respondent was confident in the

Social Security system’s sustainability (c.f., Lusardi and Mitchell 2007, and Brown, Kapteyn, and

Mitchell 2013).18

Table 4 here

           Turning to results in column 1, respondent age is positive and statistically significant,

meaning that a 60-year old would claim about three months later (20*0.134) when the lump sum

is available, compared to a 40-year old (ceteris paribus). This finding is compatible with empirical

evidence for time-inconsistent discounting noted by Dohmen, Falk, Huffman, and Sunde (2010,

2012), who showed that people facing a short time horizon were more impatient than those facing

payoffs in a more distant time period. This effect becomes insignificant in column 2, however,

when we control on respondents’ claiming age under the Status Quo. This is partly because

peoples’ ages and claiming ages are correlated (0.14). But interestingly, the Claiming Age SQ term

is highly significant and negative, implying that those who claim early under the Status Quo would



18
     Table A1 in the Appendix describes how we constructed these controls in greater detail.
                                                                                                                       13


delay claiming the most under the new policy. Column 2 also shows a positive and significant

relationship between the difference in claiming ages and peoples’ optimism regarding their life

expectancy: that is, people who expect to live longer will claim later, since they are more likely to

live to receive the lump sum at the later age. On average our respondents underestimate their

probability of living to later ages by 14% compared to life tables;19 accordingly, a respondent who

predicted his probabilities accurately would be anticipated to claim about one month later

(0.14*7.142).20

         Overall, our estimated effects are robust to the inclusion of the additional controls in

column 3 of Table 4. There we show that the order by which the two lump sum alternatives are

shown to the responded has significant impact on the claiming ages chosen, indicating a potential

anchoring effect. If the respondent first sees the Lump Sum scenario the difference between his

expected claiming ages under the Lump Sum alternative and the Status Quo scenario is almost 4

months smaller than in case the Lump Sum scenario was shown second. This change in claiming

ages is comparable in magnitude to the average Status Quo versus Lump Sum difference. The Lump

Sum scenario provides a substantial lump sum relatively early. Consequently, the respondent might

delay claiming by only a bit. By contrast, those who see the Delayed Lump Sum alternative first

tend to anchor initially on a higher claiming age and smaller lump sum amount. Accordingly, when

presented with the regular Lump Sum scenario second, the respondent delays claiming more,

although not as long as in the Delayed Lump Sum setup.




19
  See Table A1.
20
  Interestingly, the system’s finances could benefit under the Lump Sum scenario, since people expecting to live
longer than average indicate that they would delay claiming instead of taking an early lifetime annuity based on
population rather than optimistic mortality tables (holding all else constant). It must be recalled that, in this analysis,
people may not choose between the Status Quo versus the Lump Sum scenario.
                                                                                                                14


        We also find that persons reporting being debt-constrained say they will defer claiming by

almost two months given the Lump Sum alternative (42 percent of the mean Status Quo versus

Lump Sum difference). Respondents who indicate they are more risk averse also claim later, by

about a month per standard deviation above the mean risk aversion level. This might be due to a

preference for a larger lump sum of known amount compared to a higher annuity with an uncertain

length of payment. Financial literacy is statistically significant, positive, and quantitatively

important: that is, when presented with the Lump Sum option, someone with no financial

knowledge would delay claiming less than the most financially literate individual, by about 3.288

months. This finding is compatible with results in Brown, Kapteyn, Luttmer, and Mitchell (2013),

who showed that financially illiterate persons have a difficult time comparing annuities versus

lump sums.21 Turning to the Political Trust variable, those having the most confidence in the Social

Security system defer claiming less (by 2.556 months), a sensible finding in that they value the

lump sum less than their more skeptical peers, who seek to cash out of the Social Security system

as much as possible and as early as possible.

        The next three columns of Table 4 replicate the previous analysis, but this time the

dependent variable measures the change in claiming age from the Status Quo to that selected in

the Delayed Lump Sum alternative. Interestingly, age is no longer significant in column 4. Since

most respondents in our sample are younger than the FRA, they tend to more heavily discount the

lump sum that will be paid far in the future under the Delayed Lump Sum option. By contrast,

when they were offered early lump sum payments in the previous scenario, they were more

impatient. This is compatible with the time-inconsistent discounting referred to above (Dohmen,

 Several prior studies have examined the links between cognitive abilities and financial decision making; see Fang,
Keane, and Silverman (2008) for Medigap purchase; Agarwal and Mazumder (2013) on the use of credit; and
McArdle, Smith, and Willis (2011) and Banks, O’Dea, and Oldfield (2010) on retirement wealth accumulation.
                                                                                                  15


Falk, Huffman, and Sunde 2012). Other results in columns 5 and 6 are quite comparable in terms

of signs, significance levels, and magnitudes of estimated coefficients, though financial literacy

now has a somewhat larger impact.

       Overall, we conclude that offering people lump sums in lieu of higher annuity payments

from Social Security would induce reasonably substantial delays in claiming ages, by about half a

year on average if the lump sum were paid on claiming, and by about two-thirds of a year if the

lump sum were only payable for benefits claimed after the Full Retirement Age. Those deferring

claiming the most under both scenarios are also those who would take their Social Security benefits

early under the Status Quo scenario. Interestingly, only a few factors seem to differentiate those

particularly sensitive to the lump sum offers, including financial literacy which is associated with

a larger claiming delay, and confidence in the program’s sustainability. Additionally, the most

indebted would also delay claiming to obtain the lump sums. Finally, people’s delayed claiming

patterns do not differ by wealth levels, the presence of other annuities, Social Security benefit

amounts, planning horizons, or expected investment returns.



Results for Changes in Work Effort

       Having established that people will delay claiming more under both lump sum alternatives

than under the Status Quo scenario, we next turn to an examination of whether people will simply

delay their benefit take-up dates, or whether they will continue to work in the interim. To this end,

we report in Figure 3 the distribution of full-time work effort under the Status Quo versus the two

lump sum scenarios. As before, the box plots represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, with the

intermediate line in each case reflecting the median; the dots reflect the mean months of full-time

work post-age 62 under each case. The top bar, representing full-time work months beyond age 62
                                                                                                  16


under the Status Quo, ranges from 2 to 53 months (median 32). The mean is 34.8 months. The

second bar, by contrast, shows that the distribution shifts to the right under the Lump Sum scenario,

when people can receive part of their benefit stream as a lump sum instead of as a monthly

payment. Now, on average, people indicate they will work 36.2 full-time months (median 35)

beyond age 62; this difference of 1.4 months is significant at the 10% level. Moreover, the work

effort distribution is now compressed on the left, implying that those who would work least under

the Status Quo are also most likely to work more when the lump sum becomes available. Less

change is evident on the right side of the bar, indicating that individuals who would have worked

more under the Status Quo case would exhibit smaller increments in work effort. The final bar

illustrates the pattern of work effort under the Delayed Lump Sum scenario, where a lump sum is

available only to those who claim after their FRA. Mean work effort again rises, now to 39 months

post-age 62, 3.9 months more than under the Status Quo and 2.5 months more than under the Lump

Sum case. These differences are significant at the 1% level.

Figure 3 here

       Additional detail on work patterns under the Status Quo and two lump sum cases is

provided in Table 5, where we again report the number of months of full-time work post age-62

overall (row 1), and also by respondents’ demographic characteristics, i.e. sex, marital status, age,

education, and whether people were optimistic regarding self-assessed life expectancy. A first

point to note is that, under the Status Quo, men, singles, those younger than age 62, and the better-

educated all spend more time working than their counterparts. Moreover, those who are optimistic

about their life expectancy would also elect to expend more work effort. Second, results under

both lump sum scenarios are similar, where all groups boost their work effort. Moreover, work

effort is consistently the highest under the Delayed Lump Sum scenario.
                                                                                                 17


Table 5 here

       Turning to a multivariate regression framework, Table 6 helps us test whether respondents

having particular characteristics differentially change their work patterns under the two lump sum

policy alternatives, holding other factors constant. The three left-hand columns in Table 6 report

estimates of the impact of factors shaping changes in work effort (in full-time months) when people

see the Lump Sum versus the Status Quo scenarios; the three right columns compare work effort

in the Delayed Lump Sum versus the Status Quo scenarios. For each dependent variable, the first

model (columns 1 and 4) includes only those factors summarized in Table 5 (sex, marital status,

age, education, and whether the individual is optimistic regarding his life expectancy). The second

model (columns 2 and 5) adds a control for the respondent’s work effort selected under the Status

Quo scenario. This permits us to test whether and which lump sum policies will incentivize people

exerting modest work effort under the current system to devote more effort to employment. In the

third model (columns 3 and 6), we add an additional control for whether the respondent saw the

Lump Sum treatment first (versus the Delayed Lump Sum treatment), as well as economic

covariates (wealth, age 62 benefit, whether the respondent had some other annuity, an indicator

for long job tenure, and a dummy variable indicating the respondent had high debt). As before, we

also control for indicators of attitudes and preferences, including risk aversion, planning horizon,

financial literacy, and an indicator that the respondent was confident in the Social Security

system’s sustainability (see Table A1 in the Appendix for further detail).

Table 6 here

       Results in column 1 show that respondent age is positive and significant; the estimated

coefficient implies that a 60-year old would work three months longer (20*0.153) than a 40-year

old (ceteris paribus). The age effect loses significance in columns 2 and 3, however, after we
                                                                                                  18


control on the status quo work level. The Total Work SQ term is negative and highly statistically

significant, indicating that those who work less under the Status Quo would work more under the

new policy, and the coefficient is robust to the inclusion of our additional controls in column 3.

We also see that, if the respondent is first presented with the Lump Sum scenario entitling him to

a substantial lump sum relatively early, his work effort is 1.6 months less than when he sees the

Delayed Lump Sum scenario first. This confirms our earlier finding that respondents shown the

Delayed Lump Sum scenario first are incentivized to work more.

       The other results in column 3 confirm many of the findings from the equivalent column in

Table 4, in that only a few factors differentiate people who are most sensitive to the lump sum

offers. Once again, given a lump sum, respondents who are very confident in the program’s

sustainability increase their work effort less than those who distrust the system. Wealthy

individuals will also exert less additional work effort, but the risk averse and the debt-constrained

increase work more when offered a lump sum versus the base case. Finally, people’s change in

work effort patterns do not differ depending on the presence of other annuities, Social Security

benefit amounts, planning horizons, or expected investment returns. Results are rather similar in

columns 4-6 of the table, but often coefficient magnitudes are somewhat smaller while having

similar signs and significance levels. Those with most wealth are least likely to increase their work

effort in the Delayed Lump Sum case, as they can self-finance the waiting period before claiming

the lump sum.

       Overall, then, providing a lump sum option in lieu of higher annuity payments from Social

Security would induce respondents to work more: by about 1.4 months when the lump sum is paid

for claiming after age 62, and by 3.9 months if the lump sum is payable only for benefits claimed

after the Full Retirement Age. Relating these estimates to the findings in the previous section, we
                                                                                                  19


conclude that people would voluntarily work about one-third of the additional months of delayed

claiming time in the Lump Sum scenario vs. the Status Quo, and half the additional delay time in

the Delayed Lump Sum scenario vs. the Status Quo.



Conclusions and Implications

       The primary contribution of this paper is to employ empirical microeconomic data to

examine how individuals would respond to the chance to exchange part of their Social Security

annuities for a lump sum. We do so to test our hypothesis from a stochastic life-cycle model

commonly used to study annuitization decisions. In our nationally representative sample of

Americans, we show that people would voluntarily work longer, on average, if they were offered

an actuarially fair lump sum instead of a delayed retirement annuity under Social Security. Our

prior theoretical work predicted that they would do so, and our empirical analysis using the ALP

reinforces those predictions.

       We show that giving people lump sums in lieu of higher annuity payments from Social

Security induces reasonably substantial delays in claiming ages, by about half a year on average if

the lump sum is paid for claiming after age 62, and by about two-thirds of a year if the lump sum

is payable only for claiming after the Full Retirement Age. Interestingly, those who are most

responsive to these incentives prove to be those who would claim early under the status quo.

Moreover, financial literacy and mistrust in the retirement program’s sustainability are associated

with greater claiming delays; and the indebted would also delay claiming to obtain the lump sums.

Claiming delays do not differ across wealth levels, whether people have other annuities, the level

of their Social Security benefit amounts, their risk aversion or planning horizons, or the investment
                                                                                                20


returns they expect on investments. Additionally, we show that people would work one-third to

one-half of the additional months, compared to the status quo.

       Our findings will interest policymakers seeking ways of reforming Social Security without

raising costs or cutting benefits, while enhancing the incentives to delay retirement. Boosting

Social Security system solvency without cutting benefits appears to be feasible, by offering a fair

lump sum in place of the current delayed retirement credit. As, we have shown, people would

voluntarily extend their work effort due to the lump sum options examined here. This implies that

some workers would pay Social Security payroll taxes for more years. At the same time, given the

well-established decline in average labor income toward the end of the work life, the additional

work period might add little to the lifetime earnings history on which Social Security benefits are

based. Hence the overall solvency of the system could be enhanced. Additionally, from a

macroeconomic perspective, incentivizing longer work lives could also offer additional economic

resources to help cover the costs of population aging (National Research Council 2012), and

working longer may well be associated with better mental and physical health (Rohwedder and

Willis 2009).

       In terms of future research directions: our policy experiment was designed to be cost-

neutral to the Social Security system. That is, our approach has the virtue of not imposing

additional solvency concerns on the system nor imposing wealth transfers on the next generation.

It remains to be seen whether people might also be willing to delay claiming and work longer for

smaller-than-actuarially-fair lump sums, which would enhance the system’s sustainability.

Notes: Full Retirement Age (FRA): 67, Assumed Social Security Benefit at Age 62: $ 1,500. Status Quo refers to the
current Social Security system (column 1). Lump Sum (column 2) holds the monthly benefits constant at all claiming
ages; the lump sum amount payable at the claiming age in that row is the actuarial present value of the difference in
monthly benefits between the Status Quo and those paid in the Lump Sum scenario. Delayed Lump Sum (column 3)
increases monthly benefits to the FRA with no lump sum payment; thereafter monthly benefits are constant and the
lump sum is the actuarial present value of the difference in monthly benefits between the Status Quo and the FRA
benefit. Source: Authors’ calculations.
