While a burgeoning literature has extolled the conceptual virtues of directly measuring the
underlying job tasks that define work activities, in practice task-based approaches have been
hampered by well-known data limitations. We study wage determination using data collected
specifically to address these limitations. Most fundamentally, we construct the first longitudinal
dataset containing job-level task information for individual workers. New quantitative task
measures take advantage of unique survey questions that ask respondents to detail the amount of
time spent performing People, Information, and Objects tasks at different skill levels. These
measures have clear interpretations, suggest natural proxies for on-the-job human capital
accumulation, and provide methodological guidance for future data collection initiatives. A
model of comparative advantage highlights the benefits of the unique data features, and guides
the specification and interpretation of empirical models. We provide new findings about the
effect of current and past tasks on wages. First, current job tasks are quantitatively important,
with high skilled tasks being paid substantially more than low skilled tasks. Second, there is no
evidence of learning-by-doing (i.e., effects of past tasks) for low skilled tasks, but strong
evidence for high skilled tasks. Current and past high skilled information tasks are particularly
valuable, although high skilled interpersonal tasks also play a significant role. Shifting 10 percent
of work time from low skilled people tasks to high skilled information tasks increases a worker’s
yearly wage by 22 percent after ten years. The accumulation of valuable task-specific experience
accounts for 70 percent of this increase, and the direct current-period effect of performing
different tasks accounts for the remainder.

1    Introduction

The tasks that a worker performs on-the-job are likely to play a central role in the determina-

tion of wages. The notion that worker productivity, and therefore wages, will depend directly

on current job tasks is supported empirically by a large literature that explores the existence of

wage differentials across employers (Manning, 2003), industries (Gibbons and Katz, 1992), oc-

cupations (Heckman and Sedlacek, 1985), and worker skill levels (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011;

Autor and Dorn, 2013). In addition, as emphasized by the learning-by-doing model of human

capital formation (Becker, 1964), one’s productivity today will also depend on past tasks.1

    Recently, the desire to understand wage determination at a primitive level has motivated

research that attempts to characterize the tasks performed on jobs using measures of the type

found in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) or the newer Occupational Information

Network (O*NET).2 This paper takes advantage of unique data that address fundamental data

limitations present in recent research by directly measuring the amount of time that workers

spend on specific job tasks over their careers. These data allow us to provide new evidence

about the roles that both current and past work activities play in the determination of wages.

In particular, we provide empirical evidence on the intuitively appealing hypothesis, raised in a

theoretical context by Gibbons and Waldman (2004), that learning how to perform job tasks may

be an important component of human capital accumulation.

    The most fundamental data limitation present in recent research is that no longitudinal sur-

veys have collected task information directly for individual workers. In the absence of such data,

it is necessary to use the DOT or O*NET databases to impute job tasks for workers. Because these

data sources provide information only at occupational level, all workers in the same (typically

three digit) occupation must be assigned the same tasks. This type of imputation is not par-

ticularly appealing from a conceptual standpoint; Sanders and Taber (2012) note that, from the

perspective of the theory of specific human capital, the primary usefulness of categorizing jobs by


    1 Motivated by this theory, a vast empirical literature examines questions such as whether human capital tends

to be general and transferable across all jobs (Mincer, 1974), or specific to occupations or industries. See Neal (1995)
and Parent (2000) for studies of industry specific human capital, and Kambourov and Manovskii (2009) and Sullivan
(2010b) for evidence of occupation specificity. Gibbons and Waldman (2004) and Lazear (2009) develop theoretical
models that use job tasks to understand concepts such as the distinction between general and specific human capital,
and the structure of promotions.
    2 See, for example Poletaev and Robinson (2008), Gathmann and Schönberg (2010), Yamaguchi (2012, 2016),

Sanders (2017), Lise and Postel-Vinay (2015), Speer (2017), and Roys and Taber (2017).

occupation is that occupations serve as observable proxies for the true task requirements of jobs.3

Further, recent evidence suggests that this type of imputation matters in practice; taking advan-

tage of rare cross-sectional data that allow job tasks to be observed at the individual job-level,

Robinson (2011) and Autor and Handel (2013) show conclusively that tasks vary significantly

within three-digit occupations.4 As a result, imputing a worker’s current tasks based only on

her occupation is likely to create substantial amounts of measurement error in job tasks. Given

the persistence in one’s occupations over time, this measurement error problem may be further

exacerbated in a longitudinal setting where it is natural to impute a cumulative measure of tasks

for use as a proxy for human capital accumulated over her career. This type of consideration has

led to a recognition that individual-level task information is especially crucial when studying

issues that require longitudinal data. For example, when describing the (unrealized) possibility

of extending the 2006 Skills Survey (UK) to collect longitudinal task information, Green et al.

(2006) write: “such a longitudinal study...would enable a huge leap in our understanding of the

processes of skills development...”

    Other fundamental data limitations arise because the questions used to describe tasks in the

DOT or O*NET do not necessarily correspond closely to conceptual or empirical frameworks of

interest. One issue is that the questions are typically of a qualitative nature (important, very

important, etc.). A second issue is that existing task measures may not provide insight into why a

task is important because they often do not distinguish between the skill level at which a task is

performed and the amount of time that is spent on the task. Of particular salience, these issues

imply that it is not possible to quantify the precise object that is arguably of ultimate importance -

the relationship between wages and the amount of time that is spent on well-defined job activities.

For example, a finding that changing a particular task from “not important” to “important” has

a sizable effect on earnings may not be entirely satisfying if one cannot ascertain whether more

    3 Of course, in practice there are reasons that occupations may be found to have an effect on wages, even after

attempting to directly measure job tasks. This is not the focus of this paper, but is explored in Autor and Handel
(2013).
    4 Since it has been well established that tasks vary within occupations, our paper is based on the premise that

the underlying task measures are the relevant objects of interest, rather than occupations. Robinson (2011) uses the
one year (1971) of CPS data in which an analyst assigned DOT tasks to jobs at the individual level to show that
within three digit occupations there is a large amount of variation in the tasks that are performed on jobs. Using
individual level information collected as part of the Princeton Data Improvement Initiative, Autor and Handel (2013)
also find substantial variation in tasks within an occupation and show that this information is an important predictor
of earnings even after conditioning on occupation. The Skills Survey (UK) also provides cross-sectional information
about job tasks at the level of an individual worker-job. The recently initiated LISA survey (Canada) will potentially
provide longitudinal information about tasks.

time was spent performing the task at the same level or whether the same amount of time was

spent performing the task at a higher level.5 Throughout the paper we also discuss a variety

of other concerns related to measurement, specification, and interpretation that arise because of

these issues. As an example of particular relevance in the longitudinal context here, it may be

difficult to find an appealing way to aggregate yearly qualitative measures of task importance

into a cumulative measure of the task importance over a career.

    This paper takes advantage of data from the Berea Panel Study (BPS), which followed two

cohorts of students very closely from the time of college entrance past the age of thirty. The

BPS task measures, which are described in detail in Section 2, are in the spirit of some of the

task information available in the DOT, describing the manner in which tasks relate to People,

Information, and Objects.6 Related to the first fundamental data limitation described above, a

crucial feature of the data collection is that the task information comes directly from the worker,

providing a rare measure of what the worker is actually doing on-the-job. The fact that this

information was collected yearly allows us to construct the first longitudinal dataset containing

job-level task information for individual workers, with it being particularly valuable that the

dataset documents a period starting at the very beginning of workers’ careers. However, the

features of our data collection that are perhaps the most innovative were motivated by our desire

to also address the other fundamental data limitations described in the previous paragraph. A

unique feature of our task measures comes from collecting time allocation information related

to the task measures. While the conceptual usefulness of knowing how individuals divide their

work time among various job tasks has been recognized (Gathmann and Schönberg, 2010), direct

information of this type is not available from existing data sources. The BPS collected data

detailing the percentage of work time in a year that is spent in the People, Information, and

Objects task categories. Further, within each of these general task categories, respondents report


    5 In practice, factor analysis is often used to summarize a large number of DOT or O*NET questions in terms of a

smaller number of factors (e.g., cognitive or manual). The same issues remain in this case. The weights characterizing
the importance of cognitive and manual tasks for a particular occupation are informative about the importance of cog-
nitive and manual tasks in that occupation relative to other occupations, but it is difficult to interpret the information
from the factor models in terms of concrete job activities. Further complicating interpretation, it is typically the case
that some DOT and O*NET questions used to identify the factor are more related to task level and others are more
related to how frequently a task is performed.
    6 The fourth, fifth, and sixth digits of the DOT occupation code reflect relationships to Information (data), People,

and Objects (things), respectively. We have condensed the number of categories within Information, People, and and
Objects relative to the DOT, and have also written the categories so that they are ordered in terms of the level of the
tasks being performed.


                                                            3
the percentage of time that is spent performing different sub-tasks, which are ordered by skill.

These data allow us to construct the six quantitative task variables that we utilize: the proportion

of one’s work time that is spent on high skilled People tasks, low skilled People tasks, high skilled

Information tasks, low skilled Information tasks, high skilled Objects tasks, and low skilled

Objects tasks. For each worker, summing a particular task variable over time, after weighting by

hours worked, provides a direct measure of task-specific work experience at each point of her

career.

   Our results take advantage of up to ten years of labor market data. The descriptive results in

Section 3 represent the first time it is has been possible to quantify, using explicit time measures,

how workers are spending time on particular jobs. Of particular importance for the interpretation

of a variety of results in the paper, we find that, while there is substantial heterogeneity in the

tasks that workers perform, almost all workers devote at least some time to each task in each

year. That is, even for this sample of college graduates, it is difficult, for example, to entirely

avoid performing low skilled People tasks. Taking advantage of the longitudinal nature of our

data, we find that the mean amount of time spent on Information tasks and the mean amount of

time spent on high skilled tasks increase significantly over time.

   Section 4 transitions from examining how time is spent on jobs to determining how this

time allocation is related to wages. In Section 4.1 we explore OLS relationships between wages,

jobs tasks, and task-specific work experience. Given the strong relationships that are found, we

introduce, in Section 4.2, a simple conceptual framework to discuss issues of interpretation that

arise when attempting to estimate the returns to job tasks. The importance of the new BPS task

data is highlighted by enriching the conceptual model of Autor and Handel (2013), who stress

the potential importance of taking into account the role of comparative advantage (Heckman and

Sedlacek, 1985; Roy, 1951). We begin by discussing why explicitly quantifying the time allocated

to tasks at different skill levels is useful when adopting the standard empirical assumption that

task prices are constant in the market of interest.

   Next, we examine the benefits of our longitudinal data for addressing the selection biases that

will be present if, taking into account their multi-dimensional (unobserved) abilities, workers sort

into jobs on the basis of comparative advantage. When workers with higher unobserved ability

to perform task k tend to sort into jobs that require more time spent on task k, differences in



                                                 4
wages across two workers could arise either because of differences in the amount of task k that

is performed or because of differences in ability to perform the task. If the latter is important,

cross-sectional estimators of the return to spending more time on task k would be biased because

the two workers would not obtain the same wages even if they performed the same amount of

the task.

   The quantitative nature of our novel time allocation measures allows us to difference observa-

tions over time to take advantage of within-person variation in job tasks. Even though, unlike the

case where ability is one-dimensional, differencing in the case where ability is multi-dimensional

does not entirely remove the influence of unobserved abilities, fixed effects has the potential

to estimate a parameter of substantial interest: the average return, or effect, of having workers

spend more time on a particular task. Helpful for this interpretation is that the nature of our

task measures allows us to observe that the large majority of individuals spend time on each task

(i.e., they spend non-zero time in high and low skilled People, Object, and Information tasks) and

are also observed changing tasks over time. Thus, a contribution of our data collection is that it

helps us move away from the typical comparative advantage scenario in which most agents are

not observed participating in all “sectors.” However, we also describe a variety of issues that can

complicate interpretation. Among these, one might worry that changes in tasks over time may

be related to changes in the idiosyncratic portion of wages over time or one might be concerned

about the implications of a scenario in which workers and employers learn about a worker’s

abilities over time.

   A comparison of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and fixed effects (FE) estimates reveals that

the estimated role of tasks tends to be somewhat smaller when employing the fixed effects es-

timator. However, the big picture takeaways from the estimation of both OLS and fixed effects,

which rely on very different identification strategies, are remarkably similar. Our first main find-

ing is that current job tasks play a large role in determining wages. In particular, there is a large

wage premium for performing high skilled work: high skilled tasks are paid substantially more

than low skilled tasks. Our second main finding is that there is no evidence of learning-by-doing

for low skilled tasks, but there is strong evidence of learning-by-doing for high skilled tasks.

Our third main finding is that not all types of high skilled tasks (i.e., People, Information, and

Objects) play the same role in the determination of wages. We find that working in high skilled



                                                 5
People tasks in the present and/or in the past plays an important role, but that the influence of

working in high skilled Information tasks in the present and/or in the past is especially large. We

illustrate the benefits of our quantitative measures and put our results into a further “lifecycle”

context by examining how hypothetical changes in tasks over the first ten years of a worker’s

career would affect the worker’s log wage in the tenth year. As an example of our findings,

shifting 10 percent of work time from low skilled People tasks to high skilled Information tasks

in each of the first ten years leads to a 22 percent increase in the tenth year wage, with 70 percent

of this increase due to the accumulation of task-specific experience during the first nine years

and the remainder due to the direct effect of performing different tasks in the tenth year.

      From a methodological standpoint, our results indicate that longitudinal data on tasks is

crucial for understanding a variety of important issues, including those related to wage determi-

nation and wage growth.7 In terms of direct guidance about survey questions, our time allocation

measures allow the type of work required by jobs to be characterized by quantitative task mea-

sures that have clear interpretations. Among their many benefits, the measures lead to natural

proxies for on-the-job human capital accumulation (task-specific experience), which appear to be

an improvement over existing proxies (such as years of work experience). In addition, differenti-

ating tasks by skill level is crucial in order to understand wage differences across workers.



2     Data

This section provides general information about the Berea Panel Study (Section 2.1) and explains

how job tasks are measured in this dataset (Section 2.2).


2.1    The Berea Panel Study

Designed and administered by Todd Stinebrickner and Ralph Stinebrickner, the Berea Panel

Study (BPS) is a longitudinal survey that was initiated to provide extremely detailed information

about the college and early post-college periods. The project involves surveying students who

entered Berea College in the fall of 2000 and the fall of 2001 approximately sixty times from the

time of college entrance through 2014. In this paper, we focus on understanding the evolution of
    7 A number of influential papers in recent years have employed task-based approaches to investigates the causes

of changes in the wage structure and the extent of polarization in the U.S. labor market. See, for example, Autor, Levy
and Murnane (2003); Autor, Katz and Kearney (2009); Autor and Dorn (2013).

earnings for graduates, by taking advantage of post-college surveys that were collected annually

after students left school. More than ninety percent of all graduates in the two BPS cohort years

completed one or more of these annual surveys, and the response rate on these surveys leveled

off at approximately eighty-two percent until 2011 before declining slightly. To avoid the need to

impute crucial information, our analysis uses all yearly observations from the time of graduation

until an individual first fails to complete a post-college survey. For the 528 individuals in our

sample, the maximum number of yearly observations is 10 and the average number of yearly

observations is 6.2.

    Important for the notion that the basic lessons from our study of one school are pertinent

for thinking about what takes place elsewhere, Berea operates under a standard liberal arts

curriculum, students at Berea are similar in academic quality to students at schools such as

The University of Kentucky (Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2008), and outcomes such as major

choice at Berea are similar to those found in the NLSY by Arcidiacono (2004). However, even

putting aside the obvious issue of data collection feasibility, there are benefits of studying one

school. In particular, the ability to hold school quality constant is beneficial for a variety of

reasons, including that it makes academic measures such as college GPA directly comparable

across individuals.8
    This paper is made possible by merging the unique survey data from the early portion of

an individual’s working life with detailed administrative data. The administrative data provides

basic demographic information as well as academic information that is necessary to characterize

one’s human capital at the time of workforce entrance. Table 1 shows that 64 percent of the

sample is female, 15 percent of the sample is black, and the average college grade point average

(GPA) is 3.17. Pooling all observations across the full sample period, the average hourly wage, in

2005 dollars, is $15.42, and the average work week is 39.58 hours with 43 percent of jobs reporting

exactly a 40 hour week. It is worth noting that in this sample of recent, young college graduates,

the labor market experiences of males and females are similar across many dimensions. For

example, as described in Stinebrickner, Stinebrickner, and Sullivan (2017), which examines issues

related to the gender wage gap, both men and women have similar, high employment rates (91%
   8 For previously published work that has used the BPS to study issues in education, see Stinebrickner and Stine-
brickner (2003b; 2003a; 2004; 2006; 2008b; 2008a; 2010; 2012; 2013; 2014). Stinebrickner, Stinebrickner and Sullivan
(2017) and Stinebrickner, Stinebrickner and Sullivan (2017), respectively, take advantage of the job task data intro-
duced in this paper to examine the beauty wage premium and the gender wage gap, respectively. The job task data
also play a secondary role in the analysis of mismatch in Agopsowicz et al. (2017).

2.2     Measuring Job Tasks in the BPS

The task information associated with the job that a worker holds in a particular year comes from

BPS survey Question C, which is shown in Appendix A. A unique component of Question C is

the time allocation measures associated with job tasks. Question C4 contains the time allocation

measures that indicate the percentage of total work time that is spent on the People, Information,

and Objects task categories. Questions C1, C2, and C3, respectively, contain the time allocation

measures that indicate the percentage of time that is spent on each specific sub-task within the

People, Information, and Objects task categories, respectively. Defining the first two sub-tasks (1

and 2) within each of the People (C1), Information (C2), and Objects (C3) task categories as low

skilled and the last two sub-tasks (3 and 4) as high skilled, these questions allow us to compute

the percentage of total work time in a year that is spent on each of the three task categories, at

each of the two skill levels. That is, they allow us to compute the percentage of time devoted

to high skilled People tasks, low skilled People tasks, high skilled Information tasks, low skilled

Information tasks, high skilled Objects tasks, and low skilled Objects tasks.

      In terms of notation, for each task k, k ∈ (People, Information, Objects), let τh (k) represent

the fraction of time on-the-job (in a particular year) that a worker spends performing task k at

                                                       8
a high skill level (h), and let τl (k) represent the fraction of time spent performing task k at a

low skill level (l). The vector of all task requirements of a job is denoted by the six element

vector T = {τs (People), τs (Information), τs (Objects), s = l, h}. For notational convenience,

we sometimes abbreviate the general task categories as follows: P = People, I = Information,

O = Objects.

      Relevant for the question of whether students are able to understand questions such as C1,

C2, C3, and C4, these questions are similar in spirit to BPS questions that elicited beliefs (expec-

tations) about grade performance (and other outcomes) by asking respondents to assign percent

chances to a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive grade categories. As a result,

respondents had received classroom training related to similar types of questions and had an-

swered similar types of questions frequently in the past, with both exit interviews and internal

consistency checks confirming a good understanding of these questions. Nonetheless, given the

experimental nature of our approach, one of our methodological objectives is to see whether con-

fidence can be gained in these conceptually valuable, but previously untested, survey questions.



3     New Facts About Job Tasks

A descriptive examination of the task data is useful because it represents the first time that it has

been possible to quantify, using explicit time measures, how individuals are spending time on

their particular jobs.


3.1    The Distribution of Job Tasks

This section presents descriptive results obtained by pooling data over the ten year longitudinal

sample. We begin by examining the distributions of the fraction of time that workers spend

performing People, Information, and Objects tasks, respectively, for the moment abstracting away

from the distinction between high and low skilled tasks. The three panels of Figure 1 show the

density function of τl (k) + τh (k) for k = People, Information, and Objects. Figure 1 shows that, on
                                                                                   (              )
average, workers spend 51 percent of their time on People tasks (i.e., µ = mean τl (P) + τh (P) =

0.51), 34 percent of their time on Information tasks, and only 15 percent of their time on Objects

tasks. The standard deviations of τl (k) + τh (k) indicate that there is significant variation across

jobs in the fraction of time spent performing each task, with People tasks varying the most

tasks lying in between the two extremes (σ = 0.17).

          In addition to the overall amount of time spent working on People, Information, and Ob-

jects tasks, the BPS data distinguish between high and low skilled work within each category.

Figure 2 shows that, within each category, the distributions of high and low skilled tasks are in

general quite similar. Averaged across all jobs, an approximately equal amount of time is spent
                                                       (                          )
performing each task at the high and low skill levels τh (k) ≃ τl (k), k = P, I, O . These aggre-

gate statistics alone do not speak to the mix of high and low skilled tasks present at the level of

individual jobs. We find that jobs frequently require performing different amounts of high and

low skilled People tasks, but that there is comparatively less dispersion in the combinations of

high and low skilled Information tasks required by jobs. For example, 35 percent of jobs require

spending an equal amount of time on high skilled and low skilled Information tasks, but only 21

percent of jobs require spending an equal amount of time on high skilled and low skilled People

tasks.

   The statistics presented up to this point reveal substantial variation in the job tasks performed

by workers. One interesting feature of the data is the strong tendency for jobs to require per-

forming at least some of each task. For each of the six tasks, Figure 3 shows the fraction of jobs

that require performing some of that task (i.e., the fraction of jobs with τs (k) > 0). This figure

shows that it is very difficult to avoid performing low skilled People tasks, with approximately

99 percent of all jobs requiring at least some low skilled interaction with People. Similarly, the

percentages shown in Figure 3 for high skilled People tasks, low skilled Information tasks, and

high skilled Information tasks are each greater than 95 percent. Perhaps not surprisingly given

our sample of college graduates, workers are less likely to spend at least some time performing

Objects tasks. However, even in this highly educated sample, approximately 70 percent of jobs

require low skilled Objects tasks, and 60 percent of jobs require high skilled Objects tasks.

   Naturally, the percentages in Figure 3 tend to be even higher when we take advantage of

the longitudinal aspect of the data to examine the proportion of individuals who ever perform

a particular task at some point over their career (i.e., the fraction of individuals who report
∑T     s
  t=1 τit (k) > 0, where T is the last sample year the person is observed). For example, we



                                                                  12
find that 80 percent of individuals report performing high skilled Objects tasks at some point

over their career and that 82 percent of individuals report performing low skilled Objects tasks

at some point over their career. Thus, there is a strong tendency to perform at least some of

each task. Section 4.2 discusses how this feature of the data is useful when estimating the wage

returns to different job tasks.


3.2     Task-Specific Work Experience Over the Career

Up to this point, the descriptive analysis of job tasks has primarily pooled data over the ten

year longitudinal sample. This section focuses instead on using the panel aspect of the data to

describe how workers spend their time on the job over their careers.

      Using the unique features of our panel data, we are able to compute the first measures de-

scribing the cumulative amount of time that an individual has spent on different tasks over her

career. These task-specific experience measures, which serve as proxies for human capital accu-

mulated while working, incorporate the task variables, which are measured in fraction of time

units, along with data on the hours worked by each worker. Specifically, the cumulative amount

of time that individual i at time t has spent performing a task k from the set {P, I, O} at a
                                                                    ∑
skill level s from the set {h, l} in the past is given by hsit (k) = t−1   s      s              s
                                                                      j=1 τij (k)ωij (k), where τij (k)

is the fraction of time that individual i spends performing task k at skill level s in time j and

ωsij (k) is a weight derived from the hours that person i works in time j. The hours weight is

ωsij (k) = hoursij /40, where hoursij represents the hours worked by worker i on her job at time

j. The weights are normalized in this manner so that ωsij (k) = 1 indicates that a worker works

a forty hour week. We make use of the hours data based on the premise that the amount of

learning-by-doing depends on the time allocated to each task, rather than simply the percentage

of time spent on each task.9
      Table 2 shows descriptive statistics for task-specific work experience in the sixth survey year.

The unit of measurement for the task-specific experience variables is full-time work years.10

For example, the first entry of Panel C of Table 2 shows that the average worker accumulates

1.382 years of experience working with People at a low skill level. The numbers in Table 2 are


    9 All of our key empirical results are robust to eliminating the hours weight, which is perhaps not surprising given

that 43 percent of all jobs in the data report exactly a 40 hour work week.
   10 Defining a 40 hour work week as full time employment.

consistent with the findings from Section 3.1. Considering the disaggregated tasks, very few

people specialize strongly by primarily performing any one task at any one skill level; column

6 shows that each of the ninety-fifth percentiles are considerably less than 6.0, the maximum

amount of task-specific experience that a worker could attain by fully specializing in one task

over the first six years of the career.11 However, at the same time, potentially important for

explaining issues such as wage dispersion, column 4 shows that the variation across workers in

accumulated tasks is quite substantial.

    Neither Figure 2 nor Table 2 provides evidence about how the amount of time spent on tasks

changes over the first ten years of workers’ careers. Taking advantage of the longitudinal nature

of our data, Table 3 shows that there exist substantial differences in task usage between the first

two survey years (1-2) and the last two survey years (9-10). The Task Category section of the

table shows that the mean amount of time spent on Information tasks increases significantly over

time, primarily because the mean amount of time spent on People tasks decreases significantly

over time. The Skill Level section of the table shows that the mean amount of time spent on high

skilled tasks increases significantly over time. Together, these findings are of course reflected in
  11 Whilenot shown, the shapes of the density functions for the six disaggregated task-specific work experience
measures were found to be very similar to the shapes of the density functions in Figure 2.

notably, the mean amount of time spent on low skilled People tasks decreases by 18 percent

over time, and the mean amount of time spent on high skilled Information tasks increases by 22

percent over time.




4   The Relationship Between Current Tasks, Past Tasks, and Wages

This section transitions from examining how time is spent on jobs to determining how this alloca-

tion is related to wages. We begin in Section 4.1 by exploring OLS relationships between wages,

job tasks, and task-specific work experience. In Section 4.2 we introduce a conceptual framework,

which builds on the recent work of Autor and Handel (2013), to highlight the issues that arise in

the interpretation of the types of strong empirical relationships that we find. This analysis points

to the potential value of fixed effects estimators, which take advantage of our longitudinal data

to difference observations across time. Of particular importance, fixed effects estimators have the

potential to identify informative population parameters even in the presence of selection into job

tasks based on comparative advantage, although we discuss a variety of conceptual issues that

complicate interpretation. Section 4.3 shows the fixed effects results.


4.1                           Tasks and Task-Specific Work Experience Across the Wage Distribution

Figure 4 shows bivariate relationships between wages and job tasks (Figure 4a), and wages and

task-specific work experience (Figure 4b). Pooling across all workers and all years, Figure 4a

depicts the mean fraction of time spent on tasks for jobs in the bottom decile of the wage dis-

tribution and for jobs in the top decile of the wage distribution. Perhaps most notable, when

compared to jobs in the top decile, jobs in the bottom decile require approximately 50 percent

more low skilled People tasks, twice as much low skilled Objects tasks, and half as much high

skilled Information tasks. Figure 4b shows how task-specific work experience in the final survey

year varies across the wage distribution. Most notable here, the gaps in low skilled task usage

that were seen between the bottom and top wage deciles in Figure 4a are not as large (People)

or are not present at all (Objects). On the other hand, the large gap that was observed for high

skilled task usage (Information) in Figure 4a is also observed in Figure 4b and a new gap has

emerged for high skilled Objects tasks. Thus, our descriptive results in Figure 4 suggest that both

current and past tasks may play an important role in determining wages, with high skilled past

tasks potentially being more important than low skilled past tasks.

                         OLS provides a way to delve deeper into the relationships in the data. The large majority of

the human capital literature has focused on human capital produced during the formal schooling



                                                                                      16
period. In recognition of a central assumption in this literature - that observable academic mea-

sures are reasonably viewed as proxies for human capital at the time of entrance to the workforce

- column 1 of Table 4 shows a regression of log-wages on college GPA and demographic charac-

teristics. The coefficient on GPA is quantitatively large and statistically significant (t-statistic of

3.76). Nonetheless, the fact that the R2 in column 1 is only 0.014 reinforces the message in much

prior research that understanding how human capital accumulates in the post-schooling period

is of great importance for understanding the evolution of earnings (Ben-Porath, 1967; Mincer,

1974; Katz and Murphy, 1992; Heckman, Lochner and Taber, 1998).

    Unfortunately, in the post-schooling period it is typically not possible to observe either inputs

into the production of human capital or any direct measures of human capital (Bowlus and

Robinson, 2012). In practice, empirical researchers attempt to proxy for a worker’s human capital

using observable characteristics that are related to wages, with experience measures (overall

experience or experience in different occupations) playing a prominent role given their time-

varying nature. Column 2 of Table 4 shows that an overall experience measure is significant

when added to the wage regression, and the new R2 is 0.059.
    The six measures of task-specific work experience, hsit (k), s ∈ (h, l), k∈(P, I, O), described in

Section 3.2 allow a more complete and in-depth way to characterize the activities that a person

has performed during her career. Column 6 of Table 4 adds these six task measures to the

wage regression along with the five measures that characterize the tasks a person is currently

performing on the job.12 The parameters associated with current period tasks are identified

relative to the omitted task category of low skilled Objects tasks, τl (O).13 Confirming that the

new variables constructed from our time allocation measures contain substantial content, the R2

of the regression that includes the new measures is 0.112 (column 6).

    An appealing and unique aspect of both the τs (k) measures and the hs (k) measures is that

they have have very clear interpretations. For example, τl (P) = 0.20 means that a person spends

20 percent of her time in year t performing People tasks at a low skill level. Similarly, hh (I) = 1.5

means that a person has spent a total of 1.5 years in the past performing high skilled Information

tasks.

  12 Quadratic terms for the task-specific experience variables are not included because for these relatively young

workers, we did not find evidence of curvature in the experience-wage profile.
  13 There are only five task measures included in the regression because by definition the six “fraction of time” task

measures must sum to one for each job.

   The estimates related to current tasks shown in column 6 of Table 4 make considerable in-

tuitive sense, with two main takeaways. First, performing Objects tasks has a particularly large

negative association with wages, especially if these tasks are performed at a low skill level. Sec-

ond, performing tasks at high skill levels rather than low skill levels is associated with large wage

increases. To see the quantitative importance of these facts, consider a person who is spending

at least half of her current hours working in low skilled Objects tasks (i.e, τl (O) > 0.50). With re-

spect to the wage penalty for low skilled Objects tasks, holding constant the person’s past work,

moving half of her current work hours from low skilled Objects tasks to low skilled People tasks

payoff for high skilled work, moving half of her current work hours from low skilled Objects

tasks to high skilled People tasks (instead of low skilled People tasks) leads to an almost dou-

is 21 percent ( 0.427

   Turning to the six proxies for task-specific human capital, hs (k), s ∈ (h, l), k∈(P, I, O), that

describe a person’s past activities, perhaps the most striking result in column 6 of Table 4 is

the role of accumulated time spent performing high skilled Information tasks. The estimated

coefficient on hh (I) of 0.189 suggests that working in high skilled tasks may be very important

for creating one’s human capital; a worker with one extra person-year of experience performing

high skilled Information tasks earns 18.9 percent more than a worker with no such work expe-

rience, and the associated t-statistic is 5.4. The estimated coefficient on hh (O) of 0.077 is also

quantitatively large, although neither this estimated effect nor the estimated effect of hh (P) is

significant at conventional levels (t-statistics of 1.42 and 0.47, respectively). In contrast, there is

no evidence that the amount of time spent performing tasks at low skill levels in the past has any

relationship with current wages. The point estimates associated with the three low skilled tasks



                                                  19
are economically small (hl (P) = 0.019, hl (I) = −0.016, and hlt (O) = −0.028), and the associated

t-statistics are each below 1.0.

      It is worth noting that the OLS estimates are based on a fairly parsimonious specification, as

are the fixed effects estimates discussed in Section 4.3. We experimented with richer alternative

specifications that allowed for interactions between current tasks (τ ′ s) and task-specific experi-

ence (h ′ s) variables. To give one example, it is natural to wonder whether or not the return to the

cumulative amount of time spent performing a particular task in the past depends on the current

task requirements of a job (Gathmann and Schönberg, 2010). Unfortunately, given our relatively

small sample size and the large number of potential interactions that could exist between the

eleven current task and task specific experience variables shown in Table 2, we did not find these

specifications to be particularly informative. Thus, very roughly speaking, our results indicate

the overall effects of accumulating experience in particular tasks in the past, but do not provide

information about whether heterogeneity in these effects might arise from differences in current

tasks.


4.2     Conceptual Framework: Wages and Tasks

Given the strong relationships found in Section 4.1, it is worthwhile to use a simple conceptual

framework to discuss issues of interpretation that arise when attempting to estimate the returns

to job tasks. The value added of the BPS tasks measures is highlighted by enriching the con-

ceptual model of Autor and Handel (2013), who stress the potential importance of taking into

account the role of comparative advantage, as in the extensive literature that considers estimation

and identification of the Roy (1951) model.14 In particular, we adapt the Autor and Handel (2013)

framework to incorporate the direct measures of time spent on tasks that are a novel feature of

the BPS data.

      Comparative advantage arises when workers have different efficiencies (i.e., abilities) at per-

forming each of the K job tasks present in the labor market. To help fix ideas, note that our

empirical application has K = 6 tasks corresponding to high and and low skilled People, Infor-

mation, and Objects tasks.15 The efficiency endowment of worker i is Θ = {θi1 , ..., θiK }, where,


  14 See, for example, (Heckman and Sedlacek, 1985; Heckman and Honoré, 1990; Heckman and Sedlacek, 1990;

Gould, 2002; Heckman and Taber, 2010)
  15 To simplify notation, in this section we do not explicitly distinguish between high and low skilled tasks.



                                                      20
as in Autor and Handel (2013), θik is the amount of task k that person i can complete in a given

time interval (e.g., per hour).16 Each job j requires a worker to devote a specified amount of time

τjkt to each of the k = 1, ..., K job tasks in time period t. Thus, the total units of job task k that

are performed by person i in time t, which we often refer to as the total number of efficiency

units of task k, is given by τjkt θik . Letting pk represent the productivity of each efficiency unit

of job task k, letting εijt represent an idiosyncratic shock to output, and allowing each worker

to possess an endowment of general ability µi reflecting differences in productivity that are not

directly tied to job tasks, the output of worker i in job j in time period t is

                                                (                                     )

Assuming workers are paid their marginal product, the log wage is

    The majority of the discussion in this section assumes, in effect, that the task efficiencies (θik )

are: 1) constant across time and 2) known by both the worker and by employers. Regarding the

first assumption, Appendix B expands our conceptual framework to explore how time-varying

task efficiencies could arise because of learning-by-doing. Regarding the second assumption, one

potential concern is that individuals and employers could learn about comparative advantage

(θik ) over time as workers perform different tasks.17 Like much previous literature, we do not

dwell on this issue. However, it is important to acknowledge that the possibility of this type of

learning suggests a need to be cautious when interpreting our estimates, and in the remainder

of this section we provide further discussion about this issue where relevant.

    A standard objective of empirical work is to estimate the market price of each task in the labor

market, pk , k = 1, ..., K. This requires an assumption that pk is constant across jobs. While Autor

   16 We  initially abstract away from worker learning about ability to perform different job tasks, but return to this
important issue at the end of the section.
   17 Gibbons et al. (2005) provide a detailed analysis of an empirical model of learning and comparative advantage

within the context of sectoral choice. It is also worth noting that estimating an empirical model of learning is quite
difficult in the present context, where there are six separate task efficiencies that individuals could potentially learn
about over time, specifically, one efficiency parameter for each of the three task categories (People, Information,
and Objects) at both skill levels (high and low). Using O*NET data,Sanders (2017) estimates a structural model
of occupational choice that includes both task-specific human capital and learning about ability to perform tasks.
Guvenen et al. (2017) investigate the extent of skill mismatch using a framework that incorporates occupation-level
job task data and learning about skills.

appealing, two unique features of our data are crucial for increasing its plausibility as a rough

approximation in our environment. First, our collection of time allocation measures allows τjkt

to appear explicitly in the efficiency unit measure, τjkt θik . To see why this is important for the

constant price assumption, note that the situation without explicit time measures is consistent

with the standard data sources analyzed in the growing empirical literature on tasks. When time

allocation data is not available, the unobserved time spent on a task, τjkt , is subsumed into the

“price” of θik . Specifically, as in Autor and Handel (2013), whose model takes into account the
                                                ∑       ∗               ∗
realities of traditional data, wages depend on K  k=1 pk × θik , where pk = pk τjkt . This implies

that in the absence of measures of time spent on tasks, the “price” (p∗k ) must by definition vary

across jobs to the extent that different jobs involve spending varying amounts of time on each

task.

   The second feature of the BPS data that increases the plausibility of the constant price as-

sumption is that the data clearly identifies the skill level at which a task is performed. Thus,

a particular price in Equation 2 corresponds to a particular task being performed at a specific

skill level. This is helpful because, for example, two identical workers spending exactly the same

amount of time on People tasks would likely be paid differently if one was primarily a supervisor

(high skill) while the other was primarily being supervised (low skill).

   A large body of research on the determination of wages has viewed ability as one-dimensional

(i.e., θik = 1 ∀ (i, k) ). The primary identification concern expressed in this literature is that ex-

planatory variables may be correlated with general ability (µi ). A concern about bias arising

through this avenue is relevant for our regressor of interest τjkt ; a variety of unobserved em-

ployer and employee considerations might lead high ability workers to end up in different types

of jobs than lower ability workers. In this setting, a natural approach is to take advantage of a

fixed effects estimator. However, data limitations have limited the usefulness of this approach

in the task context. Given that tasks are not measured at the level of individual jobs in existing

longitudinal data, researchers typically assign all workers in a particular occupation the same

tasks from the DOT or O*NET. However, in this scenario, changes in tasks will be ruled out as an

explanation for any of the substantial changes in earnings that are known to exist for a person

within an occupation. Further, existing task data is frequently characterized in a qualitative man-



                                                 22
ner, and it is not obvious how to interpret “differenced” ordinal measures. Thus, our collection

of the first longitudinal, individual-level task information, when combined with our new time

allocation measures, provides a unique opportunity to implement a fixed effects estimator in this

context.

   The potential benefits of differencing are also readily apparent when we return to a scenario

where θik varies across i and k, so that task efficiencies are multi-dimensional and heterogeneous

across individuals. A primary identification concern in this comparative advantage scenario is

that individuals with a higher efficiency at task k (i.e., higher values of θik ) will tend to select

into jobs in which they spend more time performing task k (i.e., jobs with higher values of τjkt ).

This implies that two workers who spend different amounts of times on task k would not likely

receive the same wages even if they spent the same amount of time on task k. As a result, given

that θik is unobserved, the OLS estimator for the effect of τjkt on wages, which exploits this

cross-sectional variation, will suffer from an omitted variables bias.

   The previous discussion suggests the potential benefits of utilizing the within-person vari-

ation that the fixed effects estimator is based on. Consider a version of our model in which

there are two time periods and a single task (K = 1). The difference in log wages between two

time periods t and t ′ for a particular person is given by log(wijt ) − log(wijt ′ ) = pk θik (τjkt −

τjkt ′ ) + (εijt − εijt ′ ). Under the assumption of exogenous mobility presented by Abowd, Kra-

marz and Margolis (1999), E(εijt − εijt ′ |τjkt − τjkt ′ ) = 0, and the average value of (log(wijt ) −

log(wijt ′ ))/(τjkt − τjkt ′ ) across all workers is equal to pk E(θik ). Note that, unlike what is seen

with fixed effects in the one-dimensional ability scenario, fixed effects in the comparative ad-

vantage scenario does not remove the influence of θik altogether. Nonetheless, the parameter

pk E(θik ) is of substantial interest, representing the average return, or effect, of having a person

spend more time on task k.

   As in Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999), the exogenous mobility assumption does not

imply that individuals move between jobs in an unconditionally random manner. Rather, it

is an assumption that an individual decides whether to accept a new job offer by considering

the tasks she would perform (τikt , k = 1, ..., K), how good she is at performing these tasks

(θik , k = 1, ..., K), and the prices (pk , k = 1, ..., K). This assumption is consistent with much

recent research (see, e.g., Yamaguchi (2012) and Autor and Handel (2013)), which implicitly



                                                  23
assumes that selection due to comparative advantage into job tasks is of primary importance.18 ,19

Nonetheless, as always, the interpretation that follows from the exogenous mobility assumption

should be viewed with an appropriate degree of caution given that this assumption likely will

not be literally true.

    Further, it is worth noting that interpretation would also become more complicated if we were

to move away from the assumption that the task efficiencies θik are known by both the worker

and by employers in all periods, because in this case an individual’s wage would depend on

what the market believes about θik at a particular point in time. Further, in this type of learning

environment, changes in beliefs about θik could potentially create a spurious correlation between

the within-person changes in wages and the within-person changes in tasks that are utilized by

the fixed effects estimator. For example, this would be the case if, when the market learns that

a worker’s ability to perform a particular task is higher than previously believed, the worker

chooses to perform more of this task and employers pay the worker more for all units of this task

that she performs.

    The interpretation of the fixed effects estimator as the average return to spending more time

on a task depends critically on whether agents are observed performing each task during their

careers. This message is front and center in the literature interested in identifying and estimat-

ing models of comparative advantage. In the typical context where comparative advantage is

relevant, workers will frequently not be observed in all sectors. For example, in an occupational

choice context, workers are usually observed working in only white collar occupations or only

blue collar occupations (but not both). Roughly speaking, in this situation, a fixed effects esti-

mator will capture the average return for only the subset of individuals who participate in both

sectors. This is problematic because the average return for this subset of workers may be very

different from the average return for the overall population. Thus, in a typical comparative ad-

vantage scenario, researchers are forced to specify and estimate the process by which selection

takes place.

    In contrast, the view of our fixed effects estimator as an informative average return is sup-

   18 Exceptions include Sullivan (2010a), and Taber and Vejlin (2016). Bonhomme, Lamadon and Manresa (2016)
describe the central role of the exogenous mobility assumption in recent research and develop an empirical framework
based on matched worker-firm data that allows for endogenous mobility.
   19 Under the exogenous mobility assumption, even if tasks tend to be systematically related to unobserved wage

determinants of jobs (ε ′ s) in the population, our estimates would have a useful interpretation; they would capture the
average total wage effect of moving to a job with different tasks rather than capturing a pure task effect.

ported by our descriptive results in Section 3, which indicate that the large majority of workers

in our data are observed spending time on all tasks (and have changes over time in these tasks).

We note that our ability to uncover the degree to which workers participate in different “sectors”

comes from the nature of our unique time allocation measures. As such, a contribution of our

project comes from the role that our data collection efforts play in potentially allowing a useful

interpretation of an estimator that does not require us to parameterize and directly estimate the

selection process.20


4.3     Fixed Effects Wage Equation Estimates

In this section we do not dwell on whether our fixed effects results should be interpreted under

the one-dimensional ability scenario or the comparative advantage scenario that were discussed

in Section 4.2. Instead, we simply keep in mind that, subject to the caveats/assumptions stated

in Section 4.2, in either of these scenarios a large estimated effect of tasks suggests that what a

person does on her job plays an important role in wage determination.

      Column 7 of Table 4 shows person-level fixed effects (within) estimates of the log wage equa-

tion. Beginning with the current task information, a 37 percent decrease in the coefficient on

τh (I) is observed as we move from OLS (Column 6) to fixed effects (Column 7). This decrease is

consistent with the hypothesis that the OLS estimator is upward biased due to a positive corre-

lation between unobserved worker ability and the tendency to perform high skilled Information

tasks. Nonetheless, the estimated wage effect of working in a job with high skilled Information

tasks remains quantitatively large and statistically significant. The estimated coefficient on τh (I)

of 0.693 is the largest of the five task coefficients and the associated t-statistic is greater than 2.5.

Similarly, the fixed effects estimated coefficients on τh (P) and τl (I) are 24 percent and 21 percent

smaller than the OLS estimates, but still indicate economically large and statistically significant

wage premia for performing high skilled People tasks and low skilled Information tasks relative

to low skilled Objects tasks (point estimates of 0.497 for τh (P) and 0.413 for τl (I), and p-values

of 0.006 and 0.010). Perhaps the biggest differences between the fixed effects and OLS results are

seen in the remaining two variables, with both the estimated coefficient on τl (P) and the esti-


   20 Of course, directly modeling the difficult selection problem has the benefit of potentially allowing one to examine

a variety of population parameters other than the parameter discussed here (Heckman et al., 1998; Keane and Wolpin,
1997).


                                                           25
mated coefficient on τh (O) falling by over 50 percent. Nonetheless, the general takeaway from

the “current tasks” estimates in column 7 of Table 4 is similar to that found using OLS, despite

the fact that the fixed effect estimates are based solely on within-person variation in tasks and

wages.

      The spirit of our results on the importance of task-specific work experience is also remarkably

robust to controlling for fixed effects. Similar to what was seen with τh (I), a decrease of 30

percent in the estimated coefficient on hh (I) is observed as we move from OLS to fixed effects.

Nonetheless, the estimated effect of accumulating experience in high skilled Information tasks

remains quantitatively and statistically important, with one person-year of hh (I) being estimated

to increase wages by approximately 13 percent and the associated t-statistic having a value of

2.85. The fixed effects estimates also reveal that accumulating time in high skilled People tasks

increases future wages, with hh (P) having an estimated coefficient of 0.040 and a p-value of

0.059. Also similar in spirit to the OLS results, none of the estimated low skill task-specific

experience coefficients are statistically different from zero at conventional levels, although the

point estimate for hl (O) is quite large but imprecisely estimated. Thus, the fixed effects estimates

support the intuitively appealing notion that there is considerable scope for workers to become

more productive through learning-by-doing as they perform high skilled tasks, with accumulated

experience in high skilled Information tasks being particularly important. However, there is little

evidence that performing low skilled tasks today is a path to higher future wages.


4.4     Decomposing Wage Changes: Current Tasks vs. Task-Specific Experience

A number of influential papers have demonstrated the value of the task approach to labor mar-

kets by using factor analysis to merge occupation-level task data with individual-level occupa-

tional choice and wage data (Poletaev and Robinson, 2008; Yamaguchi, 2012). In this approach,

the data describing occupations in a source such as the DOT is distilled into a small number of

factors (such as cognitive and manual). Higher factor scores are typically interpreted as more

“complex” tasks. However, within this framework it is inherently difficult to identify concrete

changes in job activities that affect wages.21 In addition, there is no natural way to directly

translate the factor scores into a cumulative measure of tasks performed over the career. In con-

  21 Of course, applying factor analysis in this manner is an excellent way to distill the very high dimensional DOT
data into information that has been shown to be quite useful in empirical work.

 Note: Each row shows the wage change resulting from the shift in tasks listed in column 1. Column 2 lists
 the amount of time that is shifted between tasks. The hypothetical change in tasks occurs in each year,
 over a ten year period. Column 5 shows the total log-wage change in year 10: w(t = 10|task shift) − w(t = 1).
 Columns 3 and 4 decompose the total change into the Current Task (τ ′ s) and Task-Specific Experience (h ′ s) components.
 All log-wage changes are based on the fixed effects estimates shown in column 7 of Table 2.


trast, subject to the caveats/assumptions discussed in Section 4.2, the novel structure of the BPS

data allows us to quantify the wage effects of changing the amount of time spent performing

well-defined tasks over the career. Further, we are able to decompose the wage effects into two

components: 1) task-specific experience, which serves as our proxy for human capital accumula-

tion in the past, and 2) current-period tasks, which have a direct effect on wages.

      The results in column 7 of Table 4 can be broadly summarized by three main findings: 1)

current job tasks play a large role in determining wages, with high skilled tasks being paid

substantially more than low skilled tasks, 2) there is no evidence of learning-by-doing for low

skilled tasks, but there is strong evidence of learning-by-doing for high skilled tasks, and 3) not all

types of high skilled tasks play the same role in the determination of wages, with current and past

high skilled People tasks being important, but current and past high skilled Information tasks

playing an especially prominent role. Table 5 puts these results into further “lifecycle” context by

examining how hypothetical changes in tasks over the first ten years of a worker’s career would

affect the worker’s log wage in the tenth year. When describing the table, it is useful to first

define new notation for the estimated returns to both current tasks and task specific experience.

In particular, let βsτ (k), s ∈ (h, l), k ∈ (P, I, O) represent the fixed effects estimate of the returns

to time spent on tasks (τ).22 Analogously, let γsh (k), s ∈ (h, l), k ∈ (P, I, O) represent the fixed

effects estimate of the returns to task-specific experience (h).


     22 Recall   that the coefficient on low skilled Objects tasks is normalized to zero.


                                                                27
    The main findings 1) and 2) above, which highlight the importance of past and present high

skilled tasks, are apparent in the three rows of Table 5. The first row shows the change in the log

wage in the tenth year for a worker who, in each of the first ten years, experiences a hypothetical

move from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the distribution of high skilled People tasks.23 Row

1, column 2 shows that the movement from the 25th to the 75th percentile involves increasing

τh (P) by 0.239 units in each of the ten years, and we assume that this time is shifted away from

low skilled People tasks (thus, the notation τl (P) → τh (P) used in row 1, column 1 of the table).

This re-allocation of time from low skilled to high skilled People tasks impacts wages through

two distinct channels shown in columns 3 and 4 of the table. On the one hand, current tasks
                              ∑ s
affect wages directly through   βτ (k)τs (k) (column 3). On the other hand, changing current-

period tasks alters task-specific experience, our proxy for human capital accumulation, through
∑ s
  γh (k)hs (k) (column 4). Column 3 of Table 5 shows that the “Current Tasks” component of the

log wage change is equal to 0.239 × (βh        l
                                      τ (P) − βτ (P)) = 0.100, where 0.239 is the per-year increase

in τh (P) and (βh        l
                τ (P) − βτ (P)) is the estimated premium for performing high skilled People tasks

over low skilled People tasks. Column 4 shows that the ‘Task-Specific Experience” component of

the log wage change is equal to 0.239 × (γh
                                          h (P) − γh (P)) × 10 = 0.158, where 0.239 is the per-year
                                                   l


change in tasks, (γh        l
                   h (P) − γh (P)) is the premium for accumulated experience performing high

skilled People tasks, and 10 is the number of years over which tasks change. Finally, column 5

of Table 5 shows that a permanent move from the 25th to the 75th percentile of τh (P) results in

a total increase in wages of 25.8 percent.

    The second row of Table 5 quantifies the effect of shifting time from low to high skilled

Information tasks (τl (I) → τh (I)). Moving from the 25th to the 75th percentile of high skilled

Information tasks requires increasing τh (I) by 0.160. This change is 33 percent smaller than the

change in the fraction of time required to move between the same percentiles of the distribution

of high skilled People tasks (row 1). The current tasks component of the wage increase is 0.045

log-points (column 3), and the task-specific experience component of the wage change is 0.130

(column 4). The total wage change, shown in column 5, is equal to 0.175, which again suggests

that performing high skilled tasks is a key determinant of earning high wages. The third row

   23 Expressing  the change in tasks in terms of percentiles is useful because column 2 of Table 5 reveals that there
are fairly large differences in the inter-quartile ranges across the high-skilled People, Information, and Objects task
categories. In other words, what one might consider a large change in job tasks varies considerably across the task
categories.

(τl (O) → τh (O)). The total log wage change resulting from this shift is -0.067, although it is worth

noting that the effects of current and past Objects tasks are seen to be imprecisely estimated in

column 7 of Table 4.24



5 Conclusion

This paper presents new empirical evidence on the relationship between job tasks and wages by

taking advantage of novel data, which allow a natural way to characterize current and past job

activities at a primitive level. The data from the Berea Panel Study represent the first longitudinal

dataset containing job-level task information for individual workers. Further, novel quantitative

task measures detail the amount of time spent performing People, Information, and Objects

tasks at different skill levels. We find that current job tasks are quantitatively important, with

high skilled tasks being paid substantially more than low skilled tasks. There is no evidence of

learning-by-doing for low skilled tasks, but strong evidence for high skilled tasks. Current and

past high skilled Information tasks are particularly valuable. Our new methods for the collection

of task information are of importance given that a variety of recent data initiatives have been

motivated, in part, by a desire to collect better measures of what workers are doing on their jobs.




    24 Despite our third main finding - that current and past high skilled Information tasks play an especially prominent

role in the determination of wages - the total effect in row 2 (Information) is smaller than the total effect in row 1
(People) because low skilled Information tasks pay substantially more than low skilled People tasks. In results not
shown, a log wage increase of 0.113 arises in the tenth year when, in each of the first ten years, a worker experiences
a hypothetical increase in τh (I) of 0.10 and an accompanying decrease in τh (P) of 0.10 (τh (P) → τh (I)). Similarly,
we find that a shift of 10 percent of work time from low skilled People tasks to high skilled Information tasks
(τl (P) → τh (I)) leads to a total log-wage increase of 0.221.

   Appendix B: Extended Conceptual Framework

   This appendix expands the conceptual framework presented in Section 4.2 to consider how

past tasks, in addition to current tasks, might affect wages. Taking advantage of the explicit time

allocation measures in our data, we consider a framework where past tasks are summarized by

accumulated task-specific work experience. Specifically, the output of worker i in job j in time

period t is

                              (                                                                        )

This equation expands on the framework presented in Section 4.2 in two ways. First, and most

straightforwardly, it allows task-specific work experience to directly affect wages through the
      ∑
term K  k=1 βk hikt . Second, it allows the worker’s efficiency endowment at performing task k,

fk (θik , hikt , Γ ), to depend on initial ability, θik , accumulated task-specific work experience, hikt ,

and a vector of parameters, Γ .

   In the absence of data limitations, in principal it would be possible to estimate a flexible func-

tional form for the relationship between accumulated task-specific experience and task efficiency

(fk (·)). However, given the high dimensional nature of our task measures, and the limited sample

size, it seems reasonable to consider a linear relationship, f(θik , hikt , Γ ) = θikt + γk hikt , where

the parameter γk reveals how accumulated experience at task k affects the worker’s efficiency at

performing task k. Under this specification equation 3 becomes

As discussed in Section 4.1, we estimated several versions of this model, and did not find spec-

ifications allowing for interactions between current tasks and task specific experience to be par-

ticularly informative. Perhaps this is not surprising, given the high dimensional nature of the

task measures. In addition, the specification of our wage equations is constrained by the rel-

atively small sample size of 528 individuals, with an average 6.24 observations per individual.

However, if future data collection efforts obtain similar task measures on a larger scale, it would

certainly be interesting to estimate more general relationships between current tasks, past tasks,

and wages.
