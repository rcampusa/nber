1    Introduction

Following the seminal theoretical work of Becker (1968), a large body of empirical literature has revealed
that preventive and punitive measures do in fact have a signi…cant impact on criminal activities (Cook,
2009; Benson and Zimmerman, 2010; Cook et al., 2013; and Draca and Machin, 2015). In particular,
regarding law enforcement, it is well established that an increase in the size of the police force reduces
crime (Levitt, 1997; Di Tella and Shargrodsky, 2004; Klick and Tabarrok, 2005; Evans and Owens, 2007;
and Draca, Machin, and Witt, 2011). The key question now at the frontier of the economics of crime
    This paper is dedicated to the memory of Gary S. Becker.


                                                          1
and law enforcement is how to make police deployment strategies more e¢ cient (see Benson, 2010 for a
recent survey on this topic). This paper aims to help answer this question by developing the …rst general
equilibrium model to study how the geographic distribution of police protection a¤ects the decision to
become a criminal, the intensity and location of crime, residential choices, housing prices, and the welfare
of di¤erent socioeconomic groups. The goal is to study the positive and normative e¤ects of di¤erent
ways of spatially allocating police forces in a city.
   Section 2 develops a baseline model. The building block is a model of a city populated by agents of
di¤erent socioeconomic groups and made up of several residential areas, which are denoted as neighbor-
hoods. Socioeconomic groups are distinguished by their factor endowments. In particular, there is one
homogenous group of skilled agents, and several homogenous groups of unskilled agents, each of them with
a di¤erent per capita endowment of unskilled labor. The city is treated as a small open economy, that is,
the prices of tradable goods and inputs are exogenously given. Agents select (1) their occupation (i.e.,
work in …rms that produce goods or become a criminal); (2) their residence (i.e., in which neighborhood
to reside); and (3) consumption and housing. Firms demand unskilled and skilled labor and supply trad-
able goods using a constant returns to scale technology. Criminals use their labor endowments to extract
income from other citizens. The supply of housing in each neighborhood is chosen by pro…t-maximizer
developers, who use capital and land to build houses. Capital is a tradable input, that is, it is elastically
supplied at a given price, while land is a nontradable input in …xed supply in each neighborhood. The
government provides public protection by deploying police forces in the city, which reduces the amount
that criminals can otherwise extract from their victims. Given the prices of tradable goods and inputs
and the allocation of public protection, the model determines the three endogenous variables mentioned
above by employing a combination of a standard small and open-economy competitive equilibrium and a
spatial notion of equilibrium. In equilibrium, no agent can obtain a rent changing his or her occupation
and/or location. Thus, we adopt a long-run perspective that allows agents enough time to change their
occupation and residence.
   The central object of the analysis is public protection regimes. We consider two extreme strategies
to allocate the police across the city, which we assume are both feasible and have the same cost. Under
concentrated public protection, the police only protect some neighborhoods and leave the rest of the city
completely unprotected. Under dispersed public protection, the police are evenly deployed across the


                                                        2
entire city, inducing an equal level of public protection in all neighborhoods. With these two protection
regimes we try to capture, albeit in stylized fashion, the basic trade-o¤ faced by the police with regard
to the geographic allocation of protection. With the same resources, the police can either extensively
protect a smaller area (concentrated protection) or partially protect a larger area (dispersed protection).
   Section 3 characterizes the equilibrium in each protection regime. It shows that, under proper condi-
tions, concentrated public protection leads to a spatially segregated city. Only rich agents are willing to
pay the high housing prices in protected neighborhoods, while poor workers and criminals reside in un-
protected neighborhoods. Neighborhoods protected by the police are safe, concentrate wealthy citizens,
and have high land and housing prices. In the rest of the city, crime is pervasive, neighborhoods are
populated by poor agents, and land and housing prices are relatively low. The opposite happens under
dispersed public protection. When the police force is evenly dispersed across all neighborhoods, the city
becomes fully integrated. All neighborhoods are inhabited by citizens of all income levels. Indeed, income
per capita and crime levels are equalized across the city.
   There are two mechanisms operating in the model presented here that produce these results. Regard-
ing occupational choices, the payo¤ from crime does not vary with a citizen’s labor endowment, while the
payo¤ from working is obviously increasing in a citizen’s labor endowment. This makes relatively poor
citizens more prone to become criminals. Indeed, both under concentrated and dispersed public protec-
tion, we focus on a region of the parameter space for which, in equilibrium, only agents in the poorest
socioeconomic group decide to become criminals. Regarding residential choices, the wealthier the agents,
the more harmful criminal activities are for them and, as a consequence, the more they are willing to
sacri…ce in order to avoid high-crime areas. Under concentrated public protection, these di¤erences in
the willingness to pay for a safe neighborhood produce a concentration of rich agents in protected neigh-
borhoods and poor agents in unprotected neighborhoods. Under dispersed public protection, there is no
essential di¤erence among neighborhoods, crime distributes evenly in the city, and agents only take into
account housing prices in their residential choices. As a consequence, there is housing price equalization
across the city and all neighborhoods have the same income per capita.
   After formally characterizing the equilibrium under concentrated and dispersed protection, Section 4
makes several comparisons. In particular, it compares crime, measured as the total income of criminals,
aggregate income, and housing prices. With respect to crime, there is likely to be more of it under


                                                     3
dispersed protection than under concentrated protection when the wage-income share of skilled agents is
high, dispersing the police signi…cantly reduces its e¤ectiveness, the proportion of income that criminals
can extract from rich agents is high, and the proportion of income that criminals can extract from the
poor is low. Aggregate income is more likely to be higher under concentrated protection, the higher the
wage-income share of skilled agents, the more intense the reduction in police e¤ectiveness when the force
is dispersed, the more criminals can extract from skilled workers, and the less criminals can extract from
unskilled workers. Finally, we …nd conditions under which housing prices under dispersed protection
are higher than housing prices in unprotected neighborhoods but lower than housing prices in protected
neighborhoods under concentrated protection . We also show that these conditions are more likely to be
satis…ed the higher the wage-income share of skilled agents.
   Section 4 also examines the welfare and distributive e¤ects associated with a change in the public
protection regime. First, employing a simple utilitarian welfare function, we show that concentrated
protection may induce higher aggregate welfare than dispersed protection. Moreover, income inequality
matters. We prove that aggregate welfare is higher under concentrated protection for a society with a
high wage-income share of skilled agents, while aggregate welfare is higher under dispersed protection for
a society with a low wage-income share of skilled agents.
   Second, regarding distributive e¤ects, we prove that, with regard to a utilitarian welfare function,
unskilled agents as a whole are better o¤ under dispersed protection. Thus, societies with high levels of
income inequality may face a complicated dilemma. Concentrated protection may maximize aggregate
welfare but exacerbate social disparities. In contrast, in more equalitarian societies, dispersed protection
simultaneously maximizes aggregate welfare and reduces social disparities. One solution to the regressive
distributive consequences of concentrated protection is to supplement the regime with a set of taxes
and transfers. We deduce a set of equations for the compensation that must be provided in order to
make each unskilled agent equally well o¤ between concentrated and dispersed protection. Conceptually,
the compensation received by each socioeconomic group takes into account the impact of the protection
regime on income (di¤erent for each group) and housing prices (common for all groups). However, there
are general equilibrium e¤ects and, therefore, each compensation cannot be computed separately.
   Third, we explore some interesting political economy implications related to the distributive e¤ects
of a change in the public protection regime. In particular, there is room for the formation of atypical


                                                     4
political coalitions with respect to public safety. Although at least one group of unskilled agents will
be better o¤ under dispersed than under concentrated protection, it is not necessarily the case that
all unskilled agents unanimously prefer dispersed protection. Dispersing police forces could induce an
increase in the housing prices paid by unskilled workers that consumes their gains in income. Thus,
skilled and some unskilled agents may have an incentive to form a coalition that supports concentrated
protection.
   Section 5 explores two extensions to the baseline model. First, it introduces private security. In many
countries di¤erent forms of private security are intensively employed by households and businesses. In
principle, our baseline model can handle pure private security such us alarm systems and security doors.
One alternative is to reinterpret the fraction of income that criminals extract from other agents as the
outcome of a more detailed game that incorporates defensive measures by the victims. More interesting
are closed neighborhoods protected by fences and security guards or patrols collectively …nanced by the
neighbors – that is, when private security works as a club good. In this case, we show that dispersed
public protection does not necessarily lead to an integrated city equilibrium in which crime, income per
capita, and housing prices are spatially equalized. The reason is that skilled agents may use private
protection to endogenously isolate themselves in fully protected areas, while high housing prices exclude
unskilled workers from these areas.
   Second, the section considers a model with a continuum of agent types. Instead of four socioeconomic
groups, we assume that the distribution of labor endowments in the population is given by a continu-
ous distribution function over an interval. Although numerical solutions are required to obtain a full
characterization of the equilibrium of the model with a continuum of agent types, we …nd conditions
under which concentrated public protection leads to a segregated city equilibrium, while dispersed public
protection induces an integrated city equilibrium. Thus, the structure of the equilibrium associated with
each protection regime is the same as in the baseline model. In both protection regimes, in equilibrium,
only agents with labor endowments below some occupational threshold become criminals (although the
thresholds are generally di¤erent in each regime). Under concentrated protection, agents with labor
endowments below a residential threshold reside in unprotected neighborhoods with low housing prices,
while agents above the threshold reside in protected neighborhoods with high housing prices. Under
dispersed protection, agents of all types reside in every neighborhood and housing prices are equalized


                                                    5
across the city. Regime comparisons are more complicated in the model with a continuum of agent
types because they depend on the occupational and residential thresholds, which must be computed nu-
merically. Nevertheless, we show that in order to compare aggregate welfare, we only need to compute
the occupational and residential thresholds for the equilibrium under concentrated protection. This is
interesting because it indicates that crime statistics could be a misleading way to infer welfare changes.
   There are two bodies of literature connected with this work. First, there is a vast literature studying
how police presence can deter crime and disorder. Various mechanisms have been identi…ed, from in‡u-
encing the probability of apprehension of active o¤enders, which is a necessary step for their subsequent
conviction, to proactively targeting “hot”places and people, responding more rapidly to calls for services,
and conducting successful post-crime investigation (Glaeser, 1999; Levitt, 2004; Yezer, 2014; and Lum
and Nagin, 2015). Surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the …rst to analytically study
the consequences of police deployment strategies on the endogenous formation of urban spatial equilibria
and crime. Banerjee et al. (2002) conduct a RCT to examine the optimal composition of deterrence
interventions in India. Fu and Wolpin (2015) estimate a structural model of crime using MSA-level
data and employ their estimations to evaluate several targeting schemes that allocate federally-sponsored
additional police across cities. While they focus on the allocation of additional police across cities, we
study police deployment strategies within a city. As a consequence, we do not only model occupational
choices but also the location of criminal activities, residential choices and housing markets. In a very
di¤erent context, Quy-Toan, Ma and Ruiz (2016) study two crime deterrence strategies to combat So-
mali piracy: the deployment of international navies in pirate-infested waters and the provision of armed
security guards onboard vessels.
   Second, there is a large literature on urban economics, especially the notion of spatial equilibrium
(see, for example, Glaeser, 2008) as well as on spatial and socioeconomic segregation (see, for example,
Benabou, 1993, 1996, Verdier and Zenou, 2004 and Calabrese et. al., 2006). We extensively use the
idea that, in a spatial equilibrium, the location of both legal and illegal activities must be such that
no agent has an incentive to move his or her activities to a di¤erent location. Indeed, we apply to
the geographic distribution of crime the same tools many urban economists have used to explain the
location of legal activities. Following this parallelism, just as public education policies, highways and
other public infrastructure a¤ect the incentives of households and businesses to locate in di¤erent areas


                                                    6
of the city, we show that police deployment strategies shape the geographic distribution of legal and
illegal economic activities. As do many studies on urban economics and socioeconomic segregation, our
model also emphasizes the importance of properly accounting for changes in housing prices. In particular,
we stress two channels through which police deployment strategies a¤ect the welfare of each individual.
First, they a¤ect the intensity and location of crime, thus a¤ecting the income of each agent; and second,
they induce changes in housing prices.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the baseline model. Section 3
characterizes the equilibrium under concentrated and dispersed protection. Section 4 compares the two
protection regimes. Section 5 develops two extensions. First, we introduce private security. Second, we
explore a model with a continuum of agent types. Finally, Section 6 concludes.


2     A Model of Crime and Residence

This section develops a simple model of the geographic distribution of crime and residence in a city,
which we treat as a small open economy. Citizens select their occupation and area of residence. The
government provides police protection. The distribution of agents to occupations and residential areas,
as well as wages, housing, and land prices, is all determined in equilibrium.


2.1    Agents, Neighborhoods, and Endowments

Consider a city integrated by a …nite set of neighborhoods indexed by j 2 J. Each neighborhood has a
                                                                     P
…xed quantity of land Lj that can be used to build houses. Let L = j2J Lj be the total quantity of
land for residential purposes. The city is populated by four homogeneous socioeconomic groups indexed
by i 2 I = fl; m; h; sg: three groups of unskilled agents denoted by l, m, and h, and a group of skilled
agents denoted by s. The mass of people in group i is N i . Each unskilled agent owns ei units of unskilled
labor, where 0   el < em < eh , while each skilled agent owns es units of skilled labor and an equal share
of all land.




                                                    7
2.2    Residence and Occupations

Each agent has a residential choice. Let ri 2 J be the residential choice of an agent in group i. Each
agent also has an occupational choice. The agent can be a worker denoted by w, that is, the agent can
rent his or her labor endowment to producers in exchange for a wage. In such a case, let wu and ws be
the wage rates of unskilled and skilled labor, respectively. Alternatively, the agent can become a criminal
who operates in neighborhood j (denoted by bj ), that is, the agent can use his or her labor endowment
to extract resources from workers residing in j. Let oi 2 O = fw; b1 ; :::; bJ g indicate the occupational
choice of an agent in group i.
   The income of an agent depends on his or her occupation and residence. Let y i oi ; ri indicates
the income of an agent in group i who selects oi ; ri . For a worker in group i who resides in j, his
                                            h            P             i

extracted by criminals, siL = 0 for i = l; m; h and ssL = 1=N s (all land is evenly owned by skilled workers)
and pL;j is the price of a unit of land in neighborhood j. Thus, each worker only keeps a fraction 1                         i
                                                                                                                             j

                                                             j                                             j

   Let N i oi ; ri denote the mass of agents in group i who select hoi ; ri . Then, for an          agent in group i
                                                         P    i N i (w;j) w i ei +si

                                                                          i2I     r i 2J

The numerator is the total plunder in neighborhood j after substracting the fraction of goods lost due
to criminal activities. Indeed, only a fraction     i   =1        i   +   i   out of each unit of income of a worker in
                                                    j             j       j

group i who resides in neighborhood j survives the destruction that crime provokes. The denominator
is the mass of criminals operating in neighborhood j. Thus, each criminal who operates in j obtains an
equal share of the total plunder in j. Note that criminals do not rob each other. As a consequence, the
income of criminals depend on where they decide to operate, but not on their residential choice.


2.3    Preferences

All agents derive utility from a consumption good and housing services. Speci…cally, they all have
identical Cobb-Douglas preferences, that is, the utility of an agent of group i who selects occupation
oi , place of residence ri , consumption level ciri and housing services hiri is given by v i oi ; ri ; hiri ; ciri =



                                                         8

price of housing services in neighborhood j. Then, the budget constraint of an agent in group i is given
by pH;ri hiri + pC ciri = y i oi ; ri .


2.4       Production and Trade

Production is undertaken by competitive …rms in both industries: consumption goods and housing.
The consumption industry employs unskilled and skilled workers. Speci…cally, assume a Cobb-Douglas
production function QC = (UC )              U;C   (SC )1       U;C   , where UC and SC are the amount of unskilled and
skilled labor employed, respectively, and                U;C   2 (0; 1). Developers use land and capital to build houses.
Again, assume a Cobb-Douglas production function QH;j = (KH;j )                            K;H   (Lj )1   L;H   , where KH;j stands
for capital used in the construction of houses in neighborhood j and                             K;H   2 (0; 1). We assume that
the city is a small open economy. The consumption good is a tradable …nal good, while houses are
nontradable …nal goods. Capital is a tradable input, while all other inputs (unskilled and skilled labor
and land) are nontradable. The city takes the price of tradable goods pC = pC > 0 and pK = pK > 0 as
                                                        P
given. Moreover, we assume balanced trade, that is, pK j2J KH;j = pC (QC CC ).


2.5       Police Protection

The government’s role is restricted to providing police protection to the neighborhoods. Assume that
the police budget is given and consider two protection strategies of equal cost: concentrated police
protection and dispersed police protection. Under concentrated protection, the police only protect some
neighborhoods. As a consequence, the residents of those neighborhoods are fully protected against crime,
while the residents of other neighborhoods su¤er the full brunt of criminal activities. Under dispersed
protection, the police force is evenly deployed in all neighborhoods, inducing equal levels of protection
throughout.1 Formally,          i
                                j   = (1     pj )   i,   where        i   2 (0; 1) is the fraction extracted by criminals from
an agent of group i when there is no police protection and pj represents the protection strategy. Under
concentrated protection, pj = 1 for j 2 Jp                 J (protected neighborhoods) and pj = 0 for j 2 Jun = J               Jp
(unprotected neighborhoods). Under dispersed protection, pj = p < 1 for all j 2 J. Thus, under
   1
       Concentrated and dispersed protection should not be confused with deterministic and random policing. As Eeckhout,
Persico and Todd (2010) show random crackdowns can be part of the police optimal monitoring strategy.


                                                                          9
concentrated protection,                   i   = 0 for j 2 Jp and           i   =    i   for j 2 Jun , while under dispersed protection,
                                           j                                j
 i   = (1           p)     i   for j 2 J. Note that p can be interpreted as the reduction in the e¤ectiveness of protection
 j

when the police force is dispersed.2


2.6         Crime and Income Distribution

We assume that wealthier agents are more vulnerable to crime. However, we put a limit on how much
crime reshapes income distribution. In particular, we keep the income ranking among the socioeconomic
groups constant, before and after crime enters the picture.

         Assumption 1: The proportion of income that criminals extract from a worker is higher the richer
the worker is. Formally:
                                                                s       h            m       l
                                                                    >       >            >       .                                    (1)

However, this is not enough to a¤ ect the ranking of groups. Formally:
              "                   #
                 1            h h

                     U;C N e


         Assumption 1 will be important and, hence, requires a more detailed discussion. First, note that
Assumption 1 does not take into account any protection (either public or private). It imposes restrictions
on the e¤ects of criminal activities in a hypothetical world without public protection. Second, a simple
way to justify condition (1) is to consider the incentives of criminals to target workers with di¤erent levels
of income as in Becker’s (1968) seminal model of crime. Suppose that each time they mount a robbery,
criminals manage to extract a fraction                       of the victim’s income, regardless of the victim’s income level.
If there is any observable attribute that signals victims’ income, then criminals will attack rich agents
more frequently. If we interpret                   i   as the fraction extracted from an agent during a period of time, which
is consistent with our model, then condition (1) holds. Indeed, even if each time they are robbed poor
agents lose a higher fraction of their income than rich agents, it is still possible that rich agents will be
     2
         It is possible to consider more moderate policies. For example, assume that under concentrated protection, pj = pH for
j 2 Jp and pj = pL for j 2 J               Jp , while under dispersed protection, pj = p0H for j 2 Jp and pj = p0L for j 2 J    Jp , where
pH >      p0H   >   p0L   > pL . The qualitative results of the paper will not be a¤ected. It is also possible to consider that pj depends
on the size of the police force relative to the mass of criminals. In particular, given a …xed police force, it is reasonable to
assume that pj decreases with the mass of criminals. This will not a¤ect our results.


                                                                                10
targeted more frequently and, as a consequence, over a long enough period of time will end up losing a
higher fraction of their income.3 More generally, the key necessary assumption for our results is that the
richer an agent, the more the agent is willing to pay for security. In this sense, condition (1) can be seen
as a natural su¢ cient condition to induce the required order on the willingness to pay for security in our
model.
       Third, crime a¤ects income distribution, but does not reverse the initial ranking of socioeconomic
groups. In order to see this, note that the income of an agent in group i = l; m; h who chooses to
be a worker and su¤ers the maximum possible extraction                                   i   is wu ei 1       i   . Thus, the last three
inequalities in condition (2) mean that workers in group h are richer than workers in group m, who are
richer than workers in group l, even after we take into account crime. The wage-income of an agent
in group s who chooses to be a worker and su¤ers the maximum possible extraction is ws es (1                                                 s ).


With the Cobb-Douglas production function, it must be the case that ws = wu                                       1        U;C   UC =   U;C SC   .
In the worst possible case where only agents in group s and h choose to be workers, we have ws =
wu       1      U;C    N h eh =   U;C N
                                          s es   . Thus, the …rst inequality in condition (2) implies that skilled workers
are richer than unskilled workers.


2.7          Equilibrium Conditions

Given the police protection allocation (pj )j2J and the prices of tradable goods pC = pC > 0
and pK = pK > 0, an equilibrium is: (1) a price vector                                       wu ; ws ; (pH;j ; pL;j )j2J     (i.e., factor re-
wards and prices of nontradable goods); (2) a production vector                                      QC ; (QH;j ; KH;j )j2J ; (3) occu-
pational and residential decisions                   UC ; SC ; N i oi ; j   i2I;j2J
                                                                                        ; and (4) income levels y i oi ; j               i2I;j2J

such that:            (1) Given the price vector                  wu ; ws ; (p   H;j ; pL;j )j2J     and occupational and residen-
tial decisions N i oi ; j , each agent maximizes his or her utility:                                   y i oi ; ri = pH;ri        (pC )1
   3
       For evidence consistent with this assumption, see, among others, Demombynesa and Ozlerb (2005) and Di Tella, Galiani
and Schargrodsky (2010). In particular, Demombynesa and Ozlerb (2005) show that criminals move to rich neighborhoods
to steal from the rich while Di Tella, Galiani and Schargrodsky (2010) show that when crime is low, the rich do not
protect themselves and they are the main target of criminals while when crime is very high, they respond by buying private
protection displacing crime towards the poor. Another, very di¤erent way to justify condition (1) is to rely on Hirshleifer’s
                                                           i
(1991) paradox of power. Suppose we interpret                  as the outcome of a more primitive con‡ict game under anarchy. Poor
agents will have an advantage in this game and, hence, con‡ict will mitigate income inequality.

    There are two important features of this notion of equilibrium. First, individuals sort themselves
across neighborhoods and select occupations in such a way that there are no gains associated with changes
in their decisions. Second, the city is a small open economy for which the prices of tradable goods are
exogenously given. Factor prices and the prices of nontradable goods are determined in competitive
markets.


3     Equilibrium

This section characterizes the equilibrium of the model under concentrated and dispersed protection,
respectively. To facilitate the characterization, the section examines a region of the parameter space in
which the protection regime does not a¤ect occupational choices. In particular, we impose conditions such
that under both concentrated and dispersed protection, in equilibrium, only agents in group l become
criminals.


3.1    Concentrated Protection

Suppose that police protection is concentrated in some neighborhoods of the city. Speci…cally, assume
that for security purposes the city is divided into two set of neighborhoods, Jp                     J and Jun = J        Jp .
Neighborhood j 2 Jp is fully protected by the police, while neighborhood j 2 Jun is left entirely unpro-
                P                    P
tected. Let Lp = j2Jp Lj and Lun = j2Jun L be the land in protected and unprotected neighborhoods,
respectively. In equilibrium, no criminal activity arises in Jp . If there are any criminals, they must locate
in Jun . An agent exposed to crime keeps a fraction 1                 i   of his or her income and criminals retain             i




                                                             12
of the victim’s income. Since the payo¤ of criminal activities depends on the income of others, and the
poorer an agent the lower the opportunity cost of crime, only poor agents become criminals.
     Regarding residential decisions, there are two neighborhood characteristics that agents weigh: housing
prices and local protection. Moreover, in equilibrium, neighborhoods with the same level of protection
have the same housing and land prices. Formally, pH;j = pHp and pL;j = pLp for j 2 Jp and pH;j = pHun
and pL;j = pLun for j 2 Jun . The wealthier an agent, the more harmful criminal activities are for him
or her and, hence, the more prone he or she is to avoid neighborhoods in Jun and choose to reside in
neighborhoods in Jp . Summing up, when protection is concentrated, criminals only operate and reside
in Jun and their victims are poor workers who also reside in Jun , while rich workers reside in Jp . It
remains only to …nd the marginal agents, that is, we need to determine the wealthiest agent who prefers
to become a criminal and the wealthiest agent who prefers to reside in Jun .
     Assume that all skilled agents reside in Jp , all unskilled agents reside in Jun , and only agents in
group l become criminals. Skilled agents will not have an incentive to change residence if and only if
                      = pLun =pLp ( K;H ) , that is, when lower housing prices in j 2 Jun are not
     s < p                            1
1           Hun =pHp

enough to compensate them for the income they lose due to criminal activities in such neighborhoods.
Moreover, since pH;j = pHp for j 2 Jp , the proportion of skilled agents who reside in j 2 Jp is Lj =Lp .
Unskilled workers will not have an incentive to change residence if and only if 1  h > p
                                                                                         Hun =pHp  =
 pLun =pLp ( K;H ) , that is, when lower housing prices in j 2 Jun are more than enough to compensate
            1


unskilled workers for the income they lose due to criminal activities in such neighborhoods. Since                   h

 m   >   l   (due to Assumption 1), agents in groups m and l also prefer to reside in Jun . Moreover, since
pH;j = pHun for j 2 Jun , the proportion of unskilled workers in group i who reside in j 2 Jun is Lj =Lun .
Finally, only agents in group l become criminals who operate in j 2 Jun if and only if 1                      l   wu el <
                                                              1
y l (bj ) < (1     m ) w u em ,   where y l (bj ) = wu N l        m N m em   +   h N h eh   is the income of a criminal
when only agents in group l are criminals. Since eh 1                 h      > em (1        m)   (due to Assumption 1),
agents in group h prefer to be workers as well. Note that, in equilibrium, criminals distribute in Jun
proportionally to the land of each neighborhood, that is, the proportion of criminals who operate in
j 2 Jun is Lj =Lun .
     pLp and pLun are endogenous variables that depend on housing demand and supply in each neigh-
borhood. However, given occupational and residential decisions we can easily compute aggregate income


                                                             13
in each neighborhood and, hence, equilibrium housing and land prices. Intuitively, pLun =pLp depends on
the ratio of aggregate incomes in relation to the ratio of supply of land in protected and unprotected
neighborhoods. Finally, we must verify that no agent prefers to change his or her original residential
choice for those equilibrium prices, that is, we need 1 s < p   =p    (1 K;H ) < 1     h.
                                                                                         Lun   Lp

   Lemma 1 shows that, under proper conditions, concentrated protection leads to an extremely segre-
gated city. Neighborhoods in Jp are completely safe and have high income per capita and high land and

                                                                         14
housing prices. In the rest of the city, that is, neighborhoods in Jun , there is crime, income per capita is
low, and land and housing prices are also low. Two mechanisms contribute to produce this equilibrium.
First, the payo¤ from criminal activities does not depend on an agent’s productivity, while the payo¤
from working does. This pushes poor agents into criminal activities. Equation (3) assures that only
unskilled agents with the lowest level of labor endowment become criminals. Second, the wealthier an
agent, the more harmful criminal activities are for him or her and, as a consequence, the more he or she
is willing to sacri…ce in order to avoid high-crime areas. This produces a concentration of rich agents in
the safe protected neighborhoods and a concentration of poor agents in the unprotected neighborhoods.
If the wage-income share of skilled labor is high enough (i.e.,                                     U;C   is low), these residential decisions lead
to higher housing and land prices in the protected neighborhoods than in the unprotected ones. This
is consistent with ample causal evidence that crime and insecurity drive housing prices down (Ajzen-
man, Galiani, and Seira, 2015; Besley and Mueller, 2012; and Linden and Rocko¤, 2008). Equation (4)
assures that this di¤erence is neither too high, so skilled workers prefer to relocate to the unprotected
neighborhoods, nor too low, so unskilled agents prefer to relocate to the protected neighborhoods.
       Employing Lemma 1 we can compute the equilibrium utility of an agent in group i:

    Since there is only one tradable sector, there is no Stolper-Samuelson distributive issue. A higher pC =pK makes everyone
in the city better o¤. Income is higher and capital to build houses is cheaper for all agents. (QC )1 (1 K;H ) captures the
production of tradable goods.



                                                                               15
payo¤ from crime is higher, which increases the income of criminals. Second, this produces a reduction
in aggregate income in Jun , that is, the neighborhoods where criminals reside, which depresses housing
prices in Jun . Thus, criminals pay a lower rent.                m   is decreasing in     m,   but increasing in    h.   As   m
                                                                 C

increases, criminals extract more from agents in group m. The reduction in aggregate income depresses
housing prices and, hence, agents in group m pay a lower rent. This second e¤ect only partially compen-
sates agents in group m for the reduction in income. As                 h   increases, criminals extract more from agents
in group h. This does not a¤ect the income of agents in group m. The reduction in aggregate income
still depresses housing prices, which bene…ts agents in group m. For analogous reasons,                      h   is decreasing
                                                                                                             C

in    h,   but increasing in   m.   Finally,     s   is decreasing in   m   and   h.   Although agents in group s are fully
                                                 C

protected in Jp , they own all the land. As there is more crime in Jun , there is a reduction in aggregate
income in Jun , which induces a decrease in the price of land. This reduces the income of agents in group
s.


3.2        Dispersed Protection

Suppose that protection is evenly dispersed in all neighborhoods. Then, every agent in group i will be able
to retain a fraction     i   = (1     p)   i   of his or her income, regardless of residential choice. Under dispersed
                         D

protection, residential choices are simple, because there is no essential di¤erence between neighborhoods.
Since protection and, hence, crime, is evenly distributed, only housing prices play a role in residential
choices. As a consequence, agents move from one neighborhood to another until there is housing price
equalization.
     Regarding occupational choices, the same logic we described for concentrated protection also applies
here. Speci…cally, the poorer an agent is, the more incentives he or she has to become a criminal. In
equilibrium, only agents in group l choose to be criminals when 1       l    u l    l            m ) w u em ,

         Lemma 2 shows that evenly dispersed protection leads to an integrated city. The mechanism behind
this result is simple. When protection is the same in all neighborhoods, free mobility of workers and
criminals induces equalization of income per capita and housing prices among neighborhoods. If one
neighborhood has a higher income, criminals move there and workers leave the neighborhood until the
di¤erence disappears.
         Employing Lemma 2 we can compute the equilibrium utility of an agent in group i:

Second, there is a term speci…c to each group                                     i .    l   is increasing in      m,      h,   and     s .    m    is decreasing

    v is a terms-of-trade e¤ect. The higher the terms of trade, the better o¤ everyone in the city is. QC captures the
production of tradable goods, while L is the total endowment of land in the city. The higher the (QC )1 (1 K;H ) , the
higher the income of all agents. The higher the L, the lower the housing prices.


                                                                                        17
4        Regime Comparisons

This section compares several key variables under concentrated and dispersed protection. First, we study
how the protection regime a¤ects crime, aggregate income, and housing prices. Second, we consider the
utility of each group as well as aggregate welfare.


4.1        Crime

The model supports at least two di¤erent measures of crime. First, we can focus on the number and
characteristics of the criminals. Second, we can compute the value of stolen goods, that is., total plunder.
Under the assumption and conditions in Lemmas 1 and 2, regardless of the protection regime, only agents
in group l choose to become criminals. Thus, the protection regime does not change either occupational
choices or the number and characteristics of the criminals. On the contrary, the protection regime a¤ects
the value of stolen goods. Indeed, the value of stolen goods is higher under dispersed protection if and only
  P                                                      P
if i=m;h i ~ iD N i ei < 0 or, which is equivalent, i=m;h p i (1 p) s ^iD ni < 0. The intuition
behind this inequality is straightforward. Under concentrated protection, criminals extract more from
agents in groups m and h (p i ), but agents in group s are fully protected. Under dispersed protection,
criminals also extract from agents in group s ((1                   p)   s ^i   > 0). It is interesting to study when it is
                                                                            D

more likely that this inequality holds. After some simple algebra                   we can express it as follows:
                                           h                                        i
                                             1 U;C
                  P                                 + 1      K;H                      (1 p) s
                           i i                 U;C
                    i=m;h n <                                                                  s (1
                                                                                                          .             (11)
                                  p 1      1     K;H  + (1 p)                       1    K;H            )

Thus, crime, measured as the value of stolen goods, is more likely to be higher under dispersed than
concentrated protection when the wage-income share of skilled labor is higher (                       U;C   is lower)6 , when
the reduction in the e¤ectiveness of protection when the police are dispersed is lower (p is lower), when
criminals can extract more from skilled workers (               s   is higher), and when criminals can extract less from
unskilled workers (        i   is lower for i = h; m).

        See Kang (2016) for empirical evidence consistent with this result.




                                                                18
4.2   Aggregate Income

The protection regime also a¤ects aggregate income, which is higher under concentrated protection if and
        P                                              i + 1
                                                          (     )                            i + 1
                                                                                                (     ) s
only if i=m;h ~iC ~iD ni > 0, where ~iC = U;C 1 C 1 U;C = ^iC + iC and ~iD = U;C 1 D 1 U;C D                 .
                                                 U;C [    ( K;H )]                     U;C [    ( K;H ) sD ]
It is interesting to study when it is more likely that this inequality holds. After some simple algebra we
can express it as follows:
                                                                        s
                U;C   <                                  h                                              iP              .              (12)
                                                s             p                                     s            i ni
                          1    1      K;H           +        1 p   +    1        K;H   (1       )        i=m;h

Thus, aggregate income is more likely to be higher under concentrated protection when the wage-income
share of skilled labor is higher (   U;C   is lower), when the reduction in the e¤ectiveness of protection after
the police are dispersed is lower (p is lower), when criminals can extract more from skilled workers (                                  s   is
higher), and when criminals can extract less from unskilled workers (                       i   is lower for i = h; m).


4.3   Housing Prices

Housing and land prices are also a¤ected by the protection regime. In particular, pLun < pL <
                               1P       i i            1P           i i           1P         i i          i
pLp if and only if Lun            i=m;h C n < L             i=m;h ~D n < Lp           i=m;h ^C n , where ~D =
         i + 1       s                              i
   U;C D (     U;C ) D                  (1 K;H ) C +(1 U;C )
                         and ^iC = U;C                         . After some simple algebra we can express
  U;C [1    (1 K;H ) s
                     D ]                U;C [1   (1 K;H )]
it as follows:                          (P                  P                     )
                             Lun
                                                      i i
                                               i=m;h C n      i=m;h ~D
                                                                       i
                                                                           ^iC ni
                                  > max P             i i
                                                          ;     P         i i
                                                                                    .                       (13)
                               L               i=m;h ~D n          i=m;h ~D n

Thus, if equation (13) holds, a move from concentrated to dispersed protection will increase housing
prices in Jun and reduce housing prices in Jp . Moreover, this condition is more likely to be satis…ed the
higher the wage-income share of skilled labor (               U;C   is lower).

   The following proposition summarizes the results.

Proposition 1 Under the assumptions and conditions in Lemmas 1 and 2.

  1. Crime is lower under concentrated protection if and only if equation (11) holds. Moreover, equation
      (11) is more likely to be satis…ed the higher the wage-income share of skilled labor (                                U;C   is lower),
      the lower p, the more criminals can extract from skilled workers (                    s   is higher), and the less criminals
      can extract from unskilled workers (          i   is lower for i = h; m).

                                                                   19
  2. Aggregate income is higher under concentrated protection if and only if equation (12) holds.
      Moreover, equation (12) is more likely to be satis…ed the higher wage-income share of skilled labor
      (         is lower), the lower p, the more criminals can extract from skilled workers (   s   is higher) and
          U;C

      the less criminals can extract from unskilled workers (     i   is lower for i = h; m).

  3. Housing prices under dispersed protection are between housing prices in unprotected neighborhoods
      and protected neighborhoods under concentrated protection (pLun < pL < pLp ) if and only if equation
      (13) holds. Moreover, equation (13)is more likely to be satis…ed the higher the wage-income share
      of skilled labor (   U;C   is lower). Proof: See Online Appendix.

   The intuition behind Proposition 1 is as follows: Under concentrated protection, skilled agents are
fully protected and the rest of the agents are not protected at all. Housing is expensive for those
protected and cheap for those not protected. Under dispersed protection, all groups get the same level
of protection. This means that previously protected agents (i.e., skilled workers) now get less protection
and previously unprotected workers (i.e., unskilled workers) now receive more protection. The e¤ects
on crime and aggregate income are ambiguous because under dispersed protection, criminals can extract
less from unskilled workers, but they can also rob skilled workers. Income inequality and, in particular,
the wage-income share of skilled labor, plays a key role. When the wage-income share of skilled labor
is high, it is more likely that crime is lower and income is higher under concentrated protection. In
other words, dispersing the police is likely to produce an increase in crime and a reduction in aggregate
income in an unequal society, and the opposite e¤ects in a more equalitarian one. Housing prices are also
a¤ected by the protection regime. Dispersing the police will induce convergence in the housing prices in
both neighborhoods. Thus, housing prices will decrease for previously protected workers and increase for
previously unprotected workers.


4.4   Welfare

From a normative point of view we can study which protection regime is better. First, we explore
the distributive e¤ects associated with a change in the protection regime. Second, we compare aggregate
welfare under both regimes. As a benchmark we assume a utilitarian welfare function. Formally, aggregate

   Part 1 of Proposition 2 con…rms that a change in the protection regime will tend to generate winners
and losers. Under concentrated protection, skilled agents enjoy full protection and unskilled agents are
completely unprotected. Under dispersed protection, all agents enjoy the same intermediate level of pro-
tection. The changes in the protection levels a¤ect the income of each group. Criminals can extract more
from unskilled workers under concentrated protection, but they cannot target skilled workers. Unskilled
workers are better protected under dispersed protection, while skilled workers are better protected under
concentrated protection. The changes in the protection levels also a¤ect housing prices. For example, if
equation (13) holds, criminals and unskilled workers pay higher housing prices under dispersed protection,
while skilled workers pay higher housing prices under concentrated protection. Moreover, the variation
in the income of a group responds to the change in the protection level, while the variation in housing
prices responds to the change in aggregate income. Therefore, for one group the e¤ect on income may
dominate the e¤ect on housing prices, while for another group the opposite happens.

                                                                             21
          Part 2 of Proposition 2 puts some order to the type of distributive e¤ects induced by a change in
the protection regime. At least one group of unskilled agents is better o¤ under dispersed than under
concentrated protection. This, however, does not necessarily mean that all unskilled agents unanimously
prefer dispersed protection. The reason is that dispersing the police could produce a signi…cant increase
in the housing prices paid by unskilled workers, which dominate the increase in their incomes. Part
2 of Proposition 2 also implies that preferences for concentrated and dispersed protection may not be
monotonic with respect to income. This suggests that there is room for atypical political coalitions made
up of poor and rich agents. Figure 1 illustrates this point for di¤erent values of p (Figure 1.a) and                                                                                                                                                                                 (Figure

          Part 3 of Proposition 2 shows that aggregate welfare is higher under concentrated protection for an
unequal society, while the opposite is true for an equalitarian one. Figure 1.c illustrates this point. The
intuition behind this result is simple. When skilled agents represent an important share of aggregate in-
come, aggregate welfare is higher when they are well protected. This suggests that unequal societies could
face a di¢ cult dilemma. The welfare-maximizing protection regime (i.e., concentrated protection) makes

          For the numerical example we consider the following values for the parameters of the model: (1) population shares:
N = 0:35, N m = 0:5, N h = 0:1, and N s = 0:05; (2) labor endowments: el = 1, em = 3, eh = 7, and es = 10; (3) preferences:
  l


  = 0:5; (4) production functions:                                                   U;C   = 0:5 (for Figure 1.a), and                                                       K;H    = 0:5; (5) prices of tradable goods: pC = 1, and
                                                       l                 m                        h                                   s

society even more unequal. On the other hand, in more equalitarian societies, the welfare-maximizing
protection regime (i.e., dispersed protection) will reduce social disparities.


4.5     Compensations

A solution to these problematic distributive e¤ects is to provide proper compensation. Suppose that
concentrated protection maximizes aggregate welfare, but the government is particularly concerned about
the impact of this regime on poor agents. Indeed, from Part 2 of Proposition 2 we know that concentrated
protection induces a lower payo¤ than dispersed protection for unskilled agents. However, the government
can compensate the losers by paying subsidies …nanced with taxes on the winners. Let pC                                  i   be the transfer
                                                                                                                         f

received/paid by each agent in group i. Then, the government budget constraint is:

                                                              P          i  i
                                                                  i2I    fN     = 0.                                                   (15)

In the Online Appendix we characterize the equilibrium under concentrated protection when the govern-
ment provides compensation. Equations (3) and (4), as well as equations (5) and (6) for equilibrium land
prices, must be modi…ed, but the segregated city equilibrium persists. We also compute the transfers that
the government must provide in order to make each unskilled agent equally well-o¤ between concentrated
and dispersed protection. Formally,                 l ; m; h            is the solution to the following system of equations:

   There are several interesting features about equations (16)-(18). First, with no transfers, unskilled
agents are better o¤ under dispersed than concentrated protection (Part 2 of Proposition 2). Therefore,


                                                                         23

it must be the case that       i=l;m;h> 0, which means that skilled agents must be taxed. In fact,
                                         f
                                                                              P
from the government budget constraint in equation (15), we have sf = (N s ) 1 i=l;m;h if N i < 0.
Second, compensation must take into account the impact of the protection regime on incomes (…rst
squared bracket on the left-hand side of each equation) and housing prices (second squared bracket on
the left-hand side of each equation). Moreover, while the e¤ects on housing prices are the same for all
socioeconomic groups, the e¤ects on incomes di¤er. Finally, note that compensations are interrelated
and cannot be computed separately. The reason is that general equilibrium e¤ects matter. As one group
receives a higher transfer, the aggregate income of unprotected neighborhoods increases, which leads to
higher housing prices for all unskilled agents (see the denominator of       l ; m; h   ). A higher transfer
                                                                             f   f  f

for groups m and h also a¤ects the payo¤ for criminals (see the …rst squared bracket in equation (16)).


5    Private Protection

Previous empirical work has shown that when crime levels are high, rich agents buy private security to
protect themselves. For example, Di Tella, Galiani, and Schargrodsky (2010) and Levitt (1999) show
that the rich, unlike the poor, are able to protect their homes by hiring security services and/or installing
security devices. This enables them to avoid being robbed as much as they would be if they were not be
able to self-protect. This section extends the model to include private protection. The main motivation
is to explore the robustness of the segregated and integrated city equilibria when agents have access to
private security. We treat private protection as a club good complement with public protection in the
sense that it requires public protection to be e¤ective.
    Consider the model in Section 2, but assume that there is a technology to build protected areas.
In particular, suppose that developers can combine l units of adjacent land in neighborhood j with
k (l) =A (pj ) units of capital and obtain l units of fully protected land, where A (0) = 0 and A (pj ) is
increasing in pj . Whoever resides in a house built on protected land is not a¤ected by criminals. The
                                                                                               pK k(l)
average cost of developing l units of fully protected land in neighborhood j is C (l) =        A(pj )l   + pL;j ,
where pL;j is the price of land without any security investments. Assume that k (l) =l has a minimum
at lmin > 0, and let cmin = k (lmin ) =lmin . Then, if there is free entry, developers will keep converting
land into protected areas until, in equilibrium, the price of a unit of land in a fully protected area is



                                                     24
            pK cmin
pLp ;j =     A(pj )   + pL;j . Moreover, each of these developments will contain lmin units of land.8 Also note
that, since A (pj ) is increasing in pj , pLp ;j is decreasing in pj , that is, developing a fully protected unit
of land is cheaper in a neighborhood with higher public protection. In other words, private and public
protection are complements.
       It is simple to prove that private security will not emerge when public protection is concentrated. If a
neighborhood is fully protected by the police, no agent will be willing to pay higher housing prices to cover
the extra costs of private protection because there is no gain from extra protection. If a neighborhood
is not protected by the police, the cost of private security is prohibitive. Thus, when police protection is
concentrated, the segregated city equilibrium characterized in Lemma 1 persists even when agents have
access to private security.
       On the contrary, when police protection is evenly deployed across the city, private protection can a¤ect
the integrated equilibrium described in Lemma 2. As the following lemma formally shows, under proper
conditions, skilled agents prefer to reside in fully protected areas with private and public protection, while
unskilled agents are not willing to pay the high housing prices in those areas. Thus, private security may
restore a segregated city equilibrium in which rich agents reside in safe areas, while crime is concentrated
in poor neighborhoods.

Lemma 3 Private Protection. Suppose that agents have access to private protection.

   1. If police protection is concentrated, private protection has no e¤ ect on the equilibrium, that is,
         Lemma 1 applies.

   2. Suppose that police protection is evenly distributed in all neighborhoods and Assumption 1 holds.
   8
       If we assume an integer number of symmetric developers, free entry will not necesarilly lead to zero pro…ts. A simple
way to solve this problem is to assume that one developer has a cost curve with a ‡at range from lmin to lmin + 1. Under
                                                                                                                     pK cmin
free entry, this developer will convert l 2 [lmin ; lmin + 1] units of land into protected areas at a unit cost of    A(pj )
                                                                                                                               + pL;j .
If the zero pro…t condition induces a non-integer number of symmetric developers, the developer with the ‡at range in the
cost curve will absorb the di¤erence.

       (b) Suppose that cmin > cs . Then private protection has no e¤ ect on the equilibrium, that is,
            Lemma 2 applies. Proof: See Online Appendix.

   Lemma 3 suggests that dispersing the police force could not be enough to equalize criminal activities
across the city. If ch < cmin < cs , even when public protection is evenly dispersed in the city, skilled agents
will use private protection to endogenously isolate themselves in fully protected areas. Unskilled workers
will …nd housing prices in those areas too expensive and, hence, they will reside in areas with cheaper
housing, but more crime. Of course, this might not be the case if skilled agents …nd private protection
too expensive. Indeed, when cmin > cs , agents in group s are not willing to reside in a neighborhood with
private protection. Therefore, there is no private protection and the dispersed equilibrium persists.
   In Lemma 3, we have focused on a situation where only agents in group s have an incentive to buy
private security. This could be easily relaxed. If cmin < ch , then at least some unskilled agents also
prefer to reside in a neighborhood with private protection. As a consequence, the areas with private
protection will expand and, provided that there are some unskilled agents who are not willing to buy


                                                                     26
private protection, there will be a segregated equilibrium with safe areas with public and private security
populated by rich agents and poor areas with higher crime rates and only protected by public security.


6    A Continuum of Agent Types and Occupational Choices

Previous sections have focused on a region of the parameter space in which the protection regime does not
change occupational choices. It is possible to extend the analysis of the model with four socioeconomic
groups to study regions in which the change in the protection strategy induces agents in group m to
modify their occupational choices. However, it is more natural to attack this problem in a model with
a continuum of agent types, where any change in the payo¤s of legal versus illegal activities induces a
change in the marginal agent. Furthermore, it is easier to incorporate some extensions in the model with
a continuum of agent types. In particular, we can introduce almost any distribution of labor endowments,
allow for more general ownership structures of land, and allow for criminals to distribute their plunder
unevenly. Unfortunately, the model with a continuum of agent types has one important disadvantage.
Although we can summarize the equilibrium in a few equations, we need numerical solutions to obtain a
full characterization of the equilibrium.
    Consider a city integrated by a set of neighborhoods J, each with a …xed quantity of land Lj and
        P
let L = j2J Lj . The city is a small open economy populated by a continuum of agents. Each agent
has labor endowment e 2 eL ; eH , with 0 < eL < eH . The cumulative distribution function of e is
F (e), which has a continuous density f (e) > 0 for all e. Some agents also own land. In particular, let
sL (e) be the share of Lj owned by agent e. Assume that sL (e) = 0 for e < e, sL (e) > 0 for e    e,
                R eH
s0L (e)  0 and e sL (e) f (e) de = 1. Labor is employed in the production of a tradable consumption
good, whose production function is QC = N and whose price is exogenously given by pC = pC > 0.
Thus, the wage rate is w = pC . Land and imported capital are used to build houses. The production
                                         1   K;H
function is QH;j = (KH;j )    K;H   Lj             , where KH;j stands for capital used in the construction of
houses in neighborhood j. The price of capital is exogenously given by pK = pK > 0. Thus, the demand
of capital (KH;j ), the price of houses (pH;j ), and the supply of houses (QH;j ) in each neighborhood
                                                                                K;H                    1   K;H
are given by KH;j = pL;j Lj      K;H =pK     1      K;H   , pH;j = pK =   K;H         pL;j = 1   K;H             and
pH;j QH;j = pL;j Lj = 1    K;H    , respectively, where pL;j is the price of land.



                                                           27
      Each agent has a residential and an occupational choice. r (e) 2 J is the residential choice of agent
e, where r (e) = j indicates that agent e decides to reside in neighborhood j. o (e) 2 fw; b1 ; :::; bJ g is the
occupational choice of agent e, where o (e) = w indicates that e is a worker and o (e) = bj that e is a
criminal who operates in neighborhood j. Let N (o; j) = e 2 eL ; eH : o (e) = o and r (e) = j                                      be the
set of agents who choose occupation o and reside in j and N (o) = e 2 eL ; eH : o (e) = o be the set
of agents who choose occupation o.9 Criminals extract income from workers. Let                                j   : eL ; eH ! [0; 1]
indicate for each agent e 2 eL ; eH the fraction of e’s income that criminals will extract if e resides in
neighborhood j and chooses to be a worker.                 j   is partially given by technology and partially determined
by the government. In particular, assume that                    j   (e) = (1    pj ) (e), where      (e) is the fraction of e’s
income extracted by criminals when the government does not intervene, and pj represents the protection
strategy chosen by the government. The government selects one of the following protection strategies:
under concentrated protection pj = 1 for j 2 Jp and pj = 0 for j 2 Jun = J                                    Jp , under dispersed
protection pj = p < 1 for all j 2 J.
      Let y e (o (e) ; r (e)) indicate the income of agent e when he or she selects (o (e) ; r (e)). If e becomes a
worker and resides in j, then

The term in brackets is total plunder in neighborhood j (note that (1                           ) 2 (0; 1) of it is lost), while
 (e) captures how criminals operating in neighborhood j distribute the plunder. A fraction                                      2 [0; 1] is
distributed evenly among criminals. The rest depends on the labor endowment of the criminal relative
to the average labor endowment of all criminals. Thus, better endowed criminals get a higher share of
the total plunder.
      Regardless of how they obtain their income, agents demand housing services and consumption goods.
                                                                                                     her(e)        cer(e)   1

her(e) is housing services and cer(e) is consumption. The budget constraint of agent e is pH;r(e) her(e) +
pC cer(e) = y e (o (e) ; r (e)). Finally, we introduce the following assumption:

      Assumption 1.C.                (e) and    (e) = e [1    (1   pj ) (e)] are strictly increasing functions of e. That
is, the better endowed an agent is, the more vulnerable he or she is to criminal activities. However, this
is not enough to a¤ ect the income ranking of agents.

Proof: See Online Appendix.

   Lemma 4 simply states that when protection is concentrated, the city is segregated. Only very poor
agents become criminals. Poor agents (criminals and workers) locate in high-crime neighborhoods with
low housing prices (Jun ), while rich agents locate in safe neighborhoods with high housing prices (Jp ).
There are two marginal agents. The agent with labor endowment ew
                                                               C is indi¤erent between becoming a

criminal who operates in the unprotected area or being a worker. The agent with labor endowment eun

is indi¤erent between residing in the protected and the unprotected area.

Moreover, if e 1     j   (e) = (e) is increasing in e, then the two ways of measuring crime will induce the
same comparison. If crime is higher under concentrated than dispersed protection according to one crime
statistic, the same will be true for the other. Note also that, in order to compare aggregate income,
housing prices and aggregate welfare under concentrated and dispersed protection we only need ew

infer welfare changes.


7     Conclusions

This paper has developed a general equilibrium model of the geographic distribution of crime in an urban
area. In order to characterize the equilibrium we have repeatedly applied the notion of spatial equilibrium.
This implies that the equilibrium geographic distribution of legal and illegal activities must be such that
there are no gains from changing their location. We have employed the model to study police deployment
strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the …rst to analytically explore the consequences
of police deployment strategies on the endogenous formation of urban spatial equilibrium and crime. Our
formal general equilibrium approach model is pertinent because a change in the geographic distribution
of police protection induces long-run general equilibrium e¤ects on occupational and residential choices,
the location of criminal activities, and housing prices. Indeed, our model revealed two channels through
which the spatial allocation of police protection a¤ects individuals. First, it changes the intensity and
location of crime, thus a¤ecting the income of each agent. Second, it changes housing prices.
    In particular, this paper has examined two opposite police deployment strategies: concentrated public
protection (the police only protect a certain area of the city), and dispersed public protection (the police
are evenly deployed across the entire the city). We have shown that, in equilibrium, concentrated public


                                                     32
protection leads to a segregated city. The rich, who are more willing to pay for protection, reside in
protected areas with high housing prices. The poor reside in unprotected high-crime areas with low
housing prices. Conversely, dispersed public protection leads to an integrated city, with all areas of the
city having the same income per capita and crime levels. We have also compared these two equilibria
and shown that crime tends to be higher under dispersed than concentrated public protection when
inequality is high, dispersing the police force signi…cantly reduces its e¤ectiveness, and the proportion of
income that criminals extract from the rich (poor) is high (low). We have also shown that in very unequal
societies concentrated public protection is likely to produce higher aggregate welfare but exacerbate social
disparities. Fortunately, there is a set of taxes and subsidies that the policymaker can use to avoid the
unfair distributive e¤ects associated with concentrated public protection. Thus, instead of dispersing the
police, taxing the rich and properly redistributing the proceeds to the group made worse o¤ by police
concentration has the potential to e¢ ciently equalize the cost of crime in society. Moreover, we have
shown that dispersing the police might not necessarily produce an integrated city when private security
is available. If private security is a club good, rich agents have incentives to isolate themselves in closed
residential areas.
   Besides private security, there are several other directions in which our model can be extended. For
example, it is reasonable to assume that the geographic distribution of protection could a¤ect schooling
decisions, particularly for poor agents. One way to capture this interaction is to imbed our model in a
dynamic human capital formation model. We conjecture that in this setting dispersed protection is more
likely to produce higher aggregate welfare than in our model. The reason is that dispersed protection
would promote schooling among poor agents without signi…cantly a¤ecting schooling among rich agents.
   Our model also suggests new paths for empirical work on the economics of crime and law enforcement.
For example, we have a very limited understanding of the e¤ectiveness of more concentrated versus more
dispersed allocations of police forces. Some work on this issue has been done related to the literature on
hot spots (Weisburd, Gro¤, and Yang, 2012). The next empirical step would be a consistent estimation of
the parameters of the production function of security across locations. Our model provides a theoretical
framework for such an estimation.
   Finally, our model points to some interesting policy recommendations. The literature on crime hot
spots has found evidence that they tend to be quite stable over time, which suggests concentrating


                                                     33
police e¤orts on those hot areas. Our results indicate that one needs to be cautious about such law
enforcement strategies. For example, in our model, ceteris paribus the total area protected, changing the
neighborhoods in which the police are concentrated only switches the entire con…guration of the spatial
equilibrium, with no long-run e¤ect on crime and welfare. The new protected neighborhoods become
rich safe heavens, while the previously prosperous neighborhoods now left unprotected become the new
criminal hot spots. Moreover, our model does not take into account any transition costs, which could
easily make this policy a welfare-reducing one. At a minimum, our model suggests that when we consider
changes in the geographic distribution of police forces, we need to take into account the e¤ects on housing
prices and on reallocation of the population, as well as the overall e¤ect on crime in the entire city (see
Jaitman and Ajzenman, 2016, for evidence of these e¤ects in Montevideo, Uruguay).

Online Appendix to “Stirring Up a Hornets’Nest: Geographic Distri-
bution of Crime”

This appendix proves all the lemmas and propositions outlined in the main text.
     Proof of Lemma 1. Suppose that protection is concentrated. Assume that os = w and rs 2 Jp .
Then, in equilibrium, N s (w; j) = Lj =Lp N s and pH;j = pHp for j 2 Jp . Otherwise, some agents in s
prefer to change their residence to a neighborhood in Jp with lower pH;j . Let Bun = fbj 2 O : j 2 Jun g
and assume that ol 2 Bun , oi = w for i 2 fm; hg, and ri 2 Jun for i 2 fl; m; hg. Then, in equilibrium,
                                                                       P
N h (w; j) = Lj =Lun N h , N m (w; j) = Lj =Lun N m , N l (bj ; Jun ) = h2Jun N l (bj ; h) = N l (Bun ; j) =
P          l                    l
  h2Jun N (bh ; j) = Lj =Lun N , and pH;j = pHun for j 2 Jun . Otherwise, some agents in i 2 fl; m; hg

prefer to change their residence to a neighborhood in Jun with lower pH;j , some agents in group i 2 fm; hg
prefer to move to a neighborhood in Jun with lower crime, or some agents in group l prefer to change
their criminal activities to a neighborhood in Jun with higher income per criminal.
                                                            P         i i           s s
    Given these occupational choices we have UC =              i=m;h N e , SC = N e , and QC                                                         =

w s = pC 1              U;C    (UC =SC )     U;C   , where pC > 0. Moreover, incomes are given by: y l (bh ; j) = y l =

                                                                         P
 1      h     wu eh for j 2 Jun , and y s (w; j) = y s = ws es + (N s ) 1 j2J pL;j Lj for j 2 Jp .
     From pro…t maximization in industry H,                                        KH;j     =         K;H pL;j Lj =   1     K;H    pK ,     pH;j     =

 pK =   K;H             pL;j = 1          K;H                  , and pH;j QH;j = pL;j Lj = 1                  K;H   , where pK > 0 is the price
of capital. Since pH;j = pHp for j 2 Jp and pH;j = pHun for j 2 Jun , it must be the case that pL;j = pLp for
                                                 P                         P

are pHun = pK =         K;H          pLun =1      K;H                and pHp = pK =                K;H         pLp = 1    K;H              .
Thus, pHp > pHun if and only if pLp > pLun .
       Finally, it still has to be checked that no agent has an incentive to select the occupation and/or
residence selected by an agent in a di¤erent group. The indirect utility of an agent in group i who selects

would get no income. They prefer to reside in Jun rather than in Jp provided that pLp > pLun . They prefer

N l (B; j) = h2J N l (bh ; j) = Lj =L N l , N i (w; j) = Lj =L N i for i 2 fm; h; sg, and pH;j = pH for

pH;j , some agents in group i 2 fm; h; sg prefer to move to a neighborhood with lower crime, or some
agents in group l prefer to change their criminal activities to a neighborhood with higher income per
criminal.

       We are implicitly assuming that if a skilled worker decides to become a criminal, he or she keeps his/her land holdings.

                                                   Lun              (1    K;H        )                     Lp         (1     K;H     )

     Next, we prove that there exists a threshold for 1                                                   U;C     =    U;C     such that WC < WD if and only if
 1      U;C   =   U;C   is below it.
     Step 1. First, we prove that equations (3), (4) and (8) impose an upper bound on 1                                                                                           U;C      =   U;C .

      Let         H   = min               H;    H    . Then, combining Steps 1, 2, and 3 we have proved that if                                                                                    L   <     <    H

   Proof of Lemma 3.
   Part 1. Suppose that police protection is concentrated in neighborhoods Jp . Then, pj = 1 and                                                         i   =0
                                                                                                                                                         j

for j 2 Jp and pj = 0 and                 i   =     i   for j 2 Jun . For j 2 Jun we have A (0) = 1 and, hence, pLp ;j = 1.
                                          j

Thus, no agent can a¤ord an area with private protection in j 2 Jun . For j 2 Jp we have A (pj ) = A (1)
and, hence, pLp ;j = pK cmin =A (1) + pL;j . However, no agent who decides to reside in j 2 Jp will be willing
to pay for private protection because he or she is already fully protected.
   Part 2. Suppose that police protection is evenly distributed in all neighborhoods. Then,                                                                  i   =
                                                                                                                                                             j
 i (1   p) for j 2 J. In equilibrium the prices of land with and without security investment (pL ; pLp ) must
be the same everywhere. Otherwise, agents will move to neighborhoods with lower land prices. Let Lp be
the supply of fully protected land. If pLp < pK cmin =A (p) + pL , then Lp = 0. If pLp = pK cmin =A (p) + pL ,



                                                                                      47
developers will elastically supply fully protected areas each with lmin units of adjacent land. Next we
consider two possible cases.
   Part 2a. Suppose that agents in group l are criminals, agents in groups l, m, and h reside in areas
without private security, and agents in group s reside in fully protected areas with private security. Then,
following the same procedure we use in the proof of Lemma 1, housing market clearing conditions become:

pL and pLp   are connected by pLp = pK cmin =A (p) + pL . Employing these three expressions we obtain the

Solving this quadratic equation we have Lp =                           2a      .         Note that b2 > 4ac,                    2a        > 0, but

Introducing Lp into the housing market clearing conditions we obtain pL and pLp :

   For this solution to be an equilibrium we must verify that no agent prefers to change his or her
occupational or residential choice. Regarding residence, there are no incentives to move if and only if

     Nl     i=m;h (1 p) i N i ei < [1 m (1  p)] em , implies that only agents in group l prefer to become
criminals. This completes the proof of Part 2a.

      Part 2b. Suppose that Lp <                                            L, or which is equivalent, cmin > cs . Then agents in group s are not
willing to reside in a neighborhood with private protection. Therefore, there is no private protection and
the dispersed equilibrium persists.
