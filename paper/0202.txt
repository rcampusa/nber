   Why Has the U.S. Divorce Rate Doubled Within the Decade?


    This paper seeks to explain the recent rise in U.S. divorce

rates using an economic framework. Annual time series data from

1920 to 1974 are used in the empirical analysis. The estimated

equation tracks the actual series quite well. Itattributes the

recent increase in divorce to improved contraceptive technology,

reduced average duration of marriage (resulting from the age dis—

tribution of the population) and income growth. Projections sug-

gest a flattening of the divorce rate series in the near future.




           Anatomy of the Divorce Rate: 1960—1974



     This paper uses Vital Statistics data from the Divorce Reg-

istration Area to decompose into age—specific components the rise

in the aggregate divorce rate between 1960 and 1974. While women

in their 20's comprise only about 20 percent of the married pop-

ulation, they appear to have contributed over 60 percent of the

decade growth in the divorce rate.

Introduction

     The motivation for this paper is to understand the causes of the

recent rise in the U.S. divorce rate. Figure 1 shows the time series of

annual divorce rates (number of divorces per 1000 married women age 15 and

over) since 1920 with decennial estimates back to 1890. The series ex-

hibits an upward trend with three substantial disruptions: a short episode

during the Great Depression, a sharp rise during and immediately following

World War II, and an extended upswing in the most recent seven years. One

can readily offer single ad hoc explanations for the first two of

these disruptions from the long—term trend, but the cause of the current

rise is less apparent. This recent upswing is exceptional by historical

standards but is not unique to the U.S. The recent doubling of the U.S.

divorce rate represents a major demographic phenomenon for which no ex-

planation and little analysis has yet appeared. As a divorce is in some

respects analogous to a job separation or to a dissolution of any long—

term contract, an economic perspective is employed in a demographic con-

text in seeking an explanation for the rise in divorce.

I.   Analytical Issues

     Recent economic analyses of marriage and cross—sectional divorce

provide the context for this multivariate analysis of the U.S. aggregate

divorce rate.1 Marriages may be made in heaven but are assumed to be

negotiated in competitive markets in which each partner settles for the

best he or she can do, given the available choices which are limited by

the competition of others and the costs involved in searching more thor-

oughly. Divorces result when those negotiated marriage contracts appear

no longer to represent the expected best alternative marital circumstance

even in light of the costs of dissolution and perhaps recontracting.

    The economic literature on marriage suggests at least three forces

which affect the gains from a marriage; the smaller those gains the greater

the likelihood of divorce.      (1) The level of the family's income (in par-

ticular the income of the primary worker) is expected to be negatively

related to divorce, as the marriage gains are positively related to the

level of resources.    (2) The relative wage rate of the secondary worker,

or the labor force attachment of the secondary worker, is expected to be

positively related to divorce, as the gains from specialization within the

marriage decline with increases in the secondary worker's labor market

attachment.     (3) The similarity between spouses in traits or character-

istics used jointly in marital activities is expected to be negatively

related to divorce, as these traits are technical complements in non—

market production and are thus positively related to the gains from

marriage.

     Cross—sectional divorce studies tend to confirm all three of these

forces,2 and introduce two other forces which influence divorce.        (4) Un-

expected events are maritally destabilizing (e.g., unexpectedly high or

low income, severe episodes of unemployment, fertility impairment, and

health changes appear to increase the likelihood of divorce). (5) If we

conceive of family—produced capital jointly owned by the spouses and

having greater value in the marriage in which it is produced than else-

where ——    marital—specific   capital ——   then the stock of such capital at any
duration of marriage will be negatively related to the probability of

divorce, with causation running in both directions. Own—children are the

most prevalent example of such capital.

     The analogue to job separation is very clear here. The first three

forces are related to the general adequacy of the match; the better that
                                   —3—


matching the less likely any random perturbation will render that marriage

(or that job) no longer desirable. The fourth implies that for any given

quality of the match, the bigger a random shock to the system the more

likely the match will no longer be desirable. The fifth factor is com-

parable to job—specific human capital that represents an additional cap-

ital loss from dissolving the match.

    The application of many of these cross—sectional results to aggregate

time series is quite straightforward. Increases in women's labor force

participation rates, unanticipated increases in unemployment rates, de-

creases in number of children in the family, and any phenomenon which

might result in less well—matched couples should increase the aggregate

divorce rate.3 In the case of other variables, notably those which oper-

ate through the marriage market, analytical modifications are required in

dealing with aggregate time series data.

     Consider the effect of males' income on the gain from marriage. In

the cross section an increase in one man's income has two effects on his

expected gains from marriage: it raises the gain from marriage to any

partner via complementarity of his income with other resources and it

increases his relative attractiveness in the marriage market, which im-

proves his chances of securing a relatively better mate. In the aggregate,

however, only the first of these two forces operates; if all men's incomes

rise there is no improvement in the relative attractiveness of any one

man, hence no resorting. Since the differential sorting effect by income

is not present in the aggregate time series, the gains from marriage should

not rise with income as much in aggregate time series as in the disaggre-

gate cross section data. Hence the negative effect of husbands' income

on divorce in the cross section should be weaker in the time series.
                                      —4—


        There are two other reasons the effect of husbands' income may not

be strongly negatively related to the likelihood of divorce In aggregate

time series data. First, cross sectional findings suggest the relation-

ship between income and the likelihood of divorce is nonlinear ——   steeply
negative at low Income levels, rather flat at middle income levels and

even positive at very high income levels [see Becker, Landes, Michael

(1977)]. As changes in aggregate time series income reflect changes in

average income a relatively weak relationship with divorce may be expected.

Second, to the extent time series income fluctuations reflect transitory

income, they may represent little or no impact on the expected gains from

marriage.

        Another aggregation issue involves the fact that the likelihood of

divorce typically declines with duration of marriage. There is consider-

able evidence from cross—sectional studies that various factors such as

age at marriage affect divorce rates differently at different durations

of marriage. In the cross section one can remove the complicating influence

of duration by decomposition. In time series data one has only the mean or

median marriage duration for standardization and it may be that critical

interactions involve other moments of the distribution of marriage dura-

tion.

        In addition to differences between the cross section and the time

series due to aggregation there are, of course, factors which change

over time that are fixed in the cross section. One such factor is business

cycle fluctuations encompassed in such variables as income and unemploy-

ment as discussed above. A second additional time series factor is war.

In a time series study of divorce it seems inappropriate to omit war years,

as is frequently done In other time series analyses. This variable, say
                                     —5—


measured as the percent of adults in military service, surely merits atten—
                                                                               J
tion   in the past fifty—year perspective and perhaps in the past twenty

years as well. Admittedly, the emphasis on this phenomenon is prompted

by the obvious empirical relationship between the divorce rate and the war

years, so the purity of hypothesis testing in this regard is questionable.

However, it seems clear on a priori grounds that a military manpower

variable should be negatively related to the gains from the current

marriage for at least four reasons. (1) Many marriages during wartime are

initiated relatively quickly prior to entering service (perhaps prompted

by military pay supplements for spouses) or relatively quickly in order to

avoid service as in the 1960's. These marriages which resulted from less

marital search presumably result in less well—matched pairs and hence in

relatively low gains from marriage; thus they should exhibit higher rates

of divorce. (2) Among existing marriages, wartime military service is

typically an unexpected event, and such events are generally maritally de-

stabilizing. (3) The separation of spouses itself is maritally destabil-

izing as associations weaken and other ties are more likely to form ——

greater   depreciation of and less new investment in spouse—specific capital

lowers the capital loss involved in divorce. (4) The imposed mobility and

the increase in the size and the sex imbalance in the pooi of unmarried

persons resulting from war tend to raise the probability that a relatively

attractive mate might be encountered, which further raises the probability

of divorce.

       An additional time series influence is technological change, of which

the most important aspect in the present context is technological change

in fertility control. The oral contraceptive, first patented in 1955 and

first marketed in the U.S. in 1960, followed by the medical acceptance of
                                   —6—



the IUD after l962 represented an abrupt and sizable change in the

efficacy of available contraception. Two quite different observations

provide convincing evidence that couples faced a very different circum-

stance related to fertility control in the post—pill era than they faced

prior to 1960. First, estimates of the actual use—effectiveness of con-

traceptive techniques imply huge differences between the pill—IUD technol-

ogy and the pre—pill methods. Briefly, the probability of a pregnancy in

ten years when using rhythm, foam or jelly, condom or diaphragm, hiD, or

pill is .98, .88, .77, .22, and .09 respectively.5

     Second, evidence on actual fertility outcomes, when measured by, say,

the conditional probability of a birth for women with six children at a

given age showed essentially no change from 1930 to 1960 despite the large

fluctuation in actual fertility over this period. But this measure of

fertility plummeted in the 'years following l96 (see Table 1). Likewise,

Sanderson's extensive study of birth probabilities isolated year—specific

effects (removing, cohort and age effects). For higher—order births, the

year effect was essentially nonexistent until 1960 after which the year

effect was very pronounced (again, see Table 1). The use—effectiveness

data and these year—specific fertility indicators for high—order births

imply that a major change in fertility control occurred in the 1960's.

     These changes in contraceptive technology in the early 1960's were

followed by further medical improvements in fertility control through

changes in male and female sterilization procedures and by legal changes

governing elective abortions. Students of contraceptive behavior argue

convincingly that the past fifteen years deserve to be considered a period

of "contraceptive revolution" [see Westoff and Ryder (1977)]. Given that

such a revolution has taken place, why should it be expected to affect the

divorce rate? Three reasons are suggested here, and because of the

importance of this factor in the empirical estimation below, these three

reasons are discussed at length. First, improved fertility control

lowers actual fertility which tends to raise the rate of divorce.6 In

cross—sectional studies of divorce there is statistical evidence of the

commonly held belief that the presence of children, In particular young
                              7
children, inhibits divorce.       Table 2 shows the implied partial effects

of the first and second young child on the divorce probability over two

successive five years of marriage in one recent study. The presence of

a young child in the household is estimated to lower the likelihood of

divorce in these intervals by roughly 30 percent; a reduction from two to

one child is associated with a roughly 50 percent rise in the likelihood

of divorce.


     While the decline in fertility since 1960 cannot be attributed exclu-

sively to improved contraception, surely some part of the decline is re-

lated to the introduction of the pill and the medical acceptance of the IUD.

Despite reservations expressed at earlier dates [e.g., Ryder (1972) pp. 237—

239], Westoff and Ryder (1977) conclude on the basis of their extensive

analysis of contraception and fertility behavior through the l960!s that:

"the entire decline in births within marriage across the decade of the

1960's can be attributed to the improvement In the control of fertility"

(p. 340) which "is no doubt attributable in large measure to the advent
                                   —8—


and wide diffusion of a new, highly effective birth control technology,

particularly the pill and the intrauterine devicet' (p. 308). The total

marital fertility rate in the U.S. fell from 1961 to 1974 from 3.42 children

per married woman to 1.63, a decline of 1.79 children [see Gibson (1976)].

If, say, sixty percent of that reduction is attributable to the changed

contraceptive technology, that one fewer child may have resulted in a sub-

stantially higher likelihood of divorce, if the findings characterized in

Table 2 are indicative of that effect.

     A second reason contraceptive technology may affect divorce behavior

involves a more indirect but not necessarily less powerful channel of

influence: it reduces uncertainty about subsequent fertility, which in

turn alters household investment behavior in a manner which raises the like—

lihood of divorce. With imperfect fertility control, young couples face

considerable uncertainty about their subsequent fertility. The amount of

this uncertainty is not trivial and its relation to contraceptive behavior

can be illustrated with findings from a study using the 1965 National Fer-

tility Survey. Partitioning the sample of women into groups deemed to have

had similar fertility intentions, women who used relatively effective con-

traception had a much smaller likelihood of experiencing excessive fertility

than women who used relatively poor, or no, contraception (Table 3 provides

some details on the samples and fertility outcomes). Viewing the observed

actual fertility by the 24th year of marriage as an indication of the ex

ante risk of excess fertility faced by these women, those who used "good"

contraception (primarily condom and diaphragm in the time intervals in

question) had less than half as high a likelihood of having five or more

children than did those who used "poor" contraception, and less than one—

third as high a likelihood than did those women who used no contraception

(some of whom were and most of whom thought themselves subfecund).

There is both considerable variation by contraceptive technique in the un-

certainty couples face, and there is substantial uncertainty faced by

couples using even the best available pre—pill technology. Of course, one

cannot yet have a 24—year history of fertility outcomes for pill—IUD users,

but judging from the differential use—effectiveness of these techniques, the

comparable chance of having more than five children when using the pill

should fall practically to zero.

     This reduction in uncertainty about subsequent fertility faced by a

young couple in their 20's or 30's can be expected to influence decisions

about their consumption and savings behavior, the wife's labor market

attachment, and for some the attractiveness of being married per Se. Con-

sider two 30—year—old women with no additional children desired. If faced

with a probability of .75 or higher of another pregnancy within the next

ten years (a reasonable expectation using a pre—pill technology), the

attractiveness of making a labor market career investment might appear con-

siderably less than if the accurate expectation was no pregnancy. There

is considerable evidence that the presence of young children lowers the

likelihood of married women being in the labor market [e.g., Heckman,

Willis (1977) estimate the effect per child to be about —.09 on a mean

of 0.43 for a 1967 sample], and discussions of on—the—job investments in

skills by women frequently emphasize that these investments are often

postponed until childbearing is completed as skills depreciate relatively

rapidly when the woman is outside the labor force [see Mincer, Polachek

(1974)]. Faced with uncertainty about future fertility, a woman may

delay her anticipated labor market investment. That delay might well be

accompanied by other activities which would increase her skill in non—
                                     —10—


labor—market activities, subsequently decreasing the attractiveness of

marital dissolution and also of a market career altogether. Perhaps more

broadly than the change in labor market orientation of women, couples may

respond to uncertain future fertility by orienting their plans and present

activities in ways that tend to strengthen their marriage by increasing

the capital losses from dissolution. Although no evidence is adduced

linking the reduced uncertainty about future fertility to investment be-

havior, the logic that underlies those investments surely implies that the

effect   is to be expected.8
     An additional   impact of   this uncertainty about subsequent fertility

relates to the decision to be married or unmarried. It has been argued

[Becker (1974)] that one of the important production efficiencies which

generates a demand for marriage is the more basic demand for bearing and

rearing own—children. 1n a world of quite imperfect fertility control,

the force of this argument might be changed: given a desire to be sex-

ually active, an inevitable consequence is some substantial risk of a birth

which implies a likelihood of marriage if the birth is to be legitimized.

If, with improved contraception, sexual activity no longer need involve a

substantial risk of birth, then the derived demand for marriage would be

based on the smaller demand for "desired" or "wanted" children rather

than on the demand for "actual" (wanted and unwanted) fertility. Thus,

the gains from marriage per se may have been reduced appreciably with the

recent fertility control technology changes, especially for persons who

 wantedH no children.

     The third reason improved contraceptive technology may encourage

divorce is that it weakens an important restriction on extramarital sexual

activity. By lowering the risk of conception, the cost of non—marital sex
                                    —11—


is reduced which presumably raises the quantity demanded, thus increasing

extra—marital search that in turn raises the probability of encountering

a preferred mate. Evidence here too is difficult to obtain, but Ryder and

Westoff show that within marriage "coital frequency is positively associ-

ated with the effectiveness of contraception" [Westoff and Ryder (1977),

p. 67], for presumably the same reasons.

        The change in fertility control technology in the 1960's has another

feature which makes it an attractive variable to use in studying time

series divorce. The technological change can be considered exogenous;

it was introduced before the rise in divorce began and had its roots in

medical innovations for which patents were first applied as early as 1952.

It is often the case that a set of variables moves together over time in

a consistent manner, as in the past fifteen years the decline in fertility,

growth in women's labor force participation and growth. in divorce rates

have done. But it is not an easy matter to identify the causally prior

force which has influenced such series. Surely there is much simulta-

neous causation among fertility, women's labor force rates and divorce

rates in recent years but we would like to know which of these or what

other influences prompted the changes which have taken place. While

technological innovations may themselves be induced by demand considera-

tions and perhaps the contraceptive technological changes in the late

1960's were responding to social forces, It seems reasonable to argue that

the pill—IIJD technology was in no meaningful sense caused by the divorce

rate.

        Another factor often discussed as an important influence on the

divorce rate in recent years is the change in the legal costs (broadly

defined) of divorce. Surely the costs affect the demand and as discussed
                                 —12—


below these costs have fallen in many states in the U.S. within

the past decade. What is far less clear is whether it is appropriate in

trying to explain the rise in divorce to use the easing of divorce laws as

an exogenous influence. In other areas of law, such as minimum schooling

legislation, studies have indicated that changes in laws do not

alter behavior but are, rather, responses to and codification of be—

havioral changes [see, e.g., Landes, Solmon (1972)1. So, without a simul-

taneous system in which these law changes were themselves predicted, it

seems inappropriate to place much weight on these changes in divorce laws

in explaining the recent rise in divorce.

     One final potentially important influence on time series divorce

results from a dynamic relation with the series itself. A general rise

in the divorce rate influences subsequent years' divorce rates in several

ways: (1) by creating a greater pool of more readily available potential

mates which probably lowers the expected (net) gain from the current

marriage, thus inducing increased divorce; (2) by increasing the expecta-

tion of divorce which reduces incentives to invest in marital—specific

capital, which lowers the losses incurred by divorce (i.e., the expecta-

tion is self—fulfilling); (3) by ultimately raising the proportion of all

marriages which are second and third marriages, in which the divorce rate

is, typically, higher [see McCarthy (1977)].

II. 1920—1974 Time Series Analysis

     The preceding section discusses numerous factors expected to influence

the divorce rate over time. The regression analysis reported in this

section and in the appendix focuses on the aggregate annual time series

of divorce rates since 1920, with a few appendix regressions restricted

to the post—war period. The estimation involves a single reduced form
                                  —l 3—



equation and thus several factors which are considered simultaneously

determined with the divorce rate are not included directly in the equations

(some are reported in the appendix for comparison). Five principal vari-

ables are used in the regressions: income (Y), for which cross section

results show strong negative coefficients but as discussed above, this

negative effect should be much weaker in the time series; unemployment

'(U) for which the positive cross section effect might also be somewhat

weaker; a measure of marriage duration (MD) used to standardize for this

important demographic dimension of divorce rates —— as measured MD is

inversely related to the median duration of marriage and thus should be

positively correlated with the divorce rate; a measure of military man-

power (CI) which should be positively related to the divorce rate; and one

of two measures of contraceptive technology, CT, a diffusion measure

based on estimated adoption of the pill and IUD in the U.S., or DF, a

diffusion measure based on a logistic diffusion curve. Another variable

with which experimentation was performed with little success is a crude

measure of an Easterlin relative income concept [see Easterlin (1973)],

REL(Y), defined here as the ratio of real per capital income in year t to

real per capita income in year t—15. The idea here is to capture the

economic circumstances of an individual in year t (think of, say, a 28—

year—old) relative to the economic circumstances that individual experienced

in his or her formative years, taken to be about fifteen years before (say,

at age 13). The hypothesis is that the better the person's current circum-

stance relative to his or her childhood circumstance, the higher his rela-

tive income and the lower his likelihood of divorce)0

      The variables used in the regression analysIs for the period 1920—1974

were annual observations. Their sources and measurement details are listed
                                                                               )
in   appendix Table A—i. Briefly, they are:
                                 —14--



    DR: divorce rate: the number of divorces per 1000 married women age
           15 (u = 10.1; a = 3.1; range 6.1 — 19.3)

     Y: income: personable disposable income per capita in 1967 dollars
         (p = $1783; a = $603; range $934 — 3045)

REL(Y): relative income: for year t the ratio of real personal disposable
         income per capita in year t to the real PDI per capita in year
         t — 15 (p = 1.27; a = 0.28; range 0.54 — 1.92)

     U: unemployment: percent of civilian labor force unemployed (year
         averages) (p = 7.1; a = 6.1; range 1.2 — 24.9)

    MD: marriage duration: for year t, the ratio of the total number of
         marriages in years t, t—l, t—2, to the total number of marriages
         in years t, c—i, ..., t—14. This ratio should be inversely re-
         lated to the median duration of marriage.
         (p = 21.5; a = 2.2; range 18.0 — 25.4)

    GI: military manpower: percent of the population age      18 which is
         in the military (p = 2.1; a = 2.5; range 0.3 — 12.3)

    CT: contraceptive technology: estimate of the percent of married
         spouse—present women who are using an oral contraceptive or IUD
         (p = 3.4; a = 9.2; range 0 — 35)

    DF: technology diffusion: an index intended to reflect the diffusion
         of changed contraceptive technology in the 1960's. The index
         reaches 98.5% saturation in 15 years (p = 4.3; a = 13.4; range
         0 — 68.6)


    As the decision to divorce precedes the final issuing of a divorce

decree by many months,11 it is assumed that a two—year lag on most exogenous

variables would be appropriate. The contraceptive technology variable CT

or DF is the only one for which a longer lag seemed appropriate. Whether

the channel of influence of this factor is through a reduction in actual

fertility, a reduction in uncertainty about subsequent fertility, or a re-

percussion of a reduced cost of extra—marital sex, a lag between initial

adoption and the decision to divorce of, say, three years seemed reason-

able, a priori, so a total lag of five years for this variable is used.

Clearly, the proper lag structure may differ from variable to variable, and

the entire impact may not be transmitted to the divorce rate in any single
                                   —15—



year. Experimenting with distributed lags and alternative single—period

lags has not been done, however.

     Table 4 reports results from five regressions estimated by a two—

stage process employing the "Durbin—procedure" for removing the autore-

gressive structure from the residuals.12 Regarding the directions of

effects, marriage duration, military manpower and contraceptive technology

have the expected, and reasonably strong, positive effects on the divorce

rate. Unemployment has a substantial positive effect, as in the cross

section (although this effect does not accord with one's casual impression

from the drop in divorce in the early. 1930's). The most puzzling result

in these regressions is the persistently positive effect of income.

While the strong negative effect from the cross section was not expected,

the significant positive effect of income on divorce has not been ex-

plained. My explanation is this: measured income (Y) is capturing in part

the positive effect on divorce of the growth in women's labor force parti-

cipation. To investigate this possibility, time series regressions using

women's labor force participation rates (LF) and men's income (MEN(Y)),

both available only in the post—war period, were run (see appendix Table

A—4). The labor force variable did appear to weaken the significance of

the positive income (Y) effect although LF itself never approached sig-

nificance, while MEN(Y) had a much weaker (insignificant) effect when used

in place of Y and its effect was further weakened by including LF, which

supports the view that Y's significant positive effect is reflecting, in

part at least, the rise in LFPR of women. The REL(Y) variable is not

useful in these regressions (see Table 4). Preston and McDonald (1976)

did find relative income important in explaining cohort divorce differen—

        lagged two years except CT and DF which are lagged five years.)

tials but both the measure of relative income used here and the analysis

of period instead of cohort divorces helps explain its poor showing in

these regressions.

     Figure 2 plots the predicted series (from equation (3), Table 4) together

with the actual divorce rate series; the predicted series mirrors the actual

series quite well.13 In order to track through time the impact on the

divorce rate of the various explanatory variables, Table 5 indicates the

decade—by—decade changes attributable to each variable, based again on eq.

(3) in Table 4. Considering income and unemployment together as the in-

fluence of the economy, this influence contributed on the order of magni-

tude of two—thirds of a percentage point per decade to the growth in

divorce in three of the five decades. In the most recent decade the effect

of the economy was to raise the divorce rate by about three times its

ordinary decade effect.

     The military manpower variable contributes to the growth in divorce

rates in these decade changes through the 1940's and 1950's only. The ex-

ceptional role played by this variable in the mid—l940's is indicated by

the four—year period effects shown parenthetically in Table 5. (In the

post—war regressions, the military manpower variable was invariably statis-

tically insignificant.) The marriage duration variable appears to have an

important Influence on the decade changes throughout this half century.

Marriage duration lengthened over time from about 1920 through 1933,

shortened during the remainder of the 1930's, was low throughout and

immediately after World War II, lengthened thereafter until about 1960,

then shortened again. Thus the changes in the duration of marriages tended

to depress the divorce rate in the 1920's, late 1940's and throughout the

1950's, and tended to raise the period—specific divorce rates during the

1930's and from 1960 to the present.

     The effect of the contraceptive technology proxy in the most recent

decade is very strong when measured by either DF or CT.   [The comparable

1962—1972 effects of CT from regressions (1), (2), and (4) of   Table   4 are:

4.477, 5.063, and 4.469 respectively.] The lengthy discussion in the pre-

ceding section offers an explanation for this strong effect.

     The final column of Table 5 shows each variable's half century ef-

fect. While marriage duration had a relatively strong effect on the divorce

rate in each of the decades considered, it, like unemployment, is cyclical

so its influence on the fifty—year trend in the divorce rate is substan-

tially smaller relative to other variables. Over the fifty—year period,

the growth in income appears to be a principal factor In the growth in

divorce, contributing 4.3 percentage points or about 45 percent of the

"explained" increase. Although both military manpower and marriage duration

also contribute 0.9 and 0.7 percentage points, these figures are quite

sensitive to the particular fifty—year period chosen for the comparison)4

Unemployment has no significant influence over the fifty years. The con-

traceptive technology variable, measured as either DF or CT, does have a

pronounced effect through its impact in the recent decade.

III. Further Explorations

    Divorce Laws. Regarding the easing of legal barriers to divorce,

there is no disputing the magnitude of changes in laws governing divorce

in certain states such as California, Iowa, Florida, and Michigan with the

advent of no—fault dissolutions in 1970—71. It is, however, difficult to

quantify In general the easing of divorce laws over time.15 Moreover, as
                                  —18—


discussed above, there is a more fundamental question of whether changes

in laws can legitimately be viewed as an exogenous social force.

     While legal ease of divorce was not incorporated in the time series

regressions above for both of these reasons, Figure 3 provides some crude

indication of the relation between the rise in divorce and the statutory

changes in divorce laws in several states. The figure simply shows the

annual time series since 1960 of divorce rates for specific states.16

There was only one notable change in the divorce laws during the 1960's:

New York eased its law moderately in 1966. The new no—fault dissolution

law which went into effect January 1970 in California marked the beginning

of a two—year period in which several states ——   including   Iowa, Florida,

Michigan, Oregon, Colorado, and Vermont —— adopted no—fault [see Wheeler

(1974)]. In most of these states in which law changes have occurred,

appreciable increases in divorce rates are observed subsequently ——     cer-
tainly in New York and California and perhaps Iowa and Florida as well.

Whether the higher rates of divorce persist several years after the easing

of the law is not clear —— compare New York (where it appears to do so)

with California (where the effect appears to be temporary).17

     Yet, while we observe increases after the enactment of new, easier

divorce laws, we also observe considerable increases in divorce rates

prior to the passage of those laws, and contemporaneous increases in states

in which no law change took place. The figure does not lend support to

the argument that the divorce law changes caused the rise in divorce rates

which began in the 1960's. In almost every state investigated the rise in

divorce began several yearsbefore the law was changed. Whether the change

in laws subsequently altered divorce behavior or altered only its timing,

or in some states had no effect, is far less clear. Whatever forces caused

the rise in divorce rates probably also contributed pressure, at least

indirectly, on legislators to codify in the form of easier divorce laws

a more tolerant social attitude toward divorce.

     International Comparison. Additional perspective on the rise in U.S.

divorce rates in the past decade can be obtained by a comparison of inter-

national crude divorce rates (divorces per 1000 population). For an arbi-

trarily selected set of countries, Figure 4 reveals the following pattern:

North American and European countries appear to have experienced a marked

and sustained rise in divorce rates beginning in the mid—1960's; the rest

of the world, generally speaking, did not. This paper does not provide an

analysis of these data but several relevant points can be observed from the

figure itself:   (1) The marked rise in the U.S. divorce rate in the mid—

1960's is not an isolated, national phenomenon. Thus the cause of that

rise probably is not a purely domestic force such as a change in laws.

(2) The impact of World War II is evident in practically every country and

even the more modest change in Sweden during the 1940's confirms this

interpretation of the war—related increase in divorce. (3) There appears

from this casual evidence to be a relationship between the recent rise in

divorce and the adoption of the oral contraceptive: the rise in divorce

has been far less dramatic in predominately Catholic countries such as

Guatemala and France, in middle—Eastern countries, and in highly developed

countries such as Japan in which more traditional forms of contraception

are still the prevalent mode (in Japan the IUD and pill had not been

officially approved for use by 1971). A multitude of additional factors

may need be accounted for in a more thorough international study, but Fig-

ure 4 appears to lend support to this contention that in countries where the

new modes of contraception have not been adopted the rise in divorce rates

in recent years has been much less pronounced.

        Demographic Standardization. To determine if the recent growth in the

U.S. divorce rate might have been the result of demographic shifts toward

population groups which traditionally have high divorce rates, several

demographic standardizations were performed. Between 1960 and 1970 estimates

of age—specific divorce rates suggest that no more than 20 percent of the

decade change in divorce is attributable to changes in the age composition

of the population and much of the increase (about 40 percent) is due to

increase in the divorce rates of women aged 20—29 [see Michael (1977)].

The attribution of the growth in divorce to younger couples is cdnsistent

with the contention that the contraceptive revolution of the 1960's is a

primary cause of that growth, for the impact of the improved fertility

control should be strongest on women with more remaining years of fertility

risk.

        Divorce rates are generally observed to be higher in second than in

first marriages.18 A shift in the proportion of all U.S. marriages which

are second (or higher order) marriages would tend to raise the observed

overall divorce rate, but no such shift is evident for the period from 1950

to 1970.19 So there is no ground for supposing the observed rise in divorce

between 1960 and 1970 is attributable to a shift toward second marriages.

        Likewise, it has long been known that divorce rates differ geograph-

ically in the U.S. in a curious manner: they rise rather continually from

the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast. Without discussing the reasons for

this pattern here, it would be important to know if the recent rise in

divorce is a geographically local phenomenon or if much of the rise could

be attributed to population shifts among regions. The answer here too

appears to be no. Vital Statistics data show a substantial rise In the

divorce rate between 1960 and 1970 in every division of the country.

IV.   Summary and Prognosis

      The recent increase in divorce rates in the U.S. appears to be attrib-

utable disproportionately to couples in their twenties; their high and

rapidly growing divorce rate has been reinforced by their rising proportion

in the married population. The largest age cohorts today (1977) are those

aged 16—20 and as these cohorts marry there should be continued upward

pressure on the aggregate divorce rate. The rising age at first marriage

has offset this tendency somewhat, but the basic arithmetic of the aging

of baby—boom cohorts has had and will continue to have a significant

impact on the aggregate divorce rate ——   in   1960 there were one—third as

many women in their 20's as there were women in their 30's, 40's, and 50's;

by 1975 there were one—half as many women in their 20's!

      Regarding the forces that have contributed to the change in divorce

behavior over the past fifteen years, the growth in the economy, measured

in terms of real per capita income, appears from Table 5 to have had a sub-

stantial influence explaining perhaps 25 percent of the growth in divorce

rates between 1962 and 1972. Real growth in the economy over the next

decade should continue upward pressure on the divorce rate. The reconcil-

iation of considerable cross—sectional evidence of a negative relationship

between income and divorce and the observed positive relationship in the

aggregate time series deserves further study. The discussion in Section

II explains why a negative relationship is not expected in the time series,

but does not predict a positive relationship. Perhaps the explanation is

that variety Is a luxury in the context of interpersonal relations as it is

observed to be in diets, work routines, etc. But perhaps the explanation

is that aggregate income is in part reflecting the positive effect on

divorce of the rising labor force participation of women, as discussed in

Section III.
                                  —22—


     The other major factor suggested by the regression analysis as an

important cause of the recent decade's rise in divorce is the improvement

in contraceptive technology which began in the early 1960's. In terms of

a prognosis, the regression analysis can be interpreted in at least two

ways. If this phenomenon is strictly the diffusion of the oral—ITJD contra-

ception technology, working through the channels discussed in Section II,

one would expect at least a leveling off of the divorce rate soon, as that

technology is now surely effectively diffused in the U.S. (In the longer

run, this effect may lower divorce rates as many potential married couples

may choose not to marry and the remainder exhibit a lower rate of dissolu-

tion.) However, a second interpretation is also possible. Ifthe under-

lying phenomenon which the CT or DF variable reflects is an exogenous,

technologically induced shift toward costless, perfectly effective fer-

tility control, then the whole impact of this phenomenon may not lie behind

us. Significant post—pill innovations in sterilization, fetal monitoring

and perhaps abortion represent further advances toward perfect fertility

control, and may be expected to continue to exert upward pressure on the

observed divorce rate. Of course, the regression equation estimated here

more adequately reflects the first of these two interpretations, but the

logic of the argument need not.

     As all the variables in the divorce regression in Section III are

lagged at least two years and the regression ends in 1974, the equation can

be used to predict the divorce rate for an-additional four years on the

basis of actual values for the explanatory variables. The actual divorce

rate and the predictions from eq. (3) in Table 4 for the last four years over

which the regression was run and for the subsequent four years are shown

below:

            1978                                  21.3



The equation implies a substantial reduction in the rate of increase in

the divorce rate over the "next" few years. The prediction for 1975 tracks

well the official 1975 divorce rate (which recently became available in

Nay 1977), and the flattening of the divorce series thereafter appears to

be consistent with the preliminary vital statistics figures on divorces

subsequently.

1. See Becker (1974), Becker, Landes, Michael (1977), Preston, McDonald
    (1976), and Ross, Sawhill (1975).

2. For example, in Becker, Landes, Michael (1977) a ten percent increase
    in husband's earnings is associated with a reduction in the probabil-
    ity of divorce in the first five years of marriage by about 0.2 per-
    cent from a mean of 6.8 percent (the effect is nonlinear and appears
    to persist through the first 25 years of marriage); Ross, Sawhill
    (1975) find an additional $1000 of wives' annual earnings raises by
    one percent (t = 3.4) the probability of divorce in a four—year
    period, holding husbands' earnings fixed; and for a positive assor—
    tative trait such as religion, Michael (1976) finds that similarity
    between spouses reduces the probability of divorce substantially.

3. One exception, perhaps, is the impact of an increase in the unem-
    ployment rate. An increase in unemployment experienced by one man
    may convey new information to him and his spouse about his labor
    market prospects compared to others, and this information may be
    maritally destabilizing.   [Ross, Sawhill (1975, p. 56) find that an
    extended period of unemployment is destabilizing.] An increase in
    unemployment in the aggregate, however, may be viewed as a cyclical
    phenomenon conveying no such information. Thus while unemployment
    is positively related to the probability of divorce in cross—section
    studies, that effect may be weaker in the aggregate data. In prin-
    ciple, high unemployment could induce a postponement in divorce, as
    it does the purchase of many durable goods and, apparently, births
    and marriages [see Silver (1965)].

4. The IUD became a medically accepted and thus a generally available
    contraceptive option in the U.S. only after Guttmacher's 1962 inter-
    national conference on BiDs. See Huber, et. al. (1975).

5. See Michael, Willis (1976, pp. 36—39) for details and qualifications.
    These probabilities are calculated as 1—Cl—p.)12° where p1 is the
    estimated monthly probability of conception using technique i.

6. Of course, the direction, of causation is not altogether clear here if
    fertility is affected by the anticipation of divorce. Becker, Landes,
    Michael (1977) discuss this issue in detail and present evidence
    suggesting that the causation between fertility and divorce flows in
    both directions.

7. See Becker, Landes, Michael (1977) who use SEO data for white women.
    Cherlin (1977) using NLS data for white women aged 30—44 also finds
    that the presence of young (but not older) children tends to lower
    the probability of marital separation.

 8.   It may be well to note and clear up an apparent inconsistency here.
      Above it was suggested that unexpected events are maritally destabil-
      izing per se while here the argument is made that the reduction in
      uncertainty about subsequent fertility is destabilizing due to its
      impact on intervening investment behavior. The former point pertains
      to an unanticipated event —— a change in one's health, or labor market-
      ability for example. The latter pertains to a recognized or antici-
      pated uncertainty which affects behavior whether or not the event
      actually occurs. The same distinction could be made regarding any
      other stochastic event. Couples may marry with some anticipated risk
      of the husband being unemployed sometime. No statement has been made
      about the impact on divorce of a change in that anticipated risk.
      What has been argued is that an unanticipated period of unemployment is
      maritally destabilizing. In the case of the risk of conception, the
      case is argued that a reduction in that risk is maritally destabilizing.
      Moreover, to the extent the change in available contraceptive tech-
      nology itself was an unanticipated event, it should be expected to be
      maritally destabilizing per se.

 9.   A major remaining puzzle related to this point is the precipitous
      rise in recent years in the rate of illegitimate births [see Hartley
      (1975)1. Perhaps a substitution of abortion for contraception as a
      means of fertility control may be a factor. That is, perhaps some
      couples find a contraceptive strategy involving a hypothetical
      abortion not as easy to implement once a pregnancy is detected (for
      financial, emotional, religious or other reasons). Perhaps the rise
      in divorce itself, which has resulted in an increase in the propor-
      tion of children not raised by both their natural parents, has
      resulted in a reduction in the social sanctions against illegitimacy.

10.   Preston, McDonald (1976) use five separate income terms in their
      analysis of cohort divorce and find a strong deterrent effect of
      recent income and a strong destabilizing effect of income about 12
      years prior to marriage.

11.   Some information on the length of time between separation and
      divorce is available for DRA states. In 1969 in California about 7%
      of divorces took place in less than one year after separation while
      about 14% took place after three or more years of separation; for
      Michigan the comparable figures were 46% and 15% and for Virginia 3%
      and 24% respectively [see Table 22, Platens (1973)]. Of course
      the final decision to divorce may also be made some months after
      separation has taken place.

12.   If the relationship

                Dt = a + b Y_1 + c

      exhibits autocorrelation, the Durbin procedure involves first
      estimating

                Dt =   a'   + p Dtl + b'

     and using p as an estimate of the first—order autoregressive parameter
     in the second stage equation:

               (Dt —   PDi)                               Ut.

13. For reference the figure also includes a time trend estimate obtained
     by the regression in Dt = a + bT (or Dt = AerT) in which
     b = .01296(t = 8.3); a = l.666(t = 21.5) and R2 = .56. Divorce rates
     for census years prior to 1920 are available and are substantially
     lower than predicted by this constant growth rate of 1.3. When the
     1890, 1900 and 1910 observations are included in the regression, the
     growth rate is 1.5.

14. That is, if the fifty years were shifted back in time by as little as
     two years, 1920—1970, military manpower's effect would have been
     estimated as —1.0 percent due to the first World War, and marriage
     duration's effect would have been 0.5 percent.

15. Statutory changes are a matter of record but changes in practice,
     procedures or interpretation are far more difficult to identify or
     evaluate. Platens [see Rheinstein (1972)] indexed the ease of
     divorce by state for 1959, but to my knowledge no one has updated
     Platens' work, much less provided a time series.

16. The married populations are estimates extrapolated from 1960 and 1970
     censuses; the number of divorces are from Vital Statistics through
     1972. The divorce numbers for 1973 and 1974 were kindly provided by
     Alexander Platens' office at D.H.E.W.

17. In a study of the impact of the no—fault law in California, Schoen,
     Greenblatt and Mielke reach the surprising conclusion that there is
     "no basis for concluding that non—adversary divorce led to any
     increase in marital dissolutions among Californians" (1975, p. 231).
     They contend that nearly all the additional 1970—71 divorces resulted
     from the timing feature of the law (six—month instead of twelve—
     month minimum residency and required time between filing and decree),
     with some additional Californians divorcing in their own state
     instead of Nevada after the new law went into effect.

18. For example, in 1970 the divorce rate in California for first
     marriages is estimated to be 22.1 while for second marriages it is
     40.5. The reason for much of this difference is a vast difference in
     the average duration of marriages, but even holding duration constant
     one observes a sizable differential [see McCarthy (1977)].

19. The proportion of marriages which were second or higher order in 1950,
     1960 and 1970 were 13.8, 13.0, 13.7 percent respectively, according
     to the decennial censuses.


                                                                              9

      Appendix Table A—i indicates the sources of variables used in

Table 4 and in this appendix. Table A—2 is a simple correlation matrix

for 1920—1974 (below the diagonal in this table) and for 1950—1974 (above

the diagonal).

      Table A—3 indicates several additional regressions which may be

compared to those in Table 4. The only additional variable is:

      F: Fertility: live births per thousand women aged 15 to 44
           (ji   = 101.6;   a =   15.7;   range 75. to 125.)

The ordinary first difference equations (eqs. 1—4) exhibited serious

serial correlation as did the level equations (not shown). Including

time in the first difference regression (eq. 2) affected nothing. In-

cluding fertility (eqs. 3 and 4), which suffers from simultaneity'problems,

weakens CT substantially.

       In the first of the three modified first difference equations, REL(Y)

replaces Y (eq. 5) and performs no better than in eq.; (5) of Table 4.

Eq. (5) adds an income—squared term to eq. (1) of Table 4, but the co-

efficient is not significant. Eq. (8) is a slightly altered form of the

two—stage estimation procedure used in eq. (3) of Table 4, adding the

initial year observation as XTlp2, as discussed in Johnston (1972,

p. 261). As is consistent with the discussion in Johnston or Griliches,

Rao   (1969),    this modification had no substantive effect on the estimator.

      1950—1974. Because of higher quality post—war data on several ex-

ogenous variables and the nature of the divorce series during the 1940's,

a separate regression analysis of the post—war period was done. The

analysis includes four additional variables:
     MEN(Y): Men's income: median real income of males age 14 and over;

             I: Income: per capita personal income excluding transfer
                 payments, in 1967 dollars;

            LF: Labor force participation rates: the LFPR of women with
                 spouse present and with children under six;

            PA: Public assistance: average monthly AFDC payment per
                 recipient in 1967 dollars.

The means, standard deviations and ranges of the variables for this

shorter time period are:

Table A—4 indicates the most useful results from this analysis, all in

modified first difference form. GI and MD were never significant in this

short time period. Neither PA, F, nor LF showed statistical significance

but there is considerable multicollinearity among these variables and

income. The use of men's income MEN(Y) in place of Y destroyed the sig—

nificance of the positive income effect.

                                        based on NSF data. For the
                                        period prior to 1960 the series
                                        is assumed to be zero; for the
                                        period since 1970 the figures are
                                        estimates derived by linking

                                        a TV, so the TV diffusion curve
                                        has been flattened somewhat. The
                                        index employed here reaches 50%
                                        saturation in about 9 years and
                                        99% saturation in 16 years. The
                                        curve is a logistic: DF =
                                        1/(1+exp(4.35 —0.57T)) where
                                        T = year — 1960.

     Over the past ten years the United States has witnessed a dramatic

rise in its aggregate divorce rate. After remaining relatively stable

for over forty years (except for two years in the Great Depression and

three years during World War II), in the latter half of the 1960's the

divorce rate began to rise precipitously and has continued that rise to

today. Table 1 indicates the pattern of the U.S. divorce rate since 1920.

     This general pattern of increase in divorce in the past decade is

not unique to the United States. It is also evident in Canada, in many

European countries including United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Czechoslo—

vakia, USSR and to a lesser degree East and West Germany, as well as in

Australia and New Zealand. The rise is not, in general, found in middle—

Eastern, African, Latin or South American, or Asian countries.

     The demographic literature has informally suggested numerous possible

causes of this increase in divorce in the U.S., but empirical evidence on

the Importance of contributing factors has not appeared. Often cited

causes such as the liberalization of divorce laws, the impact of the War

in Vietnam and the rise in women's labor force participation rates cannot

help explain the quite similarly timed burst in the divorce rates in many

other countries. The rise In divorce may, in fact, prove to be a difficult

phenomenon to explain, so more extensive and systematic research on its

nature and its causes appears warranted.

    To begin to understand the causes of the recent upswing in divorce,

several research approaches seem feasible. First, some historical per-

spective should prove useful and Glick and Norton (1973) provide per-

spective with retrospective information from the 1971 CPS, focusing on

cohort divorce behavior. Likewise, a recent multivariate analysis of
                                      —2—



cohort divorce over the past century by Preston and McDonald (1976)

provides perspective, although the Preston—McDonald study itself ends with

1969. A second approach is a multivariate analysis of the recent time

series divorce rate itself, and studies of this nature are currently

underway (e.g. Michael, 1977). A third approach, which this short paper

employs, is a decomposition of the recent increase in order to see its

anatomy more clearly. By knowing more about which groups, social or

demographic, have contributed most to the increase, we should be in a

better position to understand the reasons for the recent change. The

difficulty with this approach is the sparcity of information about char-

acteristics of those divorcing. This paper uses available information

from Vital Statistics on women's age at the time of divorce together

with information from the U.S. decennial censuses. With this information

the change in divorce over the past fifteen years is decomposed into age—       )
specific    divorce rates and age—specific marriage weights that are affected

by changes in age structure and in age at first marriage.

      These age—specific divorce rates permit us to address two types of

questions: (1) What is the anatomy of the rise in the aggregate divorce

rate since 1960? Is the rise due to a shift in the age structure of the

married population toward ages which traditionally have higher divorce

rates? Is the rise due to a roughly equal proportionate rise in the age—

specific divorce rates or is it attributable to a disproportionate rise in

the divorce rate for a few age groups? (2) Is the time pattern of the rise

in the aggregate divorce rate (i.e. a low growth rate from 1960 to 1965

and   a   high growth rate from 1965 to 1970 and from 1970 to 1975) mirrored

in all of the age—specific divorce rates?
                                                    —3—



    To address the first set of questions a decomposition of the

divorce rate into age—specific population weights, marriage proportions

and divorce rates can be performed. Let

              the   number of divorces in the I
                                                -         th   age group in year t;
    D.t =

          =   the   number of married women In the th age group in year t;

          =   the   number   of   women   in    the I     age group in year c.

where d, m and p are the group's divorce rate, marriage proportion and

population weight respectively. These quantities are calculated for

eight age groups defined as i 19, 20—24, 25—29, 30—34, 35—39, 40—44,

45—49, and        50, for several years.

     The Vital Statistics data used are from the Divorce Registration

Area (DRA), which reports divorces by age, but the DRA was only begun in

1958 with 16 states reporting. By 1971 there were 29 states in the DRA,

but not all recorded age at decree. I selected for study all states (15)

which were In the DRA by 1960 with a preponderance of reported divorces

distributed by age at decree. (Divorces not distributed were apportioned

by age in the same proportions as those reported for each state separately.)

The set of states included Alaska, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas,

Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Vir-

ginia, and Wisconsin. Published data are available for these states through

1973, and data for 1974 were kindly provided me by Alexander Platens' office.

     The 1960 and 1970 censuses provide information on the number of

married women by age in each state, so age and state specific divorce

rates for 1960 and 1970 were obtained using the annual divorce flows from

Vital Statistics (the DRA) and the annual stocks of women at risk from the

censuses. As the flow of divorces is an annual series, divorce rates for

1965 and 1974 are also estimated but these are based on straight line

extrapolations of the stocks of married women based on the 1960 and 1970

census figures. Thus, the rates estimated for the mid—decade years are

subject to greater error and will be treated accordingly.

     This set of fifteen states exhibited a somewhat lower level of

divorce than the U.S. as a whole, but the &rowth in divorce rates is very

similar to the growth for the U.S., as seen from Table 2.   So from the

point of view of the changes over time, this fifteen—state sample appears

to be representative df the U.S. as a whole.
                                                                              )
     Equation (1) can be used to construct synthetic divorce rates re-
flecting what the divorce rate would have been under various assumptions

about changes in the d's, m's and p's. Table 3 shows several of these

synthetic divorce rates) If the population's age structure shifted

between 1960 and 1970 as in fact it did, but no change had taken place in

the age—specific proportions married or in the age—specific divorce rates,

the aggregate divorce rate in 1970 would have fallen by 1.2 percent from

1960 to the level 7.54. If the population's age structure and marriage

proportions shifted between 1960 and 1970 as in fact they did, but the age—

specific divorce rates had remained unchanged, the aggregate divorce rate

in 1970 would have been 8.24, some 8 percent higher than in 1960. However,

if the age—specific divorce rates shifted, as in fact they did, while the
                                  —5—



marriage proportions and population weights had been unchanged, the 1970

divorce rate would have been 12.21, practically identical with the actual

1970 divorce rate. So, had the age composition of the married population

been unchanged between 1960 and 1970, the aggregate divorce rate would still

have risen by about sixty percent over the decade.2

     Table 4 addresses the same issue somewhat differently, showing each

age category's contribution to the decade growth in the divorce rate from

7.6 to 12.2. Col. (7) again indi:ates that a very large portion of the

growth in divorce over the decade is attributable to changes in age—specific

divorce rates. The final column indicates that over sixty percent of the

decade growth is attributable to women in the 20's (i.e. 33.9, +   26.9),
despite the fact that these women represent only about twenty percent of

the married population. tSee Cols. (3) and (4).] The substantially greater

contribution of women in their 20's than of women in their 30's results from

the relative growth in the marriage weight of the former (a combined con-

tribution of 21.2 percent) compared to the relative reduction in the

marriage weight of the latter (a combined contribution of —7.0 percent).

     So, Tables 3 and 4 indicate that the decade's rise in divorce is

surely not due to a shift in the age structure of the married population,

nor is it the result of a proportionate rise in the divorce rates at all

ages. In fact, the divorce rate rose far more rapidly for women in their

20's and early 30's. The shift in age structure of the married population

further increased the impact of the growth in young women's divorce rates.

     Turning to the question of the time pattern of the growth in divorce

rates, Table 5 provides an answer. The more rapid rate of increase in the

second half of the 1960's is mirrored in the age—specific rates for women in
                                     —6—



their 20's and 30's, but not so for women over age 40. In fact, for women

over age 40 the per annum growth rate in divorce was higher in the first

half of the 1960's than in the second half. So in this regard, as well as

in the decomposition shown in Table 4, the burst in divorce in the late

1960's is attributable to wonn in their 20's and 30's. The sustained

rise in the early 1970's also appears to be caused by younger women.3

The decade changes shown in column (4) again reflect this differential

growth in divorces among younger women. The fourteen year change shown in

column (5) confirms this tendency.

     These tables provide a valuable clue to the explanation of the rise

in divorce rates in recent years. Both the higher decade growth rate for

younger women and the within—decade pattern of that growth imply that the

explanation lies with forces which have influenced younger couples, not with

forces which influence all ages similarly. So in order to argue convincingly

that forces such as the easing of divorce laws or improved labor market

opportunities for women have caused the rise in divorce in the U.S., one

must explain why that force should have a greater impact on younger couples.

     One final note. The sustained disproportionate growth in the divorce

rate for younger couples implies a substantial change since 1960 in the

divorce probability density function by age. In 1960 the age—specific

divorce rate for women aged 45—49, for example, was about 40 percent as

high as for women aged 25—29; by 1974 it was only 25 percent as high. So

not only has the risk of divorce increased dramatically over the past

decade and a half, the relative risk at young ages has also risen consid-

erably. It may be that we will find that much of the postponement in

fertility among young couples over the past decade is in fact related to

this shift in the relative likelihood of divorce at younger ages.

2. One might wonder how the 60 percent actual rise is reconciled with an
    8 percent rise due to a change in weights and a 60 percent rise due to
    a change in age—specific rates. The two iihply a negative covariance.
    If x = Eab and dx = E[a(db) + (da)b + (da)(db)], then in this case the
    dx = 60.2, Ea(db) = 8.0, E(da)b = 60.0, so E(da)(db) must equal —7.8
    (=60.2 — 8.0 — 60.0).



3. These per annum growth rates may        be   misleading in this regard. For
    women    aged   20—24, for example, the divorce rate rose 5.7 points in
    these four years from 31.1 to 36.8 (a per annum growth rate of 4.2)
   while for women over age 50, the divorce rate rose 0.8 points from
    2.6 to 3.4 (a per annum      growth rate of 6.3). Of the total growth
    in the divorce rate from 1970 to 1974 the percentage attributable to
    the change in the eight age—specific divorce rates were as follows:
    7.2, 12.0, 25.7, 21.9, 11.2, 4.3, 3.4 and 4.8 for a total of 90.4
    percent of the total four—year growth.
