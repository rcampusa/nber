             Expectations, Surprises and Treasury Bill Rates: 1960—82



                                    ABSTRACT



      Changes in six-month bill rates over semiannual periods in the 1960s and

1970s are successfully related to expected changes and to surprises. The

latter include unanticipated changes in expected inflation, in the growth of

industrial production and base money, and in inflation uncertainty. Estima-

tion of the basic equation through the middle of 1983 does not suggest any

change in structure. Moreover the equation "explains" 60 percent of the

extraordinarily high level of real rates since late 1980, largely owing to an

excess of unexpected net increases in anticipated inflation over actual

increases.

      Our estimates provide some support for the expectations theory; there

appears to be information content in six-month forward rates. While this

content is swamped by the impact of surprises in equations explaining rate

changes in terms of forward rates alone, the content is clear when proxies for

the surprises are included in the equations.

      The height and volatility of interest rates in the early l980s

spectacularly exceeded that of the past half century. Various researchers

have attributed this to: the sharp increase and decline in inflation, the

special characteristics of recent monetary (the monetarist experiment) and

fiscal (the structural deficit) policies, and mysterious or unidentified

forces.   The present paper estimates the relationship between the six—month

Treasury bill rate and its determinants in the l960s and 1970s. The purpose

is to test various hypotheses regarding interest-rate determination and to

determine whether this relationship was altered markedly in the early l980s.

      The short-term bill rate is chosen for investigation for two reasons.

First, the yield on a short—term instrument is independent of longer—term

expectations regarding inflation, output growth, and fiscal and monetary

policies. Longer-term yields should depend heavily on such variables. While

reasonably accurate measures of expectations over, say, a six-month horizon

can probably be deduced (are, in fact, available from survey data), longer—

term expectations are both more uncertain and vary more widely across market

participants. Second, analysis of a short-term bill rate allows an easy test

of the expectations theory of interest rates. Recent studies by Shiller,

Campbell and Schoenholtz (1983) and by Mankiw and Summers (1983) suggest that

observed interest rate movements are unrelated to expected changes in rates

extracted from the term structure of short-term rates, calling into question

the validity of the expectations theory.2 The sixth-month bill rate is

analyzed because it meshes best with the Livingston survey data.

      Our framework draws together two views of interest rate determination:

the expectations theory whereby expected changes in the six-month rate can be

inferred from the six-month forward rate, and structural models of rates in

which unexpected changes can be attributed to unanticipated changes in

expected inflation, economic activity, and monetary growth. To anticipate the

results, there does not appear to be a marked change in the interest-rate

relation in recent years; the 1979—80 rise and 1981—82 decline in the six—

month rate are well explained by a reduced—form equation estimated over the

1960-79 period. Further, the expectations theory is supported by the data;

when variables explaining unexpected changes in interest rates are included in

the estimation equation, the expected rate change performs as anticipated.

      The present paper is divided into five broad parts. The first is an

examination of real before- and after-tax six—month bill rates in the 1960-82

period; the second presents the framework for the empirical analysis; the

third reports the results; the fourth discusses the determinants of the bill

rate in the 1980—mid83 period; and the fifth summarizes.

      Figure 1 contains plots of the real six-month bill rate, before and

after tax. The bill rate is the average of daily figures, on a bond-

equivalent basis, for June and December of the years 1960-82, and the expected

inflation data are the corresponding numbers for six-month inflation from the

Livingston survey. The extraordinarily high level of real bill rates in the

l980s is obvious. In the five observations from December 1980 to December

1982, the real bill rate averaged 6 percent. This is 4 percentage points

higher than the average of the 1960s and 1970s and 4 3/4 percentage points

greater than the 1971-79 span.

      The appropriate tax rate to employ in a study of real after-tax bill

rates is uncertain, and it would probably not be difficult to find economists

who would advocate rates as low as zero and as high as the corporate tax rate.

For illustrative purposes, we utilize an intermediate rate, a weighted average

of marginal personal tax rates for each adjusted gross income class.   During

the 1960—82 period, this series ranged between 0.24 and 0.38 and averaged

0.30. The June rate is that for the year in which it falls; the December rate

is an average of the year in which it falls and the following year.

      The after-tax real bill rate, so calculated, tells a far different story

than the before-tax real rate. In only one observation in the l980s is the

real after—tax rate above the average in the l960s. The rate is high in the

1980s only relative to the extraordinarily low rates in the l970s.

      One extreme outlier in both rate series in recent years is worthy of

note. The -3 percent real bill rate in June 1980 was 2½ percent below any

other observed bill rate in the entire period, and the -5.8 percentage points

after—tax real rate was 3½ percentage points below any other. Moreover, the

declines from December 1979 were 5½ and 4 percentage points, respectively, and

the increases between June and December 1980 were 8½ and 5 percentage points,

respectively. The record declines to unprecedented lows and the even sharper

immediate reversal cry out for an extraordinary explanation. Fortunately, one

is available.

           In response to a sharp increase in the inflation rate in early 1980 from

 an already high level, President Carter issued an executive order for the

 Federal Reserve to curb the growth in credit.4 On March 14, the Federal

 Reserve implemented a credit controls program which included a noninterest

bearing reserve requirement of 15 percent on increases in credit. Apparently

as a result, consumer installment credit outstanding contracted at an annual

rate of 10½ percent in the April-May period, the first decline since May 1975

and the largest reduction in the postwar era.5 The program was eased in late

May and terminated on July 24, 1980. It is difficult to imagine explaining

the sharp, temporary drop in bill rates in the middle of 1980 without

explicitly accounting for the credit restraint program.



                                 II. The Conceptual Framework

       Our starting point is the tax-adjusted Fisher equation whereby the

after-tax nominal rate { (l-T)RJ to investors equals the after-personal-taxes

real rate (r) plus the expected rate of inflation (it):



                                (l—T)R =   r   ÷ it.                         (1)



Next is the specification of the determinants of r. A number of small macro

models have been utilized to derive real rate relations [Levi and Makin

(1979) ,   Melvin   (1982) ,   Peek (1982), Wilcox (1983) and Makin and Tansi (1983) j.




4The consumer price index accelerated most rapidly and virtually the entire
acceleration was due to the inappropriate inclusion of mortgage interest rates
in the index. The expected six-month inflation rates given by the Livingston
survey for December 1979 and June and December 1980 were 10.1, 10.7 and 10.5
percent, respectively.

The resulting set of determinants depends on both the specified behavioral

equations and the substitutions made in deriving the reduced forms. For our

purposes, we specify a simple two-equation IS-LM Model:6

where I is a function representing both household and business investment, Tb

is the tax rate on business investment (reflecting the statutory rate, the

investment tax credit and depreciation tax schedules for a given inflation

rate) , CU   is the capacity utilization rate,   measures uncertainty regarding

inflation, CC refers to the 1980 credit controls discussed above, X is real

exogenous (defense) demand for output, Q is the supply of real output

(production), M is base money, Me is its expected value, P is the price level,

and T is the tax-transfer function. The signs of the partial derivatives are

indicated above the arguments in the functions. While most of these are

obvious, three merit disciion. First, the hurdle rate for the business

component of investment is positively related to business, not personal, tax

parameters and to the expected inflation rate (owing to the use of historic-

cost depreciation and FIFO inventory accounting). Thus increases in these

lower investment and real interest rates {Feldstein and Summers, 1978, and

Hendershott, 1981, pp. 913—14]. Second, the impact of greater inflation

uncertainty on interest rates is ambiguous; risk-averse investors will require




6lntroduction of an aggregate supply equation would introduce supply-shock
variables into the specification of the real rate a la Wilcox (1983)
Preliminary experimentation with such variables was not promising.

higher nominal returns, but investors in real capital will not be willing to

pay such returns (Levi and Makin, 1979, p 42). Third, the difference between

the actual and expected level of base money captures the impact of deviations

from money targets on anticipated future monetary policy; above target money

generates expectations of a more restrictive policy, lowering the demand for

bonds and thus raising the demand for money and interest rates.7 Solving for

r, assuming that the real interest rate effect in the investment function and

the output response in the money demand function dominate, yields

7Makin (1982) notes that positive money surprises tend to lower interest rates
by raising output and saving and to raise rates by raising expected inflation.
Because current output and expected inflation are represented in the model,
these effects are already incorporated.

       Conceptually, the change in the interest rate and in all the other

variables can be partitioned into expected and unexpected components. The

total change in the interest rate then equals the expected change plus the
                                                                      7a
unexpected parts of the terms on the right-hand side of (4)                Given the

six—month time frame considered here, it seems reasonable (and is certainly

convenient) to assume that tax rate and defense expenditures changes are

largely anticipated owing to the lags between the known intent of future

legislation and the actual implementation.8 On the other hand, changes in

inflation uncertainty and the credit controls are, almost by definition, fully

unexpected. Thus only the output and inflation terms are viewed as having

both expected and unexpected components. With these assumptions, we can write

where an E denotes the expected change and U the unexpected change, and

should be unity.

       There are two advantages to estimating equation (5) rather than (4).

First, the expectations theory of the term structure can be tested directly.

A strong test is that          is both significantly greater than zero and not



7aLet E denote the expected change and U the unexpected change. Then
differencing of (1) yields:

                          =   E1(r+ir) + UA(r+ir)

8The "causality" of this sentence is somewhat misleading. As noted earlier, a
short—term bill rate was selected for analysis in part so that this assumption
would be reasonable.
                                            —9—



 significantly different from unity, i.e., forward rates have informational

 content and the data are not inconsistent with the pure theory. The

 individual parts of the hypothesis constitute weak tests. Second, the

 measurement of T and Tb is less important for the estimation of (5) than of

 (4) .    The principal effect of change in taxes on AR comes through the AT    and
    terms which do not appear in (5).



                                    II. The Estimates

                                        A. The Data

          The dependent variable is the observed percentage change in the monthly

average (June and December) of daily six-month bill rates calculated on a

bond-equivalent annual basis. The change that was expected is the difference

between the value expected six months earlier [E1 (R)] and the value six

months ago (R1). This change is assumed to be the forward rate -- computed

from last period's one (six month) and two (twelve month) period bill rates --

plus     a constant:


                                  rl+R2_1         -
                       E_1(R) =     +                       e,
                                        R1/2          lj+
where R2 is the twelve—month bill rate.9

         The unexpected change in the expected six-month inflation rate is the

difference between the observed change and that expected, EMr =             —
                                                                   E1(ir)
where E1(T) can be computed analogously to E1(R) from inflation rates over




9Following Mishkin (1982), the difference between the expected and forward
rates was hypothesized to depend on interest-rate uncertainty. When this was
approximated by our measure of inflation uncertainty (see below) the measure
                                                                   ,

the next six and twelve months that were expected six months ago. These data

are based on Livingston's survey.10

      For the output variable, we use industrial production because it is

available monthly and forecasts of six-month changes in it can be derived from

the Livingston survey. The unexpected percentage change is computed as



                          IP —
                                 E1(IP)

                                  —l




where IP is the level of the industrial production index during the last month

(June or December) of the period.

      Following Levi and Makin (1979) and Makin and Tanzi (1983), the change

in the standard deviation of expected six—month inflation is assumed to be

linearly related to the change in the standard deviation of the expectations

of Livingston survey respondents.

      To my knowledge, there are no available appropriate survey measures of

anticipated monetary growth. Two variables were tested: the actual growth

rates during the previous one and two years. For the monetary variable, the

adjusted monetary base computed by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis was

employed. Because the results were very similar, we only report equations in

which unanticipated monetary growth defined as the difference between the

growth rate during the current semiannual period and the average growth rate

in the previous two years.

      The consumer—credit-control variable is defined as plus one in June

1980, minus one in December 1980, and zero elsewhere.

                             B. Estimates for 1960—79

       Daily—average bill—rate data first became available in 1960. Thus the

 maximum estimation span is the end of 1960 to the end of 1982 or 45 semiannual

 observations. Equations (l.l)—(l.4) in Table 1 are estimated on data prior to

 the gyration of rates in 1980 and the high levels of late 1980 through the

middle of 1982.11 In (1.1), only the expected change in the bill rate is

 employed as a regressor. Equations (l.2)-(l.4) are estimates of equation (5)

utilizing different specifications of t,     the   marginal-tax rate on personal

interest income. In (1.2), the tax rate is assumed to be constant, and the

constant value is embedded in the coefficients on all variables except the

expected change in rate. In (1.3), Peek's estimate of , discussed earlier is

employed. In (1.4), an estimate of t   is    extracted from Salomon and Hutzler

yields on six-month Treasury bills and prime tax-exempt securities, the

estimate being 1 less the ratio of the exempt to taxable yields for the first

day of the relevant month.

      The near zero coefficient on the expected change in rate in (1.1) is

consistent with the recent results of Shiller et al (1983) and Mankiw and

Summers (1983). Note, however, that the coefficient is not measured with

precision; the estimate is not significantly different from 0.8, although it

does differ from unity. When unexpected changes in expected inflation,

industrial production, and base growth (as well as the change in the standard

deviation of expected inflation) are added to the equation to capturesome of

unexpected changes in interest rates [see equation (1.2)), the coefficient on

the expected percentage change in rate becomes significantly greater than zero

at the 0.05 level and within a standard error of unity. The coefficients on



     these equations all variables, including the constant term, have been
divided by R, in order to reduce heteroscedasticity of the residuals.

the inflation and economic-activity variables are also significantly greater

than zero; the coefficients on the change in inflation uncertainty and the

money surprise are about a standard error greater than zero.

      Comparison of equations (1.3) and (1.4) with (1.2) reveals only minor

differences. Because l-r is embedded in the coefficients in (1.2) -—      except
the constant and that on EtR --     the other coefficients in (1.3) and (1.4) must

be divided by the respective mean values of l—r to make them comparable to

(1.2) and to each other. These means are 0.70 and 0.57. When this division

is made, no coefficient in (1.3) or (1.4) differs from its counterpart in

(1.2) by as much as 7½ percent. Moreover, the explanatory powers of the three

equations are virtually identical.      (This contrasts with Peek's finding that

division by 1-t   significantly   improves the fit.) Given the uncertainty

regarding the correct measurement of r, this does not seem surprising.

      Equation (1.5) in Table 1 extends the estimation period through the

middle of 1983. The coefficients exhibit remarkable stability in face of the

unprecedented changes in interest rates in the 1980-mid83 period; as does the

equation standard error. The measured increase in explanatory power is

attributable entirely to the ability of the consumer-credit dummy to capture

the sharp seesaw in the bill rate in 1980. To test for a change in structure,

a zero-one dummy variable assuming the one value after 1979 was interacted

with the three significant variables: EAR, UMr and U%AQ. The t ratios on

these three variables ranged from 0.1 to 0.6 and the equation standard error

increased.




             C. The Impact of the Explanatory Variables, 1960-82

     Expected increases in the six—month bill rate never exceeded a full
                                    —14—



percentage point in the 1960-82 Span, but they were in the 65-100 basis point

range in 13 semiannual periods. While declines were larger than 65 basis

points in only four periods, these include nearly one and a half and over two

percentage point expected declines in the first halves of 1980 and 1981. The

0.72 estimated coefficient in equation (1.2) of Table 1 suggests that 72

percent of these expectations were translated into actual movements.

      The estimates and underlying data imply some major impacts of

unanticipated changes in expected inflation. Substantial unanticipated

increases occurred following the oil price shocks, raising the bill rate by 3

percentage points in 1973-74 and by nearly 5 points in 1979-80. In contrast,

the bill rate fell by a full percentage point in the first half of 1975 and by

nearly 4½ points in 198l-mid83 because of unanticipated declines in expected

inflation.

      unanticipated industrial-production growth (or decline) also had

substantial effects on the bill rate over parts of the 1960-82 period. The

unexpectedly strong recovery following the Kennedy-Johnson tax cuts in the

early l960s raised the bill rate by 1 and 3/4 percentage points in the 1963-66

span. Similarly, the surprisingly strong rebound from the middle of 1980 to

the middle of 1981 increased the bill rate by nearly a percentage point. On

the other hand, the unexpectedly sharp declines in output from the middle of

1973 to the middle of 1975 and from the middle of 1981 to the end of 1982

lowered the bill rate by 1 1/4 and 1 3/4 percentage points, respectively.

      Monetary surprises and changes in inflation uncertainty have not had as

large impacts on the bill rate as have the other variables. Most importantly,

the increased uncertainty accompanying the rise in inflation in the 1973-mid74

and l978—mid8l periods each raised the bill rate by about 3/4 of a percentage

point. The subsequent declines in uncertainty lowered the rate by somewhat
                                    —15—




less. Positive money surprises increased the bill rate by about 40 basis

points in the early 1960s, in 1967—68 and in l977—mid78; negative surprises

lowered the rate by a like amount in l969-mid70 and 1981.



                          III. The Recent Experience

      The actual and forecasted changes in the bill rate for semi-annual

segments of the 1980-mid83 period are reported in Table 2. The forecasts are

based upon equation (1.2). As can be seen in column 3, there are large,

nearly offsetting, forecast errors in the first and second halves of 1980

(owing to the imposition and removal of credit controls); the equation

underforecasts by a percentage point in 1981 (the forecasted decline is 4 1/2

percentage points, not the 3 1/2 observed); large, somewhat offsetting errors

occur in 1982 (the equation forecasts a roughly continuous decline, rather

than the observed increase and then sharp decline); and about half of the rise

in early 1983 is forecast. Given the offsetting nature of the errors, the

cumulative error on the level of the bill rate (indicated in column 4 of Table

1) is small. By late 1982 and early 1983, the forecasted bill rate was less

than a percentage point below the actual.

      Table 3 indicates the sources of the rise and fall in the bill rate

between June 1978 and June 1983. Eighty percent (6.70 percentage points) of

the 8.42 increase to December 1980 is explained by the equation. Over 5

points is due to unexpected increases in anticipated inflation, two-thirds of

a point to unexpected increases in output, a half point to the increase in

inflation uncertainty and a third point to other factors. Because the

expected inflation rate rose by only 4.1 percentage points, the real interest

rate increased by 4.3 percentage points. Of this rise the estimated equation

explains 2.6 (6.7 -   4.1) points or sixty percent. The estimated relationship

also explains 60 percent of the extraordinarily high average real bill rates

in the early 1980s)2

      One and a half percentage points of the 2.6 percentage-point explained

increase in the real bill rate can be attributed to the unanticipated

increases in industrial production, inflation uncertainty and other factors

noted above. However, the primary single factor contributing to the rise was

unexpected increases in inflation far in excess of the actual 4.1 percentage

point increase. From mid1978 to midl979, no increase was expected, but a two

point rise occurred. From late 1979 to late 1980 half point increases were

anticipated, while the actual expected rate rose by another two points. In

total, the cumulated unexpected increase in anticipated inflation over this

span was a full 7 percentage points.13 Even though the estimated coefficient

on expected inflation increases is only 0.74, implying that the nominal bill

rate rises by only three-quarters of a point for every point of unanticipated

increase in inflation, the forecasted nominal bill rate rises by 5.2 points

because of this 7 point increase and thus the real bill rate rises by over a

full point.

      Between the end of 1980 and the middle of 1983, the bill rate declined




l2 was noted in Section I that the real six-month bill rate was 4 3/4
percentage points too high, relative to the l970s, for the 5 observations from
802 to 822. The average cumulative forecast error for our equation for those
periods is a little under 2 percentage points, indicating that only 40 percent
of the high average value need be attributed to unidentified factors.

13These large errors are not surprising given the second oil price shock and
the nearly 4 percentage point increase in home mortgage rates, both of which
heavily influenced the CPI, during this period. A crude measure of inflation
surprises is the difference between the all-items CPI and the all-items less
food, energy and home purchase and finance, the excluded items being difficult
to predict (especially when an oil shock occurs). For 1978, 1979 and 1980,
this difference was 2.1, 5.8 and 2.5 percentage points, respectively.
                                      —19--




 over 6 1/2 percentage points. This decline, which was almost entirely a fall

 in nominal rates (expected inflation decreased by 6.2 percentage points), is

 fully explained by our estimation equation. All the factors that contributed

 to the early increase in rates reversed themselves, inducing the decline.

 Unexpected declines in industrial production, inflation uncertainty, and the

 catch-all other tended to lower the real rate by almost 2 1/2 percentage

 points, but rough equality between unexpected and actual declines in

 inflation, along with the only partial (0.74) response of nominal rates to

 unexpected changes in inflation, tended to raise the estimated real rate,

 resulting in virtually no change.

      At this point, one might ask about the impact of the unprecedented

federal deficits. A simple response is that deficits were not unprecedented

through the period analyzed. From midl98l to mid1982, the high-employment

deficit was only $12 billion or 0.3 percent of high-employment GNP. In the

year midl982 to mid1983, this deficit jumped to $48 billion, but the ratio to

high employment GNP, 1.1 percent, was still no greater than in 1975. High-

employment deficits have been large only since the third year of the personal

tax cut went into effect in July 1983.14 Thus there is no reason to believe

that short-term Treasury rates were high in the l98l-mid83 period because of

the deficits. On the other hand, short-term rates could now (1984) be higher

than they would be in the absence of the structural deficit)5




14Von Furstenburg (1981) has documented a systematic tendency for lawmakers to
cut taxes during rec.essions and generally run large high-employment deficits
in early stages of economic recoveries.

15Hendershott and Shilling (1982) calculated that the ERTA of 1981 could raise
real interest rates by nearly two percentage points in the new equilibrium
owing to higher steady-state business investment. For an analysis suggesting
that the cuxnraulation of deficits raised three-year Treasury rates in 1983, se.

                                 IV.     Summary

      Changes in six-month bill rates over semiannual periods since 1960 have

been successfully related to expected changes and to surprises. The latter

include unanticipated changes in expected inflation, in the growth of

industrial production and base money, and in inflation uncertainty, as well as

the imposition and removal of consumer credit controls in 1980. Surprise

revisions in inflation expectations had large effects (3 to 5 percentage

points) and errors in forecasts of industrial-production growth had moderate

impacts (1 to 2 percentage points) on the six-month bill rate in a number of

periods. Monetary-growth surprises and changes in inflation uncertainty had

smaller positive impacts.

      Our estimates provide support for the expectations theory; there is

information content in forward rates. While this content is swamped by the

impact of surprises in equations explaining rate changes in terms of forward

rates alone, the content is clear when proxies for the surprises are included

in the equations.

      Real six—month bill rates rose by over 4 percentage points between June

1978 and December 1980 and averaged 4 3/4 percentage points more in 1981 and

1982 than they did in the l970s. Forecasts from a reduced-form equation

estimated over the 1960-79 period "explain" sixty percent of both the increase

and the high 1981-82 average. The primary cause of the high real rates is the

asymmetry between increases and decreases in unexpected changes in anticipated

inflation relative to observed changes. Between June 1978 and December 1980,

unexpected increases exceeded observed by 3 percentage points (7 versus 4).

Between December 1980 and June 1983, unexpected and observed declines were

roughly equal (6 1/4 percentage points). The estimation equation also
                                    —21--




explains the full 7 1/2 percentage point decline in the nominal six—month rate

during 1981 and 1982, although rates did not come down as rapidly as the

equation predicts.

      The current paper tells only part of the recent interest rate story.

The full story requires the modeling of expected changes in all the variables

utilized in this study: the bill rate itself, anticipated inflation,

industrial production growth, monetary growth, tax rates and expenditures

policies. This is an agenda for future research.
