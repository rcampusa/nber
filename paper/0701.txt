               Investment Strategy in an Inflationary Environment



                                    ABSTRACT



     This paper addresses the issue of how an investor concerned about the
real rate of return on his investment portfolio should allocate his funds
among four major asset classes: stocks, bonds, bills and commodity futures
contracts. It employs the Markowitz mean—variance framework to derive
estimates of the pre—tax, real risk—return tradeoff curve currently facing
an investor in the U.S. capital markets.

     Some of the major findings are: 1) Bills are the cornerstone of any
low—risk investment strategy. The minimum—risk portfolio has a mean real
rate of return of zero and a standard deviation of about 1%. The slope of
the tradeoff curve is initially 1, but it declines rapidly as one progresses
up the curve to higher mean rates of return. 2) Stocks offer the highest
mean and are also riskiest. 3) Bonds play a prominent part in portfolios
which lie in the midsection of the tradeoff curve, although not much would
be lost if these instruments were eliminated. 4) Commodity futures contracts
are the only asset whose returns are positively correlated with inflation.
By adding them to the portfolios of stocks, bonds and bills, it is possible
to achieve any target mean real rate of return with less risk.

              IN7ESIMENT STRATEGY IN AN INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT

                                    Zvi Bodie
              For presentation at the NEER Debt/Equity Conference
                   in   Williamsburg, Virginia, April 2, 1981




     The basic premise of this paper is that ultimately what is of   concern
to an investor, whether a household or an institutional investor such as a life

insurance company or a pension fund, is the real value of its investments in

terms of purchasing power over consumer goods and services. The issue to be

addressed is what investment strategies make sense in an economic environment in

which a major factor (although certainly not the only one) to be considered

is substantial uncertainty about the future level of the prices of those goods

and services. By investment strater I mean decisions about how to allocate

investible funds among four major asset classes: common stocks and other equity

investments, long—term fixed—interest debt instruments, short—term or variable—

rate debt instruments, and other "inflation—hedging" assets such as commodity

futures contracts or commodity—linked bonds.

     The paper is organized as follows. I will first discuss why it is real or

inflation—adjusted rates of return and their uncertainty which ought to be the

main concern of investors. I will then present an analytical framework for for-

mulating investment strategy, examine the historical record of real rates of

return on the four asset categories, and derive estimates of alternative risk—

return tradeoff curves. Finally, I will discuss the implications of my findings

for individual and institutional asset allocation policies.
                                         —2—

I.   Thy It Is Real Investment Returns and Their Uncertainty That tter.
     With respect to the individual investor, i.e. the household, there can

be little doubt that the dollar value of its investment portfolio is not what

counts, 'out rather its real value in terms of purchasing power. It follows,

therefore, that households will be concerned about the real or inflation—

adjusted rate of return rather than the nominal rate of return on their

investments. If the future rate of inflation were known with certainty, it

would make no difference whether households were making their portfolio deci-

sions on the basis of real or nominal rates of return. The expected real rate

on any particular asset would just be the nominal rate less the known inflation

rate, and its real risk would be the same as its noiainal risk. But in an

environment of uncertainty about future inflation there can be a great dif-

ference between the real and nominal risk associated with an asset. The most

extreme example is the case of conventional bonds and mortgages which offer a

guaranteed nominal return to an investor, but a highly uncertain real one. As

inflation becomes more uncertain, these instruments become riskier and less

attractive to households.

     But what about institutional investors, should they be concerned with real

or nominal rates of return? Institutional investors are financial inter-

mediaries between the nonfinancial business sector and the household sector of

the economy. Their ultimate survival and success depend on providing households

with the kinds of financial assets that households want to hold. In our infla—

tionary environment contractual savings plans such as ordinary life insurance

policies, which offer guaranteed nominal cash flows, and money—fixed annuities

have become unattractive.    In order to maintain their viability, life insurance

companies must respond by   offering   new products and adjusting their investment
                                         —3—

 policies accordingly. In a previous paper I have discussed the feasibility of

  indexed annuities as a po ile innovation for providing stable real retirement

 income in a inflationary environment, and
                                               many other suggestions along these
 lines are bound to be forthcoming in the future.1 The central concern of

 investment policy in this new environment ll surely be real rates of return

 and their uncertainty.

      at about pension plans and pension funds?       Wny shod they care about
 real rates of return? Under many corporate
                                                dc±ined—henefjt pension plans, the
 staing level of the retirement benefit promdsed to the worker is based on an

 average of the worker's wage in the last several years prior to retirement.
                                                                                    If, as
 in the past, wages increase in tandem with consuner prices, then such a plants

 liabilities are in effect indexed during the phase of benefit accrual.

 Furthermore, it is likely that the future evolution of pension plans is going to

be in the direction of at least paial indexation of benefits in the post—

retirement phase too. Thus, at least these pension funds have to plan their

investment strategy with a focus on real rates of return too.


II. The Theory of Portfolio Selection.

     The analytical framework which underlies the investment strategies I will

present in this paper is known as mean—variance analysis, and it goes back

almost thirty years to the pioneering work by Harry Markowitz.2 The basic pre—

mise underlying this approach is that the investor is risk—averse, that is to

say, given a choice between two investments offering the same mean (or average)

rate of return the investor would always choose the one that has less risk.

Risk in the context of this analysis is identified with the unpredictability or

uncertainty of achieving one's expected rate of return and is measured by its

variance or standard deviation.
                                       _'4 -



     The investor's decision process is divided into two stages.    In the first

stage he computes what his risk—return opportunities are, and in the second he

chooses the risk—return combination which suits him 'best.   In stage one, the

investor starts by finding the minimum—risk strategy, determining the nean rate

of return associated with it, and then proceeding to derive other portfolios

which offer higher and higher means with the least possible risk. The result of

this part of the process is a tradeoff curve showing the terms—of—trade 'between

risk and expected return.3

     The inputs needed to generate the tradeoff curve are the means and standard

deviations of the real rates of return on the individual assets and the correla-

tions among them. In the following section we examine what these parameters

have 'been over the past 27 years and discuss our assumptions about their current

values.


III. Inflation and Asset Returns: The Historical Record.

     Table 1 contains the historical record of real pre—tax rates of return on

each of four categories of assets for the period 1953 through 1979. The measure of

the price level that was used in adjusting these rates of return was the

Personal Consumption Expenditures Deflator published by the U.S. Department of

Cormuerce. This measure was chosen rather than the Department of Labor's

Consumer Price Index 'because serious doubts about the adequacy of the CPI as a

measure of true inflation have been raised in the past seven or eight years.

The main objection to the CPI is that it gives too such weight to new mortgage

rates in the computation of shelter costs. The last two columns in Thble 1 pre-

sent the rate of inflation as measured first by the Consumer Price Index, then
                                         —5—


as measured by the Personal Consumption    Expenditures Deflator.   There are serious

d:fferences between the two Eres, esrecally in l91 and l99; but as the

correlation coefficient of .9T reported at the bottom of Table 1 indicates,

they are highly positively correlated.

     The first column in Table 1 is the real rate of return on a policy of

"rolling over" thirty day easury bills, and is representative of the rate of

return on money—market instruments. This is by far the least volatile series,

with a standard   deviation of only l.li%. This is because over this period,
short—term interest rates have tended to follow rather closely movements in the
rate of inflation.

     Of course, this is not a coincidence. All     irket—determined   interest rates

contain an "inflation premium," which reflects expectations about the declining

purchasing power of the money borrowed over the life of the loan. As the rate

of inflation has increased in recent years, so too has the inflation premium

built into interest rates. While long—term as well as short—term interest rates

contain such a premium, conventional long—term bonds lock the investor into the

current interest rate for the life of the bond. If long—term interest rates on

new bonds subsequently rise as a result of unexpected inflation, the funds

already locked in can be released only by selling the bonds on the secondary

market at a price well below their    face value. But if   an investor buys only

short—term bonds with an average maturity of about 30 days, then the interest

rate he earns will lag behind changes in the inflation rate by at most one

month.

     The problem with money—market instruments, however, is their low rate of

return. Over the last 2?   years,   the average pre—tax, inflation—adjusted rate of

         using the PCE Deflator inflation rate. The rate of return on conmiodity
         futures in column (4) was calculated differently, as explained in the text.

 return on money—market instruments has been barely half a
                                                           percent per year.                 In
 the most recent six—year period, that return has actually been negative.
 Perhaps    the most likely scenario for the future is that inflation—adjusted

 returns ll hover around zero, i.e. ,         the interest rate ll be about equal to
 the rate of inflation.

         Column 2   presents   the real rate of return an investor would   have    earned    by
 investing    in U.S. Ieasury bonds with       a   twenty year nturity. The assumption
 underlying   this series is that the investor bought a twenty—year bond at the

beginning of each year and sold it at the end. His return therefore includes

both coupon interest and capital gains or losses. As the relatively low mean

and high standard deviation indicate, the past twenty—seven years was a bad

period for the investor in long—term bonds. Capital losses caused by unan-

ticipated increases in interest rates tended to more than cancel the coupon

yield over this period.

     It would probably be a mistake to assume that the mean real rate of return

on long—term government bonds in the future is going to be the           —. 87%   per year
that it was over the 1953 to 1979 period. A more reasonable approach to esti-

mating the ex ante mean real rate would be to take the yield to maturity on

long—term government bonds and subtract an estimate of the mean rate of infla-

tion expected to prevail over the next 20 years. When we do this we find a mean

real rate of return on U.S. Preasury bonds of 2% per year.

     Column   3 in    Thble 1 presents the real rate    of return on   the Standard and
PoorTs   Composite Index of common stocks which is a value—weighted stock port—

folio of the five—hundred largest corporations in the United States. The return
                                           —8—


 includes dividends and capital gains. The mean real rate over our sample period was

 1.08% per year, but we will use 10% per year as our estimate of the ex ante mean

 in our computations of the tradeoff curve. There are two main reasons for doing

 so. The first is that several recent careful studies of the real rate of return

on unlevered corporate capital (i.e. ,    the    return to debt and equity combined)

indicate it to be in the   range of 6   to 1% per year. Since the average

debt/equity ratio for the S & P 500 companies is about 1/3, and the after—tax

real interest rate on corporate borrowing is quite negative, a 10% mean real

rate of return on levered equity seems plausible.5 The second reason is

that 10% per year is the estimate of the mean real rate of return on the S & P

500 derived by Robert C. Merton in a recent National Bureau of Economic Research

study employing a new estimation technique, which incorporates more information

than just the simple average of past rates.6

       Finally, let us focus our   attention on column )4   in Thble 1 which presents

the   annual rate of return one would   have earned on a well—diversified portfolio

of commodity futures contracts     over the 1953 to   1919 period. The rate of return
on   a futures contract reflects the proportional change in the futures price over
the holding period. The series was generated by assuming a "buy and hold" stra—
tegy whereby contracts were entered into at quarterly intervals, held for three
months, and then liquidated. The number of commodities increases from 13 in
1953 to 22 by   the end of the period. Table 2      presents   the list   of   commodities
and the year in which each was added to the portfolio. The portfolio was
assumed to consist of equal dollar amounts invested in each commodity contract.
       The rates of return for commodity futures listed in column )4 of Table 1

require an interpretation that is different from the real rates in columns 1

through 3. When an investor takes a long position in a futures contract he does

not buy it in the sense that he would buy a stock or bond or the physical corn—

modity itself; rather, he agrees to purchase the commodity for a specified price

at a certain point in the future. The           commodities   exchange which acts as an

intermediary requires all parties to a futures contract to post bond called

'trnargin"   to   guarantee   performance.1   Investors are permitted to post reasury

bills, on which they continue to earn the interest, so the funds used as

margin are therefore not strictly speaking an investment in commodity futures.

The rates of return reported in column 1 should therefore be interpreted as the

addition to the total investment portfolio rate of return the investor would

have earned in each year had he taken a position in commodity futures with a

face value equal to his total investment in other assets.

      In order for a buy—and—hold strategy in the futures market to be profitable

it is not enough for spot prices to be rising; they must rise by more than was

anticipated in the futures price at the time the contract was entered into. On

average one might expect the spot price forecasts implicit in futures prices to

be right, and therefore expect the mean rate of return on futures contracts to

be zero.8 But what is more important for our purposes, futures contracts will

yield a positive rate of return when there are unanticipated increases in            spot
prices, and it is this feature which makes them valuable as an inflation hedge.

      The critical parameters which determine how valuable commodity futures are

in this role, and which play a crucial role in determining the shape of the tra-

deoff curve, are the correlation coefficients presented at the bottom of Thble

1.   Perhaps      the most significant thing to notice is that the real rates of

return on bills, bonds, and stocks are all negatively correlated with inflation

and all positively correlated with each other. But commodity futures are posi-
                                                                                        -11—

tively correlated with the rate of inflation and negatively correlated with the

real rates of return on the other major asset categories, and therefore can

serve to reduce the risk associated with any portfolio containing them.

       The mean rate of return on our buy—and—hold strategy in coimnodity futures

during the 1953 to 1919 period was 7.13% per year, a strikingly large

number, and one which may                                not      be an accurate indicator for the future. In com-

puting the tradeoff curve we will assume a rran of zero, although we will also

       Before proceeding to our presentation of the risk—return tradeoff curves in

the next section, let us summarize the assumptions that we are making about the

key parameters relating to the real rates of return on bills, bonds, stocks and

commodity futures and the interrelationships among them. With regard to the

means, we assume zero on bills, 2% on bonds, 10% on stocks, and zero on commodity

futures. With regard to the standard deviations and correlations we assume the

ones reported in Table 1.


IV.    The Risk—Return Tradeoff.
      We will begin our analysis of the risk—return tradeoff by looking at port-

folios consisting only of stocks and bills. The minimum—risk investment stra-

tegy is to invest                    entirely                 in bills, in which case one's mean real rate of

return would            be      zero and one's standard deviation i.i4%.                                              At the other extreme
one   could invest everything in stocks, in which case the mean real rate of
return       on the portfolio would be 10% and the standard deviation 19.46%. Table 3

shows us the combinations of                                    mean and standard deviation of real rate of return
an investor would achieve by going from one of these extremes to the other.9

Figure 1 graphs this tradeoff curve as curve 1.                                                              For mean values   above 1% per

year, curve 1              is     very close to a straight line with a slope of .53,                                              indicating

 an increase of about 2 percentage points in standard deviation for
                                                                    every 1 per—
 centage point increase in mean.

        In order to provide a clearer picture of the nleaning of a movement along

 the risk—return tradeoff curve, we have graphed in Figure 2 three probability

 distributions, corresponding to the first three points on curve 1.               They are

 based on the assumption that the distribution of the real rate of return on the

 portfolios is normal, i.e. a "bell—shaped" curve. The first corresponds to the

 portfolio consisting of bills only, which has a mean of zero and a standard

 deviation of 1.Th%; the second to the portfolio which has 90 percent invested in

bills and 10 percent invested in stocks with a mean real rate of return of 1%

per year and a standard deviation of 2.%; and the third to a portfolio which

has eighty percent invested in bills, twenty percent in stocks with a mean of 2%

per year and a standard deviation of )4.2)4%.            As the proportion of the portfolio

invested in stocks and therefore the mean go up, the bell—shaped curve shifts

the right and becomes more flat or stretched out, indicating greater upside

potential but also greater downside risk.

        Now let us consider what the tradeoff curve would look like if the investor

were    restricted to combinations of bonds and stocks.             This curve is tabulated in

Table   )4   and   graphed as curve 2 in Figure 1. Note that as we move up curve 2               4k 4
froma bonds—only portfolio to one containing a little stock, the standard
deviation actually falls a bit before starting to grow. The minimum—risk stock—
bond portfolio contains 6.)4%      stocks   and 93.6%    bonds   and has a mean and standard
deviation of 2.51% per year and 6.61%,         respectively.J-0      This implies that no
risk—averse investor wnuld ever rationally choose to hold a bonds—only
portfolio, since by substituting a small amount            of    stock for some of the bonds,
he could both increase his expected rate of return and reduce his risk.

        As a comparison of curves 1 and 2 makes   clear,   at mean real rates of   return
greater then 3.5% the stock—bond portfolios have less risk for any mean than do

the corresponding stock—bill portfolios. On the other hand, for mean values

below 3.5%, stock—bill portfolios have less risk for any mean than do the

corresponding stock—bond portfolios. Perhaps more important, however, is the

fact that very low risk strategies are unattainable using only stocks and bonds.

The mnimurn—risk stock—bond portfolio still has     a   standard deviation of 6.6)4%,

which   is quite high compared to the lower risk levels attainable with bills.
      Now let us consider portfolios containing all three assets: stocks, bonds
and   bills. The process of computing the tradeoff curve in this case is more

complicated than before, because for each value of mean real rate of return one

must use an optimization procedure to find that portfolio which has the lowest

standard deviation.—' The resulting tradeoff curve and portfolio proportions are

presented in Table 5 and Figure 3 which allows us to compare the risk—return tradeoff

curve derived using all three assets to the two previously derived curves from

Figure 1.

      The main improvement comes at the low risk, low return end of the curve. The

minimur—risk strategy is still to invest in bills only, but as we move up the curve

we replace bills with increasing amounts of both bonds and stocks. This continues up

to a mean of 5% per year. At higher means bills disappear from the portfolio and the

proportion of bonds declines; curve 3 just becomes identical to curve 2.           One point

of special interest on curve 3, which is not tabulated in Table       5,   is the point

having the same mean as the minimum—risk stock—bond portfolio on curve 2, i.e. 2.5%

per year.    It consists of a portfolio with 53%   bills,   28% bonds and 19% stocks and

has a standard deviation of )4.8%, as opposed to the 6.6)4%      standard deviation of the
minimum—risk stock—bond portfolio. Thus by adding bills to the minimum—risk

stock—bond portfolio one can achieve a substantial reduction in risk with no

loss in expected return.

         Now we are ready to introduce coimnodity futures contracts into
                                                                         our

 portfolio. It is important to remember that when we take a position in com-

 modity futures we are not actually using up any of our funds; our funds are

 invested in stocks, bonds and bills. We are simply taking a position which has

 a    face value equal to some specified proportion of the total amount invested in

 these other assets. The only restriction on our portfolio imposed by the

 futures    contracts is that we must have an amount invested in bills equal to at
 least 10 percent of the position in commodity futures, to serve as margin.
         The results with commodity futures included are presented in Table 6              and
 Figure .      Note   that the minimu—risk strategy is still to invest 100 percent of
 our    funds in bills, but it is      now optimal to hedge that       investment   with a small
 position   in our well—diversified commodity futures portfolio by taking a long

 position with a face value equal to            percent of the investment in bills. Under
 our assumption that the mean rate of return on commodity futures is zero, the

mean real rate of return on our portfolio will remain
                                                                    unaffected, but there will
be a reduction in standard deviation.

        Comparing   curves 3    and   in Figure ,
                                              see that for any mean real rate of

return, introducing the right amount of commodity futures contracts into our
portfolio enables us to reduce our standard deviation by a significant amount.
The reduction in standard deviation increases

and is at its greatest value at a nan of 9% per year. Introducing commodity

futures shifts the tradeoff curve to the left by .17% at the minimum—risk end of

the    curve and by .93%   at   the other end.
       Looking at the last four columns in Table 6           and   comparing them with   the
last   three columns of Table 5       we   see that the addition of commodity futures

 contracts    does not change   the   portfolio proportions of stocks, bonds and bills

 by much. The major effect is that bills do not disappear entirely from the

 portfolio when we move to high mean real rates of return because there is a need

 for    bills to serve as margin on the commodity futures contracts. We       also     see
 that as we move to higher mean real rates of return and the investment in stocks
 goes up, there is a steady increase in the size of the relative position in corn—
 rnodity   futures, although it never exceeds 3)4 percent    of the total value of the
 investment   portfolio.

        What is the effect on the tradeoff curve of assuming a positive mean rate

of return on commodity futures? Table 7 and Figure 5          present the results of -7
assuming a 2% per year mean rate. Perhaps the best way to describe the effect

is as an upward shift of the entire curve. At any level of risk it becomes

possible to achieve a higher mean real rate of return, with the gain being

larger the higher the level of risk. Even the minimum—risk portfolio now has a

positive mean rate of return. It now becomes possible to attain a 10% mean real

rate of return with a standard deviation of only 16.39% instead of 19.)46%, by

holding a portfolio consisting of 86% stocks, 8% bonds, 6% bills and a position

in commodity futures equal to 59%       of   the portfolio's value.

        It should be stressed once again before ending this part of the paper that

the    role of commodity futures stems from the fact that it is       the only asset
whose  returns are positively correlated with inflation. The reason the propor-
tion of commodity futures in the portfolio rises in Table 6 as the investment in
stocks goes up is that the real return on stocks is negatively correlated with
inflation. I have performed the experiment of deriving the tradeoff curve under
the assumption that the real return on stocks is uncorrelated with inflation,

and the result is that there would be virtually no role for commodity futures

contracts in that case.         It is their value as a hedge against inflation, to off-

set the inflation risk associated with the investment in stocks, that accounts

for commodity futures' significant role.


V. Implications of Findings for Asset Allocation.

     The first implication of our findings is that bills are the cornerstone of

any low   risk investment strater. Here it          is important to keep in mind that

bills   for   us are a proxy for all money market instruments and floating—rate

debt. ir results indicate that in order to achieve a low degree of risk, by

which we mean a standard deviation below ).%,        at   least half of the portfolio

would have to be invested in these securities. Of course, along with the low

risk comes a low return.

     Who      might   be interested in a low—risk strate,r, despite its low return?

The prime candidates are probably retired people with a small—to—moderate accu-

mulation of assets and a low tolerance for risk. In Great Britain the

government has for years been selling bonds bearing a zero real interest rate on

a voluntary and restricted basis to citizens aged 65 and            over.   These bonds have

proven to be a very popular          investment.
        Our findings     carry two   important messages to institutional investors such
as life insurance companies. The first is that households can currently provide
themselves      with a fairly safe pre—tax real rate of return of about zero by

investing      in money—market funds. Therefore any new kind of contractual savings
plan would have to offer a similar rate. The second            is   that if the   insurance

industry wanted to offer savings plans and/or annuities with full            or   partial

indexation they could hedge almost all of the investment risk by             investing   pri—
                                         —27—

 rriarily   in corey market instruments. In fact, if they wanted to avoid the

 investment risk altogether, they could offer them as variable annuities.

       What can we say about the role of bonds and other long—term fixed interest

 securities? The first point suggested by our findings is that one can get along

without bonds with very little loss of portfolio efficiency; the improvement in

the risk—return tradeoff that one gets from adding bonds to stocks and bills is

relatively minor. Some institutional portfolio managers might say that the risk

associated with long—term bonds is exaggerated n xrr findings because I have

included in rqy measure of annual returns unrealized capital gains and losses.

Most insurance companies and pension funds do not count unrealized capital gains

or losses on long—berm bonds as part of their annual rate of return. But even

disregarding them, any instrument which commits the investor to a fixed nominal

flow of coupon income and a money—fixed principal mmount at maturity is in fact

extremely risky even for an investor with a long-run horizon, in fact, espe—

cially for such an investor.

      Many institutional investors have already come to the conclusion that long—

term fixed—interest securities are too risky relative to their expected return

and have simply stopped investing in them. If that trend continues we can

expect to see the disappearance of these financial instruments frOm the U.S.

capital market. In Great Britain the market for long—term fixed—interest cor-

porate debt disappeared rather quickly in l97 and has not reappeared since.        11b


the extent that this market is to maintain its viabiity in the U. S.,   the mean

real rate of return will have to be higher than in the past.

      Finally, what are the implications of our findings for investments in com-

modity futures contracts or other inflation—hedging assets? Our results mdi—
                                         —28—



cate that as long as stocks are negatively correlated with inflation, there is

going to be a need for some kind of asset that haS the property that its rate of

return is positively correlated with inflation. Commodity futures contracts

have the considerable advantage of already being in existence and therefore can

be used right away.

       There are some new types of financial instruments that have started to

appear and may play an increasingly significant role in this regard in the

future. I am referring specifically to commodity—linked bonds, that is to say,

bonds whose principal and/or interest is linked to the price of some commodity.

The silver—linked bonds issued by the Sunshine Mining Corporation are an

example. Bonds linked to the price of petroleum and other natural resources

owned by   the   issuing corporation are being actively discussed by   the   institu-

tional   investment community. These securities would share with commodity
futures contracts the property that their rate of return wnuld be positively
correlated with the rate of inflation. If significant inflation persists in the
future, these kinds of securities will probably come to play an important role
in   investment portfolios.

          Capital," Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Washington, D.C., 1980,

5   The   relationship between the rate of return on levered equity, ROE, the rate
    of return on total capital, ROC, the after—tax interest rate on debt, I, and
    the   debt/equity ratio is given by        the formula:
                   ROE =         + (R0C—I)    Debt
                           ROC
                                              Equity
                                                —30—


    Assuming a 15% per year nominal interest rate on corporate debt, a 50% tax
    rate, and a 12% per year expected rate of inflation, we get a real after—tax

    interest rate on the debt of _1.5%            per   year. Substituting this value into

    the formula for I, 6.5%        per year for ROC and 1/3 for the debt/equity ratio we
    find that ROE        10% per year.

7   Margins on commodity futures contracts are typically quite low, ranging from
    7   to   10 percent of the face value of the contract. For more detail about the

    commodity futures series see Z.          Bodie and V. Rosansky, "Risk and Return in

    Commodity Futures," Financial Analysts Journal, May/June 1980.

    point. For further discussion and references see Podie and Rosansky, op. cit.


9   The formula for computing the standard deviation of the real rate of return

    on any portfolio consisting of stocks and bills is:


    SD       (lx)2 SD +     X2   SD2 +   x(1x)B   SDb SD5

    where    SDb   and SD represent      the standard deviations on bills    and   stocks,

    respectively, and R the correlation coefficient between them. X is the pro-

    portion of the portfolio invested in stocks, and therefore 1—X is the propor-

    tion invested in bills.

10 The formula for finding the minimum—risk proportion of stocks is:


                                 2
              xmm   —
                    —       SDb—RSDbSDS
                              + SD2 - 2RSDbSDS
                          SDb2




   Note that when we combine bills with stocks, this formula yields a negative

  number for the proportion of stocks, which means we would actually have to sell

   some stock short In order to minimize risk. This explains why curve 1 in Figure

  1 does not have the same shape as curve 2 at its lower end.
