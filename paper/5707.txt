        Analysts   using the Health and Retirement     Survey (HRS) often require information      on

earnings, labor market attachment, and social security benefits in order to better understand the

factors affecting retirement and well-being at older ages. To this end, several derived variables were

constructed   and documented   in the Earnings and Benefits File (EBF) described here. The EBF

provides a set of summary earnings, employment, and social security wealth measures for a subset

of HRS respondents in Wave 1 of the survey, for whom administrative       records are available.

        The EBF, a restricted data file, is available from the University of Michigan’s Institute for

Social Research for matching only with versions of the HRS containing geographic detail no finer

than the Census Division level. Interested users should contact hrsquest@umich.edu       by email for

further information on access to the data.

            This paper documents        the Earnings and Benefits File (EBF).               The EBF is a restricted     dataset

created for researchers        working with the Health and Retirement                   Survey (HRS) under a set of limited

access conditions.     The EBF and all derived variables contained therein are intended for research

purposes only, by registered         users of the public use file of the Health and Retirement               Survey, and

may be linked only with HRS files containing                  no geographic       detail below the Census Division level. 1

            Details on the rationale for, and definitions             of, constructed    employment,   earnings,     and social

security wealth variables in the EBF are provided,                    as well as a bibliography    for those wishing

benefits.     The EBF contains information              derived for respondents         of the 1992 Health and Retirement

Survey who authorized          the University         of Michigan’s       Institute for Social Research to obtain

administrative      records from the Social Security Administration.                    The EBF is described below, first in

conceptual     terms in Part 1, and then in more technical detail in Part II. Appendices                    contain a

I. A General Description         of EBF Variables

            The Earnings      and Benefits File (EBF) contains three types of variables,               aimed at meeting

specific data needs of the research community                  working with the Health and Retirement           Survey.

First, HRS researchers         often desire summary measures of labor market attachment,                    particularly

useful for modeling      retirement       and saving patterns.            Second, researchers   often require information

on aggregate      earnings,     measures of interest in their own right and also of use to those assessing

respondents’     retirement     saving.     Third, researchers        need computed social security wealth variables

for studies of retirement      behavior,    and preparedness           for retirement.    In the context of the Health and

Retirement     Survey, first fielded in the year 1992, it is useful to have measures of social security

wealth as of that year for comparability            purposes with other wealth measures obtained             at that

interview    date.

          We have constructed       measures of these three types of variables in the EBF dataset, derived

only for age-eligible    HRS respondents           who authorized       the release of earnings and benefit data to the

University    of Michigan’s    Institute for Social Research,            Specifically,    only HRS respondents    and

spouses age 51-61 in 1992 were eligible for inclusion in the EBF file. In this section we describe in

general terms the nature of the data creation effort, and further technical details follow in Part II

below.

A. Creation     of Employment       Summary         Data in the EBF

          The EBF contains a variety of employment                summary measures created for Health and

Retirement     Survey respondents.         These are derived from administrative              records supplied by the

Social Security Administration         (SSA), in accord ante with agreements               signed between the Institute

for Social Research     (ISR) at the University         of Michigan and the SSA. Of the HRS survey

respondents     asked to sign a permission          form in 1992 allowing access to their earnings and benefit

records at SSA, some 75% complied with the request. ~ ISR provided identifiers                      to SSA, and

individual    earnings records were obtained for cases with matching identifiers.                  A final match rate of

66% of the entire Wave 1 HRS sample was obtained.                      If no permission    was obtained, or if a match

could not be generated,       no employment         variables were generated in the EBF file for that case lD.

         Table 1 summarizes        several of the labor market attachment                variables included in the EBF.

The sample included in this Table covers individuals                   who were not in receipt of disability benefits

from social security as of 1991, and who had nonzero earnings at some point in their careers.~                          One

  summary measure indicates how many years arespondent’s                            record showed zero covered earningsby

  decade of age from age 20-29, 30-39, . to age 80-89 (see variables 44-50 in Appendix                          A). Only the

  years 1951 through        1991, inclusive,       are used in this computation.          If the respondent’s   current age

  was part-way through a decade at the time of the HRS survey, only the relevant years “at risk’ are

  included in the count. Thus, for instance, a 52-year old respondent                     would have a value of at most 3

. years in the column pertaining            to the number of years with zero covered earnings from age 50-59.

           Descriptive     statistics on this variable by sex and marital status appear in Table 1 for

  respondents     who had had some positive covered earnings over their lifetimes. q Here we see that men

  with at least some nonzero earnings in the HRS cohort devoted 80-90 percent of their potential                           work

  years in covered employment.            whereas women with nonzero earnings devoted about half the time in

  covered jobs during their twenties and thirties, with the fraction rising to 60-80 percent thereafter.

  The fraction of time spent in covered employment                      varies with marital status:   more married than

  nonmarried      men were in covered employment                 all their lives, whereas more nonmarried         than married

  women were in covered jobs.

  See Table i. Descriptive          Sta tistics on EBF Covered Employmen               t Variables



           A dtiferent variable measuring                respondents’       length of time working under the social security

  system focuses on total quarters of coverage (QC’S), or the number of quarters an individual                         worked

  in jobs covered by social security rules,              Specific numbers of quarters of coverage        (QC’S) are needed

  for establishing    eligibility    for social security benefits;           persons reaching age 62 after 1990, for

  instance, must have 40 quarters of coverage to be insured for Social Security retirement                         benefits.

  Historically,   QC’S referred to earnings in a calendar quarter, but more recently, one quarter of

  coverage has been credited for a specified amount of earnings.                      For example, in 1992, a worker was

  entitled to a quarter of coverage for each $570 in earnings in covered employment,                       up to 4 per year;




 narrowed over time, but most often would be thought of as government (e.g. federal, state, and local),
 agricultural, and nonprofit workers.
 q Tabulations in Table 1 are weighted by HRS sample weights, Some HRS respondents do not have
 covered earnings reported in the administrative records, since their jobs were not covered by social
 security in times past. For a discussion of covered and uncovered jobs see Myers (1991),

that figure is indexed over time (SSA 1992, Table 2.A. 7)                 For the EBF datafile, quarters of coverage

requirements      in the past were computed by the ANYPIA software program.                  This is a computer

program prepared by the Office of the Actuary, Social Security Administration,                   that incorporates

current as well as historical social security rules relevant to HRS respondents                (Office of the Actuary

1995).



          The EBF reports total quarters of coverage for each individual,              as well as quarters of

coverage over each two-year period from 1982 through 1991. Table 1 summarizes                        the total number

of quarters reported in covered employment              (variable 30; see Appendix     A), the number of covered

quarters by two-year pairs between            1982-1991 (variables 32-36), and our computation              of the total

number of years in covered employment              between the ages of 20 and 50. As before, the employment

variables indicate that married men have the highest numbers of years in covered employment

between age 20 and 50 (26 years) as well as total quarters in covered employment                     (125) compared        to

nonmarried     men (25 years, 115 quarters) as well as married and nonmarried                 women (16 years, 72

quarters;   18 years and 85 quarters respectively),            Both men and women averaged           5-7 quarters of

coverage within the last several pairs of years leading up to the HRS survey.

         Also included in the EBF is a variable (31) indicating the individual’s              eligibility    status for the

Social Security Disability      Insurance     program as of yearend        1991, Table 1 shows that most married

men (84°/0) and nonmarried         men (75°fi) are eligible for SSDI based on their own work record, whereas

somewhat     fewer married women (59[%) and nonmarried                 women (72°/0) are eligible.    As is clarified in

Part II of the discussion,     any HRS respondents          in receipt of Disability Insurance payments          at the

time of the survey have no social security retirement                benefits computed in the EBF

 (but their earnings      and employment        are shown).s     Individuals    receiving DI benefits are therefore

excluded from computations           in Table 1.6

B. Computation        of Aggregate     Earnings     Data

          As described     above, QC’S measure the work attachment              requirement    for Social Security

insured status,      Once eligible, retiree benefit amounts are based on the respondent’s              average long-

term covered earnings.         Speciflca lly, the number of years in the averaging          period equals the number

of full calendar years after 1950 (or, if later, after age .21) and up to the year in which the worker

attains age 62, becomes disabled, or dies--generally              minus 5 “dropout” years. For most HRS

respondents,     the result is 35 years. For the EBF, the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings                  (AIME)

amount was computed           using the ANYPIA program            (Office of the Actuary,   1995).

          To compute the respondent’s          current AIME (that is, based on earnings through           1991), the

algorithm    used covered earnings from 1951 to 1991, recorded Llp to the taxable maximum                    earnings

ceiling in the administrative        records file supplied by the Social Security Administration,           (In 1992

this maximum       was an annual $55,500; for historical amounts, see SSA, 1995, Table 2.A.3).                The

program then indexes earnings up to age 60 by economy-wide                     average wage increases;   for example,

earnings in 1951 were inflated by a factor of almost 9 to convert them to 1992 dollars, Subsequently

the respondent’s      highest indexed earnings are averaged after eliminating               the requisite number of

dropout years (see Part 11 for a inore detailed discussion).            This computation      yields the respondent’s

current AIME amount, in $1992 (variable 5). Zero earnings years -- including imputed future zeros -

  are included     as necessary     in the AIME calculation. T




s As noted below, disability benefits are not included in the EBF file.
6DI recipients are identified (variable 4 is set to 1) and they have a missing value code (-9) inserted in
lieu of social security benufit amounts in the social security benefit fields (variables              9-29 in Appendix
A), In this way, DI recipients can be distinguished from those ineligible for benefits                 due to
insufficient quarters of coverage; those not eligible to receive social security benefits              have a O in their
benefits variable fields (variables 9-29). If a DI recipient was married, no benefit is               computed for
that person’s spouse either, and a missing data value (-9) appears in variables 9-29.
~ Users should note that the respondents’ consent agreements allowed the provision                    only of records to
date and annual earnings before 1951 are not available in electronic form at SSA.



EBF Working Paper - Afitchell/Ols[]l l/Stci:lmeier - version 8/1/96
           Two other AIME measures were also created (but not retained in the EBF), namely the

AIME that the respondent             would have had at the early, and also at the normal, retirement              age.

Because some HRS respondents                   (and their spouses) were not old enough to be eligible to receive

social security retirement           benefits in 1992, it was necessary to project earnings forward in order to

determine      what these potential AIME amounts might be if they did work to the social security

entitlement      ages.    Each non-disabled         respondent’s     earnings were therefore projected    to age 62, which

is the earliest age he/she could file for retired worker benefits under social security rules, and also to

that respondent’s         normal retirement        age. This normal retirement       age is age 65 for older members of

the sample, but has been raised to age 67 for those born in 1960 or later, with gradual increases for

ages in between.         We projected carnlngs for each person using a weighted               average of hislher own

earnings over the past five years, corrected for inflation.                (Details are given in Part II of this report).

           These earnings calculations            may be summarized        in several ways.   Table 2 describes

respondents’      average annual real taxable earnings by decade of life, computed beginning                  at age 20-

29, and running to age 80-89.             For each decade of age, average earnings are computed            only to the

social security taxable maximum,                and only over the years in which the individual       had nonzero

earnings     (variables    37-43).    Tab] e 2 indicates that average annual taxable earnings while age 50-59

stood at approximately          $27,700 for married men, with nonrnarried men averaging               about $20,500,

nonmarried       women about $14,700, and married women about $10,600.S

See Table 2. Desc~iptive          Statistics    on Earnings      Variables in the EBF

           Table 2 also replicates        the computation       representing   respondents’   current AIME amounts

(variable 5), which as noted earlier include zero earnings years as necessary in the calculation.

Married men’s AIME averages                $ 1.,!)90, with nonmarried      men close behind at about $1,570; married

women’s lower earnings anti fewer years of covered employment                      no doubt contributed   to the lower

average AIME of about $640, while nonmarried                     women are higher at about $840.       Additional

information      is also provided in the EBF file regarding the twenty lowest earnings years in the AIME

average, arranged in ascending              order (variables       51-70; we do not display the results of these

computations      since lowest ea~nings tend to be zero in most cases.)                  These variables are included

primarily     to allow analysts to update the AIME using survey-reported                    earnings for 1992 and later.

In addition, analysts wishing to compute alternative AIME figures may use these lowest earnings

years to recompute       AIME values for other retirement                  dates (Office of the Actuary    1995; Myers

1993).9

C. Computation        of Social Security         Wealth Amounts

          Social security wealth variables were generated for EBF respondents                      for whom the AIME

could be computed,       and who were not currently receiving                 Social Security Disability    Insurance

(SSDI).’O This was accomplished               using the ANYPIA algorithm described             above, which combines         the

respondent’s    AIME with the relevant formula to obtain that person’s primary insurance                         amount, or

PIA. The PIA is the monthly amount payable to a retired worker who begins to receive benefits at

the normal retirement         age (currently,           age 65) or to a disabled worker who has never received           a

retirement     benefit reduced for age. The 1992 formula is as follows (the “bend points” are indexed

over time):

                   PIA = 90(X)of AIME Up to $387

                               Plus 32(X,of excess up to $2333

                               Plus 15% of any excess above that.

If a respondent      was not eligible to receive social security benefits based on quarters of coverage

through December         1991, the PIA and all social security wealth variables are set to zero (along with

the spouse benefits if there was no spouse, or if the spouse was ineligible                    for benefits based on the

respondent’s    earnings record).




~A different method of sLlm111 arizing the AIME computations appears in Appendix B, which reports
descriptive tabulations of linear regression coefficients for models using as dependent variables
computed values of AIMEs and Primary Insurance Amounts (PIA).

others, but these are not the focus of the present analysis.

          Having computed        the respondent’s      PIA, we then derived the social security benefits he/she

and his/her spouse (if any) could receive at the retirement                ages under consideration,          The rules for

benefit determination        specify that the PIA is the retirement          benefit at the normal retirement          age.

Workers can also receive early retirement             benefits (assuming eligibility)         at age 62; under the law,

early retirees receive a benefit equal to the PIA reduced by 5/9 of 1 percent or 1/180 per month of

entitlement    before age 65.       The normal retirement         benefit computations        take into account the fact

that the full PIA has been payable at age 65 but the normal retirement                       age will be gradually    moved

up in the future,

          In addition to computing        the retired worker benefits, we also derived spouse benefits if the

HRS respondent        had a spouse and if sufficient data were available with which to compute these.

Each member of a married couple is entitled to receive social security benefits based on his/her own

earnings record, and perhaps based on the spouse’s PIA if such benefits would be higher.                          (Spouse

benefits are generally      equal to 50% of the worker’s PIA).            Specifically,    dual entitlement     arises if the

woman’s (man’s) benefit computed             on her (his) own earnings record is lower than that computed                   as a

spouse.    In this instance, at retirement        she (he) will receive a dual benefit reflecting         both her (his)

own entitlement      as well as an additional       amount taking her/him to the level she/he is entitled to as a

spouse.

          To illustrate this point, suppose that a woman is married to a man who is eligible for retired

worker benefits from social security based on his own work record,                    The wife in this case can receive

50~o   of his PIA as a spouse benefit if she were age 65 at retirement;                   if she were 62-64, her spouse

benefit would be reduced by a monthly amount which comes to 8 1/3% per year she was under age

65, For the EBF complete computation,              we also compute the benefits she would be entitled to based

on her own work history.         The computer algorithm inquires which calculation                 is higher, and

associates with the wife the higher of the t~~~obenefit amounts.                 Users of the EBF file should note

that the constructed      spouse variables in the variable            10-29 series described in Appendix         A do not

distinguish     between respondents         projected to receive only spouse benefits, and those projected        to be

dually entitled. 11

         For currently married persons, the ANYPIA code was also used to project survivor’s                    benefits

under social security rules.        If an eligible worker dies, the surviving widow/er can receive up to 100

percent of the deceased worker’s PIA; such benefits, reduced for early retirement,                 can begin as early

as age 60. Remarriage        after age 60 does not result in the loss of benefits.

         For nonmarried       persons, eligibility for survivor or other auxiliary benefits could not be

determined.      For example,     in the event that a couple was divorced after a marriage of at least ten

years, the divorced spouse would be eligible for spouse benefits; after the death of the former spouse,

to surviving    divorced spouse benefits.          Because the HRS did not obtain Social Security Numbers            from

surviving     divorced former spouses in the HRS, we could not compute spouse benefits to which HRS

divorced individuals     might be entitled.            Users of this database should therefore be alert to the

possibility    that social security benefits derived for divorced persons will be understated.            Likewise

benefits computed      for persons widowed at the time of the survey recognize              only prospective

payments      based on their own record as workers, since we cannot compute widowler benefits to which

an HRS widowed individual            might be entitled. Evidence suggests the results will underestimate

social security benefits and wealth of many widows and divorced women, 12




11So for instance, if a spouse’s dual entitlement               benefit is higher than the benefit she could receive
based on her own earnings record, the larger benefit is entered in her husbands variable 14 (see
App. A) and a zero is entered in his variable 13. In her record (assuming she is included in the EBF
file), the values of her variables would be compatible with those appearing in her husband’s file (i.e.,
her variable 11 equals his variable 14, and her variable 10 equals his variable 13).
12Uslng a dlfferent data source, the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), estimates
show that a large majority of aged widows receives benefits based on her husbands earnings record.
An internal SSA study found that 77.6 percent of aged widows in 1990 who were receiving social
security benefits, received benefits based wholly or partially on their deceased husband’s earnings
record. This suggests that EBF-computed benefits data for nonmarried women will underestimate
the eventual benefits that many of these women will receive, since we do not have deceased spouses’
earnings records linked to the file. For divorced women the in-house study suggested that
approximately 30 percent of divorcees received social security benefits either wholly or partially
based on their (deceased) former husbands’ earnings records. This suggests that the understatement
of likely benefits may be less serious for divorced than currently widowed women.



EBF Worki)lg Paper    hfitchelI/Olso~ ]/Stei]llneier    version 8/1/96
         Having computed         these various social security benefit amounts, the question arises as to the

best way to summarize         their value to the retiree.        In the EBF file we have adopted the concept of

social security wealth for this purpose, which simply refers to the present value of the social security

benefit payable in the form of an annuity from retirement                    until death.   Benefit values after

retirement     are multiplied    by survival probabilities         from that age forward, and discounted        to 1992 by

multiplying     by the conditional     probability     of being alive at that retirement        age, given that he/she is

alive at his current age in 1992

         The social security wealth computation               is straightforward     for the case of a nonmarried

respondent     leaving the workforce        at age 62. Mathematically,          we simply sum annual benefit amounts

payable from age 62 on, multiplied           by the survival probability         at each age, and divide by an

appropriate     discount rate. Age-specific        mortality rates by birth cohort were supplied by the Office of

the Actuary at the Social Security Administration;                for the discount rate we use the interest rate

profile consistent    with the intermediate         set of assumptions        chosen by the Social Security Trustees

(Board of Trustees      1995), A similar wealth value can be computed                assuming the worker retires at the

normal retirement      age, by using the AIME and PIA computed as of that age,

         Computing      social security wealth for married respondents               is somewhat    more complex,      since

the system pays different benefit amounts depending                     on the couple’s mortality experience.      As long

as both members       of a couple survive, retired worker andlor spouse benefits can be paid.                 However

when one of the members          of the couple dies, the other may receive a survivor benefit if it exceeds the

survivor’s    own retired-worker      benefit. 13 Hence the derivation           of social security wealth here requires

that the present value computation            incorporate     retiree, along with possibly spouse and survivol

benefits, weighted     by the probability       of the different outcomes obtaining.           Here too, the interest rate

profile used is the one consistent        with the Intermediate           set of assumptions    chosen by the Social

Security Trustees,




13Under current social securitv rules, persons receiving survivor’s benefits are sometimes entitled to
retired-worker benefits on their own record, and to higher survivor benefits based on their spouse’s
record. As noted above in the discussion of spouse benefits, these dually entitled beneficiaries are
classified in the EBF simply as spouse or survivor beneficiaries.

             An overview      of the various social security variables created for the EBF file appears            n Table

3. This Table reports descriptive             statistics on each respondent’s     Primary Insurance Amount

computed       in 1992 when the HRS was first fielded based on the respondent’s                 earnings to date, and

also two projected      PIA amounts using earnings projected to the early retirement                 age and to the

normal retirement          age (variables 6-8). For married men, Table 3 indicates that the PIA based on

earnings to 1992 totaled approximately              $800, rising to $882 with earnings to the normal retirement

age; levels for nonmarried          men were, respectively,      about $680 and $750. Women’s PIAs are lower,

rising to $420 and $520 at the normal retirement                age for married and nonmarried         women,

respectively .14

See Table 3. Descriptive         Statistics    on Social Securi~F Va]YabIes in the EBF

         The EBF file also supplies three total social security wealth variables.                  One (variable 9)

reflects HRS respondents’          entitlements     as of 1992 (“current”),    filling in future years of earnings to

age 62 with zeros.      The other two social security wealth values are based on the benefits receivable                       if

the respondent      continued      to work until the early retirement         age (variable   16), and also if he/she

worked until the normal retirement              age (variable 23), These values are given as household           social

security wealth variables in the second panel of Table 3. The present values amount to about

$170,000-180)000       for married men and women working until their normal retirement                     age, much

more than double the values for nonmarried               men and women.         The fact that married persons’ social

security wealth is larger reflects the fact that social security retirement               benefits are payable to both

members of an eligible couple, as well as survivor benefits if one of the members of the couple should

die. By contrast, because of data limitations,            the social security wealth computation         for a

nonmarried       individual     does not include any survivor or divorced spouse benefit, though as noted

above, perhaps as many as three-quarters               of the widows may receive a survivor benefit over their

lifetimes.

           A clearer idea of the separate computations               that are incorporated   into a married couple’s

security wealth figure is also available from Table 3. Here we report the expected present value of

social security     retirement   benefits that an eligible respondent           and spouse can collect based on

his/her own earnings records, the spouse’s earnings records (if any), and as a survivor based on

his/her partner’s    earnings record (if applicable).         Thus for example, the wealth value for married

men’s “respondent”       benefits as of the normal retirement            age totaled approximately      $89,000, with the

spouse’s benefit on her own account totaling $28,000; the figures are roughly reversed when the

married women are the unit of analysis. 15

           These social security wealth variables will be reasonable              representations     of the expected

future value of benefit payments         in most cases, but the reader should be alert to two instances                where

the EBF projections      may be low. 16 One case arises in the event of a widow/er whose actual future

benefits will often be based on the deceased spouse’s record.                 The HRS did not attempt to collect

information     on the social security numbers of deceased spouses, so for these people, earnings records

for deceased spouses (and hence eventual social security survivor benefits) are not available.                     A

second case is that of divorced persons who had been married 10 or more years prior to divorce.

Under the regulations,       divorced persons may file for benefits based on their former spouses’ earnings

history.     For the purposes of the EBF file, however, we could not compute benefits based on the

former spouse’s earnings since these earning files were not available to us. Therefore                    the social

security wealth variables in the EBF file may be a substantial                  understatement      of benefits that will

likely be received for nonmarried         women, and specifically          widowslers   and for divorced women who

previously     had been married for 10 or more years.

           Users of the EBF file should also be alert to the point that estimated benefits and social

security wealth are also likely to be low for those respondents                having had Social Security disability




15The higher benefit values reported for male as compared to female HRS respondents                         in Table 3
reflect the fact that HRS age-eligible male respondents are somewhat older on average, as compared
to HRS women respondents.
16Those already divorced or widowed at the time of the HRS survey will have benefit amounts
computed based only on theil own records, as noted above,                    No benefits are computed      for those in
disability benefit receipt status (or their spouses).

reduction    in the amount of retirement              insurance benefits, by providing       that the period during which

the person is disabled will generally be excluded from determining                      either retirement    benefits   and

D. Layout of the EBF

          In this section we offer an idea of the EBF layout, with the idea that a general reader maybe

satisfied with this description        of the EBF variables along with the detailed variable list for the file

supplied in Appendix         A. Part II, below, provides more detailed file construction             information.

          The EBF contains one record for each individual                     in the HRS from whom a valid permission

form was obtained,       and who had nonzero earnings at some point in his/her career.                      Each person in

the file is identified   by a case ID, that matches the same variable in the HRS records and is the

variable for linking these records to the HRS data set. 18 For individuals                    who were married at the

time of the HRS interview,         there is also a spouse ID, which is the HRS case ID of the record of the

spouse.     This variable has a value of O if there is no spouse, and a value of 99999 if there was a

spouse but the spouse does not have a record in the main HRS data set. 19 All other variables                           ale as

described in Appendix        A, with the caveats discussed above.




II. Technical     Discussion     of Algorithms         and Assumptions          in the EBF

          This section is intended to provide additional                   technical details on how the EBF dataset was

constructed.     In addition to the case ID variables noted above, the other variables in the record are

grouped into three categories          and discussed in turn, These three sets of variables            are: labor market

attachment      variables,   earnings aggregates,          and measures of family social security wealth.




17For each of these cases, the EBF total social security wealth variables can be modified using social
security benefit files in conjunction with the earnings records.
18The EBF can be linked only to HRS data containing no geographic                         detail below the Census
Division level. Information about access to the restricted files is available over email from
hrsques@umich.edu,
19This might occur if, for example, that spouse did not participate in the survey, or did not agree to
permit the attachment of earnings record data to his or her file. Social security wealth variables                        are
imputed using the hot deck procedure described in Part II.

A. Labor Market Attachment              Variables

            The EBF dataset contains three groups of variables measuring                     labor market attachment,

Variables     44 to 50 indicate the number of years by age decade that the individual                    reported   zero

earnings.     These decades are the same decades used in calculating                    the average earnings by decade,

and the same limitations         apply.    Specifically,    only the years between         1951 and 1991, inclusive,       are

included.     This means, for example, that an individual                  who is 56 years old in 1992 and who had four

years of non-zero      earnings and two years of zero earnings in the 1986-1991 time period will have a

value of two assigned to variable 47. (Data in Table 1 correct for the fact that the number of potential

years of work varies by respondent             age.)

          A second variable indicates the respondent’s                   total quarters of coverage (or credits) as of year-

end 1991. This is needed to establish whether the individual                      is presently   insured under the old-age

retirement     program,     or whether he or she may become insured on the basis of future work.                    The

respondent’s     total quarters of coverage at the end of 1991 appear in variable 30. For workers

attaining    age 62 in 1991 or later, 40 quarters of coverage are required to be eligible for old age

following ten years, again using work status and earnings figures from the household                   HRS surveys

in 1992 and later.     For example, if an individual         had 3 quarters of coverage in 1982-1983 and 18

quarters of coverage in the period 1982-1991, and if the household               survey indicates that the

individual    had 8 quarters of coverage in 1992 and 1993, then we can infer that the individual                 had 23

quarters during 1984-1993 (18 plus 8 minus 3), making him or her disability insured at the end of

1993.

        A final entry in the labor market variable group indicates whether the individual                  was

receiving    social security disability insurance benefits as of December           1991. This is variable 4, taking

a value of 1 if the individual      was receiving disability benefits as of December         1991 and a value of O if

he or she was not on disability at that time. Unlike most of the other variables in this file, this

variable comes not from the summary earnings record but from the benefits record.                    If the individual

was collecting    social security disability as of December           1991, all variables described in the next two

sections (average monthly earnings, primary insurance                 amount, social security wealth, etc.) are all

set to -9. This is because the algorithms         that are used to calculate these variables for the dataset are

appropriate     only for old-age benefits for persons without prior entitlement           to disability benefits,

Spouses of workers receiving         social security disability insurance benefits are included if they are age-

eligible respondents     In their own right.

B. Earnings      Aggregates

        Variables     37 to 43 in the EBF file provide the average real taxable earnings by decade of life.

These decades are age decades, not calendar decades, and run from ages 20-29 to ages 80-89.                      For

each decade, the average is calculated          using only the years in which the individual       had positive

earnings; years in which there were no earnings are excluded from the average.                   Further, these are

real earnings, which means that each annual earnings amount is indexed to 1992 using the

consumer      price index (CP1-U).     The indexing is done prior to averaging.         The user is reminded      that

no annual earnings      are available in the social security records before 1951 or after 1991. Further,

only taxable earnings up to the maximum              amount subject to social security taxes are available in

C. Derived     Social Security      Retirement        Benefit Variables

          Social security benefits for HRS respondents                    are calculated   in three stages.    First, the

Average Monthly Indexed Earnings                (AIME) amount is calculated for everyone for whom earnings

data are available,       using the number of years of earnings as specified in the social security law. If a

respondent    does not have enough positive years of earnings, zeros are filled in for the remaining

years.    Next, the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) is calculated                        from average monthly earnings

using a formula that depends on when the individual                       turns age 62. Finally, an adjustment         factor

reflecting   early or late retirement        is applied to the PIA to determine             the benefit amount, as required.

          Variable    5 lists the calculated AIME amount based on earnings through                       1991, rounded to the

nearest $10; for this computation           zeros are filled in for years between             1991 and the year the

respondent    turns age 62. This AIME figure is calculated                    by a program created by the Social Security

Administration       called A~’PIA,       that incorporates       the many changes that Congress has made in

social security law over the years (Office of the Actuary                    1995).

          For the AIME computation,            earnings before the age of 60 are indexed upward to age 60 by a

factor calculated     from SSAS average annual wage series,                    Earnings after age 60 enter the average on

an unindexed     basis.    In general, for persons without current or prior disability,                 the number of

computation     years equals tile years after 1950 (or age 21 if later) to age 62, excluding                     5 ‘dropout’

years.    For HRS respondents         who turned 60 in 1992 and before, earnings before age 60 are indexed

according    to the average annual wage series, and the high 35 years are averaged.                           For respondents

who turn 60 after 1992, the indexing amount was not known in 1992. For these individuals,

earnings are indexed to 1992, and the high 35 years are averaged (including                          zero earnings years, if

any).z2




~~The average earnings computation for workers who attained age 62 prior to 1978 is computed
slightly differently (see SSA, various years or the Social Security worldwide web page at
www.ssa. gov).

          The EBF also contains the variables necessary to update the AIME amount based on

earnings in 1992 and subsequent               years as reported in the household           surveys, at least for those

individuals     who attained age 62 in 1979 and after, and are thus governed by the indexed earnings

formula (SSA, Table 2.A8). Variables                51 to 70 contain the lowest 20 years of earnings in the AIME

computation,      arranged from the lowest year and in ascending order.                    The amounts reported     are

indexed (and not nominal) amounts, meaning that they are indexed to age 60 if the earnings were

before age 60 and the individual             had reached 60 by 1992, or if the individual           was under age 60 in

1992, they are indexed to 1992. The indexing rules are the same as those that are applied in

computing      the average indexed monthly earnings figure itself.                   Note that these variables    may

contain a number of zero amounts, which signifies that the individual                       thus far had positive earnings

for fewer than the number of computation                  years.    Also, this entire set of 20 variables is set equal to

zero if the individual       reached age 62 before 1979, in which case the monthly earnings were figured

using unindexed        earnings rather than indexed earnings.

          To illustrate     the updating process, suppose that we obtain a 1992 earnings figure from the

household     survey, and we want to see how this affects the AIME,                     First, the earnings amount is

indexed to age 60 or 1992, as appropriate.                 Then the indexed amount is compared            to the low year in

the average (the figure in variable 51). If the new amount is less, then the 1992 earnings                        do not

affect the AIME.        If it is greater, then the difference,             divided by 35 (or the number of computation

years), is added to the AIME (variable 5). This is equivalent                     to substituting   the 1992 figure for the

low indexed amount in the average.                For additional years of earnings after 1992, the process is

repeated.     The fact that the 20 lowest indexed earnings years are reported implies that, based on

future observed       earnings in the household            survey, the AIME figure can be updated at least through

the year 2011,

          Next comes estimated           primary insurance          amounts (PIA), reported in variables 6-8. The PIA

in variable 6 is based on earnings though 1991 and the AIME reported in variable 5. If the

Individual    was 62 or older in 1991, the amount in variable 7 is the same as in variable 6. Otherwise,

the PIA in variable        7 is based on projected earnings through age 61, with the projection                  method




EBF LVorki]:g P:lper - M]tch(?ll/O1.sotl/Stc’itlIneier - ver.qion 8/Ik96
discussed later in this section,           Variable 8 is similar to variable 7, except that earnings are projected

through the year immediately              before the normal retirement              age. In calculating    variable 8, it is

assumed that the individual             applies for benefits at the normal retirement             age.

         The PIA calculation           is done by the ANYPIA program.                 The formula applied to the AIME

figure is determined       by the year the individual                attains 62.ZS Those individuals      who turn age 62 in or

after 1978 have their PIA calculated                using an AIME that depends on the year they turn 62 (variable

5), For instance,     the formula for individuals                who turn 62 in 1986 is 90~0 of the first $297 of average

indexed monthly earnings,            ;32%,of the next $1493, and 15[fi of anything beyond that.                  These “bend

points” are indexed to the national average annual wage level, but there are always just three

segments in the formula.           As before, this formula gives the primary insurance                    amount for the year

the individual    turns 62, and the resulting amount is indexed upward every year by the cost of living

index.

         For individuals       who attain 62 in or before 1992, the bend points are known (e.g. SSA 1995,

Table 2.A. 11), and the PIA indexed to 1992 is reported in variable 6. For individuals                          who attain 62

after 1992, the AIME is indexed to age 60 (if necessary)                        and the bend points are indexed to age 62,

both using the increases in the national average annual wage index projected by the Social Security

Administration.       The PIA is calculated                using the projected formula applied to the projected         average

indexed earnings,      giving a PIA value that would apply to the year the individual                       turned 62. The

resulting   amount is then deflated to 1992 using the projected increases in the consumer                           price index.

This gives the value of the primary insurance                      amount in 1992 dollars and is thus comparable          to the

amounts calculated        for individuals         who reach 62 in or before 1992. The assumptions                used to forecast

the national average annual wage and the consumer price index are the “intermediate”                                assumptions

offered by the Office of the Actuary of the Social Security Administration                        and are reported in Table

~sSpecial rules apply if the individual turned 62 before 1979 (see SSA, various years). What is
reported in variable 6 is the primary insurance amount as of 1992, reflecting the cost of living
increases since the individual first became eligible.

See Table 4- Wage and Infla tion Projections

           As mentioned     before, the primary insurance                   amount in variable 6 is calculated   solely on the

basis of the earnings in years up to and including                   1991 (with zeros filled in to age 62 as necessary).

The amounts in variables          7 and 8 project future earnings up to the year before the retirement                    age

(early for variable    7 and normal for variable 8) in cases where the individual                     was under that age in

1991, The method of projecting            these future earnings adopted for the present purposes is to compute

for each HRS respondent          a weighted      average of his or her own recent earnings and to project these

earnings into future years.

           More specifically,    earnings in the five-year period 1987-1991 are indexed to 1991 levels using

the National Average        Wage Index of the Social Security Administration.                    The indexed wages are

then averaged,     with the 1987 through              1991 single-year        earnings given weights of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,

respectively.    This procedure       thus places more weight on more recent earnings.                   This weighted

average is then indexed upward to each year up to and including the year before the individual

reaches the early (for variable 7) or normal (for variable 8) retirement                      age, using the National

Average Wage Index found in Table 4. The resulting wage series is then used to calculate a primary

insurance     amount in exactly the same way as before, and the resulting values appear as variables                            7

and 8.

           This procedure    gives reasonable          results for individuals        with a steady work history who are

planning     to work at least until age 62. However,                data users must be alert to the fact that there are

several cases where it may not give good results.                   For instance, if a woman has an intermittent           work

history, her earnings in the last five years may give only a very noisy indication                       as to her work

intentions    for the future years.       In such a case, it is probably difficult to produce an algorithm                which

will give accurate projections        of the course of her future earnings.               Another case where the algorithm

is susceptible   to error is if the individual has recently retired within the last year or two. The trouble

here is that it is difficult to know whether the fact that there are no earnings in the last year or two

signifies a permanent       retirement      or a temporary          interruption     of employment.    Thus, users are

cautioned    that particularly     for respondents          with intermittent        work histories and individuals     who

may have recently retired, the projected primary insurance               amount and the projected      social security

wealth variables     should be regarded as being subject to substantial          potential errors,

D. Computed       Social Security      Wealth Variables

          As described    above, we have computed           social security wealth several different ways for the

EBF dataset.      Our intention was to make these variables as comparable             as possible, in conceptual

terms, to the other measures of wealth reported in the HRS.

          Three versions of social security wealth appear in the EBF. The first (variable 9) is the

expected present value of benefits already accrued by the respondent,              based on his covered earnings

up to and including       1!)91. (This computation        assumes the person would have no covered earnings

between     1992 and the year he turns age 62; a zero is entered if the person would not be eligible for

benefits based on this work record).           The second and third wealth variables @ositions         16 and 23)

represent     the expected present value of benefits based on a respondent’s          projected    earnings if he/she

was younger than age 62 at the time of the survey, LIP to the year before attaining the early or

normal retirement        age. These projections,       described in the previous section, are carried out for all

individuals    and for both spouses of a married couple (with caveats to be explained              below).     In the

case of a married couple, if one spouse was at or over the retirement             age and the other was under it,

the projection    is done only for the spouse who was under the retirement            age, and the full earnings

through     1991 are used for the older spouse.

          Social security wealth calculations          depend on a number of assumptions.         One set of

assumptions      has to do with mortality,       since the calculation   multiplies the expected benefit each year

times the probability      that the individual      will live to collect it. In the next section we discuss the

specific mortality    tables used in creating the EBF file. In all cases, social security wealth calculations

are discounted     back to the respondent’s        age in 1992, taking into account the conditional      survival

probability    of the person living to that future age, given his/her current age. Another set of

assumptions      has to do with the expected future paths of wages, prices and interest rates.               Needless

to say, there are differing opinions of the likely future course of these variables, but we have chosen

to evaluate the social security wealth on the basis of the “intermediate”            assumptions      supplied by the

         The wealth calculations           were handled as follows. For each nonmarried             respondent,     we

consider each year beginning           with the year 1992. For each member of a married couple, benefits                     are

computed     for each spouse separately;           here we consider each year beginning         with either age 60

(which is the youngest       age a married individual            could collect surviving spouse benefits) or the year

1992, whichever      is 1ater. For married persons, two calculations              are undertaken,      depending    on

whether the partner is or is not projected to be still living;               we weight each calcdation      by the

probabilities    (as calculated     fl-om the mortality        tables) that the individual   is still living and the

partner is either living or not, respectively.              For every year in which the spouse is still living, the

approach was to first ask whether that spouse is age 62 or older.                   If he or she was under 62 years old,

that individual     may only receive benefits based on his or her own earnings record.                   If the spouse is 62

years old or older, then we compared the benefits the retiring individual                    could receive on the basis of

his or her own earnings with the amount that he 01 she could receive as a spouse based on the

spouse’s earnings.      The individual        would then be assigned the higher benefit amount.Z6

         To determine      the benefits that would be available on the basis of a respondent’s                own

earnings history, the PIA in nominal dollars is calculated by the ANYPIA program on the basis of the

earnings history.     For persons older than the retirement                age in 1992, we assume that they became

entitled (that is, they were eligible and applied to receive benefits) in the first year that at least some

or she first applies for social security benefits. This is held to be the early retirement age for variable
16 and the normal retirement age for variable 23. In addition, the individual cannot collect spouse
benefits until the spouse has applied as well, in accordance with the rules (Myers 1993).

        In addition to benefits to which a respondent                     might be entitled on his or her own record, a

record as of the previous year by the ANYPIA program for married couples. ~g The basic spouse

benefit is 50% of the husband’s          (or wife’s, as relevant) PIA. A reduction factor is then applied which

is determined     by when the individual          would have first started collecting        spouse benefits.    The

reduction    factor, calculated    monthly, totals 8.33 percentage              points for each year before age 65 that

the individual    first collects spouse benefits; that is, the benefit is reduced by 25/36 of one percent

multiplied   by the number of months preceding                age 65. This reduction       factor is scheduled   to be

modified when the nol.rnal retirement             age increases from its present level of 65. The spouse benefit

is then 500/o of the partner’s PIA multiplied            by the spouse reduction factor.30        For married

respondents,     therefore,   the EBF reports a total benefit due the individual               as eitfie~” the benefit based

on hislher own earnings record, or the spouse benefit based on the spouse’s earnings record,

whichever    is higher.    (As noted above, in dual entitlement                cases, benefits are classified in the EBF as




~~If a respondent was not entitled to social security benefits based on his own work record as of his
age in 1992 his social security wealth benefit variable 10 would be set to zero; similarly for benefits
based on work until age 62 (in which case variable 17 would be set to zero), and until the normal
retirement age (and variable 24 would be zero).
~aNormally, the benefit would be subject to the earnings test which may reduce benefits for those
continuing to earn after receipt of benefits. The potential benefit may also be increased because of
the delayed retirement credit if the individual has worked after the normal retirement age and lost
some benefits to the earnings test. The earnings test does not apply after 70 years of age. Here,
earnings are imputed only before 1992 or if the individual is under the retirement age; benefits are
calculated only on or after 1!)!)2 and if the individual is above the retirement age. As a result the
wealth program assumes no earnings in years after the individual becomes eligible for that benefit.
~~The data user should understand that there are some cases where spouse benefits for HRS
respondents married at the time of the 1992 survey could not be computed based on the married
parties’ earnings records; see Section F for hot deck and missing data cases.
so In realltY this benefit would be subject to earnings tests, both one based on the individual’s own
work and also one based on the work of the partner (since the individual cannot collect benefits in
any month the partner does not also collect benefits). However, the wealth program assumes no
work past the retirement age as indicated in the previous footnote.

spouse benefits or survivor benefits as relevant; increasing            numbers of women are dually entitled

over time).

         If the worker is deceased, a widow/er may be eligible both for survivor benefits based on the

earnings record of the deceased and for retired-worker          benefits based on his or her own record.         If the

widow (er) is entitled to both, he or she is dually entitled and receives a full benefit based on his or

her own record plus a partial benefit based on the deceased spouse’s record.               The amount of the

partial benefit is the difference     between the widow/er’s    own retired-worker      benefit and the amount to

which he or she is entitled as a widow/er.       Because the benefit amount received in this case is equal

to the higher, surviving      spouse benefit, the variable is identified in Appendix       A as the “surviving

                                                         ,.
spouse benefit”,    The calculations    based on the individual’s       own benefits are exactly the same as in

the previous    situation.

         Unlike other social security retirement      benefits, surviving      spouse benefits may begin as early

as age 60.31 For the surviving       spouse calculations   (variables    12, 19, and 25), there is an additional

problem: these benefits may depend on when the partner died. Hence, a separate calculation                  is

made for each possible year of death between         1992 and the year immediately         before the year for

which the benefits are being calculated,       and the weights on the calculated       amounts are proportional

to the partner’s   mortality probability    in the successive years.

         For each possible year in which the retired-worker         partner could have died, the calculations

require several steps.       First, the worker’s PIA is calculated based on his/her earnings record up to the

year immediately      prior to death.   Note that if the age at death was younger than 62, these

calculations    differ from the regular old-age calculations     because there are fewer years in the

calculation    of average indexed monthly earnings.        Next, if the worker was eligible for any delayed

retirement     credits, these are added to the primary insurance          amount.   If the worker died before the

spouse turned 65, the PIA is subject to a reduction        of 5.7°/0 (not 5.7 percentage    points) for each year




31Variable 9 assumes no projected earnings, and the widow/er applies for benefits at age 60 (or
immediately, if she/he is older than age 60). For variables 16 and 23 the widow/er is assumed to
continue his/her employment status until, respectively, the early or the normal retirement age,
before applying for these benefits.
                                                                                                                            24




the spouse collects survivor benefits before age 65. Again, the calculation                  of this reduction   is

modified when the normal retirement                  age rises above its current value of 65. Finally, if the spouse

had applied for benefits, the surviving spouse benefit would be subject to a limitation                    that it should

not be any larger than the amount payable to the worker had he/she still been alive (as long as this

restriction    does not lower the benefit below 82. 5[% of the worker’s primary insurance                 amount).

           In overview,      then, for every year that a member of a married couple could collect benefits, the

person is modeled as receiving            either (a) benefits based on his or her own earnings record or spouse

benefits (conditional        on the partner being alive), or (b) benefits based on his or her own earnings

record or surviving         spouse benefits (conditional          on the partner being deceased).     As noted, those

modeled as dually entitled are shown as spouse or survivor beneficiaries.                    Data for the partner are

computed       similarly.    Finally, the amounts are weighted by the probabilities            that the two partners

will be individually        and/or jointly alive, and the amounts of the two partners are added.              These

calculations     are carried out in nominal terms of the year the benefits are to be collected,               and

projected     using the “intermediate”          assumptions       regarding wage growth and consumer price index

growth.~~

           To form a wealth measure, future benefits are discounted                 according to the interest rate in the

set of “intermediate”        assumptions       (Table 4), and the discounted       amounts summed for all the years

that either member of’ the couple might collect benefits.                   The wealth measure for unmarried

individuals     is similar, except that there is no partner, no spouse benefit, and no surviving                 spouse

benefit.    The wealth is simply the discounted               value of the future benefits based on the individual’s

own earnings history.          All values are reported as of’ the respondent’s         current age in 1992, discounted

using conditional       survival probabilities        based on the respondent’s      current age.ss




32If an individual was not eligible for own retirement benefits, his/her own worker benefits would be
set to zero. In a married couple, if either spouse was receiving DI in 1991, the wealth variables for
both spouses are set to -9 and the AIME and PIA are set to zero. If either partner would be projected
to be eligible for benefits by the early or normal retirement age, the relevant wealth variables is
positive.
3:3.As noted, this will probably underestimate wealth for potentially three-quarters of the currently
widowed women, and some unknown fraction of divorced women, inasmuch as we do not have their
former spouse’s earnings records.

           In the case of married couples, there are additional             components    for each of these social

security wealth variables        (variables     10-15, 17-22, and 24-29; these variables are set to zero for

nonrnarried     respondents).      One set of variables represents         the expected present value of components

of social security wealth that the respondent               could collect, and others represent the expected present

value of components         that his or her spouse could collect.         Each set of three is comprised      of (a) benefits

that the individual     could collect on his/her own earnings record, (b) spouse benefits that the

individual    could collect on the basis of the partner’s record, and (c) surviving spouse benefits that the

individual    could collect on the basis of the partner’s record if that partner died.

           For example,     if the wife has a PIA substantially          greater than twice her husband’s,       and if she

is younger than her husband, then it is likely that variables                10, 13, 14, and 15 in her record would

have positive amounts, and variables              11 and 12 would contain zeros.       This is because she will collect

benefits on her own account but never on her husband’s                   account, while the husband will be dually

entitled with the larger amounts received as spouse benefits and surviving                      spouse benefits rather

than benefits based on his own account.                However,     since the older husband reaches retirement        age

before she does, he will collect benefits for a few years on his own account until she applies and he is

able to collect spouse benefits.         The same figures will appear on the husband’s record, but the pairs of

three variables will be reversed.           That is, variables      10-12 will refer to benefits he is expected to

collect, and variables      13-15 will refer to variables she is expected to collect.

           These component       quantities     can be combined in different ways for different purposes.            For

example, if the interest is in an individual’s             lifetime retirement   benefits, then the appropriate

combination     would be the sum of variables             10-12 (or alternatively   variables   17-19 or 24-26).    This

will give the total expected value of the social security benefits that that individual                  is expected to

collect.   Alternatively,    if a researcher      were instead interested in retirement         incentives,   then variable

10 should be combined       with variables     14 and 15 to give the total expected benefits based on the

individual’s    own earnings history, assuming no change in spouse labor force behavior. s~

           The EBF data user must be aware that in a minority of cases, the social security wealth

variables computed       for the EBF file are subject to potentially       severe measurement    problems.   Two

instances involve individuals         who were single at the time of the HRS survey but who were previously

married.      For such individuals,    the social security wealth just described is necessarily     based on their

own earnings records in the EBF. However, if’ the individual               is a widow or widower, his or her actual

social security benefits might in reality be higher if they are computed based on the deceased

spouse’s record,:~~ Alternatively,       if the individual    had been divorced from a marriage that lasted for

10 or more years, the individual        might be eligible for benefits based on the former spouse’s earnings

record.    In neither case were the relevant records for deceased or divorced spouses obtained from the

Social Security Administration.         In fact, until someone files for benefits, the Social Security

Administration      does not necessarily     know that any two people are linked.

           A different measurement       problem arises for persons married in 1992 who might divorce, in

that spouse’s benefits are only payable to married persons who had been married at least 10 years by

the time of the divorce.     Our computations       for elements of social security wealth available to

members of a couple assuming that they remain married at least 10 years.

           Eventually,   it will be possible to fine-tune these wealth measures for divorced and widowed

individuals     once they begin collecting benefits;         for now the best that can be done is to calculate the

wealth based on the respondent’s          own record and to note there may be understatement          of benefits

for widows or widowers       and for divorced women who previously            were married for a decade or more.3G

E. Mortality      Data




31
 Depending    on whether the individual gives full weight to benefits that            the spouse will collect after
the death of the individual, the researcher may want to alter the relative             weights of variable 15 and
perhaps variable 14 in the sum.

         The mortality          data used in calculating            the wealth variables are taken from the Social

Security Administration’s             actuarial projections.~7           These projections     contain, among other things, the

estimated     probability       of survival, by sex, for each year of age up to 120 and for each birth cohort from

1900 to 1980; this time span includes all cohorts of interest for purposes of the HRS.

         Summary       statistics from these mortality data, reported in Table 5, indicate very strong

trends in increasing           life expectancy      over time. The most dramatic increases in life expectancy                    are

those at birth, but a large part of this increase comes from reduced infant mortality,                             which is clearly

not relevant for the HRS respondents.                    Even so, the~e are projected to be non-trivial            increases     in life

expectancy     at age 25 >]nd, perhaps more importantly,                        at age 65, and it is clear that the percentage         of

individuals    living to very old ages (age 85 or 100) is Koing to grow very rapidly in the coming years,

given recent mortality           trends.

See Table 5- Mortalitv            Rates by Cohort

        The EBF user should be aware that these nlortality statistics, and the social security wealth

variables calculated        from them, are population                averages by sex and birth cohort.       These mortality

data are not available separately               by race, and they also do not reflect any individual               differences

which might make individuals                 perceive their own nlortality probabilities            to be either higher or lower,

Vital Statistics mortality probabilities                are calculated          separately by race, but they are not projected

into the future, and they are only available to age 85. Given the increasing                           percentage     of the

population,    particularly        women, who survive past 85, this last limitation                 is a matter of concern.

        Our decision to employ mortality statistics furnished by the Social Security Administration                                     is

therefore a compromise.             Nei the~ these figures nor those supplied by Vital Statistics reflect all the

variables observable           by lndividua]s       that might plausibly affect individuals’           estimates    of their own

mortality probabilities.           Among such factors are peoples’ current health status including                     the presence

and severity of disease, family income levels, and whether they participate                           in any activities or




37Felicitie Bell in the SSA’S Office of the Actuary kindly supplied these data. A comparison of the
SSA data with the 1990 Vital Statistics figures (Table 5) suggests that the lower survival rates in the
Vital Statistics tables would have resulted in lower social security wealth figures than those reported
here.

occupations     which elevate the mortality risk. The construction                      of such individual-specific     mortality

tables would be a research program in itself, not one which we undertake                           here.    Hence it should be

understood     that the social security wealth variables reported in the EBF are approximations.                             Users

exploring    differences    in social security wealth arising from mortality probabilities                    that differ

according     to factors other than age and sex should derive their own social security wealth variables.

F. Hot Deck Procedures

          The social security variables just described are calculated                     for each 1992 HRS respondent         for

whom the HRS received an earnings record from the Social Security Administration.                                 That is, there

is a one-to-one    correspondence         between respondents’               records in the EBF, and the earnings        summary

file supplied by the SSA to the Health and Retirement                         Survey.   All of the variables except the

couple’s social security wealth amounts can be calculated from the respondent’s                             own earnings record,

and it does not matter whether the record for the spouse is present, or for that matter even whether

the individual    has a spouse.

         The situation is different for a married couple’s social security wealth variables,                          since in this

case it is necessary       to have a record for the spouse as well. For some 1356 out of 4077 married HRS

sample couples, the social security file contains a record for one spouse but not for the other. ss This

could have occurred either because the spouse did not grant permission                           to access the earnings record,

or because a valid match to the earnings record could not be found at the Social Security

Administration,        In these cases, for the missing spouse record, we substituted                    an actual earnings

record from another respondent              with the same sex and similar levels of earnings and labor force

attachment.~~     This procedure         is known as “hot-decking”              in the survey literature.    We emphasize      that

in such cases, there is only one record in the summary social security variables file; we did not create




~~Some of those without an earnings record had never worked for pay in covered employment. Of the
1356 spouses without social security records for instance, 614 were women.
j!) If there were no records which matched exactly the five categories, adjacent cells were searched
until a match was found, Adj scent earnings cells were searched first, followed by adjacent age cells
and adjacent experience cells. In no case was it necessary to vary earnings, age, and experience by
more than one categol’y to find a match. Also, in no case was male record substituted for a female or
vice versa, or a record for someone not working in 19!)2 substituted for someone working or vice
versa.

a record for the “hot-decked”      or missing spouse’s earnings history.    Rather, this hot deck record was

used only to impute the family social security wealth variables for the respondent              for whom we did

receive a social security earnings record. (It will be recalled that respondents        surveyed by the HRS,

who were outside the HRS age range of 51-61 in 1992, appear in the HRS by virtue of being married

to age-eligible    spouses.   The EBF contains records only for age-eligible     respondents,    as noted above,

though family social security wealth computations          include benefit estimates for age-ineligible

spouses).

           For the hot deck procedure,    we relied on all the earning records received from the Social

Security Administration.        Each non-missing    record was assigned to a single cell in a five-way

classification    table, based on the information    the respondent   gave in the household      survey.    The table

was chosen to reflect the five variables that we believed were closely associated with different levels

of average monthly eal’nin~s and, therefore.        potential benefit amounts,    These five variables       are: sex

(male or female), work status at the time of the 1992 interview         (working or not working),      12

categories   of age in 1992, 26 categories   of annual earnings, and 6 categories     of observed work

experience .40 For individuals     who were working at the time of the 1992 interview,          annual earnings

are taken as the reported earnings for the calendar year 1991, while if the individual             was not

working at the time of the 1:)92 interview,        annual earnings are calculated from the wage (which

could be given as an amount per hour, per week, per month, or annual) in the last job. Total

observed experience      is the sLnn of the tenures in the current job in 1992 (if employed       at the time), the

last job (if not employed     at the time), and up to three previous jobs that lasted for more than 5

years.41




40 The age categories used were five years in width for ages between 25 and 74. Individuals 2Ayears
old and younger were grouped into a single category. as were people 75 years and older. The
earnings categories are $2,000 wide between $0 and $24,000, $3,000 wide up to $42,000, $4,000 wide
LIp to $50,000, $5,000 wide LIpto !$60,000 and $10,000 wide up to $100,000.    Earnings over $100,000
were grouped into a single cell, since this is considerably above the social security taxable maximum.
The experience categories are O-5, 6-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, and 41+ years.
~I The HRS did not ask respondents directly about the total number of years they had been employed
in all jobs, so experience must be proxied by the total experience in jobs reported in the survey,
                                                                                                                          30



         The rationale    for the earnings and experience          variables is fairly clear: since the average

monthly earnings figure in the social security calculations             depends on the average earnings         and the

number of years the Individuals         have been in covered employment,           it is important   to take this

information    into account when matching.           Age is important in considering       whether a given number

of years of experience     represents    a large or moderate percentage          of the number of years of eventual

experience    when the individual       retires.   Also, sex is important if it is likely that participation

patterns vary considerably      between men and women, even for those with similar earnings.                   Finally,

it probably makes a considerable         difference,    especially for the projected    wealth variable, whether the

individual    is or is not currently working.       The projected earnings of a married women who has

worked in the past but who is not currently working may well be quite different from those of a

married women with a same average earnings but who is continuing                     to work,

        Having grouped all available earnings records into this five-way table, the records were then

randomized     within each cell of the table.       Since there are 7,488 potential      cells in the table, and we

have 8,394 earnings records, each cell has on average a little more than one record.                   Then, when we

have an individual     with a social security earnings record but no matched record for the spouse, we

select a “donor” HRS household          file to construct the gender, 1992 work status, wage, and experience

variables for the Spotlse. and use a randomly            chosen   record from the same age-gender-work         status-

wage-experience     cell to represent the spouse’s missing record.          When necessary,       the wage,

experience,    andlor age cells are broadened          until a match is found.    Again, this matched record is used

only to construct   measures of family social security wealth for those individuals               for whom we do have

an actual earnings record.




III. Conclusion

        Researchers      using the Health and Retirement           Survey require information        on earnings,

labor market attachlnent,      and social security benefits, in order to better understand             the factors

affecting both the retirement     decision and well-being         in old age. It is anticipated   that analysts

will find the aggregated     variables in the restricted Earnings and Benefits File to be of substantial
                                                                                                                                 31




use toward this end. It is expected that the average user will be able to use these created

variables as they are: other analysts will desire to combine these variables                       along with their own

algorithms    to derive alternate outcomes.

          The Earnings        and Benefits File, along with full documentation                 and datafiles from the Health

and Retirement         Survey, is a restricted file available from the University               of Michigan’s    Institute for

Survey Research         under a series of limited data access conditions.                 It can be merged only with

versions of the HRS that contain no geographic                         detail below the Census Division level.    Queries

regarding    the HRS and the EBF should be directed by e-mail to hrsquest@umich,                         edu.
