                                           ABSTRACT

What do academics have to offer market risk management practitioners in financial institutions?

Current industry practice largely follows one of two extremely restrictive approaches: historical

simulation or RiskMetrics. In contrast, we favor flexible methods based on recent developments in

financial econometrics, which are likely to produce more accurate assessments of market risk.

Clearly, the demands of real-world risk management in financial institutions      in particular, real-

time risk tracking in very high-dimensional situations   impose strict limits on model complexity.

Hence we stress parsimonious models that are easily estimated, and we discuss a variety of practical

approaches for high-dimensional covariance matrix modeling, along with what we see as some of

the pitfalls and problems in current practice. In so doing we hope to encourage further dialog

between the academic and practitioner communities, hopefully stimulating the development of

improved market risk management technologies that draw on the best of both worlds.

1. Introduction

        It is now widely agreed that financial asset return volatilities and correlations (henceforth
“volatilities”) are time-varying, with persistent dynamics. This is true across assets, asset classes,
time periods, and countries. Moreover, asset return volatilities are central to finance, whether in
asset pricing, portfolio allocation, or market risk measurement. Hence the field of financial
econometrics devotes considerable attention to time-varying volatility and associated tools for its
measurement, modeling and forecasting.

       Here we survey, unify and extend recent developments in the financial econometrics of
time-varying volatility, focusing exclusively on practical applications to the measurement and
management of market risk, stressing parsimonious models that are easily estimated. Our
ultimate goal is to stimulate dialog between the academic and practitioner communities,
advancing best-practice market risk measurement and management technologies by drawing
upon the best of both worlds. Three themes appear repeatedly, and so we highlight them here.

        The first is the issue of aggregation level. We consider both aggregated (portfolio level)
and disaggregated (asset level) modeling, emphasizing the related distinction between risk
measurement and risk management, because risk measurement generally requires only a
portfolio-level model, whereas risk management requires an asset-level model. At the asset level,
the issue of dimensionality and dimensionality reduction arises repeatedly, and we devote
considerable attention to methods for tractable modeling of the very high-dimensional
covariance matrices of practical relevance.

       The second theme concerns the use of low-frequency vs. high-frequency data, and the
associated issue of parametric vs. nonparametric volatility measurement. We treat all cases, but
we emphasize the appeal of volatility measurement using nonparametric methods in conjunction
with high-frequency data, followed by modeling that is intentionally parametric.

        The third theme relates to the issue of unconditional vs. conditional risk measurement.
We argue that, for most financial risk management purposes, the conditional perspective is
exclusively relevant, notwithstanding, for example, the fact that popular approaches based on
historical simulation and extreme-value theory typically adopt an unconditional perspective. We
advocate, moreover, moving beyond a conditional volatility perspective to a full conditional
density perspective, and we discuss methods for constructing and evaluating full conditional
density forecasts.

        We proceed systematically in several steps. In section 2, we consider portfolio level
analysis, directly modeling portfolio volatility using historical simulation, exponential
smoothing, and GARCH methods. In section 3, we consider asset level analysis, modeling asset
covariance matrices using exponential smoothing and multivariate GARCH methods, paying
special attention to dimensionality-reduction methods. In section 4, we explore the use of high-
frequency data for improved covariance matrix measurement and modeling, treating realized
variance and covariance, and again discussing procedures for dimensionality reduction. In
section 5 we treat the construction of complete conditional density forecasts via simulation
methods. We conclude in section 6.
2. Portfolio Level Analysis: Modeling Portfolio Volatility

       Portfolio risk measurement requires only a univariate, portfolio-level model (e.g., Benson
and Zangari, 1997). In this section we discuss such univariate, portfolio-based methods. In
contrast, active portfolio risk management, including portfolio allocation, requires a multivariate
model, as we discuss subsequently in section 3.

        In particular, portfolio level analysis is rarely done other than via historical simulation
(defined below). But we will argue that there is no reason why one cannot estimate a
parsimonious dynamic model for portfolio level returns. If interest centers on the distribution of
the portfolio returns, then this distribution can be modeled directly rather than via aggregation
based on a larger and almost inevitably less-well-specified multivariate model.

         Berkowitz and O’Brien (2002) find evidence that existing bank risk models perform
poorly and are easy outperformed by a simple univariate GARCH model (defined below). Their
result is remarkable in that they estimate a GARCH model fit to the time series of actual
historical portfolio returns where the underlying asset weights are changing over time. Berkowitz
and O’Brien find that bank’s reported Value-at-Risk (VaRs) on average underestimate risk when
comparing ex post P/Ls with ex ante VaR forecasts. This finding could however simply be due to
the reported P/Ls being “dirty” in that they contain non-risky income from fees, commissions
and intraday trading profits.1 More seriously though, Berkowitz and O’Brien find that the VaR
violations which do occur tend to cluster in time. Episodes such as the Fall 1998 Russia default
and LTCM debacle set off a dramatic and persistent increase in market volatility which bank
models appear to largely ignore, or at least react to with considerable delay. Such VaR violation
clustering is evidence of a lack of conditionality in bank VaR systems which in turn is a key
theme in our discussion below.2

       We first discuss the construction of historical portfolio values, which is a necessary
precursor to any portfolio-level VaR analysis. We then discuss direct computation of portfolio
VaR via historical simulation, exponential smoothing, and GARCH modeling.3

2.1 Constructing Historical Pseudo Portfolio Values

       In principle it is easy to construct a time series of historical portfolio returns using current

       1
         Even though the Basel Accord calls for banks to report 1% VaR’s, for various reasons
most banks tend to actually report more conservative VaR’s. Rather than simply scaling up a 1%
VaR based on some “arbitrary” multiplication factor, the procedures that we discuss below is
readily adapted to achieve any desired, more conservative, VaR.
       2
           See also Jackson, Maude and Perraudin (1997).
       3
         Duffie and Pan (1997) provide an earlier incisive discussion of related VaR procedures
and corresponding practical empirical problems.

                                                  2
portfolio holdings and historical asset returns:


                                                   .                                        (1)


In practice, however, historical asset prices for the assets held today may not be available.
Examples where difficulties arise include derivatives, individual bonds with various maturities,
private equity, new public companies, merger companies and so on.

        For these cases “pseudo” historical prices must be constructed using either pricing
models, factor models or some ad hoc considerations. The current assets without historical prices
can for example be matched to “similar” assets by capitalization, industry, leverage, and
duration. Historical pseudo asset prices and returns can then be constructed using the historical
prices on these substitute assets.

2.2 Volatility via Historical Simulation

        Banks often rely on VaRs from historical simulations (HS-VaR). In this case the VaR is
calculated as the 100p’th percentile or the (T+1)p’th order statistic of the set of pseudo returns
calculated in (1). We can write

                                     ,                                                      (2)

where              is taken from the set of ordered pseudo returns                          . If
(T+1)p is not an integer value then the two adjacent observations can be interpolated to calculate
the VaR.

        Historical simulation has some serious problems, which have been well-documented.
Perhaps most importantly, it does not properly incorporate conditionality into the VaR forecast.
The only source of dynamics in the HS-VaR is the fact that the sample window in (1) is updated
over time. However, this source of conditionality is minor in practice.4

        Figure 1 illustrates the hidden dangers of HS as discussed by Pritsker (2001). We plot the
daily percentage loss on an S&P500 portfolio along with the 1% HS-VaR calculated from a 250
day moving window. The crash on October 19, 1987 dramatically increased market volatility;
however, the HS-VaR barely moves. Only after the second large drop which occurred on
October 26 does the HS-VaR increase noticeably.

        This admittedly extreme example illustrates a key problem with the HS-VaR.


        4
         Bodoukh, Richardson, Whitelaw (1998) introduce updating into the historical
simulation method. Note, however, the concerns in Pritsker (2001).

                                                       3
Mechanically, from equation (2) we see that HS-VaR changes significantly only if the
observations around the order statistic         change significantly. When using a 250-day
moving window for a 1% HS-VaR, only the second and third smallest returns will matter for the
calculation. Including a crash in the sample, which now becomes the smallest return, may
therefore not change the HS-VaR very much if the new second smallest return is similar to the
previous one.

        Moreover, the lack of a properly-defined conditional model in the HS methodology
implies that it does not allow for the construction of a term structure of VaR. Calculating a 1% 1-
day HS-VaR may be possible on a window of 250 observations, but calculating a 10-day 1%
VaR on 250 daily returns is not. Often the 1-day VaR is simply scaled by the square root of 10,
but this extrapolation is only valid under the assumption of i.i.d. daily returns. A redeeming
feature of the daily HS-VaR is exactly that it does not rely on an assumption of i.i.d. returns, and
the square root scaling therefore seems curious at best.

        In order to further illustrate the lack of conditionality in the HS-VaR method consider
Figure 2. We first simulate daily portfolio returns from a mean-reverting volatility model and
then calculate the nominal 1% HS-VaR on these returns using a moving window of 250
observations. As the true portfolio return distribution is known, the true daily coverage of the
nominal 1% HS-VaR can be calculated using the return generating model. Figure 2 shows the
conditional coverage probability of the 1% HS-VaR over time. Notice from the figure how an
HS-VaR with a nominal coverage probability of 1% can have a true conditional probability as
high as 10%, even though the unconditional coverage is correctly calibrated at 1%. On any given
day the risk manager thinks that there is a 1% chance of getting a return worse than the HS-VaR
but in actuality there may as much as a 10% chance of exceeding the VaR. Figure 2 highlights
the potential benefit of conditional density modeling: The HS-VaR computes an essentially
unconditional VaR which on any given day can be terribly wrong. A conditional density model
will generate a dynamic VaR in an attempt to keep the conditional coverage rate at 1% on any
given day, thus creating a horizontal line in Figure 2.

        The above discussion also hints at a problem with the VaR risk measures itself. It does
not say anything about how large the expected loss will be on the days where the VaR is
exceeded. Other measures such as expected shortfall do, but VaR has emerged as the industry
risk measurement standard and we will focus on it here. The methods we will suggest below can,
however, equally well be used to calculate expected shortfall and other related risk measures.

2.3 Volatility via Exponential Smoothing

        Although the HS-VaR methodology discussed above makes no explicit assumptions
about the distributional model generating the returns, the RiskMetrics (RM) filter/model instead
assumes a very tight parametric specification. One can begin to incorporate conditionality via
univariate portfolio-level exponential smoothing of squared portfolio returns, in precise parallel
to the exponential smoothing of individual return squares and cross products that underlies RM.


                                                 4
       Still taking the portfolio-level pseudo returns from (1) as the data series of interest we
can define the portfolio-level RM variance as

                                       ,                                                     (3)

where the variance forecast for day t is constructed at the end of day t-1 using the square of the
return observed at the end of day t-1 as well as the variance on day t-1. In practice this recursion
can be initialized by setting the initial  equal to the unconditional sample standard deviation,
say .

       Note that back substitution in (3) yields an expression for the current smoothed value as
an exponentially weighted moving average of past squared returns:




where                    Hence the name “exponential smoothing.”


        Following RM, the VaR is simply calculated as

                                   ,                                                         (4)

where Mp-1 denotes the pth quantile in the standard normal distribution. Although the smoothing
parameter 8 may in principle be calibrated to best fit the specific historical returns at hand,
following RM it is often simply fixed at 0.94 with daily returns. The implicit assumption of zero
mean and standard normal innovations therefore implies that no parameters need to be estimated.

        The conditional variance for the k-day aggregate return in RM is simply

                                                                  .                          (5)

The RM model can thus be thought of as a random walk model in variance. The lack of mean-
version in the RM variance model implies that the term structure of volatility is flat. Figure 3
illustrates the difference between the volatility term structure for the random walk RM model
versus a mean-reverting volatility model. Assuming a low current volatility, which is identical
across models, the mean-reverting model will display an upward sloping term structure of
volatility whereas the RM model will extrapolate the low current volatility across all horizons.
When taken this literally the RM model does not appear to be a prudent approach to volatility
modeling. The dangers of scaling the daily variance by k, as done in (5), are discussed further in
Diebold, Hickman, Inoue, and Schuermann (1998).

2.4 Volatility via GARCH



                                                 5
        The implausible temporal aggregation properties of the RM model which we discussed
above motivates us to introduce the general class of GARCH models which imply mean-
reversion and which contain the RM model as a special case.

       First we specify the general univariate portfolio return process

                                                               .                          (6)

In the following we will assume that the mean is zero which is common in risk management, at
least when short horizons are considered. Although difficult to estimate with much accuracy in
practice, mean-dynamics could in principle easily be incorporated into the models discussed
below.

       The simple symmetric GARCH(1,1) model introduced by Bollerslev (1986) is written as

                                      .                                                   (7)

Extensions to higher order models are straightforward, but for notational simplicity we will
concentrate on the (1,1) case here and throughout the chapter. Repeated substitution in (7)
readily yields,

                                  ,

so that the GARCH(1,1) process implies that current volatility is an exponentially weighted
moving average of past squared returns. Hence the GARCH(1,1) volatility measurement is
seemingly, and perhaps surprisingly, very similar to RM volatility measurement. There are
crucial differences, however.

       First, GARCH parameters, and hence ultimately GARCH volatility, are estimated using
rigorous statistical methods that facilitate probabilistic inference, in contrast to exponential
smoothing in which the parameter is set in an ad hoc fashion. Typically we estimates the vector
of GARCH parameters 2 by maximizing the log likelihood function,


                                                                   .                      (8)


Note that the assumption of conditional normality underlying the (quasi) likelihood function in
(8) is merely a matter of convenience, allowing for the calculation of consistent and asymptotic
normal parameter estimates. The conditional return distribution will generally not be normal.
The log-likelihood optimization in (9) can only be done numerically. However, GARCH models
are parsimonious and specified directly in terms of univariate portfolio returns, so that only a
single numerical optimization needs to be performed. This optimization can be performed in a
matter of seconds on a standard desktop computer using standard MBA-ware, as discussed by


                                                6
Christoffersen (2003).5

         Second, the covariance stationary GARCH(1,1) process has dynamics that eventually
produce reversion in volatility to a constant long-run value, which enables interesting and
realistic forecasts. This contrasts sharply with the RM exponential smoothing approach. As is
well-known (e.g., Nerlove and Wage, 1964, Theil and Wage, 1964), exponential smoothing is
optimal if and only if squared returns follow a “random walk plus noise” model (a “local level”
model in the terminology of Harvey, 1989), in which case the minimum MSE forecast at any
horizon is simply the current smoothed value. The historical records of volatilities of numerous
assets (not to mention the fact that volatilities are bounded below by zero) suggest, however, that
volatilities are unlikely to follow random walks, and hence that the flat forecast function
associated with exponential smoothing is unrealistic and undesirable for volatility forecasting
purposes.

       Let us elaborate. We can rewrite the GARCH(1,1) model in (7) as

                                              ,                                            (9)

where                         denotes the long-run, or unconditional daily variance. This
representation shows that the GARCH forecast is constructed as an average of three elements.
Equivalently we can also write the model as

                                                          ,                                (10)

which explicitly shows how the GARCH(1,1) model forecast by making adjustments to the
current variance and the influence of the squared return around the long-run, or unconditional
variance. Finally, we can also write

                                                          ,

where the last term on the right-hand-side on average is equal to zero. Hence, this shows how
the GARCH(1,1) forecasts by making adjustments around the long-run variance with variance
persistence governed by ("+$) and the (contemporaneous) volatility-of-volatility linked to the
level of volatility as well as the size of ".

        The mean-reverting property of GARCH volatility forecasts has important implications
for the volatility term structure. To construct the volatility term structure corresponding to a
GARCH(1,1) model, we need the k-day ahead variance forecast, which is

                                                  .                                        (11)


       5
         For further discussion of inference in GARCH models see also Andersen, Bollerslev,
Christoffersen and Diebold (2005).

                                                      7
Assuming that the daily returns are serially uncorrelated, the variance of the k-day cumulative
returns, which we use to calculate the volatility term structure, is then

                                                                   .                       (12)

Compare this mean-reverting expression with the RM forecast in (5). In particular, note that the
speed of mean-reversion in the GARCH(1,1) model is governed by "+$. The mean-reverting
line in Figure 3 above is calculated from (12), normalizing by k and taking the square root to
display the graph in daily standard deviation units.

        Third, the dynamics associated with the GARCH(1,1) model afford rich and intuitive
interpretations, and they are readily generalized to even richer specifications. To take one
important example, note that the dynamics may be enriched via higher-ordered specifications,
such as GARCH(2,2). Indeed, Engle and Lee (1999) show that the GARCH(2,2) is of particular
interest, because under certain parameter restrictions it implies a component structure obtained
by allowing for time variation in the long-run variance in (10),

                                                 ,                                         (13)

with the long-run component, qt , modeled as a separate autoregressive process,

                                            .                                              (14)

Many authors, including Gallant, Hsu and Tauchen (1999) and Alizadeh, Brandt and Diebold
(2002) have found evidence of component structure in volatility, suitable generalizations of
which can be shown to approximate long memory (e.g., Andersen and Bollerslev, 1997, and
Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard, 2001), which is routinely found in asset return volatilities (e.g.,
Bollerslev and Mikkelsen, 1999).

       To take a second example of the extensibility of GARCH models, note that all models
considered thus far imply symmetric response to positive vs. negative return shocks. However,
equity markets, and particularly equity indexes, often seem to display a strong asymmetry,
whereby a negative return boosts volatility by more than a positive return of the same absolute
magnitude. The GARCH model is readily generalized to capture this effect. In particular, the
asymmetric GJR-GARCH(1,1) model of Glosten, Jagannathan and Runkle (1993) is simply
defined by

                                                          .                                (15)

Asymmetric response in the conventional direction thus occurs when          .6


       6
         Engle (2001, 2004) demonstrate empirically how allowing for asymmetries in the
conditional variance can materially affect GARCH-based VaR calculations.

3. Asset Level Analysis: Modeling Asset Return Covariance Matrices

        The discussion above focused on the specification of dynamic volatility models for the
aggregate portfolio return. These methods are well-suited for providing forecasts of portfolio
level risk measures such as the aggregate VaR. However they are less well-suited for providing
input into the active portfolio and risk management process. If, for example, the portfolio
manager wants to know the optimal portfolio weights to minimize portfolio variance, then a
multivariate model, which provides a forecast for the entire covariance matrix, is needed.7

        Multivariate models are also better suited for calculating sensitivity risk measures to
answer questions such as: “If I add an additional 1,000 shares of IBM to my portfolio, how much
will my VaR increase?” Moreover, bank-wide VaR is made up of many desks with multiple
traders on each desk, and any sub-portfolio analysis is not possible with the aggregate portfolio-
based approach.8

       In this section we therefore consider the specification of models for the full N-
dimensional conditional distribution of asset returns. Generalizing the expression in (6), we write
the multivariate model as

                                                            ,                               (16)

where we have again set the mean to zero and where I denotes the identity matrix. The N×N
     matrix can be thought of as the square-root, or Cholesky decomposition, of the covariance
matrix . This section will focus on specifying a dynamic model for this matrix, while section
5 will suggest methods for specifying the distribution of the innovation vector Zt .

        Constructing positive semidefinite (psd) covariance matrix forecasts, which ensures that
the portfolio variance is always non-negative, presents a key challenge below. The covariance
matrix will have ½N(N+1) distinct elements, but structure needs to be imposed to guarantee psd.
The practical issues involved in estimating the parameters guarding the dynamics for the
½N(N+1) elements are related and equally important. Although much of the academic literature
focuses on relatively small multivariate examples, in this section we will confine attention to
methods that are applicable even with N is (relatively) large.

3.1 Covariance Matrices via Exponential Smoothing


       7
         Brandt, Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2004) provide an alternative and intriguing new
approach for achieving dimension reduction, by explicitly parameterizing the portfolio weights
as a function of directly observable state variables, thereby sidestepping the need to estimate the
full covariance matrix; see also Pesaran and Zaffaroni (2004).
       8
        See Manganelli (2004) for an interesting new low-dimensional approach to this
problem.

                                                 9
       The natural analogue to the RM variance dynamics in (3) assumes that the covariance
matrix dynamics are driven by the single parameter 8 for all variances and covariance in :

                                        .                                                   (17)

The covariance matrix recursion may again be initialized by setting       equal to the sample
average coverage matrix.

        The RM approach is clearly very restrictive, imposing the same degree of smoothness on
all elements of the estimated covariance matrix. Moreover, covariance matrix forecasts
generated by RM are in general suboptimal, for precisely the same reason as with the univariate
RM variance forecasts discussed earlier. If the multivariate RM approach has costs, it also has
benefits. In particular, the simple structure in (17) immediately guarantees that the estimated
covariance matrices are psd, as the outer product of the return vector must be psd unless some
assets are trivial linear combinations of others. Moreover, as long as the initial covariance matrix
is psd (which will necessarily be the case when we set      equal to the sample average coverage
matrix as suggested above, so long as the sample size T is larger than the number of assets N),
RM covariance matrix forecasts will also be psd, because a sum of positive semi-definite
matrices is itself positive semi-definite.

3.2 Covariance Matrices via Multivariate GARCH

       Although easily implemented, the RM approach (17) may be much too restrictive in
many cases. Hence we now consider multivariate GARCH models. The most general
multivariate GARCH(1,1) model is

                                                                   ,                        (18)

where the vech (“vector half”) operator converts the unique upper triangular elements of a
symmetric matrix into a ½N(N+1)×1 column vector, and A and B are ½N(N+1)×½N(N+1)
matrices. Notice that in this general specification, each element of St-1 may potentially affect
each element of St , and similarly for the outer product of past returns, producing a serious
“curse-of-dimensionality” problem. In its most general form the GARCH(1,1) model (18) has a
total of 1/2N4 + N3 + N2 + 1/2N = O(N4) parameters. Hence, for example, for N=100 the model
has 51,010,050 parameters! Estimating this many free parameters is obviously infeasible. Note
also that without specifying more structure on the model there is no guarantee of positive
definiteness of the fitted or forecasted covariance matrices.

       The dimensionality problem can be alleviated somewhat by replacing the constant term
via “variance targeting” as suggested by Engle and Mezrich (1996):

                                                     .                                      (19)


                                                10
This is also very useful from a forecasting perspective, as small perturbations in A and B
sometimes result in large changes in the implied unconditional variance to which the long-run
forecasts converge. However, there are still too many parameters to be estimated simultaneously
in A and B in the general multivariate model when N is large.

        More severe (and hence less palatable) restrictions may be imposed to achieve additional
parsimony, as for example with the “diagonal GARCH” pameterization proposed by Bollerslev,
Engle and Wooldridge (1988). In a diagonal GARCH model, the matrices A and B have zeros in
all off-diagonal elements, which in turn implies that each element of the covariance matrix
follows a simple dynamic with univariate flavor: conditional variances depend only on own lags
and own lagged squared returns, and conditional covariances depend only on own lags and own
lagged cross products of returns. Even the diagonal GARCH framework, however, results in
         parameters to be jointly estimated, which is computationally infeasible in systems of
medium and large size.

       One approach is to move to the most draconian version of the diagonal GARCH model,
in which the matrices B and A are simply scalar matrices. Specifically,

                                        ,                                                     (20)

where the value of each diagonal element of B is    , and each diagonal element of A is   .
Rearrangement yields

                                                      ,

which is closely related to the multivariate RM approach, with the important difference that it
introduces, a non-degenerate long-run covariance matrix S to which      reverts (provided that
"+$<1). Notice also though that all variance and covariances are assumed to have the same
speed of mean reversion, because of common " and $ parameters, which may be overly
restrictive.

3.3 Dimensionality Reduction I: Covariance Matrices via Flex-GARCH

        Ledoit, Santa-Clara and Wolf (2003) suggest an attractive “Flex-GARCH” method for
reducing the computational burden in the estimation of the diagonal GARCH model without
moving to the scalar version. Intuitively, Flex-GARCH decentralizes the estimation procedure
by estimating N(N+1)/2 bivariate GARCH models with certain parameter constraints, and then
“pasting” them together to form the matrices A, B, and C in (18). Specific transformations of the
parameter matrices from the bivariate models ensure that the resulting conditional covariance
matrix forecast is psd. Flex-GARCH appears to be a viable modeling approach when N is larger
than say five, where estimation of the general diagonal GARCH model becomes intractable.
However, when N is of the order of thirty and above, which is often the case in practical risk
management applications, it becomes cumbersome to estimate N(N+1)/2 bivariate models, and
alternative dimensionality reduction methods are necessary. One such method is the dynamic

                                               11
conditional correlation framework, to which we now turn.

3.4 Dimensionality Reduction II: Covariance Matrices via Dynamic Conditional Correlation

       Recall the simple but useful decomposition of the covariance matrix into the correlation
matrix pre- and post-multiplied by the diagonal standard deviation matrix,

                       .                                                                      (21)

Bollerslev (1990) uses this decomposition, along with an assumption of constant conditional
correlations ('t = ') to develop his Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC) GARCH model.
The assumption of constant conditional correlation, however, is arguably too restrictive over
long time periods.

        Engle (2002) generalizes Bollerslev’s (1990) CCC model to obtain a Dynamic
Conditional Correlation (DCC) model. Crucially, he also provides a decentralized estimation
procedure. First, one fits to each asset return an appropriate univariate GARCH model (the
models can differ from asset to asset) and then standardizes the returns by the estimated GARCH
conditional standard deviations. Then one uses the standardized return vector, say            ,
to model the correlation dynamics. For instance, a simple scalar diagonal GARCH(1,1)
correlation dynamic would be

                                          ,                                                   (23)

with the individual correlations in the 't matrix defined by the corresponding normalized
elements of Qt,

                                    .                                                         (24)

The normalization in (24) ensures that all correlation forecasts fall in the [-1;1] interval, while
the simple scalar structure for the dynamics of Qt in (23) ensures that 't is psd.

       If C is pre-estimated by correlation targeting, as discussed earlier, only two parameters
need to be estimated in (23). Estimating variance dynamics asset-by-asset and then assuming a
simple structure for the correlation dynamics thus ensures that the DCC model can be
implemented in large systems: N+1 numerical optimizations must be performed, but each
involves only a few parameters, regardless of the size of N.

       Although the DCC model offers a promising framework for exploring correlation
dynamics in large systems, the simple dynamic structure in (23) may be too restrictive for many
applications. For example, volatility and correlation responses may be asymmetric in the signs of




                                                 12
past shocks.9 Researchers are therefore currently working to extend the DCC model to more
general dynamic correlation specifications. Relevant work includes Franses and Hafner (2003),
Pelletier (2004), and Cappiello, Engle, and Sheppard (2004).

        To convey a feel for the importance of allowing for time-varying conditional correlation,
we show in Figure 4 the bond return correlation between Germany and Japan estimated using a
DCC model allowing for asymmetric correlation responses to positive versus negative returns,
reproduced from Cappiello, Engle, and Sheppard (2004). The conditional correlation clearly
varies a great deal. Note in particular the dramatic change in the conditional correlation around
the time of the Euro’s introduction in 1999. Such large movements in conditional correlation are
not rare, and they underscore the desirability of allowing for different dynamics in volatility
versus correlation.10

4. Exploiting High-Frequency Return Data for Improved Covariance Matrix Measurement

       Thus far our discussion has implicitly focused on models tailored to capturing the
dynamics in returns by relying only on daily return information. For many assets, however, high-
frequency price data are available and should be useful for the estimation of asset return
variances and covariances. Here we review recent work in this area and speculate on its
usefulness for constructing large-scale models of market risk.

4.1 Realized Variances

        Following Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Labys (2003) (henceforth ABDL), define
the realized variance (RV) on day t using returns constructed at the ∆ intra-day frequency as

                             ,                                                            (25)

where 1/∆ is, for example, 48 for 30-minute returns in 24-hour markets. Theoretically, letting ∆
go to zero, which implies sampling continuously, we approach the true integrated volatility of
the underlying continuous time process on day t.11




       9
         A related example is the often-found positive relationship between volatility changes
and correlation changes. If present but ignored, this effect can have serious consequences for
portfolio hedging effectiveness.
       10
           As another example, cross-market stock-bond return correlations are often found to be
close to zero or slightly positive during bad economic times (recessions), but negative in good
economic times (expansions); see, e.g., the discussion in Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and
Vega (2004).
       11
            For a full treatment, see Andersen, Bollerslev and Diebold (2004).

                                                 13
        In practice, market microstructure noise will affect the RV estimate when ∆ gets too
small. Prices sampled at 15-30 minute intervals, depending on the market, are therefore often
used. Notice also that, in markets that are not open 24 hours per day, the potential jump from the
closing price on day t-1 to the opening price on day t must be accounted for. This can be done
using the method in Hansen and Lunde (2004). As is the case for the daily GARCH models
considered above, corrections may also have to be made for the fact that days following
weekends and holidays tend to have higher than average volatility.

         Although the daily realized variance is just an estimate of the underlying integrated
variance and likely measured with some error, it presents an intriguing opportunity: it is
potentially highly accurate, and indeed accurate enough such that we might take the realized
daily variance as an observation of the true daily variance, modeling and forecasting it using
standard ARMA time series tools. Allowing for certain kinds of measurement error can also
easily be done in this framework. The upshot is that if the fundamental frequency of interest is
daily, then using sufficiently high-quality intra-day price data enables the risk manager to treat
volatility as essentially observed. This is vastly different from the GARCH style models
discussed above, in which the daily variance is constructed recursively from past daily returns.

       As an example of the direct modeling of realized volatility, one can specify a simple first-
order autoregressive model for the log realized volatility,

                                             ,                                               (26)

which can be estimated using simple OLS. The log specification guarantees positivity of
forecasted volatilities and induces (approximate) normality, as demonstrated empirically in
Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Labys (2000, 2001). ABDL show the superior forecasting
properties of RV-based forecasts compared with GARCH forecasts. Rather than relying on a
simple short-memory ARMA model as in (26), they specify a fractionally integrated model to
better account for the apparent long-memory routinely found in volatility dynamics.

         Along these lines, Figure 5 shows clear evidence of long-memory in foreign exchange
RVs as evidenced by the sample autocorrelation function for lags of 1 through 100 days. We first
construct the daily RVs from 30-minute FX returns and then calculate the corresponding daily
sample autocorrelations of the RVs. Note that the RV autocorrelations are significantly positive
for all 100 lags when compared with the conventional 95-percent Bartlett confidence bands.

       The RV forecasts may also be integrated into the standard GARCH modeling framework,
as explored in Engle and Gallo (2004).12 Similarly, rather than relying on GARCH variance
models to standardize returns in the first step of the DCC model, RVs can be used instead. Doing


       12
         Intriguing new procedures for combining high-frequency data and RV type measures
with lower frequency daily returns in volatility forecasting models have also recently been
developed by Ghysels, Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2005).

                                                 14
so would result in a more accurate standardization and would require only a single numerical
optimization step – estimation of correlation dynamics – thereby rendering the computational
burden in DCC nearly negligible.

        We next discuss how realized variances and their natural multivariate counterparts,
realized covariances, can be used in a more systematic fashion in risk management.

4.2 Realized Covariances

        Generalizing the realized variance idea to the multivariate case, we can define the daily
realized covariance matrix as

                                      .                                                       (27)

The upshot again is that variances and covariances no longer have to be extracted from a
nonlinear model estimated via treacherous maximum likelihood procedures, as was the case for
the GARCH models above. Using intra-day price observations, we essentially observe the daily
covariances and can model them as if they were observed. ABDL show that, as long as the asset
returns are linearly independent and N < 1/∆, the realized covariance matrix will be positive
definite. However 1/∆ is, for example, 48, and so in large portfolios the condition is likely to be
violated. We return to this important issue at the end of this section.

        Microstructure noise may plague realized covariances, just as it may plague realized
variances. Non-synchronous trading, however, creates additional complications in the
multivariate case. These are similar, but potentially more severe, than the non-synchronous
trading issues that arise in the estimation of say, monthly covariances and CAPM betas with non-
synchronous daily data. A possible fix involves inclusion of additional lead and lag terms in the
realized covariance measure (27), along the lines of the Scholes and Williams (1977) beta
correction technique. Work on this is still in its infancy, and we will not discuss it any further
here, but an important recent contribution is Martens (2004).

        We now consider various strategies for modeling and forecasting realized covariances,
treating them as directly observable vector time series. These all are quite speculative, as little
work has been done to date in terms of actually assessing the economic value of using realized
covariances for practical risk measurement and management problems.13

       Paralleling the tradition of the scalar diagonal GARCH model, directly suggests the
following model



       13
         One notable exception is the work of Fleming, Kirby, Oestdiek (2003), which suggests
dramatic improvements vis-a-vis the RM and multivariate GARCH frameworks for standard
mean-variance efficient asset allocation problems.

                                                 15
                                                           ,                                 (28)

which requires nothing but simple OLS to implement, while guaranteeing positive definiteness
of the corresponding covariance matrix forecasts for any positive definite matrix C and positive
values of $. This does again however impose a common mean-reversion parameter across
variances and covariances, which may be overly restrictive. Realized covariance versions of the
non-scalar diagonal GARCH model could be developed in a similar manner, keeping in mind the
restrictions required for positive definiteness.

        Positive definiteness may also be imposed by modeling the Cholesky decomposition of
the realized covariance matrix rather than the matrix itself, as suggested by ABDL. We have

                        ,                                                                    (29)

where Pt,) is a unique lower triangular matrix. The data vector is then vech(Pt,)), and we
substitute the forecast of vech(Pt+k, ) ) back into (29) to construct a forecast of    .

        Alternatively, in the tradition of Ledoit and Wolf (2003), one may encourage positive
definiteness of high-dimensional realized covariance matrices by shrinking toward the
covariance matrix implied by a single-factor structure, in which the optimal shrinkage parameter
is estimated directly from the data.

       We can also use a DCC-type framework for realized correlation modeling. In parallel to
(21) we write

                             ,                                                               (30)

where the typical element in the diagonal matrix     is the realized standard deviation, and the
typical element in     is constructed from the elements in      as

                                      .                                                      (31)

Following the DCC idea, we model the standard deviations asset-by-asset in the first step, and
the correlations in a second step. Keeping a simple structure as in (23), we have

                                                       ,                                     (32)

where simple OLS again is all that is required for estimation. Once again, a normalization is
needed to ensure that the correlation forecasts fall in the [-1;1] interval. Specifically,

                                          .                                                  (33)

The advantages of this approach are twofold: first, high-frequency information is used to obtain
more precise forecasts of variances and correlations. Second, numerical optimization is not

                                                16
needed at all. Long-memory dynamics or regime-switching could, of course, be incorporated as
well.

        Although there appear to be several avenues for exploiting intra-day price information in
daily risk management, two key problems remain. First, many assets in typical portfolios are not
liquid enough for intraday information to be available and useful. Second, even in highly-liquid
environments, when N is very large the positive definiteness problem remains. We now explore
a potential solution to these problems.

4.3 Dimensionality Reduction III: (Realized) Covariance Matrices via Mapping to Liquid Base Assets

        Multivariate market risk management systems for portfolios of thousands of assets often
work from a set of, say, 30 observed base assets believed to be key drivers of risk. The choice of
these, of course, depend on the portfolio at hand but can, for example, consist of equity market
indices, FX rates, benchmark interest rates, and so on, which are believed to capture the main
sources of uncertainty in the portfolio. The assumptions made on the multivariate distribution of
base assets are naturally of crucial importance for the accuracy of the risk management system.

        Note that base assets typically correspond to the most liquid assets in the market. The
upshot here is that we can credibly rely on realized volatility and covariances in this case. Using
the result from ABDL, a base asset system of dimension NF < 1/∆ will ensure that the realized
covariance matrix is psd and therefore useful for forecasting.

        The mapping from base assets to the full set of assets is discussed in Jorion (2000). In
particular, the factor model is naturally expressed as14

                          ,                                                                 (34)

where <t denotes the idiosyncratic risk. The factor loadings in the N×NF matrix # may be
obtained from regression (if data exists), or via pricing model sensitivities (if a pricing model
exists). Otherwise the loadings may be determined by ad hoc considerations such as matching a
security without a well-defined factor loading to another similar security which has a well-
defined factor loading.

       We now need a multivariate model for the NF base assets. However, assuming that

                                                                     ,                      (35)

5. Modeling Entire Conditional Return Distributions

        Proper portfolio and risk management requires knowing the entire multivariate
distribution of asset or base asset returns, not just the second moments. Conventional risk
measures such as VaR and expected shortfall, however, capture only limited aspects of the
distribution.

        In this section we therefore explore various approaches to complete the model. Notice
that above we deliberately left the distributional assumption on the standardized returns
unspecified. We simply assumed that the standardized returns were i.i.d. We will keep the
assumption of i.i.d. standardized returns below and focus on ways to estimate the constant
conditional density. This is, of course, with some loss of generality as dynamics in moments
beyond second-order could be operative. The empirical evidence for such higher-ordered
conditional moment dynamics is, however, much less conclusive at this stage.

        The evidence that daily standardized returns are not normally distributed is, however,
quite conclusive. Although GARCH and other dynamic volatility models do remove some of the
non-normality in the unconditional returns, conditional returns still exhibit non-normal features.
Interestingly, these features vary systematically from market to market. For example, mature FX
market returns are generally strongly conditionally kurtotic, but approximately symmetric.
Meanwhile, most aggregate index equity returns appear to be both conditionally skewed and fat
tailed.

         As an example of the latter, we show in Figure 6 the daily QQ plot for S&P500 returns
from January 2, 1990 to December 31, 2002, standardized using the (constant) average daily
volatility across the sample. That is, we plot quantiles of standardized returns against quantiles
of the standard normal distribution. Clearly the daily returns are not unconditionally normally
distributed. Consider now Figure 7 in which the daily returns are instead standardized by the
time-varying volatilities from an asymmetric GJR GARCH(1,1) model. The QQ plot in Figure 7
makes clear that although the GARCH innovations conform more closely to the normal
distribution than do the raw returns, the left tail of the S&P500 returns conforms much less well
to the normal distribution than does the right tail: there are more large innovations than one
would expect under normality.

       As the VaR itself is a quantile, the QQ plot also gives an assessment of the accuracy of
the normal-GARCH VaR for different coverage rates. Figure 7 suggests that a normal-GARCH
VaR would work well for any coverage rate for a portfolio which is short the S&P500. It may
also work well for a long portfolio but only if the coverage rate is relatively large, say in excess
of 5%.

       Consider now instead the distribution of returns standardized by realized volatility. In

                                                 18
contrast to the poor fit in the left tail evident in Figure 7, the distribution in Figure 8 is strikingly
close to normal, as first noticed by Zhou (1996) and Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Labys
(2000). Figures 7 and 8 rely on the same series of daily S&P500 returns but simply use two
different volatility measures to standardize the raw returns. The conditional non-normality of
daily returns has been a key stylized fact in market risk management. Finding a volatility
measure which can generate standardized returns that are close to normal is therefore surprising
and noteworthy.

         Figure 8 and the frequently-found lognormality of realized volatility itself suggest that a
good approximation to the distribution of returns may be obtained using a normal / log-normal
mixture model. In this model, the standardized return is normal and the distribution of realized
volatility at time t conditional on time t-1 information is log-normal. This idea is explored
empirically in ABDL, who find that a log-normal / normal mixture VaR model performs very
well in an application to foreign exchange returns.

        The recent empirical results in Andersen, Bollerslev and Diebold (2003) suggest that
even better results may be obtained by separately measuring and modeling the part of the
realized volatility attributable to “jumps” in the price process through so-called realized bipower
variation measures, as formally developed by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2004). These
results have great potential for application in financial risk management, and their practical
implications are topics of current research.

       Although realized volatility measures may be available for highly liquid assets, it is often
not possible to construct realized volatility based portfolio risk measures. We therefore now
survey some of the more conventional methods first for univariate and then for multivariate
models.

5.1 Portfolio Level: Univariate Analytic Methods

        Although the normal assumption works well in certain cases, we want to consider
alternatives that allow for fat tails and asymmetry in the conditional distribution, as depicted in
Figure 7. In the case of VaR we are looking for ways to calculate the cut-off        in

                              .                                                                  (36)

Perhaps the most obvious approach is simply to look for a parametric distribution more flexible
than the normal while still tightly parameterized. One such example is the (standardized)
Student’s t distribution suggested by Bollerslev (1987), which relies on only one additional
parameter in generating symmetric fat tails. Recently, generalizations of the Student’s t which
allow for asymmetry have also been suggested, as in Fernandez and Steel (1998) and Hansen
(1994).
        Rather than assuming a particular parametric density, one can approximate the quantiles
of non-normal distributions via Cornish-Fisher approximations. Baillie and Bollerslev (1992)
first advocated this approach in the context of GARCH modeling and forecasting. The only

                                                   19
inputs needed are the sample estimates of skewness and kurtosis of the standardized returns.
Extreme value theory provides another approximation alternative, in which the tail(s) of the
conditional distribution is estimated using only the extreme observations, as suggested in
Diebold, Schuermann, and Stroughair (1998) and McNeil and Frey (2000).

         A common problem with most GARCH models, regardless of the innovation distribution,
is that the conditional distribution of returns is not preserved under temporal aggregation. Hence
even if the standardized daily returns from a GARCH(1,1) model were normal, the implied
weekly returns will not be. This in turn implies that the term structure of VaR or expected
shortfall needs to be calculated via Monte Carlo simulation, as in, e.g., Guidolin and
Timmermann (2004). But Monte Carlo simulation requires a properly specified probability
distribution which would rule out the Cornish-Fisher and extreme-value-theory approximations.

       Heston and Nandi (2000) suggest a specific affine GARCH-normal model, which may
work well for certain portfolios, and which combined with the methods of Albanese, Jackson and
Wiberg (2004) allows for relatively easy calculation of the term structure of VaRs. In general,
however, simulation methods are needed, and we now discuss a viable approach which combines
a parametric volatility model with a data-driven conditional distribution.

5.2 Portfolio Level: Univariate Simulation Methods

        Bootstrapping, or Filtered Historical Simulation (FHS), assumes a parametric model for
the second moment dynamics but bootstraps from standardized returns to construct the
distribution. At the portfolio level this is easy to do. Calculate the standardized pseudo portfolio
returns as

                                           ,                                                 (37)

using one of the variance models from section 2. For the one-day-ahead VaR, we then simply
use the order statistic for the standardized returns combined with the volatility forecast to
construct,

                                           .                                                 (38)

Multi-day VaR requires simulating paths from the volatility model using the standardized returns
sampled with replacement as innovations. This approach has been suggested by Diebold,
Schuermann and Stroughair (1998), Hull and White (1998) and Barone-Adesi, Bourgoin and
Giannopoulos (1998), who coined the term FHS. Pritsker (2001) also provides evidence on its
effectiveness.

5.3 Asset Level: Multivariate Analytic Methods

       Just as a fully specified univariate distribution is needed for complete risk measurement,


                                                 20
so too is a fully specified multivariate distribution needed for proper portfolio and risk
management. This in turn requires us to make an assumption about the multivariate (but
constant) distribution of Zt in (16).

        The results of Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Labys (2000) suggest that, at least in
the FX market, the multivariate distribution of returns standardized by the realized covariance
matrix is again closely approximated by a normal distribution. So long as the realized volatilities
are available, a multivariate version of the log-normal mixture model discussed in connection
with Figure 8 above could therefore be developed.

        As noted earlier, however, construction and use of realized covariance matrices may be
problematic in situations when liquidity is not high, in which case traditional parametric models
may be used. As in the univariate case, however, the multivariate normal distribution coupled
with multivariate standardization using covariance matrices estimated from traditional
parametric models, although obviously convenient, does not generally provide an accurate
picture of tail risk.15

        A few analytic alternatives to the multivariate normal paradigm do exist, such as the
multivariate Student’s t distribution first considered by Harvey, Ruiz and Sentana (1992), along
with the more recent related work by Glasserman, Heidelberger, and Shahbuddin (2002).
Recently much attention has also been focused on the construction of multivariate densities from
the marginal densities via copulas, as in Jondeau and Rockinger (2004) and Patton (2002),
although the viability of the methods in very high-dimensional systems remains to be
established.

        Multivariate extreme value theory offers a tool for exploring cross-asset tail
dependencies, which are not captured by standard correlation measures. For example, Longin
and Solnik (2001) define and compute extreme correlations between monthly U.S. index returns
and a number of foreign country indexes. In the case of the bivariate normal distribution,
correlations between extremes taper off to zero as the thresholds defining the extremes get larger
in absolute value. The actual equity data, however, behave quite differently. The correlation
between negative extremes is much larger than the normal distribution would suggest.16 Such
strong correlation between negative extremes is clearly a key risk management concern. Poon,
Rockinger and Tawn (2004) explore the portfolio risk management implications of extremal
dependencies, while Hartmann, Straetmans and de Vries (2004) consider their effect on banking
system stability. Once again, however, it is not yet clear whether such methods will be
operational in large-dimensional systems.


       15
          In the multivariate case the normal distribution is even more tempting to use, because it
implies that the aggregate portfolio distribution itself is also normally distributed.
       16
          In contrast, and interestingly, the correlations of positive extremes appear to approach
zero in accordance with the normal distribution.

                                                21
      Issues of scalability, as well as cross-sectional and temporal aggregation problems in
parametric approaches, thus once again lead us to consider simulation based solutions.

5.4 Asset Level: Multivariate Simulation Methods

       In the general multivariate case, we can in principle use FHS with dynamic correlations,
but a multivariate standardization is needed. Using the Cholesky decomposition, we first create
vectors of standardized returns from (16). We write the standardized returns from an estimated
multivariate dynamic covariance matrix as

                                        ,                                                     (39)

where we calculate         from the Cholesky decomposition of the inverse covariance matrix
     . Now, resampling with replacement vector-wise from the standardized returns will ensure
that the marginal distributions as wells as particular features of the multivariate distribution, as
for example, the cross-sectional dependencies suggested by Longin and Solnik (2001), will be
preserved in the simulated data.

       The dimensionality of the system in (39) may render the necessary multivariate
standardization practically infeasible. However, the same FHS approach can be applied with the
base asset setup in (35), resampling from the factor innovations calculated as

                                                                                              (40)

where we again use the Cholesky decomposition to build up the distribution of the factor returns.
From (34) we can then construct the corresponding idiosyncratic asset innovations as,

                                                                                              (41)

in turn resampling from and         to build up the required distribution of the individual asset
returns in the base asset model.

       Alternatively, if one is willing to assume constant conditional correlations, then the
standardization can simply be done on an individual asset-by-asset basis using the univariate
GARCH volatilities. Resampling vector-wise from the standardized returns will preserve the
cross-sectional dependencies in the historical data.

6. Summary and Directions for Future Research

       We have attempted to demonstrate the power and potential of dynamic financial
econometric methods for practical financial risk management, surveying the large literature on
high-frequency volatility measurement and modeling, interpreting and unifying the most
important and intriguing results for practical risk management. The paper complements the
more general and technical (and less financial) survey of volatility and covariance forecasting in

                                                 22
Andersen, Bollerslev, Christoffersen and Diebold (2005).

6.1 Summary

       Our key points are as follows:

C Standard “model-free” methods, such as historical simulation, rely on false assumptions of
       independent returns. Reliable risk measurement requires a conditional density model that
       allows for time-varying volatility.

C For the purpose of risk measurement, specifying a univariate density model directly on the
        portfolio return is likely to be most accurate. RiskMetrics offers one possible approach,
        but the temporal aggregation properties–including the volatility term structure–of
        RiskMetrics appear to be counter-factual.

C GARCH volatility models offer a convenient and parsimonious framework for modeling key
     dynamic features of returns, including volatility mean-reversion, long-memory, and
     asymmetries.

C Although risk measurement can be done from a univariate model for a given set of portfolio
       weights, risk management requires a fully specified multivariate density model.
       Unfortunately, standard multivariate GARCH models are too heavily parameterized to be
       useful in realistic large-scale problems.

C Recent advances in multivariate GARCH modeling are likely to be useful for medium-scale
       models, but very large scale modeling requires decoupling variance and correlation
       dynamics, as in the dynamic conditional correlation model.

C Volatility measures based on high-frequency return data hold great promise for practical risk
       management. Realized volatility and correlation measures give more accurate forecasts of
       future realizations than their conventional competitors. Because high-frequency
       information is only available for highly liquid assets, we suggest a base-asset factor
       approach.

C Risk management requires fully-specified conditional density models, not just conditional
       covariance models. Resampling returns standardized by the conditional covariance
       matrix presents an attractive strategy for accommodating conditionally non-normal
       returns.

C The near log-normality of realized volatility, together with the near-normality of returns
       standardized by realized volatility, holds promise for relatively simple-to-implement log-
       normal / normal mixture models in financial risk management.

       Several important topics have thus far been omitted from this survey. We conclude by

                                                23
outlining two key areas for future research, namely option valuation and the treatment of
microstructure noise.

6.2 Future Research I: Option Valuation

        The seminal Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model has produced indispensable insight
into the valuation of derivative securities. However, many empirical studies have shown that the
assumptions of constant volatility and normal returns cause the BSM model systematically to
misprice options. Hence we have developed increasingly sophisticated models to deal with the
shortcomings of the BSM model. Nevertheless, practitioners often rely on curves fitted to the
implied BSM volatility surface to compute option prices. Thus, there appears to be a disconnect
between the academic and practitioner camps in this area.

        One reason for the disconnect is clearly that the more sophisticated academic models
involve an increasing number of unobserved parameters and volatility factors, rendering them
much harder to implement than the simple BSM model. However, recent advances in the
estimation of more complicate and empirically realistic continuous time option pricing models
(e.g. Chernov and Ghysels, 2000, Eraker, 2004, and Pan, 2002) may help reduce that problem.

       Another way to close the apparent gap is to develop potentially more tractable discrete-
time analogues of the continuous time models. Heston and Nandi (2000) thus define a discrete
time GARCH version of Heston’s (1993) stochastic volatility model, while Christoffersen,
Heston and Jacobs (2004) extend the model to allow for conditionally non-normal returns.

         We have already discussed the need to model the long-memory features of return
volatility dynamics. Getting the volatility dynamics right is clearly key for option valuation. One
way to approximate long memory is via component models. Bates (2000) studies continuous
time volatility component models in derivative pricing contexts, and Christoffersen, Jacobs and
Wang (2004) study discrete time analogues.

6.3 Future Research II: Microstructure Noise

       The potential usefulness of intra-day returns for daily risk management has been a key
theme in our discussion so far. The realized volatility literature is still quite new, and many
important practical considerations are still being explored. The influence of market
microstructure noise on realized volatility is one such consideration.

        The theoretical result giving integrated volatility as the limit of realized volatility when
the sampling frequency goes to infinity is derived under the assumption of no market
microstructure noise. When allowing for market microstructure noise, the simple limit result no
longer holds, and sampling infinitely often – or in practice, “as often as possible” – will bias the
measures. Bandi and Russel (2004a, 2004b) derive optimal finite sampling frequencies for given
specifications of market microstructure noise. But the suggestion to sample “less often than
possible,” thus discarding information, may be inefficient, and Ait-Sahalia, Mykland and Zhang

                                                 24
(2004) suggest adjustments which in principle allow for the use of all available price information
rather than sampling at certain prespecified frequencies.
