                   REFORMING CONFORMING LOAN LIMITS: THE IMPACT
                      ON THRIFI EARNINGS AND TAXPAYER OUTLAYS


                                         ABSTRACT


      In recent yeere, the conforming loan limit hes risen rapidly (62 percent
between 1985 and 1989 versus a 10 percent rise in the price of a conetant—
quelity new house) end has assumed significant importance to homebuyers and
portfolio lenders.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have become the price setters
for conforming FRM5, and the yield being set appears to be 30 besis points
below whet it would otherwise be. The lower yield raises the old issue of
overinvestment in housing, but its most important effect is on thrifts who now
earn 30 basis points less on FF31 investments under the conforming limit end who
have difficulty originating ARMs. Moreover, given other thrift problems,
taxpayers will apparently end up directly funding the interest income lost
owing to low yields on conforming FRMs.

         In this paper we calculate the impact on thrift interest income of two
redefinitions of conforming loans: making all refinancings nonconforming and
lowering the loan limit to the loan ceiling for FMA/VA loans (which was, in
fact, the conforming limit prior to 1975) .                   Each of these redefinitions makes
sense from a public policy perspective.                  Thrifts would have earned nearly $700
million more in 1987 had both redefinitions been in place at the start of 1986.
This would have amounted to a 23 percent increase in the industry net operating
income (income excluding profits of losses from the sale of assets) and a
corresponding increase in return to equity. By the early 1990s, the income
gain from these changes, had they been put in place in early 1986, would likely
be over a billion dollars —— certainly a noticeable saving for taxpayers.

      Any loan under $187,600 ía classified as conforming in 1989, and only

conforming loans can be purchased by the Federal National Mortgage Association

(Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac)       Given a

62 percent rise in the conforming limit since 1985, over 90 percent of all

conventional fixed—rate mortgage originations are eligible for

purchase/securitization by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.      And securitize them the

agencies have.   Since 1986, half of the dollar volume of eligible fixed—rate

loans have been securitized, up from a twentieth prior to 1982 and a sixth in

1983—84 (Hendershott and shilling, 1989)

      Whether a loan is conforming or not haa become significant to homebuyers

and portfolio lenders (as well as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) because coupon

rates on conforming fixed-rate mortgages (FRM5) have declined by about 30 basis

points relative to those on otherwise comparable nonconforming FRMs (see

Section III below) .   These lower rates appear to be the result of Fannie and

Freddie being able to raise capital market money cheaper than traditional

portfolio lenders can and to package mortgages less expensively than private

sector mortgage securitizers can.      In the 1980s, traditional lenders have lost

any cost advantages attributable to tax incentives and deposit rate ceilings;

in fact, they are now paying premium costs owing to the FSLIC crisis.1

      Low home mortgage ratea are good for recipients of such rates but are bad

for other households ——   for   renters and owners not getting the low rates.   A

lower mortgage rate would raise homeownership and the quantity of houaing,

conaumer durablea, and other capital demanded by homeowners (Meltzer, 1974)

The increased demands by the aubsidized homeowners, like the tax subsidy for
                                        —2—




homeownership, raise interest rates generally, partially offsetting the

ownership subsidy and resulting in higher required returns and eventually less

rental housing and industrial plant and equipment.     Rents will be higher, and

labor productivity and thus wages will be lower.

      The subsidized home mortgage rates are also bad for traditional mortgage

portfolio lenders both because interest income is lower and because households

are less likely to choose ARMs that pay lenders a more competitive yield and

provide them with a better asset/liability maturity match.    Given the

precarious state of the thrift industry and the FSLIC insurance fund, what is

bad for traditional portfolio lenders is also bad for U.S. taxpayers

generally.2    That is, here we have a case where at least some of the costs of

an indirect subsidy are showing up explicitly in budgeting deficits.

      The ostensible rationale for below—market mortgage rates is to increase

homeownership opportunities for Americans.     However, while moderate income

households may need a subsidy to achieve ownership, upper middle and high

income households do not.   Moreover, households who own the house they are

living in by definition do not need an additional subsidy to own the house.

One might think, then, that conforming loans would be defined as loans only for

the purchase of houses and only for houses priced below, say, 80 percent of the

price of houses in a given area demanded by households with the national median

real income.

      The actual conforming loan definition does not vary regionally, but it is

indexed to median house prices (Lea, 1987) .    More important from our

perspective, the actual definition is far more inclusive than the optimal one.

In 1987, 85 percent of the FRN dollar volume and over 90 percent of the number

of loans were conforming.    That is, the subsidy is received by the vast
majority of homebuyers.     Moreover, refinancings below the current loan limit

are defined as conforming loans, i.e., the subsidy is provided to households

who are already homeowners.

      The present paper considers two definitional changes that would have

narrowed the subsidy by targeting it more closely to households needing

assistance to achieve homeownership.     We compute estimates of how these

redefinitions would have influenced both the dollar volume of conforming loans

originated by saving and loans in eight broad regions of the United States in

1986 and 1987 and the interest earned by holders of the mortgages originated in

those regions.   We then go on to examine the likely consequences of these

changes for the FSLIC insurance fund and thus U.S. taxpayers.      The two

definitional changes are:     a substitution of the FHA/VA loan ceilings in 1986

and 1987 for the actual 1986 and 1987 conforming limits and a blanket

classification of refinancings as nonconforming.     The first redefinition is

only illustrative of more reasonable loan limits; the ideal setting of the

general level of the limit and regional variations about it is a complicated

issue beyond the scope of this study.     We do note, however, that the conforming

limit equalled the FHA limit prior to 1975.

      The paper is divided into five sections and a conclusion.     Section I

indicates the eight regions analyzed, lists median house prices, percentages of

loan dollar volume over the conforming limit, and total dollar volume of FRMs

originated in the eight regions, and provides estimates of how the alternative

conforming loan definitions, alone and in combination, would have affected

conforming loan dollar volume in the eight regions.     Evidence on the agencies

impact on conforming FRM rates is summarized in Section II, and the effect of
lower FAN rates on the interest income of FSLIC-insured thrifts in the eight

regions is reported in Section III.    Possible biases in our calculations are

discussed in Section IV, and our conclusions are stated in Section V.


II. Alternative Conforming Loan Definitions and Regional Conforming Loan Volumes

      We have divided the United States into eight contiguous regions based

upon the 1987 state proportions of FSLIC—insured—thrift fixed-rate conventional

loan volume that were below the conforming limit (see Figure 1)   .     These

proportions, which are based on loans financing home purchases (not

refinancings), are from the FNLBB monthly loans-closed aurvey.        The high house

price (low conforming loan volume( areas are the coastal regions ——

California—Nevada, the Mid—Atlantic, and the Northeast, where 1987 median house
prices financed by conventional savings—and-loan originated FANs ranged from

$133,000 to $155,000 (see Table 1).    Of the other regions, only the Northwest

plus Mountains had a median price above $90,000 ($102,000(

      The median price of houses financed by FSLIC—insured—thrift FAN

originations increased rapidly between 1985 and 1987 (see Table A)      in the

Northwest (31.6 percent) ,   Northeast (34.0) and MidAtlantic (39.4) and
moderately elsewhere (15.5 to 22.0 percent) .    However, the national median loan

size for FANs originated by FSLIC-insured thrifts fell slightly because

borrowers in high—priced regions shifted to financing with ARMs.        The national

median price of houses financed by both FAN and ARM conventional originations

of all lenders increased by 31.1 percent.

      Because the conforming limit rose by a third between 1985 and 1987 when

the average FAN loan size was constant, the proportion of FAN dollar volume

that was conforming increased from 79 to 85 percent nationwide.       Regionally,

the increase was greatest in California—Nevada (16 percentage points) and was

also large (8 percentage points) in the Northwest and Mountains and the Western
                                                   —5—




Upper Midwest.       By 1987, over 70 percent of loan dollar volume in the highest

priced California-Nevada area was conforming, and in the noncoastal regions

over 90 percent of this volume was conforming (98 percent in the Western Upper

Midwest) .    Table 1 also indicates the percentage of loan volume that was less

than 67 percent of the conforming limit.                 For the country as a whole, this

percentage increased from 50 to 59 between 1985 and 1987.

       The last column in Table 1 lists the 1987 average regional FHA limits.

As can be seen, the difference between the highest and lowest limits is $20,000

or only 25 percent of the nationwide mean.                 This contrasts with a $95,300

difference between the average 1987 house prices financed by conventional FRM

loans in the highest and lowest cost regions, which is 89 percent of the

nationwide mean.3        This greater proportionate difference could reflect a larger

variation in regional average real incomes (the coastal areas having the

highest) , as well as variation in costs of constant quality houses.

        Table 2 contains our estimates of conventional FRNs originated by FSLIC-

insured thrifts in 1986 and 1987.             We begin with all conventional loans

originated to finance home purchases (from the Thrift Quarterly Financial

Reports) and scale this down (multiply it) by the fraction of these loans that

was fixed rate (from the monthly survey discussed above) .                To this we add

refinancings (all presumed to be FRM5) to obtain total FSLIC—insured thrift FRM

originations.4       By these estimates, the volume was $200 billion in 1986 and

$150 billion in 1987.         The higher number in 1986 was largely the result of 70

percent of originations carrying fixed rates in that year versus only 44

percent in 1987.        The shift away from fixed rate financing was especially great

(the FRM share dropped by over 25 percentage points) in California—Nevada, the

Northeast, the Southeast, and the Northwest and Mountains.
                                        —6—




      Table 3 gives the impact on conforming loan volume of lowering the limit

to the PHA limits.    The reduction would have shrunk the conforming loans market

by 49 percent in 1986 and 58 percent in 1987.     As a result, the conforming

percentage of dollar loan volume in 1987 would have been 35 rather than the

observed 85.   On a regional basis, the decline would have exceeded two—thirds

in California-Nevada, the Northeast, and the Mid—Atlantic, but would have been

less than two—fifths in the two Upper Midwest regions.

      Table 4 lists the impact of redefining all refinancings as nonconforming.

In 1986 and 1987, total conforming volume would have been 40 to 45 percent less

than that recorded.     Regionally, the largest percentage decline would have

occurred in California—Nevada because that's where refinancings were the

heaviest relative to home—purchase loan volume.     With this change, the

conforming share of the FRM market would have declined from 80 to 50 in 1986

and 85 to 45 in 1987.

      Table S shows the combined impact of the two redefinitions.       As can be

seen, the conforming loan market would have been only one—third (1986) or one—

quarter (1987) its observed size.     All regional declines exceed one—half in

both 1986 and 1987, and the percentage decline in California—Nevada would have

exceeded 85 in 1986 and 1987.     With these redefinitions, the nonconforming loan

volume would have tripled in 1986 (from 22.2 percent to 73.2 percent) and more

than quintupled in 1987 (from 15.3 percent to 78.9 percent).


               II.   The Expanded Role of the Agencies and FRM Yields

      Coupon rates on conforming fixed—rate mortgages have declined in recent

years relative to those on otherwise comparable nonconforming FRMs.       To

illustrate this, we have computed the average effective rates on loans of

increasing size (percent of the conforming loan limit) with similar loan—to—

value ratios (75 to 80 percent) originated in California in the May—June period
                                                   —7—




of 1978, 1985, 1986 and 1987.            california was chosen because it accounts for

roughly a quarter of the dollar value of all conventional FRMs closed in the

U.S. and over half of all jumbo loans (those over the conforming limit).                    The

data are listed in Table 6 with loan size varying from under 50 percent of the

conforming limit up to over 145 percent.                 The number of loans in the samples

and the percent of the eligible dollar volume securitized by Fannie and Freddie

are reported at the bottom (see Hendershott and shilling, 1989, for more detail

on the loan samples and the volume securitized)

          In general, we would expect the loan rate to decline with loan size

because the costs of originating and servicing loans per dollar of loan

decrease as the loan size increases.               This is clearly the case for loans below

the conforming limit in all years except 1985, where the limited number of

observations results in much noise in the averages.                    Of most interest, though,

is what happens to the loan rate when the loan size increases above the

conforming limit.         Prior to 1986, the loan rate is either flat (1978) or still

decreasing (1985) .        But in 1986 and 1987, the loan rate jumps at, or just above

in 1987, the loan limit.           That is, rates on loans below the loan limit are

noticeably less than those above the limit.                  The most likely cause of this is

the expanded activities of Fannie and Freddie; between 1981 and 1986 the

percentage of the dollar volume of loans eligible for agency securitization

that was securitized rose from 4 to over 50, and the agencies became the market

price setters.        These activities also likely influence rates on loans just above

the limits because such loans will be conforming within a year (Woodward,

1988) .     Thus the low value for loans 100 to 115 percent of the limit in 1987

may   not   be as anamolous as it first appears.

          In our earlier paper, we estimated, separately for 1978 and 1986, the

relationship between rates on loans closed and the loan—to—value ratio, loan

size, the precise month the loan was closed, and dummies for geographic regions
                                        —8—




in the state and whether the loan was on a new property, was under the

conforming limit, or was just above the limit.     The loan—to—value ratio had the

expected positive effect, the loan size and the new property dummy the expected

negative effects, and the responses of the loan rate to these variables were

remarkably similar in the two years.    The loan—limit effects were not similar

in the two years.    In 1986, conforming loans had a 30 basis point lower rate

than well-above—the—limit loans had and soon—to—be conforming loans had a 15

basis point lower rate (standard error of only S basis points) -    In   1978,

however, the point estimate for the conforming loan coefficient was only 3

basis points.


III.    Alternative Conforming Loan Definitions and Thrift Interest Income

        Owing to the 30 and 15 basis point, respectively, lower yields on

conforming and soon—to—be conforming loans, increases in nonconforming loans at

the expense of both conforming and soon—to—be conforming loans would raise the

interest income of traditional mortgage portfolio investors.    To illustrate, if

the loan limit had been constant in 1986, rather than increasing 15 percent

from $115,000 to $133,000, investors' interest income would have altered in two

ways.    First, an extra 30 basis points would have been received on 1986 loans

between $115,000 and $133,000.   Second, an extra 15 basis points would have

been earned on loans between $133,000 and $153,000 because originators would

have expected these loans to become conforming within the next year under the

previous method of indexation and competition would have forced yields down in

anticipation of the future lower required yield.

        The changes in conforming loan volume shown in Tables 3—5 are translated

into changes in FSLIC-insured thrift interest income in Tables 7—9.       Each of

the tables contains, for 1986 and 1987 separately, the change in conforming—
                                                 —9—




loan volume, in just—above—the—conforming—limit volume, and in interest income

as a result of replacing conforming loan volume with nonconforming volume.                   The

change in interest income is computed as


AINC = . OO3OAConforming Volume + .OOlSAJust-Above—Limit Volume.


The data for 1987 are cunimulative.            That is, the change in interest income is

based upon greater interest income earned on FRMs originated in both 1986 and

1987.    These calculations assume that the originators would have retained the

additional nonconforming loans (or sold them to other thrifts in the same

region) .    The calculations also assume no expected increase in FHA limits in

either 1986 or 1987.

        A general shift to the FHA/VA limits (Table 7) would have saved FSLIC—

insured thrifts $250 million in 1986, $480 million in 1987 and probably over

$600 million in 1988.6         Of the saving, 37 percent would have accrued to

California—Nevada thrifts, which accounted for 32 percent of total financing.

The smallest saving goes to the Upper Midwest, which originated the fewest

mortgages.     Less than 5 percent of the saving in Tables 7—9 is attributable to

loans just above the old limit.

        Redefining all refinancing as nonconforming (Table 8) would have

increased FSLIC-insured thrift interest income by $200 million in 1986 and $380

million in 1987.       About a third would have been received by thrifts in

California—Nevada; about a tenth each would have accrued to thrifts in the

Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast, the Eastern Upper Midwest and the Lower Midwest.

        The overall impact of both changes (Table 9) would have raised interest

income by $350 million in 1986 and $630 million in l987.                     Again, about a third

of the increase would have gone to California, and a tenth to a seventh to the

MidAtlantic, Southeast, Eastern Upper Midwest and Lower Midwest.                    An aggregate

estimate for 1988 would be an $800 million gain.
                          IV.     Possible Bias in the Estimates

        The data in Tables 7—9 ars subject to a number of possible biases.          The

thrift income gains from redefining refinancings as nonconforming are certainly

understated.     The volume of loans affected is too high because we assumed all

refinancings were FRMs, while some (probably less than 5 percent -- see

footnote 4) were ARMs.      Further, if loan rates on refinancings had been 30

basis points higher in 1986 and 1987, fewer loans would have been refinanced

and thrifts would have saved 150 to 250 basis points per dollar loan not

refinanced.      Also, valuable servicing contracts would not have been terminated.

These savings would swamp the overstatement of savings from classifying some

ARM refinancings as FRMs.

        We have ignored any impact of lower FRM yields on the ARM market, and

this results in an underestimate of the impact of a lower conforming limit on

thrift interest income.         The agency reduction in FRM yields likely lowered

yields on conforming ARMs also.         Thus reducing the loan limit to the Fl-IA limit

——   raising   the yields on FRMs between these limits —— would be expected to

raise yields on ARMs between these limits.

        Another questionable assumption in the calculation is that thrifts would

have either held the new nonconforming FRMs they originated or sold them to

other thrifts in the same region.         Of course, if the loans had a 30 basis point

higher return, thrifts would have been more likely to hold them.           To the extent

these loans would. have been sold to thrifts in other regions, the distribution

of interest income gains among regions would be altered.           To the extent that

these loans would have been sold to nonthrift investors ——         or that fewer new
(as opposed to refinancing) loans would have been closed, the total interest

income gain is overstated.
                                        —11—




      The largest bias probably is due to the assumed 30/15 basis point gain.

Our 1987 data reveal that the broadest redefinition of nonconforming loans

would have increased the nonconforming share of the FRM market from 15 to 79

percent.    With a quintupling of this market, private securitizers would expand

and gain economies of scale.    In time (probably only a year or two) , the gain

from the redefinitions per dollar of redefined nonconforming loans would likely

be reduced to, say, 20/10 basis points.     That is, in the longer run only two—

thirds of the interest gain might be realized.

       On the other hand, the dollar volume of loans benefiting from the higher

interest rate would continue to grow over time as old loans are repaid and new

ones taken out.    Even holding the total volume of FRN   loans   constant, the

increases in interest income from the narrower redefinition of conforming loans

would probably triple the 1987 estimates.      Thus even if the interest savings

per dollar of redefined nonconforming loans are only two—thirds of those

indicated for 1987 in Tables 7—9, the long—run impacts are probably double

those indicated.    That is, in three to five years, thrift interest income would

be over a billion dollars greater, on the current asset base, if these

definitional changes had existed prior to 1986.

       Table 10 indicates the impact of lower conforming loan limits in 1986 and

1987 on thrift net operating income (income excluding profit or loss on sale of

assets) .   The first column contains actual net operating income (NOl) , and the

next three columns show the percentage increase under the different

redefinitions of conforming loans.    For the total industry, NOl would have been

14 percent higher if refinancings had been nonconforming in 1986 and 1987, 17

percent higher if the FHA/VA limits had applied to conforming loans, and 23

percent if both redefinitions had been in place.      These totals overstate the

typical regional impacts, though, because NOl was so negative in the Lower

Midwest region.    In fact, excluding the oil patch from the calculation lowers
                                             -12—




the percentage increase to just under 10 percent.            The typical regional

percentage increase in NOl would have been 10 or 11 percent, although the

increases for the Northeast and Eastern Upper Midwest are slightly smaller and

that for the Northwest plus Mountains is far larger.            The latter number is

attributable to a — $222 million NOl in Alaska, which sharply reduces the

denominator in the calculation.


                                       V.   Conclusion

       Prior to 1986, the conforming loan limit was not of major importance to

homebuyers.    While rates on loans below the limit were subject to the

discipline of the secondary market, these rates were not systematically lower

than rates on larger loans.        Moreover, thrifts probably preferred a higher loan

limit, especially in the early 1980s, because they could then sell a greater

portion of their existing FRM portfolios or at least swap them and use the

agency securities as collateral for borrowing.           Also, the agencies provided a

ready market for FRM sales by thrifts who wished to originate FRMs for sale

rather than for portfolio.

       In recent years, though, the loan limit has risen rapidly (62 percent

between 1985 and 1989 versus a 10 percent increase in the price of a constant—

quality new house) and has assumed far greater importance.              The agencies have

become the price setter for conforming FRMs, and this yield appears to be set

30 basis points below what it would otherwise be.            The lower yield raises the

old issue of overinvestment in housing, but its most important effect is on

thrifts who now earn 30 basis points less on FRM investments under the

conforming limit and who have difficulty originating ARMs.              Moreover, given

other thrift problems (nonearning assets and a generally high—cost fund raising
                                         —13—




network) ,   taxpayers are ending up directly funding the interest income lost
owing to low yields on conforming FRMs.     That is, the extraordinary increase in

the loan limit is having significant budgetary consequences.

       In this paper we consider two redefinitions of conforming loans:         making

all refinancings nonconforming and lowering the loan limit to the loan ceiling

for FHA/VA loans (which was, in fact, the conforming limit prior to 1975)

Each of these redefinitions makes sense from a public policy perspective.

Subsidized loan rates can be rationalized as a means of assisting those who

need assistance to achieve homeownership.       The current loan limits are

inappropriate because they make subsidized loans available to well over ninety

percent of households and they provide a subsidy to refinancers who remain in

their already owner—occupied dwellings.     Of course, an increase in home

mortgage rates would have a temporary negative impact on the homebuilding,

mortgage originating, and home selling industries and thus would likely be

opposed by the homebuilders, the mortgage bankers and the realtors.

       The estimated impacts of these conforming—loan redefinitions on thrift

interest income are large because an enormous volume of loans was originated in

1986 and 1987 when home sales were strong and refinancings were commonplace.

Thrifts would have earned $680 million more in 1987 had both redefinitions been

in place at the start of 1986.      This would have amounted to a 23 percent

increase in the industry net operating income (income excluding profits of

losses from the sale of assets) and a corresponding increase in return to

equity.      By the early l990s, the income gain from these changes, had they been

put in place in early 1986, would likely be over a billion dollars.       The

greatest effect of these redefinitions would be on healthy savings and loans

because many of the weakest institutions —— those in the oil patch most

prominently —— have largely gotten out of traditional residential lending and

moved into riskier activities.

    only median prices are shown in Table 1.      The average price varied regionally

from a low of $73,000 in the Western Upper Midwest to a high of $168,300 in

California/Nevada.    The nationwide median was $107,000.

    Less than 10 percent of the outstanding stock of home mortgages had

adjustable rates in 1986, and the refinancing incentive of a decline in

interest rates is much stronger for fixed than adjustable rate loans.         Thus

over 95 percent of refinancings were likely fixed rate.

    The statutory FEffi limits were unchanged between 1980 and 1987, although the

effective limit increased moderately because some areas shifted from lower to

higher regional limits (minimum of $67,500; maximum of $90,000)
6
    This presumes that all loans originated in a year were originated on the

first day of the year.    A more accurate, but also more awkward, statement would

be that 250 million represents the interest saved in years after 1986, ignoring

repayments, owing to the saving on loans originated in 1986.

    The $630 million is a gain from lower loan limits.      The gain from a zero loan

limit, or the cost to the thrifts of the agencies lowering the FRM rate by 30

basis points, is $900 million (all conforming loan volume in 1986 and 1987

times 30 basis points plus the $13½    billion    just-above the limit times 15 basis

points)
