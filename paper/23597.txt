                                        ABSTRACT

A major provision of the Affordable Care Act was the creation of Health Insurance Marketplaces,
which began operating for the 2014 plan year. Although enrollment initially grew in these
markets, enrollment has fallen recently amid insurer exits and rising premiums. To better
understand these markets, we estimate premium elasticity of demand for Marketplace plans,
using within-plan premium changes from 2014 to 2015, accounting for state-specific trends and
simultaneous changes in generosity. Our preferred estimate implies that a one percent premium
increase reduces plan-specific enrollment by 1.7 percent. We argue that this high elasticity
reflects the rapid growth and high churn in this market, as well as the high degree of
standardization and the availability of many close substitutes.

          A major provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was the creation of Health

Insurance Marketplaces, online portals for individual, private health insurance that began

operating for the 2014 plan year. The Marketplaces differ from other insurance markets because

they display through a single portal all products from all insurers offering Qualified Health

Plans, with standardized information on premiums and benefits. Marketplace enrollment totaled

eight million customers in 2014, and rose to 11.7 million in 2015 and 12.7 million in 2016. In

2017, enrollment fell to 12.2 million as premiums rose dramatically, and several insurers exited,

leaving many markets with limited competition.11 These changes have been central political and

policy issues in the United States.

          We estimate the premium elasticity of demand for Marketplace plans using newly

available data on enrollment and premiums. This elasticity is important for understanding recent

changes in the Marketplaces, and for improving our understanding of consumer price sensitivity

in the individual coverage market. High elasticities imply low optimal premiums, but they may

make it difficult for firms to recover their fixed costs, and could thus lead to firm exit. Using a

within-plan identification strategy to account for unobserved plan quality, we estimate that a 1

percent increase in the premium net of any tax credits lowers demand by 1.7%, higher than

previously estimated demand elasticities for health insurance. We argue that this high elasticity

reflects rapid growth and high churn in this market, as well as the high degree of standardization

and the availability of many close substitutes.

          Most prior ACA research has shown only indirect evidence on premium sensitivity. For

example, consumers choose low premium plans (Gabel et al., 2017); informational nudges about

potential savings from switching plans make consumers more likely to make an active choice

                                                                                                           2
(Ericson, Kingsdale, Layton, & Sacarny, 2017); and consumers are more likely to switch from a

plan when its premium increases (HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and

Evaluation Office of Health Policy, 2017). DeLeire and Marks (2015) estimate a premium

elasticity of demand for Marketplace plans, but do not account for unobserved plan quality.

Tebaldi (2016) also estimates demand for Marketplace plans in California, finding much higher

elasticities for young people than for old. Our results complement this work, as we use an

alternative identification strategy, and estimate demand for all states using healthcare.gov.



   I.      Background on the Health Insurance Marketplaces
        Under the ACA, insurers must charge the same premium to all customers, regardless of

health status. However, premiums vary by age, by tobacco use status, and by geographic rating

areas (GRAs, typically clusters of counties). Insurers may offer plans in all counties in a state, or

only in a subset. The ACA standardizes plans by requiring that they must cover a consistent set

of benefits, with limits on annual out-of-pocket maxima, and no limit on lifetime benefits. The

Marketplace further standardizes the display of benefit information: plans are categorized into

four metal tiers of increasing generosity based on actuarial value: bronze, silver, gold, and

platinum. A ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù plan is also available to younger persons. The Marketplace interface

highlights metal level, plan deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and premiums.

        The ACA created two types of subsidies for health care: the premium tax credit (PTC)

and cost-sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies. The PTC is a subsidy to make insurance affordable,

an important consideration because the ACA also included a mandate to buy insurance, with a

tax penalty for non-compliance. The amount of the credit depends on household income and on

the premium of the benchmark silver plan in that household‚Äôs county; it does not depend on

which plan the consumer eventually chooses. Thus, PTCs do not affect plan choice because they

                                                                                                    3
do not affect plans‚Äô relative premiums; the PTC only affects whether consumers purchase any

coverage at all. The CSR subsidy reduces copayments and deductibles for households below 250

percent of the Federal Poverty Level, but only for those choosing silver plans. The Marketplace

displays customer-specific premiums and cost-sharing information that reflect these subsidies.



    II.      Data
          We use recently released data on plan enrollment in 2014 and 2015 from the Center for

Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), a division of the Centers for Medicare

and Medicaid Services (CMS). CCIIO reports total enrollment at the plan-state-year level for

each plan offered on Healthcare.gov, the federally-facilitated Marketplace used by 34 states in

2014-2015 (latest years available). We obtained information on premiums, plan generosity, and

metal level from the Qualified Health Plan Landscape file for 2014 and 2015. Because plan

enrollment is available only at the state-year level but premiums vary at the GRA level, we

calculate state-level average premiums for each plan, weighting by the Marketplace-eligible

population of counties in which the plan was offered.2 This approach ignores some premium

variation that occurs across GRAs within the plan-state-year. However, there is little such

variation: 90% of the variation in 2014-2015 premium changes is explained by plan fixed effects.

Table 1 presents summary statistics for the full sample of Marketplace plans and for our analysis

sample, which is limited to plans that have positive enrollment in both 2014 and 2015.

 We estimate Marketplace eligible population with the IPUMS USA database (Ruggles, Genadek, Goeken, Grover,
& Sobek, 2015) using a method developed by Drake et al. (2016).

                                                                                                          4
    III.      Econometric model
    We adopt a discrete choice logit demand framework. We let ùëñ index enrollees, ùëó plans, and ùë°

markets, which we think of as a state-year. We let ùêΩùë° be the set of plans available in market ùë°.

Plan ùëó = 0 indicates the outside option of no coverage or off-exchange coverage.

    The conditional indirect utility to enrollee ùëñ from plan ùëó in market ùë° is

                                ùë¢ùëñùëóùë° = ‚àíùõº(ùëùùëóùë° ‚àí ùëÉùëáùê∂ùëñùë° ) + ùëãùëóùë° ùõΩ + ùúâùëóùë° + ùúñùëñùëóùë° ,

where ùõº is premium sensitivity, ùëùùëóùë° is the gross premium of plan ùëó and ùëÉùëáùê∂ùëñùë° is the tax credit

available to person ùëñ in market ùë° (which does not vary across plans).3 Observed product

characteristics ùëãùëóùë° include dummy variables for deductible levels, state-metal level fixed effects,

and, in some specifications insurer-year-metal level fixed effects. The term ùúâùëóùë° represents

unobserved quality. It includes provider network characteristics and unmeasured aspects of cost-

sharing, including eligibility for CSR subsidies if ùëó is a silver plan.

           The conditional indirect utility from non-insurance purchase is

                                             ùë¢ùëñ0ùë° = ùë¢ùëñ0 ‚àí ùõºùúèùëñùë° + ùúñùëñ0ùë°

where ùë¢ùëñ0 is a person-specific value of having any insurance coverage, and ùúèùëñùë° is the mandate

penalty associated with non-purchase of insurance. This specification allows for arbitrary

heterogeneity in the value of having coverage (-ùë¢ùëñ0 ).

           We renormalize utility by subtracting ùõºùëÉùëáùê∂ùëñùë° from all options. ùë¢ùëñ0ùë° and ùë¢ùëñùëóùë° become

                                      ùë¢ùëñ0ùë° = ùë¢ùëñ0 ‚àí ùõº(ùúèùëñùë° + ùëÉùëáùê∂ùëñùë° ) + ùúñùëñ0ùë°

                               ùë¢ùëñùëóùë° = ‚àíùõºùëùùëóùë° + ùëãùëóùë° ùõΩ + ùúâùëóùë° + ùúñùëñùëóùë° = ùë¢ùëóùë° + ùúñùëñùëóùë°




3
  We set the base price ùëùùëóùë° equal to the age 30 price. Prices vary by age, but by a constant factor across plans (so the
ratio of prices between plans is the same, regardless of age). Rescaling prices for the age curve would not affect our
elasticity estimate, which is already scaled by price. For more details on these tax credits, see CBPP (2017).

                                                                                                                       5
Mean utility from choosing plan ùëó (ùëó ‚â† 0), ùë¢ùëóùë° , no longer depends on ùëñ. These equations also

make clear that the PTC affects insurance demand by reducing the relative utility of non-

coverage, rather than shifting the value of one plan relative to another.

         We assume that ùúÄùëñùëóùë° is distributed type-1 extreme value. The probability of purchasing

plan ùëó is

                                                             exp(ùë¢ùëóùë° )
                                       Pr(ùëó|ùëñùë°) =                              .
                                                      1 + ‚àëùëó‚Ä≤‚ààùêΩùë° exp(ùë¢ùëó‚Ä≤ ùë° )

This probability is not ùëñ specific, so we can aggregate over enrollees ùëñ to obtain observed market

               1
shares ùë†ùëóùë° = ùëõ ‚àëùëñ Pr(ùëó|ùëñùë°), where ùë†ùëóùë° is enrollment in plan ùëó as a share of all eligible in market ùë°.

Simplifying, we have

                                       ùë†ùëóùë°
                                  log ( ) = ùë¢ùëóùë° = ‚àíùõºùëùùëóùë° + ùëãùëóùë° ùõΩ + ùúâùëóùë° .                                            (1)
                                       ùë†0ùë°

         Our goal is to estimate premium sensitivity ùõº and calculate own premium elasticities. We

calculate the premium elasticity two ways: with respect to the gross price, and with respect to the

price net of the PTC. The gross price elasticity for plan ùëó in year ùë° is simply ùúÇùëóùë° =

‚àíùõºùëùùëóùë° (1 ‚àí ùë†ùëóùë° ). This elasticity is relevant for insurers as it determines how their revenue

changes when their price changes. The net price elasticity, however, elasticity reflects consumer

behavior, and is most comparable to past estimates. The net price elasticity, ùúÇÃÉ, can be found as

ùúÇÃÉùëóùë° = ùúÇùëóùë° ùëüùëóùë° , where ùëüùëóùë° is the ratio of the net price to the gross price for plan j in year t.4


4
  To calculate this elasticity, we need an estimate of ùëüùëóùë° , which requires knowing PTC amounts. For each state, CMS
reports average monthly PTC amounts in their Effectuated Enrollment Snapshot. See
https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Marketplace-
Products/Effectuated_Quarterly_Snapshots.html. We calculate the net price for plan ùëó in year ùë° in a given state as its
gross price, minus the average PTC amount in the relevant state and year. For this calculation, we use the gross price
at the average age of Marketplace enrollees in the given state and year, calculated from CCIIO enrollment data.
Although this approach creates measurement error in the net price, we emphasize we do not use the net price for
estimation, only for transforming our price sensitivity estimate into an elasticity. Thus, our use of this approximation
does not introduce attenuation bias into our regression estimates.

                                                                                                                      6
         We do not estimate equation (1) directly because it is likely that premiums and quality ùúâùëóùë°

are highly correlated. To address this correlation, we assume a fixed effects structure: ùúâùëóùë° = ùúâùëó +

ùúâÃÉùëóùë° . We expect that ùëùùëóùë° is highly correlated with permanent aspects of quality ùúâùëó , but not

necessarily correlated with the innovation in quality ùúâÃÉùëóùë° . This is because many aspects of

quality‚Äînetwork, cost sharing, and insurer brand‚Äîvary little over time. To deal with the fixed

effect, we estimate a differenced version of equation (1):
                                    ùë†ùëóùë°
                              Œî log ùë† = ‚àíùõºŒîùëùùëóùë° + Œîùëãùëóùë° ùõΩ + Œîùúâùëóùë° (2)
                                     0ùë°


We estimate this equation via ordinary least squares, with increasingly stringent controls

included in Œîùëãùëóùë° . We always include state fixed effects; in some specifications, we include fixed

effects for state-by-metal level, insurer, or insurer-by-metal level, as well as controls for changes

in quality. Our identification assumption is that within-plan premium changes from 2014 to 2015

are uncorrelated with plan-specific changes in quality, Œîùúâùëñùë° . Other changes common to all plans

within a state, such as changing Medicaid coverage or healthcare.gov functionality, are captured

by the state fixed effect. The most likely threat to our identification assumption is changes in

generosity, which we address by controlling for changes in deductible level (measured as in

Ericson (2014)), a proxy for more general generosity measures. Our identification strategy is

similar to Curto et al. (2015), who use plan fixed effects to control for premium-quality

correlation.



   IV.         Results
         Table 2 reports our estimates of premium sensitivity, as well as the elasticity of demand,

based on Equation (2). We begin in column (1) with state fixed effects, and add richer fixed

effects and controls in subsequent columns. Our preferred estimate, in column (3), controls for

                                                                                                      7
state-metal level fixed effects and changes in plan deductible. The elasticity with respect to the

gross premium is 4.59 (P<0.001). As the subsidies cover, on average, about 60% of the premium,

the elasticity with respect to the net premium is about 60% smaller, 1.70. In the remaining

columns, we control for insurer-state and insurer-state-metal level fixed effects, which adjust for

insurer-specific changes in networks and advertising. These extra controls do not reduce

premium sensitivity, but they reduce precision. Thus, our preferred specification includes state-

metal level fixed effects and deductible controls.

        Although our elasticity estimate relies on a parametric model of demand and a within-

plan identification strategy, several factors suggest that the estimate is not driven by these

assumptions. First, Figure 1 shows the basic variation underlying our results. It is clear that

premium changes and enrollment changes are highly negatively correlated; this finding is

independent of any functional form for demand. Furthermore, in Table 3 we show that our

results are robust to non-logit specifications, in which we simply regress changes in log

enrollment or changes in log market shares on changes in log premiums and controls.

It is also unlikely that our identification approach‚Äîfrom within-plan premium changes‚Äîdrives

our high premium elasticity estimates. Plausible failures of our identification assumption imply

that our premium elasticity is too small, not too large. For example, it is possible that unobserved

aspects of generosity change with premiums. However, this would result in a bias towards zero,

as we expect a positive correlation between generosity changes and premium changes.



   V.      Discussion
        Our estimated elasticity of demand with respect to the premium net of subsidies, 1.70, is

particularly large relative to estimated net price elasticities for employer-sponsored plans, which

range from 0.2 to 0.8. (Abraham, Vogt, & Gaynor, 2006; Bundorf, Levin, & Mahoney, 2012;

                                                                                                      8
Curto, Einav, Levin, & Bhattacharya, 2015; Cutler & Reber, 1998; Einav, Finkelstein, & Cullen,

2010; Royalty & Solomon, 1999); it is also larger than the elasticity of 1.15 that Curto et al. have

estimated for Medicare Advantage plans (Curto et al. 2015). Two unusual features of the

Marketplaces likely generate this high elasticity. First, Marketplaces have an unusually large

number of active choosers, both because of rapid market growth from 2014 to 2015, and because

of high ‚Äúchurn‚Äù from people entering and exiting the Marketplaces, due to job transitions, new

discovery of the market, or changing Medicaid eligibility. Active choice is important because

past literature has documented substantial inertia in insurance plan choice, leading to low

premium elasticities (Ericson, 2014; Handel, 2013). Indeed, when Royalty & Solomon (1999)

estimate elasticities among switchers‚Äîwho make active choices, in a context with standardized

plans‚Äîthey find high elasticities, comparable to ours.

         Second, Marketplaces contain standardized plans, including many close substitutes. For

example, the median county in 2015 had 41 Marketplace plans, including 15 silver plans.5

Premium elasticities are likely to be larger when many close substitutes are available. The design

of the Marketplaces themselves, with their standardized presentation of premiums and benefits,

may also raise elasticities (Schmitz & Ziebarth, 2017).6 The Medicare Part D market also

involves standardized presentations, and past research has found large elasticities (between 5 and

6, larger even than those found here) for these plans which are also sold through a centralized

portal (Decarolis, Polyakova, & Ryan, 2015; Lucarelli, Prince, & Simon, 2012).

         These results are relevant also for understanding Marketplace performance under possible

ACA replacement plans. Both the American Health Care Act the Better Care Reconciliation Act

  Note, however, that Ericson and Starc (2016) find that standardizations of benefits (but not display information) on
the Massachusetts Health Insurance Exchange did not increase price sensitivity.

(the House and Senate replacement plans) preserve the Marketplaces as centralized markets for

purchasing insurance. The high elasticity we document suggests that, on the one hand,

competition can be an effective tool for reducing premiums but, on the other hand, insurers may

find it difficult to turn a profit, and limited entry may be a concern in the absence of subsidies.

        These results raise several questions for future research. First, it would be valuable to

know which of the many unusual features of the Marketplaces‚Äîgrowth, churn, product

standardization, and display standardization‚Äîdrive high premium elasticities. Second, how

desirable is standardization, particularly if it leads to high sensitivity to the transparent features

of the plan? The current display highlights premiums and cost-sharing information. When

information on some dimensions are made easier to find, consumers may feel less incentive to

find information on other features, for example because there is a fixed cost of acquiring any

amount of product information. Although display standardization of premiums may reduce the

likelihood that customers choose overly expensive or even dominated plans (as in Bhargava et al.

(2015)), it also may encourage consumers to focus too much on premiums and cost sharing, and

ignore other relevant but non-salient product characteristics like network composition or

prescription drug formularies.
