       We use data from Guatemala and Honduras to investigate some implications of the
Purchasing Power Parity theory over the long run. In particular, we address two questions. First,
to what extent did the fixed exchange rate regime impose macroeconomic discipline on these
countries. Second, what was the impact of terms of trade shocks and growth differentials on
inflation rate differentials between those countries and the United States. We found that the fixed
parities regime worked properly until the mid-1970s, providing some constraint on central bank
behavior. However, the evidence suggests that the fixed exchange rate system was not sufficient
to avoid inflation outbursts and balance of payments crises. Specifically, it was unable to
accommodate large negative terms of trade shocks in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

 I. Introduction

        Gustav Cassel's formulation of the purchasing power parity (PPP) doctrine in

 1916 was followed by decades of controversy.' This debate became particularly

 heated in the 1950s and early 1960s, when a number of analysts used PPP calculations

 to evaluate whether specific currencies were overvalued or undervalued Houth21ckIr,

 1962). By explicitly introducing nonttadable goods and technological progress into the

analysis, Bela Balassa's (1964) reinterpretation of PPP helped place things in

perspective. He convincingly argued that in the presence of differentials in

technological progress across counties and sectors, PPP computations would tend to

differ systematically from the equilibrium (real) exchange rate. Balassa showed that
under a plausible set of assumptions — namely that technological progress is faster in

tradables than in nontradables, and that technological progress is the main source of

growth —, the rate of inflation in the faster growing country would be, in equilibrium,

higher than that of the slower grower.2 This interpretation of inflation differentials

continues to be popular among international economists. For instance, Marston (1987)

has relied on it to explain Japan's real exchange rate behavior vis-a-vis the U.S., and

Svensson (1993) has mentioned it as a possible explanation for the collapse of the

European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1993.

       Many recent policy analyses of open economies have been strongly influenced

by Balassa's broad work on exchange rates and economic reform. For instance, much

of the work on the effect of terms of trade shocks on real exchange rate behavior has

built on Balassa's contributions in the 1960s.' Also, discussions on the merits of

alternative exchange rate regimes in developing and Eastern European countries have

been influenced by Balassa's work on policy reform. This has been particularly the

case in policy debates on the desirability of using fixed nominal exchange rates as
                                              2

  anchors in stabilization programs (see Balassa 1987 and 1989; see aiso Corden 199].
  and Edwards 1993).

         In this paper we use data from two Central American countries — Guatemala

  and Honduras — to investigate some PPP-related issues close to Balassa's early work.

  These two nations had fixed exchange rate regimes for nearly seven decades, and

 provide a unique opportunity for testing some of the most important implications of

 PPP over the (very) long run. The Honduran currency was uninterruptedly pegged to

 the dollar between 1918 and 1990; Guatemala's currency was fixed to the dollar

 between 1926 and 1986 (see the Appendix for details). We are particularly interested in

 addressing two questions: first, to what extent the reliance on fixed exchange rates for

 such a long period imposed macroeconomic discipline to these countries. That is, to

 what extent inflation in these countries was determined by "world" inflation. We deal

 with this issue primarily from the point of view of modern credibility theories that

 emphasized the role of institutional constraints as an effective way of tieing the hands

 of opportunistic governments. Second, we investigate the way in which terms of trade

changes and growth differentials affected inflation rates differentials between each of

these countries and the United States. We found that in both countries the fixed

exchange regime worked relatively well until the mid-1970s. In ct, the evidence

provides some support to the view that fixed exchange rates acted for long periods of

time as a constraint on Central Bank behavior. However, the analysis also shows that

the mere existence of a fixed exchange rate was not a sufficient condition for avoiding

inflation outbursts and balance of payments crises. More specifically, the evidence

suggests that having maintained a fixed exchange rate during a period of large negative

terms of trade shocks in the late 1970s and early 1980s may have had negative effects

on these countries.

       The paper is organized as follows. Section U deals with PPP tests. We first

use annual data for 1930-1983 to perform standard tests of the relative version of PPP

holds in Guatemala and Honduras. We then use modern time series techniques on

quarterly data for 1957-1983 to further investigate this issue. We find that when these

more powerful tests are applied it is possible to reject the relative version of PPP for

both Central American nations. Section III tries to account for the factors affecting

departures from PPP. In particuiar, we consider the potential roles of both monetary

and real factors. We test whether these countries exercised independent monetary

and/or credit policies during this period. Regarding real shocks, we investigate

whether terms of trade disturbances and growth differentials affected inflation rate

differentials. Section P/ deals with these countries' exchange rate crises during the

late 1980s and early 1990s. We argue that after the oil shocks and the debt crisis both

of these countries experienced significant changes in their credit and fiscal policies.

The appendix provides a brief history of Guatemala and Honduras' experiences with

fixed exchange rates.



II. Fixed Excban2e Rates and PPP In Central America: A Long Run Empirical
     Perspective
       Even though Honduras had a fixed exchange rate from 1918 to 1990 and

Guatemala between 1926 and 1986, we have only been able to find macroeconomic

data for both countries from the 1930s. Figure 1 displays annual rates of inftation for

1930-1992 for Guatemala, Honduras and the U.S.' This figure suggests that it is

possible to distinguish three broad subperiods. The first goes from 1930 to

approximately 1955 and is characterized by rates of inflation in the two Central

American countries that are both higher and more volatile than those in the U.S. This

subperiod was characterized by dramatic economic turbulence, including the Great

Depression, the Second World War, and the Korean War. The second subperiod goes

from approximately 1956 to 1983, and is characterized by low and relatively stable

rates of inflation. As can be seen from Table 1, during this era the average rate of

inflation was lower in both Central American countries than in the U.S. Interestingly

enough, this period was not free of external disturbances, as the world endured two

major oil shocks and in 1982 the eruption of the debt crisis. Finally, the third period

goes from 1984 through 1992 and is characterized by the development of major

imbalances that ended, in both Guatemala (1986) and Honduras (1990), with the

abandonment of the fixed exchange rate regime. An important characteristic of this

subperiod is that the authorities in both countries responded to the debt crisis by

following a domestic credit policy that was clearly at odds with the countries' history,

and that eventually proved to be inconsistent with maintaining a pegged exchange rate.

        In this section we use both yearly and quarterly data to test whether inflation in

our two Central American countries deviated significantly from that of the U.S.. We

first estimate traditional partial adjustmenttype equations on annual data. We then use

time series techniques on quarterly data to gain further insights on the behavior of

inflation differentials.

11.1 Testing for the Relative Version of PPP Using Annual Data

        In its simplest form, what Balassa (1964) called the relative version of PPP,

states that under fixed exchange rates inflation rates across countries will not differ

significantly. However, as pointed out by Bala.ssa (1964) and previously by Cassel

(1916), in the short run it is still possible for domestic inflation to deviate from

"world' inflation. The simplest way to incorporate the idea that in the long run the

relative version of PPP holds is by postulating a partial adjustnient equation of the

following type (Frenkel, 1978):



               Inf(t)   a0 + a1 InfUS(t) + a2 Inf(t-1) + u(t),              (1)



where Inf(t) is inflation in the country in question in period t, InflJS is foreign

inflation, which in our case is inflation in the US, and u(t) is an error term assumed to

have the usual properties.S If PPP holds in the long run, a/(1-a2) should not be

significantly different from one. Naturally, in this formulation coefficient a2 measures

the speed at which deviations from PPP are eliminated.

       Table 2 presents the results obtained from the estimation of equation (1) using

annual data from Guatemala and Honduras for two subperiods: 1930 (or the first year

for which there are data) and 1982, and 1956 through 1982. As can be seen from

Table 2, the relative version of PPP is rejected for the period that goes from the 1930s

to 1983. The Chi-square statistic for testing whether the long-run coefficient of U.S.

inflation is unity is 4.9 for Guatemala and 5.4 for Honduras. However, it is not

possible to reject it, in either country, for the more tranquil period 1957-83: In this

case the long run coefficient of U.S. inflation is not significantly different from one

(the Chi-square statistic is 1.9 for Guatemala and 0.18 for Honduras).

       Traditional tests of PPP of the type reported above are subject to some

limitations, including the use of annual data and the assumption that inflation rates are

stationary. Additionally, the test on coefficient restrictions used to investigate whether

the coefficient of InfUS is unity in the long run has a relative low power. As a way to

deal with these issues we have used quarterly data for 1957-83 to further investigate

the behavior of inflation rates under fixed parities in these countries.

11.2   Analysis with Quarterly Data: 1957-1983

        According to the relative version of PPP and to the simplest monetary theories

of the international transmission of inflation, under a fixed nominal exchange rate

system the rate of domestic inflation in a small open economy does not differ from

"the" world rate of inftation (Swoboda, 1978). Under this setting, international price

disturbances will be rapidly and fully transmitted into the domestic economy.

Moreover, local central banks would have no room for engaging in monetary policy: a

domestic excess supply (demand) for money will result in an equiproportional loss

(gain) of international reserves, leaving the quantity of money and domestic prices

unchanged in the domestic economy. If this simple model of the international

transmission of inflation holds, we would expect that the time series of inflationary

differentials between the domestic country and "the" world will be characterized by

white noise.

        Table 3 contains Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit-root tests, and Ljung-

Box statistics for white noise series. In every case inflation differentials were defined

as follows:

           Dinf =   i-                                                       (2)

where i       and   i   are quarterly inflation rates for the country in question and the

U.S. As in the previous section, inflation is defined as the percentage change in the

consumer price index. As can be seen from Table , in both cases the hypothesis that

the inflationary differential has a unit root is rejected at conventional levels. The

Ljung-Box Q statistics reported in the second column show, on the other hand, that the

hypothesis that inflationary differentials is white noise cannot be rejected at the 1 %

level in the case of Guatemala.6

        The analysis of the time series properties of Dinf reported in Table 3

contradicts that obtained from the simple partial adjustment model on annual data, and

provides preliminary evidence suggesting that at least in the short run, variables other

than world inflation affected domestic inflationary dynamics. From a policy

perspective it is important to investigate what factors are behind the deviations from

PPP reported above. A particularly interesting issue is whether inflation differentiaLs

responded to real or to monetary shocks.

        In his celebrated 1964 article Balassa postulated that there are three fundamental

real reasons for rejecting the relative version of PPP: (a) different rates of

technological progress (or aggregate growth) across countries;7 (b) terms of trade

shocks which affect the equilibrium real exchange rate; and (c) changes in commercial

policy that alter taxes on international transactions. In the case of Guatemala and

Honduras, however, the latter explanation is rather implausible for 1930-83, since

throughout most of this period there were only limited changes in commercial policy.

        Another question refers to the possible role of monetary variables in explaining

deviations from PPP. This is particularly important within the context of modern

discussions on the role of fixed exchange rates as a disciplinary device and effective

nominal anchor. It is also relevant to study the ability of the Central Bank to

undertake independent monetary policy, and the possible role of real variables such as

terms of trade shocks and growth differentials in explaining differences in inflation

rates.9 In Section III we investigate the possible roles of both real and monetary

variables in explaining inflation rate differential sin both countries between 1957 and

1983.

     Nominal Excban2e Rates

 IIL1 Fixed Exchange Rates and Credibility

         Most modern discussions on PPP and inflation rate differentials under fixed

 exchange rates have been couched within the context of credibility and time consistency

 literature.'° According to this approach governments that have the discretion to alter

 the nominal exchange rate will tend to abuse their power, introducing an inflationary

 bias into the economy (Calvo 1978, and Kydland and Prescott 1977). The reason for

 this is that under a set of plausible conditions, such as the existence of labor market

 rigidities that preclude the economy from reaching full employment, it will be optimpl

 for the government to surprise" the private sector through unexpected devaluations

 that, the government hopes, will reduce real wages and hike employment."        In

equilibrium the public will be aware of this incentive fuced by the authorities, and will

react to it by anticipating the devaluation surprises and hence rendering them

ineffective. As a result the economy will reach a high inflation plateau. A key feature

of the credibility literature is that under most circumstances policy commitment is

welfare-superior to discretionary policy. If the government can credibly commit itself

to low (or no) inflation, society will be better off: employment will be the same as in

the discretionary policy case, but inflation will be lower. The problem, however, is

that governments have a hard time making credible commitments. In the absence of

effective constraints to tie the government's hands, any promise of low inflationary

policy will not be credible and, thus, will be self-defeating.

       The fundamental policy implication of this literature is that defining (and

implementing) constraints that will make government pre-commitments credible, will

result in an improvement in society's we1ire. It has been argued that the adoption of

a   fixed exchange rate will constrain governments ability to surprise the private sector

through unexpected devaluations. Promises of fiscal discipline will become credible

and private sector actions will not elicit successive rounds of inflationary actions.'2

In particular, it has been argued that fixed exchange rates provide a reputational

constraint on government behavior. The authorities hiow that if they undertake overly

expansive credit policy they will be forced to abandon the parity and devalue. As the

recent crisis of the ERM has shown, exchange rate crises can indeed shatter the

reputation of politicians.'3

         Devarjari and Rodrik (1992) and Kamin (1991), among others, have addressed

the question of the desirability of fixed exchange rates from a more general

perspective.'4 For example, in Devarajan and Radrik (1992), policy makers face a

tradeoff regarding exchange rate policy: while exchange rate flexibility has an

inflationary bias, it also allows the country to reduce output variability. This is

accomplished by smoothing, via exchange rate adjustments, the consequences of terms

of trade shocks on output. In this model it is not possible to rank a-priori fixed and

flexible (or active) exchange rate regimes. For large terms of trade shocks it is more

likely that flexible exchange rates will be superior. Likewise, the more vulnerable the

real economy is to these terms of trade shocks, the more desirable will flexible

arrangements become. On the other hand, the greater is the government's built-in

inflationary bias, the greater will be its temptation to abuse devaluations, and the less

desirable will a flexible arrangement become.

        John Williamson (1991) has argued that a fixed exchange rate would be

advisable as long as four conditions are met: (1) the country in question is "small"

relative to the rest of the world; (2) the bulk of its international trade is undertaken

with the country (or countries) with respect to which it plans to peg its currency; (3)
                                             10

 the country shes to have a rate of inflation similar to that of the country it is pegging

 its currency to; and (4) there are institutional arrangements that assure that the

 commitment to a fixed rate is credible. Williamson goes on to argue that, once these

 four conditions are met, the only remaining argument in favor of flexible exchange
 rates refers to terms of trade shocks.

        Historically, Guatemala and Honduras have satisfied Williamson's first three

 conditions. Whether the fourth requirement — the existence of appropriate institutional

 arrangements — was fulfilled may be subject to some discussion. In both countries the

 Central Bank lacked formal independence, and the professional staffs werevery small.

 Also, budgetary procedures for the public sector were primitive and lacked

 transparency. On the other hand, however, the most important institutional support for

 maintaining a fixed exchange rate was the very long history with this type of regime.

 As time passed, this remarkable history became a greater and greater reputational

constraint, making the notion of devaluation unthinkih1e.

       With respect to terms of trade, every Central American country - including

Guatemala and Honduras — experienced increased volatility in the 1970s (see figure 2

for the Honduran case). This suggests that at some time, and due to changes in the

nature of underlying shocks, an exchange rate regime that had been appropriate ceased

to be so. Guatemala and Honduras, however, decided to maintain their ftxed rates in

spite of increasingly large external fluctuations. However, another Central American

country, Costa Rica, opted for abandoning the fixed exchange rate in order to achieve
a smoother external sector adjustment — even at the cost of higher inflation.

Preliminary evidence discussed in Edwards (1994) suggests that, by allowing an early

exchange rate realignment Costa Rica was able to achieve a significantly faster

recovery in growth than its neighbors.

111.2 Empirical Results

        Within the credibility framework discussed above it is important to understand

whether, under a fixed nominal exchange rate regime, countries are able to undertake

independent monetary policy. Stockmaa (1992) has analyzed the issue of monetary

autonomy for a group of industrial countries during the Breton Woods era. He

estimated a series of vector autoregressions for inflationary differentials, and tested

whether the coefficients of money growth (as a group) were significantly different to

zero. He found that for the majority of the countries the null hypothesis of zero

money growth coefficients was rejected, and interpreted these results as evidence in

favor of the hypothesis that industrial countries had sonic room to undertake

independent monetary policy during the Bretton Woods era.

       In a (small) open economy subject to exogenous shocks, Central Banks

sometimes try to use monetary (or credit) policy in an attempt to counter the effects of

terms of trade disturbances. Under these circumstances, domestic credit would be

expanded when the terms of trade worsen, and contracted when the terms of trade

improve. Naturally, under fixed exchange rates, the magnitude of credit expansion

will be restricted by the availability of international reserves and the country's capacity

to borrow internationally. Of course, a serious problem with this type of

countercydical domestic credit policy is that it requires that the authorities have a good

notion of whether terms of trade shocks are temporary or permanent.

       In order to deal with these issues we estimated equations of the following type

using quarterly data for the four Latin countries in the sample:

                                                                               +u (2)
                                              12

where, as before, Din     refers   to inflationary differentials; Gmo; is the rate of

growth of narrowly defined money for the country in question; dtot is the percentage

change in the country's terms of trade; Grodif is the differential in the rate of growth

of GDP between the country and the U.S., which along the lines of the empirical PPP

literature, is used as a proxy for differences in technological progress across countries;

u is an error term; andi = l,...,3; and j = O,...3.' If these countries enjoyed —
and practiced — monetary   independence, we would expect that the coefficients of

Gmon would be different from zero as a group. Terms of trade shocks and growth

differentials are the real variables in this analysis. The role of external disturbances in

the inflationary process is captured by the sum of the dtot coefficients. In order to

look at this issue from different angles, we also estimated a series of equations of the

type of (2), where we replaced Gmon for the rate of growth of domestic credit

(Gcredit).16 Table 4 presents the likelihood ratio tests obtained from testing the

hypotheses that: (a) the coefficients of Gmon — or those of Gcredit — were jointly

zero; (b) the coefficients of dtot were jointly zero; and (c) that the coefficients of

Grodif were jointly zero. As can be seen, the null hypothesis that the money growth

coefficients are jointly equal to zero can be rejected at conventional levels in both

countries. In the case of Gcredit the results are different; it is not possible to reject

the null hypothesis in either country. Table 4 also shows that in only one regression —

Guatemaia when Gcredit is the monetary variable — is possible to reject the hypothesis

that the terms of trade coefficients are jointly zero. With respect to the growth

differential terms, the null hypothesis was rejected in all regressions at conventional

levels.

          The results reported above are somewhat mixed. Although they suggest that

central banks were able, at least in the short run, to engage in independent monetary

policy, the evidence in this regard is not overwhelming. In particular, it is somewhat

surprising that the coefficients of Gcredit did not turn out to be significant as a group.

As a way to further explore this issue we reestimated the Dinf equations, reducing the

dimension of the vector auto regression. In the new estimates both terms of trade

shocks and growth differentials were excluded from the analysis. Table 5 contains the

likelihood ratio tests on the significance of Gmon and Gcredit for both countries. As

can be seen in this case the null hypothesis that the monetary variables coefficients are

jointly zero is rejected in both regressions. All in all, we inteipret the evidence

reported in this section as providing some evidence supporting the view that the

monetary authorities in these countries were able to engage in independent monetary

policy during the period. And yet, the fact that the fixed exchange rate regime was

maintained throughout indicates quite clearly that this ability was not abused by the

authorities. The next section deals with the issue of monetary policy and the

abandonment of the exchange rate regime in some detail.

IV. Credit Policy and Exchan2e Rate Crises

         In the mid and late 1980s and early 1990s the long experience with fixed

nominal exchange rates came to an end in both of our countries. Guatemaia devalued

in 1986, and Honduras abandoned its official parity in early 1990. These devaluations,

however, were not easy to undertake, Even when the evidence overwhelmingly

showed that the old regime was not sustainable any longer, the authorities in both

countries desperately adhered to the fixed rate, and imposed severe exchange and

capital controls in an effort to avoid the complete depletion of international reserves.

As a result of this, significant black markets for foreign exchange were developed —

see   figure 3 fOr the premium. In this section we analyze in some detail the behavior of

fiscal and monetary policy variables, and we investigate the circumstances that led to

the abandonment of the fixed parities in the 1980s.

        The fundamental feature of a fixed exchange rate system is that it imposes

financial discipline on the Central Bank and other government agencies. The

authorities are aware that if they systematically violate certain macroeconomic

constraints the country will deplete its international reserves to a minimum level, and

will be forced to give up the parity. Consequently, a fixed exchange rate imposes

upper bounds to domestic credit creation and fiscal imbalances. These constraints,

however, operate in the medium to long rnn, and do not have to be observed at every

moment. it is, in fact, perfectly possible that in a particular period credit creation

exceeds this threshold". However, when this happens, the authorities will rapidly try

to change directions, bringing macro policy back to a consistent course.'7

       If the country can increase its foreign indebtedness, the macro constraints can

be side stepped for a longer period of time. This, however, cannot be a permanent

solution. As the Latin countries found out the hard way in the early 1980s, at some

point the international community will stop providing funds, and a crisis will erupt.

       Fixed rates impose two basic financial constraints: first, domestic credit cannot

grow, on average, at a rate faster than that of the demand for money. This, in turn, is

determined by world inflation, real income growth and the income elasticity of the

demand for money.'1 Second, the fiscal deficit (as a proportion of GDP) financed by

money creation cannot exceed a certain bound determined by the increase in the

demand for money and the degree of monetization of the economy."

       Figures 4 and 5 display estimated annual upper bounds or thresholds as well as

actual rates of domestic credit creation and the fiscal deficit for our two countries.20

In these figures the solid lines represent the actually observed series, while the broken

lines are the "upper bounds imposed by the fixed nominal exchange rates regime.

These figures, then, capture the periods during which the bounds were exceeded.

During the early years (up to the mid to 1970s or early 1980s, depending on the

country) the bounds seemed to have been very effective. Every time the actual rate of

credit creation, or the deficit ratio, exceeded their respective thresholds the authorities

rapidly implemented corrective policies bringing the policy variable below the bound.

These data suggest that during these years Guatemala and Honduras followed the "rules

of the games, and acted as if the nominal exchange rate regime imposed a financial

constraints. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, this behavior breaks down;

as the figures show in both countries the two policy indicators exceed the estimated

thresholds without returning, in the short or medium runs, to a level consistent with

fixed exchange rates.

       In order to further investigate the behavior of credit policy in the period

preceding the devaluation crisis, we estimated vector autoregressions for domestic

credit growth for the core period under fixed exchange rates, 1957.75.21 We then

compared forecasted values obtained from these equations with actual credit growth.

As Table 6 shows, in both Guatemala and Honduras the forecasted rate of growth of

domestic credit was below the actual growth between 1977 and 1981. This suggests

that if the authorities had maintained the historical policy behavior in the period

preceding the debt crisis, the rate of credit expansion would have been significantly

below what was observed. This departure from the policies that respected the nominal

anchor constraint created the increasingly large inflation rate differential reported

above, and eventually led to the collapse of the fixed rate regime.

V. Concluding Remarks

       The purpose of this paper has been to investigate some aspects of Latin

America's experience with fixed exchange rates at the light of Bela Balassa's

contributions to the purchasing power parity theory. The analysis has dealt with both

long term characteristics of this system in Latin America. We evaluated the long-term

experiences of two Latin American nations with fixed exchange rates. The evidence

analyzed suggests that the relative version of PPP did not hold in Guatema1i and

Honduras. However, in spite of the fact that these countries had the ability to conduct

independent monetary policy, the existence of a long tradition of exchange rate

stability provided some constraints on Central Bank behavior. This evidence,

however, also indicates that these constraints were limited, and would not survive the

combination of populist political pressures and severely negative terms of trade shocks

in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In fact, our analysis suggests that in the mid 1970s

domestic credit and fiscal policies undertook a significant change, and were not any

longer constrained by the existence of a fixed nominal exchange rate.

Aopendix - Central American Experiences with Fixed Exchange Rates: A Brief
History

GUATEMALA

       Early in 1919 Princeton professor and economic advisor Edwin Kemmerer was

hired by the Guatemaian government to prepare a proposal for monetary reform. The

fall of dictator Estraxia Cabrera a year later prevented Kemrnerer's Gold Standard

proposal to be adopted. In September 1923 the Caja Reguladora was established to

stabilize exchange rate with funds earmarked from taxes on coffee and stop the fall in

the value of the peso. Kemmerer was invited again in 1924, and a currency reform

initiated. The Quetzal was established as the new monetary unit, to be issued at par

with the dollar.

       The first Central Bank of Guatemala was founded in 1925 with very little

foreign technical assistance. It was a semi-public institution, whose department of

currency issue only discounted short run trade bills. Besides, this bank also operated

as a commercial institution. It was managed by a Junta Directiva composed by 9

members, 2 chosen by the government and 7 by the stockholders.

       In 1926 the Guatemalan authorities were finally persuaded by Kemmerer's early

proposal, and the country embraced the Gold Standard. The Caja Reguladora waS

reorganized as the Banco Central de Guatemala, with monopoly of note issue. The

exchangeratewasfixedat60pescsperQuetzalordollar(thepesohadbeenatpar
with the dollar in 1870.) The new currency was linked at par with the U.S. dollar,

starting a tradition of more than half a century of fixed parities. It was a fully

transferable paper currency, covered by 50 percent in gold and 30 percent in dollar

assets. In February 1934 the Quetzal was devalued along with the dollar, and the

official gold price increased to 35 Quetzales per ounce.
                                           18

       In December 1945 the Banco d€ Guatemala replaced the old central bank

Several economists from the Federal Reserve System (Robert Triffin and Henry

Wallich among others) were part of the reorganization task force. The new Junta

Monetaria was composed by six members, four representatives from the public sector,

one from the University of San Carlos de Guatemala and one from the private financial

sector, arid was in charge of designing and implementing monetary, credit and

exchange rate policies of Guatemala. In December 1946 Guatem joined the IMP

and the World Bank, as part of the so-called "dollar area." In March 1956 Guatemala

became a member of the International Finance Corporation.

       CoL Arbenz Guzman caine to power on March 1951, and then several

collectivist experiments were implemented, as for instance the natior2B7tion of real

estate holdings of foreign companies. As a result, a black market for U.S. banknotes

emerged, and the premium reached 25 percent. In 1954, after a coup d'etat led by

Col. Castillo Armas, black markets finally disappear.

       By 1962 a new era of political unrest had begun, and the black market

exchange rate peaked at 1.5 per dollar. A multiple exchange rate system was

established on October 1962, and exchange controls were enacted for the first time in

Guatemalan history. After the implementation of an economic austerity plan, the

multiple exchange rate system was abolished in May 1963, and the parity was once

again unified at one Quetzal per dollar.

       Exchange controls were slowly enacted starting in 1980, as a consequence of

the state of beliigerance in Central America. The outburst of civil war in 1981 led to

the breakdown of the CACM and growing protectionism. Besides, an excessively

expansionary fiscal policy gave rise to a process of real exchange rate overvaluation

and loss of international reserves. During the first half of the 1980s, the black market
                                           19

premium increased constantly, peaking at more than 250 percent in 1985. A three-tier

exchange rate system was created in November 1984. The official rate of one Quetzal

per dollar was maintained for most export receipts, proceeds from foreign borrowing,

and for the service of the external public debt. An auction market rate ruled cerlain

import payments, and a fluctuating bank rate was effective for all other dealings.

There were also mixed export rate for sugar, cotton and meat from outside the Central

American Common Market (80 percent official and 20 percent fluctuating.) A partial

devaluation was undertaken in February 1985, by shifting commodities to the

fluctuating exchange rate. A tax of 3.5 percent on foreign exchange operations was

established in July 1985, and the mixed export rate was finaly devalued in October of

the same year. The exchange rate system was simplified in June 1986. The official

rate was set at one Quetzal per dollar for previously contracted foreign debt; the

fluctuating rate became the interbank rate at 2.9 for remittances and tourism, and the

auction market rate was replaced with the regulated market rate at 2.5 for imports and

exports, while all foreign exchange taxes were eliminated. Finally, the exchange

market was unified in June 1988.



HONDURAS

       In the early 1900 Honduras split in two parts for currency purposes: the dollar

was means of payments and unit of account in the northern coast (banana production

areas) while silver currency ruled in the rest of the country. In May 1918 the

government authorized a private commercial bank (Banco Atlantida) to redeem notes in

dollars. The US currency was declared legal tender, and the official exchange rate

fixed at two pesos per dollar. The new currency was linked to gold at the rate of
                                            20
0.836 grams per unit. In 1919 the Banco Atlantida was obliged to keep reserves in

gold or dollars.

        In 1921, Arthur Young, a US currency expert, presented a plan for monetary

reform based on the Gold Standard to the Congress, which was not acted on. Gold

and silver circulated side by side during the 1920s, until the Lempira was introduced

as new currency in 1931. Its parity was 2 to 1 relative to the U.S. dollar. The

Lempira was devalued along with the dollar in February 1934, while the gold content

of the Lempira was reduced to 0.444 grams, marking the end of the Gold Standard in

Honduras.

        Prior to February 1950, Honduras had only two banks - Banco de Honduras

and Banco 1dtlbuida, both private.   In that year, the Banco CeniTa! de Honduras was

established with the technical support of the IMF. As in the case of Guatemala, a

JwUa Monetaria, with representatives from the government, official development

agencies, commercial banks, and primary productive sectors, was responsible for the

monetary policy of the country. On September 1955 the new banking law was

approved, setting the regulatory framework for the establishment of financial

institutions.

       The Lempira maintained its link with the dollar after August 1971, which

entailed a de facto devaluation. The gold content of Lempira was reduced 7.89 percent

the following December, and again, on February 1973 by another 10 percent.

       In the beginning of the 1980s overly expansive fiscal policies gave rise to a

large disequilibrium in the external sector, because of the incipient overvaluation trend

in the real exchange rate. With the intensications of social tensions there was an

increase in capital flight, until 1980 when capital controls were imposed. Moreover,

starting in 1982 a large series of trade barriers were established as a reaction of the
                                           21
lack of foreign funds to finance the external sector deficit. A parallel market rate for

commercial transactions with Central American countries was established in March

1985, followed by a program of subsidies to non-traditional exports in December 1987,

which in practice meant a highly distortive system of multiple exchange rates.

Meanwhile, the parallel market premium increased from 20 percent in 1986 to 80

percent in 1989, signalling a growing imbalance in the external sector. Finally, a

period of more than 70 years of fixed parities caine to an end in March 1990, when the

Lempira was devalued.

    1. Viner (1937) gives a flavor of the debate.

   2. Strictly speaking Balassa's theorem also requires that the share of
   tradables in the price index is the same across countries.

   3. See, in particular, Balassa (1962, 1964).
   4. We have been unable to find a complete time series of Honduran and
   Guatemalan prices for the period prior to 1990.

   5. A number of authors have (correctly) argued that, in general, world
   inflation should be measured using a basket of foreign infl2tion. In the case
   of Central America, however, the overwhelming majority of trade is with the
   U.S. This justifies using U.S. inflation as a proxy. Notice that the
   estimation of (1) using conventional techniques assumes that inflation is
   stationary. This is discussed in greater detail in the section that follows.

    6. Edwards (1994) also looks at the experiences of El Salvador and the
    Dominican Republic.
    7. For a detailed discussion of alternative tests of PPP see Officer (1986).
    Svensson (1993), for example, refers to the Balassa effect as dealing with
    growth differentials.
    8. All of these are what have become to be known as real exchange rate
    fundamentals. See Edwards (1989).

    9.This discussion is somewhat related to traditional debates on sterilization
    and the "offset" coefficient. See Obstfeld (1982).

    10.The new impetus for fixed rates has strongly emerged in the International
    Monetary Fund. See Aghevli et al. (1991).
    11 .This assumes that wages are set before the government implements the
    exchange rate policy, but after it has been announced.

    12.Aghevli et al. (1991).
    13. In spite of its elegant appeal, this view has, in its simplest incarnation,
    some serious limitations. First, in these simple settings exchange rate policy
    has a very restricted role. In fact, in most of these models its only effect is
    to alter the domestic rate of inflation and, through it, the government
    perceives it as altering real wages. However, in most modern exchange rate
    models, nominal devaluations can also help accommodate shocks to real
    exchange rate fundamentals - including shocks to the terms of trade -
    helping to avoid RER misalignment. Second, in economies with stochastic
    shocks, contingent exchange rate rules can, at least in principle, be superior
    to fixed rates (Flood and Isard 1988). Third, it is not clear why a country
                                      26
that can credibly commit itself to unilaterally fixing the exchange rate, cannot
commit itself to maintaining a fixed stock of domestic money, or to follow a
specific monetary rule.
14. Mundell (1961) and McKinnon (1963) had earlier addressed the same
problem in the context of optimal currency areas. See also Corden (1972).

 15.The data were obtained from the International Financial Statistics. The
monetary data were centered" in order to make them compatible with the
inflation figures, which refer to period averages.

16. Since Gmon may not be completely exogenous, using Gcredit helps deal
the endogeneity issue. The problem of potential exogeneity was also tackled
by computing variance decompositions for a series of estimated VARs. In all
cases, and under all possible orderings of the variables, the results provide
strong indications that Gmon was, at least up to 6 quarters, exogenous.

17.That is, under fixed exchange rate constraints it is assumed that macro
authorities follow the rules of the gamew.

18.This assumes several things: first, the initial ratio of domestic credit to
money is equal to the desired ratio. This is equivalent to saying that initially
the Central Bank holds the desired ratio of reserves. Second, it assumes that
the opportunity cost of holding money does not vary excessively, and can be
ignored. Third, it assumes that the external debt/GDP ratio is in
equilibrium.

19.Formally this constraint is derived from the public finance approach to
inflation. The deficit to GDP ratio (d) cannot exceed the rate of growth of
money demand (dM/M) times the initial ratio of money to GDP.
20.In order to compute the upper bounds it was necessary to first obtain data
on the long run income elasticity of the demand for money. We estimated
demand for money equations for each country independently, using annual
data for 1950-80. In the case of Guatemala the estimated value was 1.1; for
Honduras was 1.8.

21. In addition to lagged values of domestic credit growth, we used U.S.
inflation and real GDP growth in the country in question. Three lags of each
variable were included.
