                                         ABSTRACT

Using several sources, we construct a data set of robot purchases by French manufacturing firms
and study the firm-level implications of robot adoption. Out of 55,390 firms in our sample, 598
have adopted robots between 2010 and 2015, but these firms account for 20% of manufacturing
employment and value added. Consistent with theory, robot adopters experience significant
declines in labor share and the share of production workers in employment, and increases in value
added and productivity. They expand their overall employment as well. However, this expansion
comes at the expense of their competitors (as automation reduces their relative costs). We show
that the overall impact of robot adoption on industry employment is negative. We further
document that the impact of robots on overall labor share is greater than their firm-level effects
because robot adopters are larger and grow faster than their competitors.

Introduction
Automation substitutes capital for tasks previously performed by labor, reducing the la-
bor share of value added and increasing value added per worker in the process. While the
higher productivity from automation tends to increase labor demand, its displacement ef-
fect may outweigh this positive impact and may lead to an overall decline in employment
and wages (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019a). Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019b) estimate
negative effects from the introduction of one of the leading examples of automation tech-
nology, industrial robots, across US local labor markets, suggesting that the displacement
effects could be significantly larger than the productivity effect.1 Firm-level evidence is
useful as well for understanding how automation is impacting the production process and
productivity.2 But its interpretation is made complicated by the fact that firms adopt-
ing automation technologies reduce their costs and may expand at the expense of their
competitors.
       In this paper, we study firm-level changes associated with robot adoption using data
from France between 2010 and 2015. Consistent with our theoretical expectations (which
are developed further in the Appendix), we find that firm-level adoption of robots coincides
with declines in labor shares, increases in value added and productivity, and declines in
the share of production workers. In contrast to their market-level effects, however, overall
employment increases faster in firms adopting robots.
       This positive employment effect may be because firms with greater growth potential are
more likely to adopt robots, generating a classic omitted variable bias. Equally important,
this positive effect may be a consequence of reallocation of output and labor towards firms
that reduce their costs relative to their competitors. We show that such reallocation
accounts for the positive firm-level impact of robots. Firms whose competitors adopt
robots experience significant declines in value added and employment.3 In fact, the overall
impact of robot adoption (combining own and spillover effects) is negative and implies that
a 20 percentage point increase in robot adoption (as in our sample) is associated with a
3.2% decline in industry employment.
       Finally, we use our data to study the decline in the French manufacturing labor share.
As in Autor et al. (2019), we find that this decline is explained by a lower covariance
between firm-level value added and labor share. However, in our data, this pattern is ex-
plained not so much because expanding firms had lower labor shares (or higher markups),
   1
     Graetz and Michaels (2018) use variation across industries and countries and find lower labor share and
higher productivity from robots, but negative effects only for unskilled workers. Aghion et al. (2019) find
negative regional employment effects in France, while Dauth et al. (2019) estimate employment declines
in manufacturing, but not overall, across German regions.

but because firms adopting robots are large and expand further as they experience signif-
icant relative declines in their labor share.


1    Data on French Robots
Our sample includes 55,390 firms that were active from 2010 to 2015 in the French man-
ufacturing sector. For these firms, we have data on sales, value added, employment (total
hours of work), share of production workers, and wages (and can estimate total factor
productivity). For firms that export, we also have data on export prices and quantities
by detailed product. Further information on the data and the sample are provided in the
(online) Appendix.
    We identified 598 manufacturing firms that adapted (purchased) industrial robots dur-
ing this period using several sources, including a survey by the Ministry of Industry, in-
formation provided by French robot suppliers about their list of clients, customs data on
imports of industrial robots by firm, and the French fiscal files, which include information
on accelerated depreciation allowances for the purchase of industrial robots. Although
only 1% of our firms purchased robots in 2010­2015, these firms account for 20% of total
manufacturing employment. Table A.1 in the Appendix describes our sample.
    Figure 1 presents information on robot adopters. These tend to be the larger firms
as shown by the higher rates of adoption at top percentiles of the size distribution within

                                                                                                                        3
the 258 4-digit industries in our sample. For example, 13% of firms in the top 1% of the
industry sales distribution adopted robots, while there is almost no robot adoption among
firms below the 20th percentile of the sales distribution. Robot adopters are also likely
to be in industries where there are more major advances in robotics technology and more
rapid spread of robots in other industrialized economies. In particular, the figure shows
that adoption rates are about 50% higher in industries with greater adjusted penetration
of robots (APR) in other European countries (shown in darker color).4


2      Firm-Level Changes
We first study firm-level changes in value added, productivity, the labor share, employ-
ment and wages associated with robot adoption. Specifically, we estimate the following
regression model by OLS across firms, denoted by f :

(1)                        ln yf =  Robotf +   Xf + i(f ) + c(f ) + f .

On the right-hand side we use the change in the log of several firm-level outcomes between
2010 and 2015. The main regressor is Robotf , a dummy for whether the firm adopted
robots in 2010­2015. We control for baseline firm characteristics that are likely to be cor-
related with subsequent changes in our variables of interest (log employment and log value
added per worker in 2010, as well as dummies for whether the firm is affiliated to a larger
corporate group), 4-digit industry-fixed effects for the main industry in which each firm
operates, i(f ) , and fixed effects for the commuting zone that houses each firm's largest
establishment, c(f ) . We report standard errors that are robust to heteroskedasticity and
cross-firm correlation within 4-digit industries.
      Table 1 reports our findings using unweighted (in Panel A) and employment-weighted
specifications (in Panel B). The results in Panel A show that, consistent with our the-
oretical expectations, robot adoption is associated with a 20% increase in value added
from 2010 to 2015 (s.e.=0.030) as well as a 4.3 percentage point decline in the labor share
(s.e.=0.009) and a 1.6 percentage point decline in the production worker share of employ-
ment (s.e.= 0.007). Value added per hour and revenue TFP also increase.5 Column 5
shows that, in contrast to market-level results in previous works, employment (total hours

     The APR measures the common increase in robot use in an industry among advanced economies
(excluding France) since 1993 and adjusts for the mechanical effect of industry growth on robot use (see
Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019b). Manufacturing industries with a high APR are pharmaceuticals, chemi-
cals, plastics, food and beverages, metal products, primary metals, industrial machinery, and automotive.
Industries with a low APR are paper and printing, textiles and apparel, electronic appliances, furniture,
mineral products, and other transportation vehicles.
   5
     The value added and TFP results are not driven by price increases but by higher physical productivity.
The Appendix shows that, for the sample of exporting firms where we have detailed price data, robot
adoption is associated with price declines.

Notes-- The sample consists of 55,390 firms, of which 598 are robot adopters. Panel A presents unweighted
estimates. Panel B presents estimates weighting each firm by its employment (in hours) in 2010. All
specifications control for baseline firm characteristics (log employment and log value added per worker in
2010, as well as dummies for whether the firm is affiliated to a larger corporate group), 4-digit industry-
fixed effects for the main industry in which each firm operates, and fixed effects for the commuting zone
that houses each firm's largest establishment. The Appendix describes the construction of all variables
used as outcomes. Standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity and correlation within 4-digit industries

of work) also increases in firms adopting robots--by 10.9% (s.e.= 0.020). Hourly wages
rise modestly as well (column 6).
        The weighted results in Panel B are similar, except that there are no longer positive
effects on TFP and hourly wages.6 The Appendix documents that these results are robust
to controlling for additional covariates in 2010, including sale distribution percentiles,
capital intensity and the share of production workers in employment.


3        Market-Level Spillovers
As noted above, firms adopting robots, by reducing their costs, may gain market share at
the expense of their competitors. If so, employment gains in these firms may go hand-in-
hand with employment losses in other firms, and the market-level effects of automation
may be very different than its firm-level impact. To investigate this issue, we estimate a
variant of equation (1) including a measure of a firm's competitors' robot adoption. This
measure is defined as

                               Adoption by
                                               =       mf i           sif   Robotf  ,
                               competitorsf        i           f  f

    6
    Even the positive estimate on hourly wages in Panel A, which implies a pass-through elasticity from
output per worker to wages of about 0.1%, is much smaller than estimates in the literature resulting from
other sources of productivity increases, such as obtaining a patent (Kline et al., 2019, and the references
therein), which generate a pass-through elasticity of about 0.35. This is as expected since automation
substitutes capital for labor.

Notes-- The sample consists of 55,388 firms, of which 598 are robot adopters. Panel A presents unweighted
estimates. Panel B presents estimates weighting each firm by its employment (in hours) in 2010. All
specifications control for baseline firm characteristics (log employment and log value added per worker in
2010, as well as dummies for whether the firm is affiliated to a larger corporate group), 4-digit industry-
fixed effects for the main industry in which each firm operates, and fixed effects for the commuting zone
that houses each firm's largest establishment. The Appendix describes the construction of all variables
used as outcomes. Standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity and correlation within 4-digit industries
are in parentheses.


where the first sum is over all 4-digit industries and mf i is the share of firm f 's sales
that are in industry i, while the second is over all firms other than f and sif  is the share
of industry i's total sales accounted for by firm f  . Thus, the measure of adoption by
competitors gives the sales overlap across 4-digit industries between a given firm and all
robot adopters in the economy. The shares mf i and sif  are constructed using sales data
by firm and 4-digit industry from the fiscal files, which cover 85% of sales in our sample.
We assume that small firms that are not in the fiscal files only sell in their main 4-digit
industry. Because equation (1) includes 4-digit industry fixed effects, the spillovers are
identified from the comparison of firms in the same main industry, but selling different
proportions of their products across industries with varying degrees of competition by
robot adopters.
      Table 2 presents estimates for employment, value added, and the labor share. We
report both unweighted and employment-weighted estimates, but because our main in-
terest is aggregate effects, we now focus on weighted models. Consistent with the notion
that automation leads to expansion at the expense of competitors and the labor share of
value added in a firm depends on its own automation decisions, the estimates in columns
4­6 show that a 10 percentage point increase in robot adoption by competitors is as-
sociated with a 2.5% decline in employment (s.e.=0.0107) and a 2.1% decline in value
added (s.e.=0.0159) and, consistent with our theory in the Appendix, competitors' robot
adoption has no impact on a firm's labor share.
      These results establish that, because of negative spillovers on competitors, firm-level
effects do not translate into similar market-level impacts. What is the overall impact



                                                    6
of robot adoption on industry employment? Aggregating the own and the competitors'
effects, we find that robots adoption is associated with an overall decline in industry
employment: a 20 percentage point increase in robot adoption (which is the average robot
adoption in our sample) is associated with a 3.2% decline in industry employment.7


4        Superstar Effects and the Labor Share
Our estimates in Table 1 suggest that the labor share of a firm that adopts robots de-
clines by 4 to 6.3 percentage points. To explore the contribution of these changes to the
aggregate labor share, we follow Autor et al. (2019) and decompose the observed change
in an industry's labor share into the change in the unweighted average within firms and
the change in the covariance between the share of value added of a firm and the firm's
labor share.8 Autor et al. document that the decline in the labor share is driven by a
reduction in the covariance term, and suggest that these changes may be due to a super-
star phenomenon--firms with low labor shares (or high markups) at the baseline expand
due to competitive pressures or winner-takes all dynamics. Our data enable us to inves-
tigate whether similar trends are present in French manufacturing and whether industrial
automation is responsible for some of these patterns.
        Figure 2 presents the decomposition from Autor et al. for French manufacturing
between 2010 and 2015. As in their US results, there is a decline in overall labor share of
0.93 percentage points, which is entirely driven by a declining covariance term. In fact,
the average within-firm change in the labor share is positive. To gauge the contribution of
automation to these changes, we further decompose these effects between robot adopters
and non-adopters. Interestingly, while, analogously to the US, the labor share increases
for firms not adopting robots, it declines for robot adopters. More importantly, about 80%
of the decline in the covariance term is accounted for by the fact that robot adopters are
larger from the outset (-2.81 pp) and expand (-0.14 pp) at the same time as they reduce
their relative labor shares. Notably, this is not due to adopters having lower baseline labor
shares.9 The residual decline in the covariance term, which includes the superstar effect,
    7
     The Appendix shows that this effect on employment is: o f f  Robotf + c f f  Robotf  i mf i 
(1 - sif ). Here, o is the own-firm estimate of robot adoption and c the coefficient on competitors, and
 f    is the baseline employment share in firm f . In our data, own-firm gains account for an increase
in employment of 0.7%, whereas the second term accounts for a decline in employment of 3.9%. Note,
however, that these computations do not incorporate any general equilibrium effects (whereby greater
productivity in one industry increases employment in other industries). The Appendix also documents
that the cross-industry association between robot adoption and employment is negative.
   8
     Changes in an industry labor share, i , can be decomposed as i = f f +  f (f -          ¯ i )  (sv    ¯v
                                                                                                      if - s i ),
                                         v
where f is the labor share in firm f , sif the share of value added in industry i accounted for by firm f ,
and  ¯ i and s
             ¯vi are their unweighted averages. The first term is the unweighted within component and the
second is the change in the covariance. The decomposition ignores entry and exit since we use a balanced
panel of firms.
   9
     Though conditional on size, robot adopters in an industry have slightly greater labor share (of about


                                                       7

in Autor et al. (2019). The decomposition is extended to account for differences between robot adopters
and non-adopters.


accounts for 20% of the decline in the covariance term. Our results therefore provide a
different interpretation of the forces behind the decline in the labor share in manufacturing.
As in Autor et al., this decline is not driven by the unweighted within component, but by
a decline in the covariance term. However, in French manufacturing, this lower covariance
is closely connected to automation: firms adopting robots are large, expand further and
experience significant relative declines in labor share, but did not have lower labor shares
(or higher markups) at the baseline.


5     Conclusion
How firms change their production structure, employment, labor share and productivity
as they adopt automation technologies can help us understand the wide-ranging effects
of automation. Nevertheless, firm-level effects do not correspond to the overall impact of
automation because firms that adopt such technologies reduce their costs and expand at
the expense of competitors. In this paper, we estimate that French manufacturing firms
that adopt robots reduce their labor share and share of production workers and increase
their productivity, but also expand their operations and employment. Yet, this is more
than offset by significant declines in their competitors' employment. Overall, even though
firms adopting robots expand their employment, the market-level implications of robot
adoption are negative. We also show that robot adoption contributes to the decline in
the manufacturing labor share by reducing the covariance between firm-level value added
2 p.p.), unconditionally they have essentially the same labor share as non-adopters.


                                                    8
and labor share, and that this is because adopters are large and expand further as they
experience sizable relative declines in their labor shares.

Notes--The table reports the composition of our sample for firms of different sizes. The Appendix describes
the sources used.


    Data on purchases of robots for 2010­2015 are assembled from the following sources:

    · SYMOP--the French Association of Producers and Importers of Industrial Machinery--
         we obtained an extract of a subset of the firms who purchased domestically produced
         or imported industrial robots from SYMOP.

    · A survey collected by the French Ministry of Industry (Direction G´
                                                                        en´
                                                                          erale des En-
         treprises, or DGE), which includes information on robot purchases among small and
         medium enterprises. This survey sampled firms recognized as clients of SYMOP
         members.

    · From French customs data, we obtained firm imports of industrial robots, which
         are coded under the NC8 product code 84798950. All imports of industrial robots
         sourced from outside of the European Union are reported. Imports of robots from
         other countries in the European Union are not recorded at the transaction level.
         Instead, firms that imported at least 460,000 Euros worth of intermediate inputs
         and capital goods (including industrial robots) during that year from all sources in
         the European Union must report their purchases. The 460,000 Euros threshold is
         the cost of approximately four or five industrial robots. Thus, the customs? data
         miss firms that imported three or fewer robots from other European Union countries
         and small amounts of intermediate inputs (so as not to exceed the combined 460,000
         Euros threshold), as well as firms that buy imported robots through subsidiaries of
         foreign robot producers.

                                                   A.1
   · From French fiscal files, we identified firms that used an accelerated amortization
     scheme dedicated to industrial robots. Eligibility was restricted to small and medium
     enterprises and to transactions occurring between October 2013 and December 2015.
     We also incorporated public information on 40 small and medium enterprises which
     benefited from a subsidy program entitled "Robot Start PME" that was in effect
     between 2013 and 2016.


   Firm accounting information: We obtained detailed accounting information for the
firms in our sample from French fiscal files. In particular, we made use of two different
files: the BRN (B´
                 en´
                   efices R´
                           eels Normaux) and the RSI (R´
                                                       egime Simplifi´
                                                                     e d'Imposition).
The BRN contains the balance sheet of all firms in manufacturing with sales above 730,000
Euros. The RSI is the counterpart of the BRN for firms with sales below 730,000 Euros.
Their union covers nearly the entire universe of French manufacturing firms.

   Corporate groups: In our regressions, we control for a dummy for firms that belong to
larger corporate groups. We obtained data on the ownership structure of firms from the
LIFI files (Liaisons Financi`
                            eres Entre Soci´
                                           et´
                                             es) supplied by INSEE. This survey is com-
plemented with information on ownership structure available from the DIANE (BvDEP)
files, which are constructed using the annual mandatory reports to commercial courts and
the register of French firms. Using these data, we constructed dummies for firms that
are affiliates of larger corporate groups. In regressions we also control for a dummy that
indicates when observations in the fiscal files are an aggregate of several affiliates of a
corporate group.

   Detailed sales information: The data on sales by firm across 4-digit industries used
in the construction of the measure of adoption of robots by competitors come from these
French fiscal files as well. In particular, we use the FARE files (Fichier Approch´
                                                                                  e des
R´
 esultats d'Esane), which contain sales by firm and industry for over 85% of the sales in
our sample. The FARE does not break down sales by industry for small firms, and so
we assume that small firms only sell in their assigned 4-digit industry. The FARE also
contain data on total sales by industry, which we use to compute the weights sif  used in
our formula for adoption among competitors.

   Data on firm exports and prices: We have detailed data on firm exports by totals and
unit values for each NC8 product category. The data come from the French Customs
and cover every transaction between a French firm and a foreign importer located in the
European Union.




                                           A.2
   Worker-level information: We incorporate information from the French matched employer-
employee administrative dataset (D´
                                  eclarations Annuelles des Donn´
                                                                ees Sociales, DADS) to
retrieve worker-level information on occupation, wages, and hours worked.

   Variable definitions: We constructed value added at the firm level as sales minus
expenditure on intermediates. For employment, we have data on the count of employees,
total hours of work, and full-time equivalent workers. In the main text we focus on total
hours of work as our main measure of employment, value added per hour worked as our
main measure of labor productivity, and mean hourly wage for the average wage rate at
the firm. To measure wages, we use the wage bill of the firm, which accounts for all wage
paymentsd to workers. We obtained very similar results using total compensation, which
also includes payroll taxes and other benefits.
   We define production workers using the DADS data as those employed in unskilled
industrial jobs (categories 67 and 68 in the INSEE classification of professions).
   We measure changes in (revenue) TFP for the 2010­2015 period as

          ln TFPf =  ln yf - f   ln        f   - m
                                                 f   ln mf - (1 - f - f )   ln kf .
                                                                      m



Here, f and m
            f denote the shares of wages and intermediates in revenue, respectively.
These shares are measured for each firm in 2010. Alternative measures using detailed
industry shares instead of firm-level ones yield very similar results. In addition,  ln yf is
the percent change in sales,  ln   f   is the percent change in hours,  ln mf is the percent
change in materials, and  ln kf denotes the percent change in the capital stock during
2010­2015. Since we do not have data on material prices, we assume that these are
common across firms.
   For exporting firms, we also have information on prices, which enables us to inves-
tigate whether productivity changes are related to price changes or changes in physical
productivity. In particular, we construct a price index for an exporting firm as follows:

                                  ln pf =         ef    ln pf ,
                                               

where the sum is taken over all NC8 product categories  , ef  denotes the export share
of  in firm f , and  ln pf is the observed change in unit values of the exports of firm f
in product category  .

B. Robustness Checks

This section provides additional own-firm estimates of robot adoption and robustness
checks for the estimates in the main text. Table A.2 presents estimates for additional
outcomes, including log sales and the share of wages in sales. These results show that the
results on Table 1 in the main text hold when we focus on sales rather than value added.
Columns 3­5 present results for additional measures of labor productivity, including sales
per hour, sales per worker, and value added per worker (as opposed to the per hour
measure in the main text). Finally, columns 6 and 7 present results for the percent change
in the number of employees (not hours) and the number of production workers (as opposed
to their share).

Notes-- The sample consists of 55,390 firms, of which 598 are robot adopters. Panel A presents unweighted
estimates. Panel B presents estimates weighting each firm by its employment (in hours) in 2010. All
specifications control for baseline firm characteristics (log employment and log value added per worker
in 2010, and dummies for whether the firm belongs to a larger corporate group), 4-digit industry-fixed
effects for the main industry in which each firm operates, and fixed effects for the commuting zone that
houses each firm's largest establishment. The Appendix describes the construction of all variables used
as outcomes. Standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity and correlation within 4-digit industries are in
parentheses.


      As mentioned in the main text, the increase in labor productivity and TFP (in the
unweighted specification) are not driven by price increases among firms adopting robots,
but reflect changes in quantities (physical productivity). Table A.3 provides evidence in
support of this claim. The table uses the sample of exporters to estimate the association
between robot adoption and changes in export prices. We provide estimates using different
weighting schemes (unweghted, weighted by employment hours as in the main text, or
weighting by firm exports) and controlling for 2-digit or 4-digit industry dummies. The
sample now is much smaller, and the estimates are less precise. But overall, we find
uniformly negative point estimates, which suggest that firms that adopt robots reduce
prices from 1% to 5.7% (using the estimates with 4-digit industry fixed effects in columns
2 and 4).

Notes-- The sample consists of 6,614 firms for which we have data on export prices, of which 372 are
robot adopters. Panel A presents unweighted estimates. Panel B presents estimates weighting each firm
by its employment (in hours) in 2010. Panel C presents estimates weighting each firm by its exports in
2010. All specifications control for baseline firm characteristics (log employment and log value added per
worker in 2010, dummies for whether the firm belongs to a larger corporate group, the sales percentile of
the firm in its main 4-digit industry, the share of production workers, and the log of capital per worker),
and fixed effects for the commuting zone that houses each firm's largest establishment. Also, columns 1,
3, 5 control for 2-digit industry-fixed effects; whereas columns 2, 4, 6 control for 4-digit industry-fixed
effects. The Appendix describes the construction of all variables used as outcomes. Standard errors robust
to heteroskedasticity and correlation within 4-digit industries are in parentheses.


      Finally, Table A.4 shows that the findings in Table 1 in the text are robust to the
inclussion of additional covariates. Specifically, we control for dummies for firms in the
top 0.1%, top 1%, top 5%, top 10%, top 20% and top 40% of sales in each 4-digit industry
as well as log capital stock per worker and the share of production workers in 2010.

C. Market-Level Effects

In this section of the Appendix, we aggregate the estimates from Table 2 to obtain market-
level effects. Recall that the estimating equation for the models in Table 2 is

         ln   f   = o  Robotf + c  Adoption by competitorsf +   Xf + i(f ) + c(f ) + f .

       We now show that the contribution of robot adoption to overall employment can be
approximated (to the first order) as

                                      f                                  f                                                           yf   yf  
(A.1)          ln  o                       Robotf + c                         Robotf                      mf i              sf  i              ,
                              f                                 f                                     i              f  f             f    f 


where the sum is taken over all 4-digit industries and mf i is the share of firm f 's sales
that are in industry i, while sif  is the share of industry i's total sales accounted for by
firm f  . Under the additional assumption that firms have similar baseline labor shares,
this expression can be further simplified to

                                          f                                  f
(A.2)              ln  o                           Robotf + c                         Robotf                  mf i  (1 - sif ) .
                                  f                                  f                                    i


The numbers given in the main text are obtained from this equation.
       We now provide more details on how these numbers are obtained. With a first-order
approximation, the change in manufacturing employment can be expressed as

                                                                             f
                                                            ln                        ln      f.
                                                                     f


The contribution of robot adoption to aggregate employment is therefore:10

                    f                             f
                         ln   f   =                   o  Robotf + c  Adoption by competitorsf
              f                       f

                                                      f                                f
                                  =o                       Robotf + c                              mf i              sif   Robotf  .
                                              f                                  f            i               f  f


Changing the order of summation, the term multiplying c can be expressed as

                                                                                                      f
                                                      Robotf         sif                   mf  i          .
                                                  f              i               f  f

  10
     Note, however, that this computation ignores any general equilibrium effects from robot adoption that
can lead to an expansion or contraction of overall manufacturing employment. Such general equilibrium
effects cannot be identified with our methodology (or with other approaches based on cross-industry
comparisons). Consequently, the estimate of -1% below should be compared with industry-level estimates
of the impact of robot adoption on employment.




                                                                     A.6
Multiplying and dividing by                     f,   and then rearranging terms, we obtain

                                                 f                                                         f
                                                      Robotf                    sif            mf  i           .
                                        f                                  i            f  f               f


   Denoting the sales of firm f by yf and using the definitions of sif and mf  i , we can
write the previous expression as

                                                 f                              yf i    yf  i              f
                                                      Robotf                                                   .
                                        f                                  i    yi f  f yf                 f


Dividing and multiplying by yf , this is equivalent to

                                            f                              yf i   yf  i yf                      f
                                                 Robotf                                                                .
                                    f                              i       yf f  f yi yf                           f


Using the definition of sif  and mf i one more time and regrouping terms, we obtain

                                        f                                                             yf       yf  
                                             Robotf                        mf i              sf  i                  .
                                f                                  i                  f  f             f        f 


In the special case where firms have similar baseline labor productivity (or equivalently,
similar levels of baseline labor shares if wages are common across firms), we would also
       yf       yf 
have   f
            =         , and this can be further simplified to the simpler expression used in the main

Using the estimates from the weighted specification for o and c (reproduced in column
1 of Table A.6), we estimate aggregate declines in employment associated with robot
adoption in the range of 3.2%­4.1%. Alternatively, if we use the specification including
2-digit industry dummies instead of 4-digit industry dummies, the estimates in column 2
of Table A.6 imply somewhat smaller aggregate employment effects, of about -1.2%.




                                                                           A.7
D. Industry-Level Estimates

An alternative strategy to asses the aggregate implications of robot adoption is to exploit
only industry-level variation in robot adoption (and is thus different from the approach
used in the main text). In particular, we start by estimating an industry-level variant of
equation (1) in the main text:

(A.3)                           ln       i   = m  Robot adoptioni + i ,

where Robot adoptioni is the employment-weighted share for firms adopting robots in
industry i. We focus on industry employment (total hours among the firms in our sample
whose main industry is i) as the left-hand side variable, and as in the text, on estimates
weighted by industry employment, which are more informative about aggregate effects.
   Table A.5 shows that robot adoption is associated with a robust decline in employment
across industries. Columns 1and 2 present estimates of equation (A.3) for 240 4-digit
industries. Column 1 shows the unconditional relationship (without any covariates). The
estimate in this column suggests that a 20 percentage point increase in robot adoption in
an industry is associated with a 2.56% decline in industry employment. Column 2 controls
for 2-digit industry fixed effects and leads to somewhat smaller estimates. Now the same
20 percentage point increase in robot adoption is associated with a decline in industry
employment of 1.44%. Finally, columns 3 and 4 reproduce the same estimates but for 95
3-digit industries, and show that a 20 percentage point increase in robot adoption among
firms in an industry is associated with a decline in employment of 1.96%.

Notes--The sample consists of N = 55, 388 firms, of which 598 are robot adopters. All models weight
firms by their employment (in hours) in 2010. Columns 3­5 present estimates for the adoption of robots
by firms in the same 4-digit industry. Columns 6­8 present estimates for the adoption of robots by firms
in all the 3-digit industries in which a firm sells some of its products (weighted by share sales). The set
of industry-fixed effects used in each specification is indicated at the bottom rows. Additional covariates
in column 1­2, 5 and 8 include: baseline firm characteristics (log employment and log value added per
worker in 2010, as well as dummies for whether the firm is affiliated to a larger corporate group), and fixed
effects for the commuting zone that houses each firm's largest establishment. Standard errors robust to
heteroskedasticity and correlation within 4-digit (and 3-digit industries in columns 6­8) industries are in
parentheses.


spillover effects by estimating the following variant of equation (1) at the firm level:

(A.4)                  ln      if   = o  Robot adopterf + c  Robot adoptioni + if .

Here, c captures spillovers of robot adoption on other firms in the same industry. For this
particular specification of spillovers, the estimate of c + o corresponds to the industry-
level estimate of robots on employment, at least to a first-order approximation.
      Columns 3­8 in Table A.6 presents estimates of equation (A.4). Column 3 presents
estimates of (A.4) focusing on spillovers among firms in the same 4-digit industry and
without any additional covariate. The estimate in column 3 indicates that a 10 percentage
point increase in adoption is associated with a 1.17% decline in employment for firms that
do not adopt robots and a 0.35% increase in employment at firms that do. The net result
is a reduction in employment of 0.82% (s.e.=0.0078), which is similar to the industry-level
estimate in Table A.5. Column 4 adds a full set of 2-digit industry dummies as covariates
and column 5 further includes the firm-level covariates used in the main text, which lead
to more precise estimates of the spillover effect. Finally, columns 6­8 reproduce the same
estimates but focusing on spillovers among firms in the same 3-digit industries.

E. Decomposing Changes in the Labor Share

This section provides the details for the decomposition used in Figure 2. Following Autor
et al. (2019), we decompose changes in the labor share of industry i as

                           i = ¯ +                (f - ¯ )  (sv - s
(A.5)                           i                       i     if  ¯vi ),
                                              f


where i is the labor share in industry i, f is the labor share in firm f , sv  if is the
share of value added in industry i accounted for by firm f , and ¯ and sv
                                                                       ¯i correspond to
                                                                  i
unweighted averages of these terms among firms in the industry. The first term in the
above decomposition is what Autor et al. (2019) term the within component (which is
the unweighted mean change). The second term is a covariance term which accounts for
reallocation to firms with lower labor shares, reallocation to firms with declining labor
shares, and larger reductions of the labor share among larger firms. We use a balanced
panel of firms and ignore entry and exit.
    We can explore the contribution to changes in the aggregate labor share arising from
robot adoption as follows. Let Ri be the set of robot adopters in an industry and Ni be
the remaining set of firms. Also, denote the number of adopters by Ri , the number of
non-adopters by Ni , and the total number of firms in the industry by Fi . Finally, for a
set of firms, X , define the following unweighted averages

                     ¯ = 1                                           1
                      X            f                         ¯v
                                                             s X =             sv
                                                                                if .
                         X   f X                                     X   f X


    We can decompose the within-firm change component in equation (A.5) as:

                                   ¯ =    Ri ¯    Ni ¯
                                    i        Ri +    Ni .
                                          Fi      Fi

The first term accounts for the within-firm change in the labor share among adopters. The
second term accounts for the within-firm change in the labor share among non-adopters.
(Both of those are still unweighted following Autor et al., 2019).
    We next decompose the superstar effect in (A.5) as:

        (f - ¯ )  (sv - s
                        ¯i ) = Ri  (¯ - ¯ )  (s                  ¯    ¯
              i     if               Ri  i     Ri - s
                                              ¯v    ¯vi ) + Ni  (Ni - i )  (s
                                                                            ¯vNi - si)
                                                                                   ¯v
    f

                           +           (f - ¯ )  (sv - s                         ¯ )  (sv - s
                                             Ri    if  ¯vRi ) +             (f -  Ni    if  ¯vNi ).
                               f Ri                                  f Ni


The first line in the above equation captures how differences between adopters and non-
adopters contribute to changes in the covariance term. The second line captures the
residual changes in the covariance term that are unrelated to automation (for example, due


                                              A.10
to the changes in the allocation of economic activity within robot adopters and separately
within non-robot adopters).
   Finally, we can further decompose the contribution of robot adoption to the change in
the covariance term in three terms:

       ¯ - ¯ )  (s                  ¯    ¯                          Ri     ¯ -   ¯ )
  Ri  ( Ri  i     Ri - s
                 ¯v    ¯vi ) + Ni  (Ni - i )  (s
                                               ¯vNi - si ) = sRi -
                                                      ¯v                × ( Ri    Ni
                                                                    Fi
                                                             + (¯ -  ¯ ) × sR
                                                                 Ri    Ni      i

                                                             + (¯ - ¯ ) × sR ,
                                                                 Ri  Ni     i



where sRi denotes the share of value added accounted for by adopters. These terms capture
three potential mechanisms via which industrial automation can lower the covariance
between value added and labor shares across firms in an industry. The first term accounts
for the fact that robot adopters are larger to begin with. Because Autor et al.'s (2019)
within component is unweighted, the covariance between value added and the labor share
also includes the size difference between adopters and non-adopters. In particular, this
covariance declines as adopters automate and reduce their labor share relative to non-
adopters. The second term captures the possibility that adopters had a different labor
share to begin with. The third term captures the fact that adopters increase their share
of value added in their industry as they simultaneously experiencing a reduction in their
labor share.
   Figure 2 in the main text implements this decomposition using data from French man-
ufacturing firms for 2010­2015. We first obtain the components for each 4-digit industry,
and we then aggregate across industries using their average share of value added during
this period as weights.

F. A Model of Automation and Reallocation across Firms

This section presents a model that builds and extends on Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019b).
Our aim is to clarify the conditions under which robot adoption will be associated with
increases in own-firm employment but declines in aggregate employment.
      Consider an economy with a single industry consisting of multiple firms with imper-
fectly substitutable products. In particular, industry output is

                                                                   f yf

                                                            f                     

where yf is the output produced by firm f and  > 1 is the elasticity of substitution across
firms.

where f denotes the extent of automation at firm f . We think of improvements in
industrial automation technologies as generating an increase in f for the firms that adopt
it.

   Let w be the equilibrium wage and r the rate at which capital is rented to firms. To
ensure that automation technologies are adopted, we assume that for all firms we have

                                                     w
                                                ln     > 0.
                                                     r

This equation implies that producing automated tasks with industrial automation tech-
nologies is cheaper than producing it with labor. Hence, whenever it can, a firm will adopt
automation technologies and this would reduce its costs.

   Proposition A1: Suppose that f =  and technological improvement increase f for
firm f by df > 0.

obtain a system of equations in {d ln , d ln k, d ln w, d ln r, d ln y }. When f =  the system

Solving this system of equations yields the formula in equation (A.12) and establishes the
second part of the proposition.
   The third part follows from the fact that labor share in firm f  is simply f  , and thus
the labor share in firm f declines and there is no impact on the labor shares in other firms.
   The fourth part follows readily from equations (A.11) and (A.12). 
   The assumption that initially f =  is imposed for simplicity. If, for example, f


                                                      A.14
and df were positively correlated, then economic activity would be reallocated to firms
that start with the lower labor share and there would be a larger decline in aggregate
employment. As noted above, in French manufacturing, there is little baseline difference
in the labor shares of adopters and non-adopters, and thus the equations presented here,
where f and df are initially uncorrelated, appear to be a good approximation in this
context.
