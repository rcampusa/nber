This paper provides an empirical estimate of "price" and "risk" elasticities of demand for term
life insurance for those who purchase some insurance. It finds that the elasticity with respect to
changes in premiums is generally higher than the elasticity with respect to changes in risk. It also
finds that the elasticity, in the range of -0.3 to -0.5, is sufficiently low that adverse selection in
term life insurance is unlikely to lead to a death spiral and may not even lead to measured effects
of adverse selection on total purchases.

Introduction



To many economic theorists, adverse selection seems a pervasive characteristic of insurance

markets. This position seems eminently reasonable. Not only does it seem virtually certain that

insurance buyers will have some information on the probability or amount of loss that insurers

lack, but real world insurers seem obsessed by the thought that those who agree to buy from

them must know something to make that purchase an unusually good deal.



In the face of this theoretical and practitioner consensus, some recent high-quality empirical

economic work is finding the opposite: signs that, in both life and health insurance markets,

there is no detectable adverse selection (Cawley and Philipson 1999; Cardon and Hendel 2001).



While the authors of both articles interpret their results as evidence that, in some way, insurers

must have found out everything insureds know, such a scenario seems implausible on its face. In

both settings, the key risk is limited to an individual’s health state, and that state is notoriously

hard to measure objectively. Witness the skimpy results after enormous effort to measure the

quality of medical care by its outcome; external observers have a hard time knowing as much

about a person’s body as the person does.



However, even if buyers indeed know more than the sellers of insurance, serious adverse

selection would not occur if those buyers were sluggish in their willingness to respond to that

information. Real consumers, after all, have more on their minds than paying attention to small

bargains in insurance markets. In short, low demand responsiveness to risk and premium




                                                                                                        2
variation can also cause markets with truly asymmetric information to avoid the instability and

bias associated with adverse selection.



This responsiveness depends on two parameters: the response of insurance demanders to

changes in risk, given price (“risk elasticity”) and the response of insurance demanders to

changes in price, given risk (“price elasticity”). In the traditional Von Neumann-Morgenstern

theory of choice under risk, the responsiveness (measured by elasticity) to the two influences

should be approximately equal and large. The demand for insurance should primarily depend on

the relationship of premium to risk, usually summarized by the “loading” ratio. The word

“approximately” is included because the income effects of an increase in premium that changes

the ratio by a given amount are opposite to those of a reduction in risk that produced the same

effect.



In this paper we estimate price and risk demand elasticities for 1year annually renewable term

life insurance. We then use these estimates to indicate how a hypothetical (but realistic)

information asymmetry would affect this market. Obviously, if information is sufficiently

asymmetric, there can always be adverse selection even with very low price elasticity of demand,

as long as the elasticity is not zero. We therefore argue that, based on the range of plausible

assumptions about variation in risk, information asymmetry would have to be very pronounced

indeed for the insurance market to exhibit strong adverse selection effects; the likelihood of a

“death spiral” is even lower.




                                                                                                   3
Life Insurance Purchase and Adverse Selection



One difficulty with using observations of existing practices in the life insurance industry to judge

the chances of adverse selection is that those practices themselves are probably shaped by the

concern buyers and sellers have for selection. That is, both the market equilibrium that prevails

and the institutional structures that support it are potentially endogenous.



To be specific: the best-known economic models of insurance markets with adverse selection

assume that all insurers have costless and accurate information on the total quantity of insurance

each purchaser buys (Rothschild and Stiglitz 1976). Then the instrument insurance firms use to

induce lower risks to self-select is a so-called “price-quantity” policy, a combination of premium

and the amount of coverage. The institutional feature which permits insurers to have this kind of

information is the Coordination of Benefits provision that exists for health insurance and some

other types of insurance. These provisions in principle give any insurer the power to determine

the total amount of insurance a buyer has and/or to make payments of benefits dependent on

truthful prior information about the total amount.



Term life insurance, however, has no such provision. While life insurers will sometimes inquire

about how much coverage a prospective buyer already has, there is no mechanism for ensuring

truthful revelation and, more to the point, no evidence that the premium for additional coverage

is in any way affected by the amount of existing coverage. If insurers thought themselves to be

at substantial risk of adverse selection, they might price larger policies at higher unit costs.




                                                                                                    4
However, as Philipson and Cawley point out, the typical-firm-level pricing policy for term life

insurance exhibits quantity discounts: unit prices which decline with quantity.



Knowing the total amount of insurance a consumer has bought is important if there is moral

hazard as well as adverse selection. The absence of such provisions for term life is consistent

with the conclusion that moral hazard is small and that adverse selection is small. However, if

observation of the total amount of coverage is itself especially costly, then the main Cawley-

Philipson result—that premiums from a given firm fall with quantity from that firm—is not

sufficient to indicate there is no adverse selection. As noted below, the decline in premiums with

coverage could simply reflect the insurer’s administrative cost structure that includes a fixed cost

per customer; the approximately constant-over-quantity marginal premium is what one would

expect if customers could purchase from multiple sellers (so long as the fixed cost is moderate).

No insurer that tried to charge increasing premiums with quantity would be able to sell large

policies. Moreover, insurers do increase their medical information requirements for applicants

for applicants who apply for policies which are large relative to their “needs;” this may be a

defense against adverse selection. In a similar vein, both non-economic and economic (Gokhale

and Kotlikoff 2002) planning models for life insurance purchase do not advise potential buyers

to adjust their life insurance purchases if they face premiums which vary relative to mortality

risk; instead people are advised to buy the insurance their dependents will “need” to replace lost

income and maintain a level of consumption, regardless of the level of the premium or the

person’s risk. That is, buyers are not advised to engage in adverse selection, even when it would

be to their private advantage to do so.




                                                                                                     5
An Informal Model of Adverse Selection When Insurance Quantity Is Unknown



We want to model insurance markets with potential adverse selection when insurance firms do

not know the total quantity a given individual purchases.



Let us therefore assume that insurers do not know the total (face) amount of life insurance any

individual has purchased. Next, let us assume that the annual premium P an insurer would

charge for x units of coverage purchased from the firm takes the form



(1) P=c+bx



where c is a fixed component of total firm revenue per policy sold, and b is a (constant) marginal

price per unit of coverage. There is a fixed component to the premium because there is a fixed

component to the administrative cost; the cost of some of the administrative functions (like

processing an application for coverage) does not vary with the amount of coverage purchased.

The key assumption here is that b (and c, for that matter) depends only on the firm’s value of x,

not on the total x the person buys from all sources. Of course, once the marginal price is

independent of x at any firm, then there is no strong incentive to the buyer to buy from more than

one firm.



Assume also that, initially, all buyers have the same level of risk, that they know the level of risk,

and that they choose the amount of insurance to buy by maximizing a risk averse utility function,

given the premium schedule (1).




                                                                                                    6
What would then be the expected effect of private information for some or all buyers that

indicates a change in loss probability from its initial (average) level? If the premium schedule is

unchanged, those who discover that they are high risks will optimally buy more coverage, and

those who discover that they are lower risks will cut back. How much either type of buyer will

change depends on the risk elasticity of demand for insurance.



As a result, the initial premium will no longer cover the firm’s benefit costs and administrative

expenses. As the insurer raises the marginal premium in the next period to cover the additional

benefit costs incurred (now more heavily weighted by the higher risks and less heavily weighted

by lower risks), all risks will reduce coverage as long as the price elasticity of demand is not

zero.



If the price elasticity of demand is uniform, regardless of risk, this reduction in coverage will

take the form of an equi-proportional reduction, across all risk classes. Then the process will

achieve a new equilibrium at these smaller quantities. There will be no cycle. This result differs

from the Rothschild-Stiglitz case. No “death spiral” will have occurred. To produce a death

spiral, one would have to assume that the price elasticity of demand is less elastic for higher

risks than for lower risks.



However, the net reduction in coverage from the initial no-information-asymmetry case provides

a measure of the inefficiency associated with adverse selection. If the reduction in coverage is

relatively small in response to a price change, we can say that adverse selection is small.




                                                                                                    7
Toward Empirical Analysis



Somewhat surprisingly, while there have been many studies of the “determinants” of life

insurance decisions, there have been few microeconomic studies of the effect of premiums or

price on the demand for term life insurance.3 Such an analysis would be more complex than the

typical demand elasticity estimation for several reasons.



First, the total premium for a policy obviously depends on the amount of coverage purchased: it

represents total expenditure, or average price multiplied by quantity. However as noted,

premiums are not linear in coverage, so that the premium per dollar of coverage is not uniform

over the amount of coverage. Because the “fixed price” term c is positive, the average premium

usually falls as coverage grows; the marginal premium may or may not be constant.



There is a literature on behavior and empirical analysis of demand in situations where consumers

face nonlinear price schedules (Hausman 1985; Hausman and Wise 1980; Nordin 1976). The

behavioral models are consistent with our earlier summary; the quantity demanded is determined

by responding to the substitution effects from the marginal price and to the income effects

associated with the fixed price component.



Second, life insurance is typically sold in national markets, so that there is no obvious or

identifiable source of substantial cross-sectional variation in marginal prices. However,




                                                                                                  8
premiums do appear to vary across firms for what seems to be similar coverage. Premiums

change over time, but much of this change is a response to changes in (perceived) mortality rates.

The demand for insurance should depend not on the premium per se but on persons’ (perceived)

mortality rate relative to the premium. The primary source of price variation would then be

variation in premiums not matched by variations in (perceived) risk. Demand might also change

if premiums and mortality rates experience equal proportional changes, because of lifetime

income or wealth effects.



Brown and Goolsbee (2002) have argued that the spread of the Internet lowered markups on

average term insurance premiums, especially for younger buyers.4 There may be some eventual

hope of finding time series variation in marginal premiums, if either profitability or

administrative costs change, but the detailed data on risk-adjusted premiums at the individual

level has yet to become available.



The price elasticity of demand for term life insurance is of more than casual interest. Its value

determines how total insurer revenues would be expected to respond to price changes. For

instance, if demand was greater than unit elastic, the price reduction found by Brown and

Goolsbee would be associated with an increase in insurer revenues. But those revenues would

fall if demand (in the neighborhood of the current price) was relatively inelastic. More relevant

  Babbel (1985) provides a time series study of the relationship between market-level price and the total amount of
life insurance demanded in the United States. Eisenhauer and Halek (1999) estimate a model of demand for term
life which includes a “loading” variable, but they do not interpret it as the price.
4
  The subsequent increase in rates following insurance regulators’ allegations of under-reserving has not been
investigated. Presumably under-reserving was most severe for the types of people who use the Internet. It may be
good for price but not for quality. If both change, the amount demanded could rise or fall depending on relative
magnitudes.


                                                                                                                      9
for our purposes, the value of price elasticity determines how much information asymmetry will

matter.



A behavioral issue is whether an individual’s demand for insurance depends only on the ratio of

premiums to expected benefits, the traditional “loading percentage”, which in turn implies that

the demand elasticity with respect to premium, given risk, should equal the demand elasticity

with respect to risk, given premium. This percentage plays the role of price in insurance theory

(Ehrlich and Becker 1972), but actual behavior might be different. For example, if doubling

premiums (controlling for risk) has an effect on the amounts and types of insurance demanded,

would we expect to observe the same or a similar effect if the mortality rate halved, holding the

premium constant? Both changes display the same change in the ratio of premiums to benefits.



Another issue, which will be important for our empirical work, deals with consumer information.

The premium a person pays is presumably known by that person; the premiums charged by other

sellers may, however, only be known imperfectly. An even more serious question concerns

consumer perceptions of risk. The right risk measure to use in the behavioral equation is what

the consumer perceives to be the risk of death. However, we only have information on the

mortality rates calculated ex post, which might or might not be known to the consumer. Take the

case of a buyer who is a smoker. The buyer knows that the premium he would have to pay is

higher than if he were a non-smoker, but what would he assume about death probability? Would

he assume the same death probability as low risks, as the average risk, as the average risk for all

smokers (regardless of the volume of smoking), or as the observed death rate for smokers

smoking a certain number of cigarettes? Or would he use the difference in premiums as a




                                                                                                  10
measure of the difference in risk (Kunreuther and Pauly, 2003). In our analysis we will explore

the effect of using a number of measures of relative risk..



Demand Estimation in the Presence of Quantity Discounts



If adverse selection were a serious problem in life insurance markets, if insurers could observe

the total quantity of life insurance purchased at the individual level, and if the administrative cost

per unit of insurance were constant over units, conventional microeconomic theory would predict

that in a competitive equilibrium (if it exists) unit prices would be increasing in the face amount

of coverage (Rothschild and Stiglitz 1976). However, empirical evidence from the life insurance

market suggests that the unit premium for term insurance declines as the face amount of

coverage increases (Cawley and Philipson 1999); these discounts exist both because average

administrative and selling costs fall as a buyer purchases a larger policy, and because sellers of

insurance are unable to observe the total amount of insurance bought from all sellers. Of course,

with average costs falling with quantity, adverse selection would be consistent with unit

premiums that decline with quantity as long as the decline is less steep than that of costs.



One key question is whether the alleged failure of life insurers to pay attention to insurance

purchased from other sellers is due to a high cost of monitoring insurance quantity or whether it

is due to the fact that there is so little information asymmetry about actual risk that knowledge of

the total quantity would not be helpful. The answer is probably some of both. Compared to

health insurance, say, or even property-casualty insurance, there is no observable benchmark of

loss or cost to which life insurance quantities could be compared. Someone who bought health




                                                                                                   11
insurance that paid out more than his medical bills, or homeowners insurance that paid more than

the damage done by a fire would be an obvious candidate as someone with inside knowledge

about risk (not to mention strong incentives for moral hazard before the fact). But there is no

objective loss measure associated with premature mortality, and so more difficulty in identifying

the high risk by noting “excess” insurance purchases. However, it is also true (according to

Cawley and Philipson) that the simple correlation between the amount of insurance purchased

and (actual) mortality is inverse, perhaps reflecting other influences on the demand for life

insurance that are inversely correlated with mortality (such as income) but also perhaps

indicating that buyers do not know more than sellers. Moreover, life insurers do sometimes have

stricter underwriting standards for people applying for large amounts of term life insurance;

variation in standards with quantity might substitute for variation in unit premiums with quantity.



Due to the presence of quantity discounts, each consumer in the life insurance market faces a

downward sloping rather than horizontal supply curve (Cawley and Philipson 1999) at what

might be called the “intensive” margin. In this situation, the observed unit or average price and

quantity are simultaneously determined by the consumer’s demand. This phenomenon adds to

the challenge to estimating the price elasticity of demand for term life insurance using consumer-

level microeconomic data.



In order to generate an unbiased measure of price elasticity, the price used should be exogenous

to the consumer demand framework. There are two reasons why observed prices will not be

exogenous. First, estimating the consumer demand equation using an ex-post unit price paid

(calculated from purchase data) will obviously yield a biased price elasticity estimate due to the




                                                                                                  12
endogeneity of price in the consumer demand system. However, if the actual price schedules

that individuals with a given set of risk characteristics face in the market vary exogenously in a

way that can be observed by the econometrician (from offered price schedules), then the

marginal price for each risk group can be obtained either directly from the tariff data or by

estimating an industry-level pricing equation using firm-level offered premiums as the dependent

variable in the regression.5 But if price schedules do not vary much across observations (because

all buyers are purchasing in the same competitive market), or if the prices people find are

correlated with demand (for example, because people with stronger demands search more

extensively for low prices), elasticity estimates will still be potentially biased. The best solution

would be to find exogenous price measures that vary across risk groups. (This is the strategy we

follow below.) Alternatively an instrumental variables approach could be used to control for the

endogeneity of ex-post prices in the consumer demand equation. Good price instruments,

however, are hard to find.



The presence of bulk discounts in the life insurance market introduces non-convexities into the

consumer’s budget constraint. This creates the possibility that there will be multiple tangencies

between the consumer’s indifference curves and budget constraint set (Taylor 1975; Hausman

1985). In order to uniquely identify parameters in the consumer demand function, two price

variables should be included in the demand equation: the marginal price, which captures the

price effect on quantity demanded given that a positive quantity of insurance is purchased; and

the “fixed cost” to the consumer of the opportunity to purchase insurance beyond the minimum

5
  It is reasonable to assume that term insurance premiums in the United States are set in a national market, and that
there is one industry supply curve (Brown and Goolsbee 2002). The group specific marginal price for term
insurance is equal to the regression coefficient on the face amount of coverage in a linear pricing equation with a
constant term, and is by definition exogenous to the consumer demand system. We ignore possible simultaneity



                                                                                                                    13
quantity at a given marginal price (Nordin 1976). The impact of this fixed cost on the size of

policy demanded should primarily be that of an income effect, but it may also serve as indicator

of self-selection into the sample of buyers. That is, people who buy insurance only at a low fixed

price may have lower demands for insurance (on average) than those still willing to buy some

insurance even though the fixed price is high. In principle, then, the coefficient on the fixed cost

could be positive, suggesting a censoring of observations, or negative, suggesting income effects

in quantity demanded.



Price Measure



There are econometric and theoretical justifications for using exogenous measures of marginal

price in order to capture how consumers change coverage when the prevailing premiums change.

If one wants to recover the parameters in the consumer demand system, it is necessary to control

for the two-part pricing of term insurance contracts. We control for the fixed cost to the

consumer of being able to purchase life insurance at the offered marginal premium by including

the fixed cost in the demand equation (see Taylor 1975; Dubin 1985). As noted above, any

effect of the fixed cost will capture the “income effect” on purchasing (for those who demand

positive amounts of insurance), while the marginal price measure captures the “price effect” on

term insurance demand (Dubin 1985).



Secondly, if a competitive insurer’s expected payouts rise because the probability of survival

falls, its premiums will also rise. However, almost all of this increase should affect the marginal


between premium and quantity in the pricing equation, which would arise if insurers set premiums to induce a given
level of demand.


                                                                                                               14
price rather than the fixed price, since variations in the mortality rate should not affect the fixed

costs of selling insurance. We assume that this property holds both for changes in survival

probability, given age, over different years and for changes in survival probability for individuals

of different ages at a given point in time. In short, the elasticity parameter that we care about in a

life insurance market is the elasticity of demand with respect to the marginal premium rather

than the total or average premium.



The other characteristic of a price measure is that it should vary to some extent across otherwise

identical buyers. The problem here is that term life insurance at any point in time is generally

sold in a national market. While posted or quoted prices may vary across firms, there is no

obvious reason why buyers with the same set of risk characteristics cannot all have access to the

same set of prices, and would therefore all choose the same (lowest) price. If they do not do so,

we do not know why.



The absence of a clear source of exogenous variation in prices is an issue in generating unbiased

estimates of price elasticity. For example, suppose one plausibly assumes that a demander who

would buy more insurance at a given (marginal) price would search more intensively for a low

price than a person with a smaller demand. On average, those with stronger demands will then

be paying lower prices, but the price measure will be inversely correlated with unobserved terms

in the demand equation. More generally, in the empirical estimates which follow, we pay

attention to possible exogenous causes for variation in prices. We try to find “market-level”

price measures as well as “individual-level” measures.




                                                                                                    15
Data Sources



We do not know exactly which prices consumers were facing and which risk measures they were

using to guide their insurance purchasing decisions. Accordingly we experiment with a variety

of specifications using different measures of each.



We use two industry data sources to estimate the price elasticity of demand for term insurance.

The first is a monthly dataset sold by CompuLife that contains firm-level premium data for term

life insurance contracts of 17 different sizes from all major companies in the US market in every

state. The CompuLife datasets are used by life insurance agents to compare premium offerings

across companies, and are generally thought to contain accurate premium information. In the

CompuLife datasets, premium offerings are broken down by the risk characteristics of the

insured persons, including their age, sex, smoking status and health status.



The presence of multiple insurers raises the questions of what quantity premium schedule to use.

Should it be that of a single “typical” insurer, or should it be a composite of those of all insurers

offering contracts to a given risk group? A buyer who selects a firm making the best offer for

one quantity of insurance is not obliged to use that firm for other quantities. Also, not all

insurers offer contracts of all sizes to a given risk group, so buying from the same firm may not

be an option.



We use two alternative estimates of “market” price schedules to test the robustness of our

estimates. In one, we use the premium of the median firm in each demographic cell-quality




                                                                                                   16
combination. In the other, we use, as data for the premium regression, the premiums posted by

all firms weighted by the number of offers in a given policy size category. These weights, which

sum to 1 for each policy size, are necessary because the number of offers vary significantly

across the 17 different policy sizes in the CompuLife dataset.



We first use the January 1997 CompuLife dataset to estimate term insurance pricing regressions

for 1-year level term contracts for the median firm in the market as of January 1997 for each risk

class separately. We use two statistical methods to estimate a linear pricing equation for the term

insurance industry. Insurance premiums vary across states, but only to a very modest extent.

We therefore look at premiums offered by the median firm in the largest state (California) to 30,

40, 50 & 60 year olds for all 48 possible combinations of the sex, smoking and health status

categories. We interpolate the estimated marginal prices and fixed costs by single year of age for

all the relevant risk groups to reflect the pricing gradient by age controlling for all other risk

factors. There are 48 separate pricing regressions, each with 17 different values for the quantity

of coverage. We then use the average and marginal prices estimates from these regressions as

explanatory variables to explain the variations in the amounts of coverage purchased by

consumers in another data set, from LIMRA International. The second specification for the

pricing regression makes use of premium offerings from all firms (weighted by the number of

policy size offers in a given contract size class) in the California market to estimate a similar

pricing equation which is used in a similar way.6 Using the marginal price and fixed cost

estimates from the two general techniques described above, we therefore estimated demand

6
  We considered estimating the pricing equation with firm-level fixed effects. However, that technique would be
relevant only if consumers typically chose a firm in advance and considered only its price schedule for different
amounts of coverage. However, it is surely possible that a firm with the lowest price for, say, $50,000 of coverage




                                                                                                                 17
regressions using (as the “exogenous” premium) the estimated marginal premium per $1000

coverage. This “market” premium varies across risk groups, not individuals, and is independent

of the quantity of term insurance purchased, thereby reducing concerns about endogeneity bias.



To explore the effect of possible variation in premiums across persons, we used a second type of

measure: a person-specific marginal premium. This measure of premium is constructed from the

premium reported in the same LIMRA data used for the total quantity of coverage purchased.

We estimate a person-specific marginal premium by subtracting the class-average fixed cost

from the CompuLife pricing regressions from the annual premium the person paid for the life

insurance contract, and then dividing that number by the quantity of coverage purchased. Exactly

why different individuals would pay different premiums for the same coverage is unclear; it

might be related to consumer search behavior. If so, the price paid is to some extent endogenous,

so these results should be interpreted with caution; we should expect these measured elasticities

to be higher in absolute value than in the first case. We also use another person-specific

premium: the ratio of annual premium paid (for the quantity purchased) divided by the predicted

premium based on the person’s fixed cost and marginal price coefficients from the CompuLife

pricing regressions.



Consumer-level data on the quantity of new term life insurance purchased is taken from the 1997

US Buyer’s Study sold by LIMRA International. The 1997 LIMRA Buyer’s study consists of a

random sample of policies bought by customers in a given year by over 35 life insurance

companies comprising approximately half of the life insurance market in terms of number of


might not be the lowest price if the person wanted to buy $500,000 of coverage. Thus, the within-firm marginal
price would not represent the price schedule a consumer faces.


                                                                                                                 18
policies sold (LIMRA 1998). We analyze data from the 1997 LIMRA Buyer’s study since it is

the most recent dataset available for purchase. The term life insurance market has undergone

significant changes in market structure during the 1990s associated with market entry and the

introduction of on-line search engines for term insurance (Brown and Goolsbee 2002). Because

the increase in market competition in the 1990s may have caused a structural change in the price

elasticity parameter, we focus our analysis on the most recent year available.7



The LIMRA data also contains information on the attributes of the life insurance contracts sold

and the basic demographic characteristics of the buyers. The data include information on the

amount of coverage purchased, the annual premiums paid, the amount of existing life insurance

coverage in force, the term lengths of the contracts, riders attached to the policies, the annual

premium, the month and year of purchase, and basic demographic information on insured

persons, including: age, sex, income, occupation, marital status, and receipt of a non-smoking

discount. Individual company identifiers were masked. Weights are provided to make the

sample representative of the policies sold at the contributing firm level.



Some of the key factors that are known to influence life insurance demand (but usually not

premiums)—like self-evaluated current health status, number of children, income and wealth—

are either completely missing, or are not available for a large number of observations in the

LIMRA data. (For example, even family income data is missing for about a third of the

observations.) We report regression results using the large LIMRA sample in which individual

observations are augmented by median household income by zip code from the 1990 US Census.

7
 In separate analyses not reported here we estimate the price elasticity of demand for term insurance using the 1993
and 1995 LIMRA Buyer’s datasets, and find that there has been an increase in the price elasticity of demand during



                                                                                                                 19
Although additional socio-demographic controls are available at the zip code level from the 1990

census, we do not include these controls due to concerns about measurement error.



While using Maximum Likelihood estimation with an error components error structure will

enable us to control from biases arising from sample truncation inherent to using purchase data

to model consumer demand, we are nevertheless without information on what determines

whether someone buys any life insurance, and, specifically, on the effect of price on this choice.



Mortality Risk



The mortality risk measure used in the demand regressions is the national average annual

probability of dying during the period of coverage for all individuals with a given set of age, sex,

health status, and (in some cases) smoking characteristics. This measure was calculated using

mortality data from the 1997 U.S. Life Tables published by the National Center for Health

Statistics (see Anderson 1999, and National Center for Health Statistics 1997 & 1998). Sex-age-

specific mortality data on the number of survivors at various years of age in 1997 were used to

estimate the percent of people that will die during the period of term life insurance coverage

based on the age of the insured person at the beginning and end of term insurance coverage. The

mortality risk variable included in the regressions is the natural log of this annual mortality risk

estimate, which varies across individuals. Using data on the relative risk of dying (over a one-

year period) between smokers and non-smokers across various age intervals published in Rogers

and Powell-Griner (1991), and data on smoking prevalence by age group from the Centers for



the decade of the 1990s (LIMRA 1996; LIMRA 1994).


                                                                                                   20
Disease Control and Prevention (1998), we adjust the mortality risk for smoking status.8 The

smoking status adjustments were necessarily imperfect, so we show results with and without this

imperfect adjustment.



CompuLife Pricing Regressions



We use the CompuLife dataset to estimate industry-level pricing regressions for 1-year annually

renewable level term contracts for the median firm in the market as of January 1997. We first

define risk groups based on the age, sex, smoking and health status of the buyers. Companies

with all ratings are used in the analyses. In 1997, the CompuLife data require that we view

premium and contract offerings by state. Based on conversations with life insurers, we assume

that median premiums are unlikely to vary significantly across states (with the exception of New

York, where state withholding regulations affect premiums).9 We also expect variation in the

degree of market competition—and hence premiums—to be minimal across states (Brown and

Goolsbee 2002).



We limit our sample to 1-year annually renewable term contracts priced for 30, 40, 50, and 60-

year old males and females for all possible combinations of the smoking and health status

categories. Separate pricing regressions are estimated for each risk group. We priced contracts

8
  The adjustment assumes that the relative death risk between smokers and non-smokers is equal to the 1 year
relative death risk published in Rogers and Powell-Griner (1991). In order to obtain the 1 year death risk measure
for smokers, we use a weighted average of the light and heavy smoker death rates published in Rogers and Powell-
Griner (1991). We assume that for all age groups 83 percent of smokers are light smokers and 17 percent of
smokers are heavy smokers (American Lung Association, 2002). The adjustment may introduce measurement error
into the smoking-adjusted mortality estimate since the adjustment for smoking requires that we use smoking
prevalence estimates that are aggregated by 5-year age intervals and approximations for the distribution of light and
heavy smokers in the smoking population. The key question, of course, is what different buyers perceive to be their
risk.



                                                                                                                  21
for 17 different policy sizes among firms offering life insurance contracts in California in 1997.10

The premium regression equation estimated is then:



(2)     Offered Premium=aj+PjQ +ε



where Q is the term insurance face amount for individuals in risk group j in January 1997. Then

aj is the estimated fixed cost for each risk class and Pj is the estimated marginal price. As

mentioned above, we estimate pricing equation (2) using two different sample—premium

offerings from the median firm in the market (Tables 1a and 1b), and premium offerings from all

firms in the market pooled and weighted (Tables 2a and 2b). We then interpolate fixed costs and

marginal premiums by single year of age to more accurately reflect the age pricing gradient for

each risk group.



Separate pricing regressions are estimated for each risk group. Tables 1a and 1b show the

estimated marginal premiums from the different pricing specifications we tried using the

CompuLife data.11 The pricing equation approximates the actual tariff schedule that individuals

of a given risk class face in the market for the “median” firm in the market. The R2 for most of

these pricing regressions is close to unity, which indicates that a linear pricing schedule above a

fixed cost fits the data well. Table 1b shows marginal premium estimates when we include all

premium offerings in the market.

   We price level term insurance policies for the following face amounts: $50 K, $100 K, $150 K, $200 K, $250 K,
$300 K, $350 K, $400 K, $500 K, $750 K, $1 million, $2 million, $3 million, $5 million, $10 million. $15 million &
$25 million.

   The marginal price estimates are the regression estimates multiplied by 1,000, or the marginal price per $1,000 of
coverage.


                                                                                                                 22
Estimated marginal prices always decline with improved health status holding other risk factors

constant. Marginal prices at any age are higher for males than for females, as well as for

smokers than for non-smokers. Marginal prices also increase with age holding all other risk

factors constant. There is not a large difference between the “preferred” and “preferred-plus”

health categories. We tested whether marginal prices varied over units, and could not reject the

hypothesis of constancy.12



Tables 2a and 2b show the estimated fixed cost (or the “average premium” component of the

premium per policy) for all risk groups using the two different specifications for the CompuLife

life insurance pricing equation. These fixed cost estimates are the intercept terms of the

estimated Compulife regression equations and are used to calculate the value of the marginal

premium that varies across individuals rather than risk groups after interpolating for single year

of age. Differences in the estimated intercept term across groups reflects differences in costs

(associated with medical underwriting, etc.) inherent to selling any coverage to individuals in a

given risk category. These estimates are generally in the range of $40-$70 per contract. (By

way of illustration, a fixed component of $70 would amount to 31% of the annual premium for

$100 thousand of coverage for a non-smoking 40-year-old male.) The estimates for ages 50 and

60 vary a great deal, but relatively few new term policies are sold at this age. (A negative fixed

price would, however, imply the existence of adverse selection).



Estimation of Demand Elasticities




                                                                                                  23
We focus our analysis on the purchase of 1-year annually renewable level term contracts, or the

“spot market” for term insurance in 1997.



Econometric Methodology



The LIMRA Buyer’s data is not a random sample. Rather sample selection occurs on the basis

of whether or not a contract is purchased. Accordingly, a truncated regression model is used to

estimate the price elasticity of demand.



The smallest contract size sold in 1997 is $2,500. We do not observe the purchase of any life

insurance contracts with a face amount less than $2,500 because smaller life insurance policies

are not sold by insurers. Data on non-purchasers for whom Qi=$0 is not observed. Hence the

selection equation for the LIMRA data, which defines the subset of the population included in

the sample, is:



(3) Si=1[$2,500 < Qi < ∞]



where Si=1 if individual i is included in the sample, and Si=0 when individual i is excluded from

the sample.




12
   Cawley and Philipson (1999) also report that conversations with life insurers suggest that insurers rely upon a
linear rather than non-linear incremental pricing schedule to price term insurance contracts, and their own regression
results from this data show insignificant quadratic terms.


                                                                                                                  24
The selection rule allows us to characterize the subset of the population excluded from the

LIMRA sample. Although we cannot use the price elasticity coefficients based on a sample of

life insurance purchasers to infer the price elasticity of non-purchasers, the price elasticity of

demand conditional on having decided to purchase a life insurance contract is still of interest

because it measures the price sensitivity of purchases on the intensive margin.



In order to obtain consistent and efficient estimates of the parameters in the conditional

consumer demand equation will need to specify the conditional distribution of Qi given Xi and Si

and use maximum likelihood estimation. We assume that the conditional distribution is normal

with mean Xβ and variance σ2, where X is a matrix of control variables that enter the consumer

demand equation. The relevant estimation technique is the truncated normal regression model

that can be carried out in SAS.



Sample Definition



We limit the sample to include adults who bought level term contracts with no rider or a level

term rider on their own lives. We exclude contracts that are part of an employee benefit plan,

that are not owned by the insured person, or that contain missing data on the smoking status of

the insured. We exclude military sales and sales by home service companies.



Price Measures




                                                                                                     25
We report regression results using three price definitions. The first price definition uses the

estimated CompuLife marginal price for the person’s risk group interpolated for single year of

age as the exogenous price measure in the consumer demand equation. This price is the fitted

coefficient Pj from equation (1) for individuals that belong to risk group j. Implicitly, the

assumption is that this “average marginal” price for the person’s risk group is independent of the

other terms (“tastes”) in that individual’s demand function. The LIMRA data do not contain

information the health characteristics of the buyers even though life insurers are known to

condition their premium offerings on health status indicators. We therefore use the mid-point

between the CompuLife regular and preferred-plus marginal and average prices for each risk

group as the relevant price measure for individuals in the LIMRA sample. We assume that the

insurer does know smoking status of the insured.



The regression also controls for the (observed) mortality rate in the person’s risk group. Thus,

over all observations, it is presumably variation in the relationship between marginal prices and

risk across risk cells that generate variation in the net cost of insurance. For example, if two cells

have the same mortality rate, but different marginal premiums, we would expect to see different

amounts of insurance demanded. The Brown-Goolsbee results on the effect of the Internet

would suggest, for example, that this price measure should be lower for Web-using younger

people.



The second price definition uses an individual-level marginal premium as the exogenous price

measure. We calculate the person specific marginal price by using the average price estimate by

risk group (interpolated by single year of age) from the CompuLife pricing regressions, and data




                                                                                                   26
on total premium paid and face amount of life insurance coverage purchased from the LIMRA

datasets. The relevant equation is:



(4) [Premiumi-aj]/Qi=P*i



where aj is the estimated constant term in the CompuLife pricing regression for risk group j (see

equation 2). Unlike the CompuLife marginal prices, Pi* varies across individuals.



The third price definition uses a relative premium measure which varies across individuals. This

relative premium measure is the ratio of total premium paid divided by predicted CompuLife

premium. The predicted Compulife premium for each individual is:



(5) Predicted Premiumi=aj+Pj*Qi



where aj and Pj are the estimated coefficients from the CompuLife pricing equation (2)

interpolated by single year of age. We include the log of the ratio of the annual premium paid to

the predicted premium based on the CompuLife coefficient estimates as exogenous price variable

in the relative premium specification.13



Regression Specification




13
  A fourth price expression would estimate the marginal price direct from the LIMRA data. The problem here is
that the price paid is endogenous in the consumer demand system. Preliminary estimates of demand equations based
on such a measure gave implausible positive price elasticities.


                                                                                                             27
We assume that the consumer demand equation for term life insurance has the following general

form:



(6) Qi=C PβFCiψRiγZiδexp(εi)



where Qi is the face amount of term life insurance purchased, C is a constant term, P is one of the

marginal premium measures, FCi is the estimated fixed cost, Ri is the individual mortality risk

variable, and Zi are demographic controls that affect life insurance demand, including income,

age, sex and marital status. The regression equation has a log-linear form, since some of the

controls included in the Zi matrix are binary variables.



Taking logs, we estimate the following empirical demand equation using Maximum Likelihood:



(7) lnQi=φ+βlnP+ψlnFCi+γlnRi +δZi + εi



where the marginal price measure (P) is the CompuLife marginal price (Pj), the person-specific

marginal price (Pi*), or a relative price, which is the annual premium paid divided by the

predicted premium given the quantity purchased and using the fixed and marginal price

coefficients from the CompuLife regression to predict the premium. The dependent variable is

the log of the total coverage purchased.



Results




                                                                                                  28
Tables 3 and 4 show the estimated demand regressions using the marginal premiums calculated

from the CompuLife data for the median-premium insurer in each cell. In both cases the

estimated price elasticity is approximately -0.5; the estimated risk elasticity has a positive and

statistically significant elasticity in the range from 0.16 to 0.29. The fixed cost component of the

premium is positive but not statistically significant. Other significant variables include median

income by zipcode, with an expected positive sign, female sex with an expected negative sign,

and significantly higher demand in New England relative to the Midwest. The quarterly

dummies are not statistically significant, which suggests that life insurance demand is not

seasonal.



Table 5 shows the price and risk elasticities for several other different specifications of the price

variable and of the data set used to estimate the price variable. The estimated values of the price

elasticities vary little; price elasticity generally varies between -0.41 and -0.58. The risk

elasticities tend to be higher when the all-firm estimate of marginal price is used; in some

specifications they are also in the neighborhood of 0.5. When the relative premium is used as a

measure of price, the smoking-adjusted risk elasticity is either statistically insignificant or

negative in sign. In the majority of cases, however, the risk elasticity has a point estimate which

is positive but is lower (in absolute value) than that of the premium “price” elasticity. The

elasticities tend to be approximately the same in the market-price and individual-price

specification, suggesting no endogeneity bias.



An analysis of the goodness-of-fit statistics suggests that the fit is better when risk is adjusted for

smoking for the specifications using the CompuLife or individual marginal premia. When the




                                                                                                     29
relative premium is used, the fit is worse with smoking adjusted risk. However, the relative

premium measure itself does not provide as good a fit as do the other two price measures. In

addition, the relative premium measure is likely to be partly endogenous because it is calculated

from the actual premium paid.



To sum up: the price (or marginal) premium elasticity of demand is estimated to be in the range

of -0.31 to -0.58; this finding is robust with regard to measures of marginal price in the demand

system. The elasticity of coverage with respect to mortality risk is generally positive and

statistically significant, but ranges in value from 0.2 to 0.5. The coefficient on mortality risk is

usually smaller than the coefficient on marginal premium, suggesting that proportional loading

does not entirely determine quantity demanded. These results indicate that people do pay

attention to premiums they face and their own risk of needing benefits; the “needs” model

favored by insurance advisors is strongly rejected. However, although people do respond to

premiums and expected benefits, their response is relatively modest in magnitude.



Conclusion



These results suggest that the elasticity of demand for 1-year level term life insurance contracts

is about -0.4 to -0.5. It is more price sensitive than the insurance “needs” models would assume,

but is still only moderately responsive. Demand is usually less sensitive to risk than to premiums

although the risk term is usually positive and statistically significant.




                                                                                                   30
If there is asymmetric information, the interpretation of this result depends on the extent and

importance of that information. If the portion of the population receiving information about

large differences in death risk probabilities is substantial, adverse selection can occur even with a

low price elasticity. However, these results are consistent with the view that life insurance

markets can remain reasonably stable even with information asymmetry on individual mortality

risk (when the variation in information is also modest, insurers are unable to observe the total

amount of insurance purchased).



Another finding is even more important for the model (but somewhat less reliable in the

empirical estimation method). For the process of adverse selection even to begin as a result of

information asymmetry, consumers must start the process by choosing substantially different

amounts of insurance when their perceived risks are altered by information. The usually lower

risk elasticity implies that the first step in the process, a response in terms of desired insurance

quantity to changes in risk with premiums held constant, may be small.



Our results suggest that life insurance purchasers engage in behavior (or, more accurately, non-

behavior) which greatly mitigates the effect of asymmetric information about individual risk

between insured and insurer in term life insurance markets. It would, of course, still be possible

for asymmetric information that secretly and substantially changed loss probabilities for a large

portion of the population to cause adverse selection. But as long as any substantial information

asymmetry is concentrated in a small population share, and as long as any large group’s

information asymmetry is small, adverse selection will not occur.




                                                                                                       31
Whether these elasticities are “small enough” to avoid symptoms of adverse selection depends

on what we assume about the extent of information asymmetry. Chronic conditions generally

affect only about 15 percent of persons aged 45 (in the midpoint of the data), but most chronic

conditions are detectable. More plausibly, people may have some idea of how they feel

physically, but the information content of differences in this information is likely to be low.



For example, suppose 5 percent of buyers have information that suggests that their mortality rate

is three times greater than the standard (200% greater). (This is the magnitude of the impact of a

positive genetic test for the breast cancer gene on female survival (Subramanian et al, 1999).) If

they respond to this information with an elasticity of 0.4 (and other buyers respond to the

absence of information that they are high risks), the overall risk level per dollar of purchased

coverage will rise by only 8.6 percent. The subsequent reduction in insurance purchases by

lower risks would be only 3.4 percent (using the same elasticity). Moreover, as noted above the

high risks will also reduce their insurance purchases so that there may be only weak subsequent

adjustments. This is not enough of a response to provoke a death spiral or even a large reduction

in coverage.



One might suppose that the result that small amounts of special information for many or large

amounts of special information concentrated only on a few does not distort the market is close to

the Cawley and Philipson conclusion of no adverse selection. Had demand or risk elasticity been

substantially greater (even in the “small difference” or “small numbers” cases), the conventional

models could lead to a prediction of serious problems. Our results suggest that this case does not

arise. Adverse selection behavior may fail to be manifested not because sellers know as much as




                                                                                                   32
buyers, but rather because buyers have more important things to care about than reacting to

asymmetric information in life insurance markets.

Note: Marginal prices are estimated for 1-year level term contracts using all premiums offered in the California market in January 1997. All data are taken from the January
1997 CompuLife dataset. Companies with all ratings are included in the analysis. Contracts are priced without riders. Marginal price estimates shown are the regression
estimates multiplied by 1,000 – or the marginal price per $1,000 of term insurance coverage.
