Recent Declines in Labor's Share in US Income: A Preliminary Neoclassical Account

NBER Working Paper No. 21296

JEL No. D3,D33

                                             ABSTRACT

As shown in the 1930s by Hicks and Robinson the elasticity of substitution (σ) is a key parameter
that captures whether capital and labor are gross complements or substitutes. Establishing the
magnitude of σ is vital, not only for explaining changes in the distribution of income between factors
but also for undertaking policy measures to influence it. Several papers have explained the recent
decline in labor’s share in income by claiming that σ is greater than one and that there has been capital
deepening. This paper presents evidence that refutes these claims. It shows that despite a rise in
measured capital-labor ratios, labor-augmenting technical change in the US has been sufficiently
rapid that effective capital-labor ratios have actually fallen in the sectors and industries that account
for the largest portion of the declining labor share in income since 1980. In combination with
estimates that corroborate the consensus in the literature that σ is less than 1, these declines in the
effective capital ratio can account for much of the recent fall in labor’s share in US income at both
the aggregate and industry level. Paradoxically, these results also suggest that increased capital
formation would raise labor’s share in income.

     Recent Declines in Labor’s Share in US Income: A Neoclassical
                                               Account



                                           Introduction

         Over the past decade, in addition to its poor employment performance, the US

economy has been plagued by sluggish wage growth and rising income inequality.

Whereas the debate over inequality in the 1980s and 1990s was focused on the growing

disparity between the earnings of skilled and unskilled workers and the earnings of the

super-rich (Lawrence 2008) growing income inequality between capital and labor

income has now been added to these concerns. Remarkably, the growth in real GDP per

worker over the decade of the 2000s which averaged 1.7 percent annually was actually

more rapid than in the 1970s, 1980s or 1990s, yet in the 2000s workers saw almost no

increase in their take home pay. Consistent with this gap between labor productivity and

wage growth was a pronounced decline in the share of US national income earned by

workers.

         This is an unusual development. For much of the past century, the long run

shares of national income earned by capital and labor in the US have been fairly stable.1

As Figure 1 shows, since the late 1960s, the share of labor compensation (a measure

that includes wages and benefits) in national income cycled between 64 and 67 percent.

  See for example Cobb & Douglas (1928), Keynes (1939), Kaldor (1961), Dew-Becker and Gordon
(2005), Mankiw (2007), Lawrence (2008). Actually the “stability” of shares is quite sensitive to how they
are measured. It makes a difference whether labor compensation is measured relative to net or gross
capital income and relative to the entire economy or just the corporate sector. For an early skeptical view
of what exactly we mean by a constant share see Solow (1958). For a recent discussion see Kraemer
(2010). For a skeptical view that labor’s share has recently fallen to all-time lows emphasizing the
difference between net and gross income see Bridgman (2014).


                                                                                                         5
                                                                                                       6


However, since 2008 that share has fallen considerably below this cyclical variation.2

The counterpart to the declining labor share has been a rise in the share of capital that

has been especially concentrated in corporate profits, and since claims on profits are far

less equally distributed than wages, this has contributed to increased income inequality.



[FIGURE 1]



        There are several plausible reasons for this development (globalization,

automation, weak-bargaining power of labor, political capture, increasing mark-ups) but

the natural starting point for explaining factor income shares is the neoclassical theory

of the functional distribution of income enumerated by John Hicks and Joan Robinson

in the 1930s.3 This theory highlights the role played in allocating income between

capital (K) and labor (L) by the ease with which they can be substituted. When there are

constant returns to scale and competitive conditions and a production function where

output Y = F(K,L) the magnitude of these responses can be summarized with a single

parameter – the elasticity of substitution – commonly depicted by σ – and defined

(negatively) as - d log (K/L) / d log (FK/ FL). If factors are paid their marginal products,

R the rental rate = FK and W the wage rate = FL. This implies that ratio of factor income

shares is      =     *    . The components of this ratio will generally change in opposite

directions. Thus for labor’s share to fall, RK must rise by more than WL. When σ = 1,

the components will change proportionally and the factor income ratio (RK/WL) will

2
  With the exception of the UK, the European experience has been different. There was a rise in the labor
share in the 1970s, but thereafter the labor share declined in many European countries and Ireland
(Bertoli and Farina 2007, 12). See also: (O. Blanchard 1997, O. Blanchard 2006).

  See Hicks (1963) and Robinson (1932). For a comprehensive review of the evidence and theories of
labor’s share see Schneider (2011).


                                                                                                       6
                                                                                                           7


remain constant.4 When σ is > 1 the factors are gross substitutes. A given percentage

rise in K/L will give rise to a smaller percentage fall in R/W and labor’s share will fall;

conversely if σ is < 1 the factors are gross complements. A given percentage rise in K/L

will be more than offset by a fall in R/W and labor’s share will rise.5 As shown by

Ellsby et. al (2013) the relationship between changes in labor share in income (Ls) and

the capital-labor ratio will be captured by the equation:

         d ln Ls = - (1 - Ls)        d ln K/L                                               (1)

         In this framework, σ can also be used to relate changes in factor shares to

changes in the capital-output ratio (K/Y).6                Where Ks is the share of capital for

example, the relationship between Ks and changes in K/Y is:

         d log Ks = (1 - ) d (log (K/Y)                                                     (2)

         In this specification, an increase in the capital-output ratio will be associated

with a rising share of capital in income if σ is > 1; a declining share of capital if σ < 1;

and no change in Ks when σ = 1.

         Determining σ and changes in the quantities of capital and labor used as inputs,

however, is not sufficient to explain changes in income distribution when there is

technological change. Hicks characterized technical change according to its relative

impact on the marginal products of the two factors. He called such change “capital
4
  Note when speaking of σ here it is defined here so that it is positive.
5
  Considering extreme cases when K/L increases reveals the intuition behind this result. If σ = ∞, and
capital and labor are perfect substitutes, their relative prices do not change and if the supply of capital
increases, and w/r remains fixed, capital’s share must rise. Conversely, if it is impossible to substitute
capital for labor, and σ = 0, starting from a position in which the capital labor ratio was equal to the
required proportion in which these factors had to be used and thus w and r were both positive, any
increase in capital would be redundant and thus capital’s marginal product would decline to zero. The
result would be that all income would accrue to labor.
6
  The elasticity of Fk with respect to the capital-output ratio K/Y is given by . This implies that the ratio
of capital’s share in income Ks = Fk K/Y. Thus d log Ks = (1 - ) d (log (K/Y). See Rognlie (2014) and
Bentolia & Saint-Paul (2003) for derivations.


                                                                                                           7
                                                                                                      8


saving” if it raised the marginal product of labor by more than it raised the marginal

product of capital. Following Uzawa(1961), however, I will use the more common

appellation “labor-augmenting.” For a given wage-rental rate such a change would lead

firms to use more labor and less capital ratio to produce a given quantity of output. On

the other hand, “labor-saving” technical change (or what is normally called capital-

augmenting) raises the marginal product of capital by more than the marginal product of

labor and leads to the use of higher-capital-labor ratios at any given wage-rental ratio.

These changes can be captured in a production function by the degree to which each

factor is augmented.7 Assume λl and λk are measures of labor and capital augmenting

change respectively, if dλl is > dλk, there is net labor augmenting technical change (or

capital-saving change) and if dλl is < dλk, there is net capital augmenting change (or

labor-saving change)).

        Once technical change is taken into account, what matters for income

distribution is the change in the effective capital-labor ratio k = (λkK/λlL). If dλl and dλk

are equal, there is so-called “Hicks neutral” technological change and both factors are

augmented to an equal degree. With non-neutral change, however, complete

explanation of changes in factor income shares requires not only determining σ and

changes in the physical measures of K and L but also how λl and λk have evolved over

time. With technical change equation (1) becomes

        d ln Ls = - (1 – Ls)         d ln(λk K/ λl L)                      (3)



7
 If technical change raises the marginal product of capital by more than the marginal product of labor
Hicks (op. cit chapter VI, page 121-122) defines it as “labor saving” but I refer to it here as “capital
augmenting”. Similarly, technical changes that raise the marginal product of labor by more than the
marginal product of capital are called “capital saving” by Hicks, but I refer to such changes as “labor
augmenting”.


                                                                                                      8
                                                                                          9


       In this framework, there are two possible explanations for labor’s recent

declining share using equation 1: The first is that capital and labor are gross substitutes,

i.e. that σ is > 1, and there has been a rise in k and the second is that capital and labor

are gross complements, i.e. that σ < 1 and there has been a decline in k.

       Several recent studies have come down on the side of the first explanation and

argue that  > 1 and that an increase in capital deepening is responsible for the fall in

labor’s share. Elsby et. al (201340) point to increased capital intensity caused by the

offshoring of labor-intensive tasks from the US as the major cause. Karabarbounis and

Neiman (2014) point to a global decline in relative prices of investment goods which

they argue has raised capital-labor ratios and reduced labor’s share; Piketty (2014)

develops a model in which the capital-output ratio is a function of the ratio of s/g – the

saving rate over the growth rate – and thus the capital output ratio rises when g declines

and s remains constant. Piketty and Zucman (2013) use this result and equation (2) to

calibrate that σ is > 1 and the decline in labor’s share is the result of a higher capital

(wealth)-output ratio. All these claims are, however, at odds with the preponderance of

the studies that have found that in the US σ is < 1 and although there is empirical

evidence and a theoretical presumption that technical change has been labor

augmenting, they all ignore a possible role for changes in the pace of labor augmenting

change in accounting for the change in factor income shares.

       This paper puts forward the alternative “gross-complements” explanation for the

declining US labor share i.e. that σ < 1 and the effective capital-labor ratio has declined.

It shows that labor-augmenting technical change in the US has been sufficiently rapid,

both at the aggregate level, and in the sectors and industries that account for the largest




                                                                                          9

portion of the declining labor share, that despite a rise in the measured capital-labor

ratios, the effective capital-labor ratios have fallen. In combination with estimates that σ

< 1, these changes in k can account for the declines in labor’s share in GDP since 1980.

This is the case for declines in labor share at the aggregate level, for declines within key

sectors such as manufacturing, mining, and information technology, and for declines

within the manufacturing industries that have had the largest impact on the declining

labor share overall.

       The results are compatible with the extensive empirical evidence surveyed by

Chirinko (2008) that σ < 1 and with the critiques of Piketty advanced by Rognlie

(2014), Summers (2014), and Acemoglu and Robinson (2014). The results are also

consistent with the evidence that on balance US technical change has been labor

augmenting(Antras 2004, Wei 2014, Young 2010). In addition, they accord with the

fundamental insights of growth theory that when σ < 1, labor augmenting technical

change is required to maintain a balanced growth path (i.e. a path where capital and

output grow at the same rate) in the face of rising capital-labor ratios (Uzawa 1961,

Jones and Scrimgeour 2004). They are also supported by work of Acemoglu (2003,

2002) who explains how endogenous technical change is likely to revert to pure labor

augmenting change.

       This paper uses industry and aggregate data to estimate a CES production

function assuming that technical change has an exponential functional form, but its

conclusions are in line with those of Oberfield and Ravel (2014) who use manufacturing

plant data and a different identification strategy based on variations in factor prices

across local areas. Despite their different methodology, they also find that σ in US




                                                                                         10

manufacturing is less than one and that most of the recent decline in the share of labor

in US manufacturing can be accounted for by “changes in the pace of the bias of

technical change”.8


                                              Outline

        Section I, discusses measurement and data issues and explores the timing,

magnitude and sector sources of various measures of recent declines in the US labor

share. Shift-share analysis is used to measure the degree to which the overall decline

can be attributed to share changes within industries and changes in industrial

composition. The sectors that have made the most important contributions to the

aggregate change over various periods are identified. Since 2000, these include the

manufacturing, mining and information technology sectors and industries within

manufacturing such as petroleum refining and coal products, chemicals and computers

and electronics. Section II critiques the studies that claim capital and labor are gross

substitutes, point to capital deepening to accounting for the decline in labor’s share and

fail to evaluate the pace of labor-augmenting technical change. These accounts are

contrasted with evidence that  < 1, on balance technical change has been labor

augmenting, and recent growth in investment, especially in US manufacturing has been

unusually weak with the result that the capital-output ratio has fallen. Section III

applies the approach developed by Antras (2004) to simultaneously estimate σ and the

magnitude of factor-augmenting technical change. These estimates are used to derive



8
  Oberfield and Raval (2014) op. cit. are agnostic as to the precise source of this bias – they mention
automation, offshoring and the decline of unions as possibilities; however, this paper places technical
change at the heart of the explanation.


                                                                                                    11

measures of changes in the effective capital-labor ratio (k) which are combined with the

estimates of σ to demonstrate that, especially in manufacturing, recent changes in

labor’s share in the aggregate as well as in key sectors and industries can be explained

with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Section IV discusses the implications of the

findings for policy measures that affect capital formation, in particular the importance

of stimulating capital formation to increase labor’s share, points to alternative

methodological approaches and provides suggestions for further research.


Section I: Measures and the Sectoral Sources of the Decline in Labor’s
                                    Income Share

       The most useful measure of factor shares for discussions of overall US income

inequality is the share of labor compensation in National Factor Income. (NFI). This

measure includes (a) the compensation of employees; (b) the net income earned by

capital in various forms (i.e. proprietor’s income, rental income, corporate profits and

net interest) after depreciation and inventory valuation adjustments have been taken into

account and (c) net international factor payments. The more comprehensive measure of

national income (NI) includes taxes on domestic production and imports, but since taxes

could be used for a variety of purposes that could benefit either capital or labor it is

appropriate to subtract them from national income when exploring the shares that are

relevant for inequality. In practice, though, since these taxes have been a fairly constant

share (around 8 percent) of national income between 1980 and 2014, their inclusion in

the aggregate measure of national income is not of great consequence when tracking

recent changes in factor shares.




                                                                                        12
                                                                                         13


       Net domestic income in turn subtracts the receipts by US nationals from

foreigners and adds the payments made by US nationals to foreigners and thus measures

the incomes of factors that are located in the United States. It is more appropriate as a

dependent variable when causation is being ascribed to developments that occur in the

US. For empirical analysis of factor shares, however, equivalent measures on the

production side are generally used and domestic product is thus explained by inputs in

the domestic economy. In this case, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the most

commonly used aggregate output measure of value added produced within the United

States includes labor compensation, gross operating surplus, and taxes on production

and imports. As with net domestic factor incomes, taxes on production and imports and

depreciation should both be subtracted for tracking the relative income shares in the

domestic economy that are relevant for inequality (Bridgman 2014).

       As is apparent from Figure 2, which reports labor’s share in various income

measures since 1929, there is a strong cyclical component to the movement in labor’s

share. The wage-share typically rises with the tightening of the labor market at the end

of expansions, remains high at the start of recessions, but then falls during the initial

phases of recovery. Because of this volatility, it is not easy to distinguish the trend from

cycles. Indeed, it is possible to examine the data and to discern a declining trend in

labor share in US GDP after 1969, after 1980, or after 1990 – consider the peaks in

Figure 2, – or actually to see no trend at all after 1969 until after 2008 – with the share

cycling around 65 percent of income. Writing in 2005 for example, Dew-Becker and

Gordon (200571) noted “labor’s share was actually higher in 2005:Q1 than eight years

earlier. Over a longer period going back to 1954, labor’s income share has been




                                                                                         13
                                                                                                     14


virtually constant.” And others, writing even later, such as Lawrence (2008), still

emphasized the long run constancy of US income shares9 dating back to the 1980s.



[FIGURE 2]



        As shown in Figure 2, various measures of labor’s share give somewhat

different pictures, but all indicate that labor’s share rose between the 1930s and 1970

and that since 2008 labor’s share has been unusually low. The measure most consistent

with the proposition that the share has been constant over the long run is the share of

compensation in GDP (red lower line). As shown in Figure 3, depreciation has

constituted a growing share of GDP over the long run, and since NDP and national

income take depreciation into account, the share of labor compensation in these

measures actually had a stronger upward trend through the late 1960s than the share in

GDP. After 2008, however, because of slow capital formation, depreciation has actually

grown more slowly than GDP. In addition, net foreign factor payments have increased

so that labor’s share in national income is somewhat lower than in net domestic product.

In 2008, the 55 percent share in national income was similar to what it was in the 1950s

and even the 1940s. However, from the standpoint of concerns about income equality,

labor’s share in net factor incomes (the highest purple line) is the most relevant measure

and it shows labor’s share in 2014 at levels last seen in the late 1940s.




9
 As noted in several studies (Harrison 2005, O. Blanchard 1997), since the 1970s, the international, and
especially the European experience has been much more varied, with some countries, like the US and UK
having maintained fairly constant shares until recently, while others in continental Europe have
experienced periods of both rising and falling shares.

        Impact. Since 2000, labor’s share has fallen by 5.1 percentage points of net

national factor income. Had labor compensation per hour simply kept pace with the rise

in net national factor income per hour since 2000, for example, in 2014 worker

compensation would have been 7.2 percent higher than it actually was. Moreover, over

the past decade, take-home pay has grown more slowly than labor compensation

because of the additional costs of providing benefits such as more expensive

healthcare.10 Had take-home wages and salaries kept pace with the growth in net factor

income between 2000 and 2014, in 2014 wages would have been 9 percent higher.

These aggregate labor compensation and wage measures include the earnings of “super-

rich” Americans at the very top of the wage distribution. Since the most well paid wage

earners have increased their share of labor compensation this has implied even greater

pressures on the earnings of workers in the middle and lower ends of the wage

distribution.


                                        Business Sector

        The conclusion that the behavior of labor’s share in the 00’s has been different

also emerges from business sector data. As shown in Figure 4, the rise in real product

compensation matched the rise in gross output per worker between 1969 and 2000 and

it matched the rise in net output per worker after 1969 until as late as 2008. There was a

  According to Burtless (2007), the real average compensation of a full-time worker increased by 5.6 per
cent between 2000 and 2005, but of this increase 10 per cent went on increased social insurance
contributions, 24 per cent on increased employer pension contributions, and 35 per cent on health
insurance, leaving less than a third for increased cash wages (Burtless 2007, Figure 3).


                                                                                                     15
                                                                                        16


larger and growing gap between the rise in both gross and net output per worker and the

real compensation (i.e. wages deflated by the consumer price index). This gap is

sometimes pointed to as indicating that labor is not getting what it deserves, but this gap

primarily reflected differences between the mix of goods and services that workers

consume and the mix that they produce (Lawrence 2008). Generally, the prices of the

goods and services workers produce have risen more slowly than the prices of those that

they consume. On the one hand, there has been relatively rapid growth in productivity

in equipment which workers do not buy, while on the other hand, the consumer price

index includes housing services that are not something workers (outside of the

construction sector) produce.11 Had workers chosen to consume the same mix of goods

and services they produced, their real (product) wages would have kept pace with

(gross) labor productivity growth between 1965 and 2000 and net labor productivity

growth between 1965 and 2008.

           However, as Figure 4 indicates, since 2000, the growth in real product

compensation has fallen behind the growth in real output per worker and this shortfall

does mean that a declining share of gross business sector income has accrued to labor.

Moreover, since 2008, the rise in real product compensation has also fallen behind the

rise in net value-added per worker, implying a growing share in business income for

claimants on capital. Nonetheless, it should be noted that around 2000 the share of labor

compensation was unusually high, in part because of the activity associated with the

dot-com boom. In addition, excluding this period gives rise to somewhat smaller

shortfalls between the growth of net value-added per worker and the real product wage.

[FIGURE 4]



        Tracking the shares of labor and capital in national income misses an additional

source of growing inequality. Income earned by owners of capital takes several forms

(corporate profits, net interest income, proprietors and rental income) and recently

corporate profits have constituted a growing share of capital income. The 5.1 percentage

point increase in the share of corporate profits in national income after 2000 is actually

greater than the decline in labor’s share in income primarily because of a fall in the

share of another component of capital income – net interest. Given that corporate profits

accounted for 8.8 percent of national income in 2000, the rise of 5.1 percentage points

in the share of corporate profits between 2000 and 2014 represented an increase of 58

percent in the corporate profit share in national income between 2000 and 2014 and a

47 percent increase over the average 9.4 percent of net corporate value added accounted

for by corporate profits between 1980 and 2000. Most of this increase reflects an

increase in the share of corporate profits in domestic income, but national income also

includes the foreign earnings of US multinationals, and about a quarter of all corporate

profits were earned abroad in both 2000 and 2014.12



[FIGURE 5]



        In sum, labor’s share in income has fallen by a variety of measures especially

since 2000. The most inclusive measures, those for national income point to declines on

12
  In 2014, for example, foreign profits accounted for 25 percent of all US corporate profits, about the
same as in 2000. By contrast, net foreign profits constituted 14 percent of profits between 1990 and 1999.
Moreover, foreign profits contributed 38 percent of corporate profits in the recession year of 2008.


                                                                                                       17

depreciation into account.        However, these national measures reflect compensation in

the government sector as well as measures that impute labor compensation to

proprietors. In the corporate sector, the declines in share have been even larger – on the

order of 11 percent since 2000. At the same time, the share of corporate profits in

national income has increased by 57 percent.


                                       Data selection

       When determining the causes of the declining labor share in income it is helpful

to identify the industries that have made the greatest contribution. However, examining

changes in income shares in the industries that make up GDP presents challenges

because of revisions in the methods used to classify industries and to estimate income.

Several industrial classifications have been used (e.g. SIC in early periods and NAICS

for recent periods) and, in addition, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has

recently revised its methodology for estimating value-added by industry by changing its

treatment of inputs such as R&D. Previously, spending on R&D, entertainment, literary

and artistic originals were all treated as inputs, which were subtracted from value-

added. In recent revisions, however, these items are now included as part of value-

added and investment in fixed assets. These changes have the effect of raising the

estimates for value-added in R&D-intensive industries – most of which are to be found




13




                                                                                        18

in manufacturing. Since the changes are more important for estimates of gross operating

surplus than for labor compensation, the new measures also reduce the share of value-

added represented by aggregate labor compensation. This means that combining the

unrevised data prior to 1997 and the revised data thereafter has the effect of showing a

stronger declining trend in the share of labor in general and in the manufacturing sector

and R&D-intensive industries in particular.

       Unfortunately, the revised data are only available after 1997, whereas data using

the previous methodology, which assumes R&D and several other components of firm

spending are input costs, are available for the years 1987 through 2011. While I will use

the most recent revised data for studying recent changes in order to identify the

industries that have played the largest role in the recent declines in labor share, for

longer run analysis, I therefore use different sources.

       The data developed by Jorgenson, Ho and Samuels (2012) are especially useful

because they have developed consistent time series of gross factor incomes using the

North American Industrial Classification System, (NAICS). I will therefore rely on their

measures for analyzing the long run period 1947 to 2010 for the economy as a whole as

well as for the long run behavior of labor shares in major sectors such as manufacturing,

mining, and telecommunications, posts and telegraphs. In addition, to undertake the

analysis at a more disaggregated level than is available in their data, I will use the

(unrevised) data that are available on an NAICS basis from 1987 and 2011 from the

BEA and the BLS. I will also use the data developed by the National Bureau of

Economic Research in its manufacturing data-base in an exercise at the 6-digit NAICS

industry level.

                                  Industry contributions

        The long-run stability of the aggregate labor share in US GDP is actually quite

surprising given the volatility of labor shares in income within several industries and the

changing of contributions of industries to overall value-added in the economy.14

Therefore, in explaining the behavior of the overall labor share in value-added, it is

helpful to distinguish between the impact of changes in sector shares in output and

changes in labor shares that occurred within particular sectors. This can be done by

decomposing the overall change in labor share (Sl) in gross value-added into changes in

sectors output shares (“between industry changes”) denoted by Wi and changes within-

industry labor shares denoted by Sli using the following formula:

                              +     Wi Sli

        Change in Labor Share = Between Industry Weight Changes + Within Industry

Labor Share Changes



[TABLE 1]



        As reported in Table 1, while the overall share of labor compensation in GDP

fell by about 4 percentage points between 2000 and 2012, the decline was the result of a

large number of sectors making negative contributions and just a small number,

especially Educational Services and Health Care and Government, making positive

contributions. Nonetheless, over this period, the negative impacts were highly

concentrated in a few sectors. Specifically, the “between” and “within” sector

and Guerrieri 2008).


                                                                                                   20

decomposition shows that they account for just 22 percent of GDP experienced declines

whose impact was equal to 82 percent of the overall decline. (3.28 of the 3.92

percentage point decline) or, since several sectors made positive contributions, 66

percent of all the absolute changes. While manufacturing contributed only 15 percent of

overall value-added in GDP in 2000, the output weighted declining labor share in

manufacturing was equal to 44.4 percent (1.74 percentage points) of the overall

economy-wide drop in labor’s share in income; the weighted impact of information

services (which had an unusually high share in 2000 because of the dot-com boom with

lots of start-ups who were not earning profits) and contributed 4.6 percent of GDP was

equal to 21.2 percent of the overall decline and the impact of mining (just 1.1 percent of

GDP) was 17.59 percent. It is also noteworthy that almost all of these changes – 3.97 of

the 4.0 percentage points – were reflective of changes within these sectors as opposed to

changes in the industry shares in value-added (i.e. the between sector changes).

       While these sectors have strongly influenced the aggregate since 2000, in

understanding their behavior it is useful to inquire when the declines in labor share

within these sectors actually began. For this purpose, the long run data of Jorgenson et

al. (2012) are useful. As shown in Figure 3, the changes in manufacturing that were

evident after 2000 were actually a continuation of a trend that began in the mid1980s.

Prior to that, labor’s share in manufacturing remained fairly constant for a long period:

The share of labor in income in manufacturing in 1988 was about the same as it was in

1954. Long run factor income shares in mining, by contrast, have been quite volatile

over the long run. They remained in the vicinity of forty percent until 2000, but then

experienced a large decline. The information technology sector, captured in the




                                                                                       21
                                                                                       22


Jorgenson et al. data as Posts and Telecommunications, experienced a large decline

between 1947 and 1960, remained around 60 percent through 1980, and then had a

declining trend that was interrupted by the rise associated with the dot.com boom

around 2000.

       This suggests that the behavior of manufacturing and information technology as

far back as the 1980s warrant attention, whereas the behavior of mining should focus

mainly on the period after 2000. To explore the impact of these medium term changes,

however, it is necessary to use the unrevised official NAICS data, which are only

available after 1987. As reported in Table 2, in these data the aggregate decline in

labor’s share between 1987 and 2011 is relatively small – 2.7 percentage points.

However, this stability is the result of offsetting changes in individual sectors. In

particular, there are very large declines in the labor-income shares in manufacturing

from 68 to 52 percent and in mining from 40 to 28 percent. There are substantial but

smaller declines in retail and wholesale trade, transportation and information, but also

increases in labor’s share in industries, such as agriculture, utilities, professional and

business services and education and healthcare.



[FIGURE 6]



       The shift-share analysis reported in Table 2 again breaks down the overall

change between changes due to alterations in the relative sizes of the sectors (between

sector changes) and those due to changes within sectors. It suggests again that

overwhelmingly the changes reflect shifts within rather than between sectors. In 1987,

the labor share in income in manufacturing was fairly high and while its shrinkage from



                                                                                       22
                                                                                       23


17.4 to 11.5 percent of GDP contributed 0.6 percentage points to the fall in the

aggregate share, the contribution of the share changes within manufacturing were far

more important – they were equal to 1.8 percentage points. Further, the 2.4 percentage

point impact stemming from manufacturing was equal to 87.9 percent of the overall fall

of 2.7 points.



[TABLE 2]




                                   Manufacturing

       The decline in the labor share in manufacturing is especially interesting due to

three reasons. First, it began earlier than the aggregate labor-share. Second, it made the

largest contribution to the aggregate decline after 1987. Third, it is a sector that is

heavily involved in international trade. In 1987, judged by the share of labor earnings in

value-added, manufacturing was a relatively labor intensive sector. It accounted for

over a quarter of all of the labor compensation in private industry but just 16 percent of

both the gross and net operating surplus earned in private industry. By 2011,

manufacturing’s share of labor compensation in private industry had declined to about

14 percent, about the same as its share in gross operating surplus. In 1987, judged by

income shares, the typical manufacturing business was thus more than fifty percent

more labor intensive than the rest of private industry. However, by 2011, labor intensity

in manufacturing was about the same as the rest of economy.

       As a sector experiencing increasing pressures from international competition, as

well as a large decline in employment, one might have expected that there would be


                                                                                       23
                                                                                                   24


relatively weak wage growth in manufacturing. However, the drop in labor’s share in

manufacturing income did not result from a large decline in the relative compensation

of manufacturing workers. In fact, the rise in average compensation in manufacturing

roughly kept pace with compensation growth in the rest of the economy. Between 2000

and 2012 for example, the increases in average compensation per full time employee in

manufacturing and in private industry averaged 64 and 61 percent respectively.15

        One possibility is that this wage performance reflected a shift in the employment

mix towards more skilled and thus higher paid workers. Indeed this mix change does

explain why manufacturing compensation actually increased somewhat more rapidly

than in the rest of private sector. However, the employment cost (ECI) index tracks the

cost of employing workers with a given set of attributes (e.g. skill, education,

experience etc.) and thus gives a better measure of manufacturing wage growth for

workers with given skill levels. This measure shows that between 1987 and 2014, the

ECI for manufacturing increased only 2 percent less than the ECI for all civilian

workers (and between 2000 and 2012 manufacturing wages grew 1.5 percent more

slowly). Thus weak relative wage growth is not much of the explanation for labor’s

declining share in manufacturing as compared to the rest of the economy. In addition, as

shown in Figure 7a, manufacturing’s constant share in both the gross and net operating

surplus earned in private industry over this period occurred despite a decline in the

overall share of the fixed assets devoted to manufacturing. Thus the declining share of

labor compensation in manufacturing reflected the combination of a massive drop in

manufacturing employment and an increase in overall profitability rather than a decline

Brock & Dobbelaere (2006). Kamal, Lovely & Mitra(2014) find that globalization increased labor share
in China. Ahsan & Mitra(2014) find a similar effect for labor intensive industries in India.

in the relative pay of manufacturing worker or an increase in the rate of investment. It is

also noteworthy that in real terms, manufacturing share in output has remained roughly

constant since 1947.



[FIGURE 7A]



[FIGURE 7B]



       As can be seen in Figure 7b, rates of return to capital, as indicated by the ratio of

the net operating surplus to the value of fixed assets, have remained fairly constant in

private industry. However, the returns in manufacturing have increased substantially

since 1998, reaching 20 percent in 2012.

       A third shift-share analysis for the manufacturing sector allows us to determine

which three digit NAICS industries have been the largest contributors to the declining

labor share in manufacturing value-added. While 14 of the 18 industries in

manufacturing experienced some decline in labor share, the changes with large impacts

were concentrated in three industries – petroleum and coal products, chemical products,

and computers and electronics. Together, these industries which accounted for just 22.6

percent of value-added in manufacturing in 1987, had impacts that amounted to 68

percent of the overall decline in labor share between 1987 and 2011. Changes in

industrial composition – between industry changes in weights – accounted for just over

a fifth of the decline, while 77.6 percent of the overall decline reflected the impact of

within-industry changes. The drops in labor’s share in petroleum refining (43.2 to 12.2




                                                                                         25
                                                                                      26


percent), chemical products (49.6 to 35.2 percent), and computer and electronic

products (81.7 to 57.7) were particularly dramatic.



[TABLE 3]



       A similar result emerges when data for 473 6-digit industries are used in a shift

share analysis. The computation in Table 4 indicates that 84 percent of the 13.9

percentage point change between 1980 and 2000 can be ascribed to changes within the

6-digit industries. Although the decline is smaller between 2000 and 2009 because of

cyclical effects, a similar conclusion – that within-industry changes dominate – emerges

from the decomposition of the decline between 2000 and 2009. What is clear, therefore,

is that the declining labor share both within the manufacturing sector and the economy

as a whole was not primarily due to the reallocation of resources towards less labor

intensive industries. Instead, the bulk of the changes came from changes in shares that

have taken place within industries: 295 of 473 industries, accounting for 76 percent of

value-added in 2009 experienced within-industry declines in labor share.



[TABLE 4]



       In sum, labor’s share in income has fallen, especially since 2000, to a degree

that appears to be outside the historical norm of cyclical fluctuations. However, even

the fairly constant labor share prior to 2000 was the outcome of offsetting developments

across sectors, and in particular, a rise in labor shares in several service sectors that




                                                                                      26

offset declines in the information and manufacturing sectors that began in the 1980s and

in the mining sector after 2000. Within manufacturing, the changes were pervasive, but

a few industries, especially petroleum refining, chemicals, and computers and

electronics have played a key role in the decline. In the case of petroleum and chemicals

this is both because their output shares have increased as well as labor’s share having

declined. However, most of the changes in labor share have reflected changes in factor

shares within industries.

        The explanation to be offered later in this paper fits these facts. A fall in the

effective capital-labor ratio will raise the marginal product of capital and thus the rental-

wage ratio. If the elasticity of substitution is less than one, this decline will raise the rate

of return and the share of capital. At the same time, with sufficiently inelastic demand

for labor, with rapid labor-augmenting technical change, the labor share and the wage

rate could actually fall despite the rise in the marginal product of labor.

        Several recent studies (Karabarbounis and Nieman 2014, Elsby, Hobjin and

Sahin 2013, Piketty 2014, Piketty and Zucman 2013) offer explanations for recent

declines in the share of labor that rest on claims that σ exceeds unity and there has been

increased capital deepening.


                                      Recent Studies




                                                                                             27

        Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) maintain that the declining labor income

share, both in the United States and globally, can be explained by the acceleration in

technological progress in the equipment industry and the associated decline in the

relative price of capital goods that took place in the early 1980s. They find that,

internationally, lower relative prices for investment goods are associated with lower

labor shares in income and they use calibration methods based on this international

cross-section relationship to estimate that σ of 1.42 best fits the data. While

emphasizing more rapid technical change in the production of equipment, Karbarbounis

and Neiman (2014) assume that there is factor-neutral productivity at the aggregate and

firm level. As they acknowledge “The choice of a CES technology with elasticity

greater than one rather than a Cobb-Douglas technology (with an elasticity equal to one)

is essential (italics added) for producing declines in the labor share in response to

declines in the cost of capital relative to the wage because firms increase their capital-

labor ratios more than they would with Cobb-Douglas production” (14). In other words,

given their assumption of Hicks neutral technical change, the only way they can explain

labor’s declining share in their framework on the basis of a decline in the cost of

investment goods is to calibrate a σ > 1. They have thus by assumption ruled out the

explanation to be presented here, i.e. that σ <1, and ignored the possibility that despite

the decline in the relative price of capital and associated rise in the capital-labor ratio,

more rapid labor augmenting technical change resulted in a decline in the effective

capital-labor ratio.

        In Capital in the 21st Century, Thomas Piketty’s model makes the capital-

income ratio (K/Y) a function of the saving rate s and the growth rate g. His key




                                                                                         28
                                                                                             29


equation is K/Y = s/g. He then argues that with s unchanged, a decline in g will increase

K/Y. If this rise in K/Y is to reduce labor’s income share as can be seen from equation

(2) above, σ must be > 1. Piketty supports his claim that σ > 1 by citing Piketty and

Zucman (2013), which presents evidence that in seven countries, the net income share

of capital and the wealth-income ratio both rose between 1970 and 2010. This

association leads them to calibrate that the elasticity of substitution lies somewhere

between 1.3 and 1.6 (Piketty and Zucman 2013, 35). However, Rognlie (2014) points

out that the measure of capital (wealth) that Piketty and Zucman use is the current

market value and thus includes capital gains, whereas the equation that relates the

capital share to the capital-output ratio using σ i.e. equation 2, should be specified in

real terms. Rognlie shows that removing capital gains from the capital measure to

obtain a more appropriate measure of capital radically reduces the capital to income

ratio and he demonstrates that using book rather than market value – a more appropriate

indicator of the impact of capital accumulation generated by saving – suggests that on

average the countries in the sample used by Piketty and Zucman actually show a decline

in the ratio of capital to income. If a falling capital-output ratio has led to a rising capital

share in income, this would actually imply that σ is less than rather than greater than

one, and thus undermine the prediction that increases in the capital-output ratio will

cause capital’s share in income to rise. The estimates provided by Piketty and Zucman

thus appear to rest on faulty data and back-of-the-envelope calculations rather than

rigorous econometric analysis. They are also contradicted by the large number of

studies that find that σ < 1.




                                                                                             29
                                                                                                        30


         Elsby et al. (2013) offer no evidence of their own on the magnitude of σ, but the

arguments in their paper reflect the assumption that σ is > 1. For example, they observe

that in the 00s the decline in labor’s share in the US has been associated with a

slowdown in the growth of the capital-labor ratio, and they argue that since slower

growth in the capital-labor ratio should slow rather than accelerate the decline in labor’s

share (assuming σ > 1), the neoclassical framework is incapable of explaining the

slowdown. Having rejected the framework, they then present evidence that attributes

much of the decline in labor’s share in income to off-shoring by US firms, and speculate

that the offshoring of more labor intensive tasks has raised the capital-labor ratio within

the US industries. In addition, they suggest that that with offshoring, σ could rise.16

However, if σ is actually < 1, in the face of rapid labor-augmenting technical change, a

decline in the effective capital-labor ratio could explain labor’s declining share (the

neoclassical explanation) and it is also possible that the off-shoring might have actually

reduced the elasticity of substitution of the production that remains in the United States

by making it more intensive in skilled labor (which is more complementary with

capital).

         The previous section concluded that US manufacturing has played a key role in

contributing to the declining labor share in the US. It is noteworthy that the behavior of

investment in manufacturing provides little support for the investment boom on which

the explanations put forward by these authors rests. First, if lower prices for investment

goods especially equipment are at the heart of the explanation, one might expect to see

that the net capital stock in manufacturing had increased relatively rapidly in recent

16
  See ibid. page 40 in which they observe that “if capital is more than unit elastic with respect to labor,
Hicks’ (1932) result will imply that the U.S. labor share will fall”.



                                                                                                        30
                                                                                      31


years. However, as shown in Figure 8, the average annual growth rate of the net capital

stock in fixed assets in manufacturing has actually decelerated, and the share of

manufacturing investment being devoted to equipment in particular has declined.

Between 1950 and 1980, and 1980 and 2013, the annual growth rate in the net capital

stock in fixed assets in manufacturing declined from 4.3 to 1.9 percent respectively and

the annual growth rate in the net capital stock in equipment declined from 4.1 percent to

1.7 percent respectively. Moreover since 2000, the overall net stock of fixed assets and

the net stock of equipment have averaged just 1.0 and 0.6 percent annual growth

respectively.



[FIGURE 8]



       Similarly, given the declining share of labor income, applying the argument

used by Piketty (i.e. that σ > 1) we would have expected the capital-output ratio in

manufacturing to have risen. Yet as shown in Figure 9, between 1980 and 2012 the ratio

of the net fixed stock of assets in manufacturing to real manufacturing output actually

declined by 33 percent! This decline is also inconsistent with the argument that as a

result of offshoring, the labor intensive tasks have been shipped abroad and

manufacturing value-added in the United States has become more capital intensive in

the sense of a higher capital to output ratio.



[FIGURE 9]




                                                                                      31

       The only evidence that capital-deepening has taken place in the US in recent

decades, is the increase in the ratio of the net fixed capital stock to full time equivalent

employment that is evident after 1990, especially in manufacturing.



[FIGURE 10]



       However, the increases in capital-labor ratios have been achieved not by

additional investment, but rather through substantial layoffs of manufacturing workers.

Indeed, as shown in Figure 11, US non-residential investment as a share of GDP has

been weak since 2000, especially in equipment in general and information technology

equipment in particular.



[FIGURE 11]




                                    Evidence on σ

       Moreover, while they have gained prominence recently, these claims that capital

and labor are highly substitutable are in the distinct minority. With a few exceptions,

there have been many studies that have used a variety of estimation and calibration

techniques that have overwhelmingly concluded that in both the short and long run, σ is

< 1. The original study which pioneered the CES function, that of Arrow et al. (1961),

estimated σ as 0.57. Later studies by David and van de Klundert (1965) and Kalt (1978)

estimated elasticities equal to 0.32 and 0.76, respectively. Hamermesh (1993) surveyed



                                                                                         32

a range of early estimates and found that the results were generally between 0.3 and 0.7.

One noteworthy early exception was Berndt (1976) who found support for an elasticity

equal to unity. However, Antras (2004) showed that if Berndt’s equation was specified

to allow for factor augmenting change, it indicated that “aggregate elasticity is likely to

be considerably less than one and may even be lower than 0.5.” Klump et al. (2007) use

a variety of methods and obtained estimates of the elasticity of substitution between 0.5

and 0.64. Moreover, Chirinko (2008) summarizes a large number of studies finding that

“while the estimates range widely, the weight of the evidence suggests a value of

(sigma) in the range of 0.40–0.60.”17 Young(2010) uses several estimation techniques

and concludes that aggregate US σ is “less than unity and perhaps less than 0.5” and he

finds that the elasticity is less than unity for the large majority of the 35 individual

industries he estimates separately. Wei (2014) uses an international sample of 40

countries and 34 industries. He finds that industry elasticities fall within a range from

0.4 to 0.9 and that country-level elasticities are “typically around 0.62.” Mallick (2012)

estimates σ for 90 countries and finds that the mean value is 0.34.18

         It is plausible that over the long run, the possibilities of substitution are greater.

Indeed, while Fragiadakis et al (2012) find that typically short run elasticities of

substitution are less than unity, they also find that using a lagged dependent variable

implies long run elasticities greater than unity. However, Chirinko and Mallick (2014)

use time series methods to explicitly measure the long run elasticity and conclude that

over the long run it is still less than one, and Juselius (2008) uses a model that assumes


17
   Ronglie (2014) points out that 31 out of 36 of the studies cited by Chirinko have elasticities less than
one.

   The mean values for the East Asia and Sub-Saharan African countries are 0.737 and 0.275,
respectively. For the OECD countries the mean is 0.340.


                                                                                                        33

labor and product market imperfections and, using time series analysis on Finnish data,

also concludes that the long run elasticity is less than one.

       Most of these studies use aggregate time series and stipulate particular

functional forms about the aggregate production function and the bias of technological

change. However, Oberfeld and Raval (2014) adopt an approach that allows

identification through exogenous variation in factor prices and recover the aggregate

elasticity of substitution from plant level elasticities and estimates of the elasticity of

demand. They distinguish changes within and across plants and, after aggregating plant

data, find an aggregate elasticity of substitution for US manufacturing of 0.7 that has

remained fairly constant over time.


                                         Theory

       The traditional workhorse of growth theory is the Cobb-Douglas production

function whose elasticity of substitution is unity. If we accept that σ < 1, there are

profound implications for growth theory. With Cobb-Douglas it also follows that the

direction of technical change is irrelevant for income distribution. In the CES world,

however, when σ < 1, a steady state with constant factor income shares and a constant

capital-output ratio is only possible if technical progress is purely labor augmenting,

see Uzawa (1961) and Jones and Scrimgeour (2004). In a model in which the bias in

technological change is endogenous, Acemoglu (2002, 2003) has provided an

explanation why in the long run, technical change will be purely labor augmenting.

       If we accept that σ < 1, it must also be the case that for the most part technical

change in the US has been labor-augmenting. In the US, the capital-labor ratio in



                                                                                        34
                                                                                                   35


manufacturing and the economy as a whole has risen steadily, yet for long periods, prior

to 1980 for manufacturing, and prior to 2000 for the economy, factor income shares

remained fairly constant. This implies that the effective capital-labor ratio must have

been constant, with labor augmenting technical change offsetting the rising capital-labor

ratio.


                                    Augmenting Change

         This reasoning is supported by several empirical studies that have explicitly

tried to estimate the direction of US technical change. Here, the pioneering work was

undertaken by Antras (2004) who assumed that factor augmentation grew by a fixed

percentage annually – an exponential specification. He found that on balance US

technical change has been labor augmenting and that the annual growth in labor

augmenting change has exceeded that of capital-augmenting change by about three

percent. Klump et al. (2007) explore the functional form of labor and capital

augmenting technical change and confirm that labor augmenting technical change is

best captured by an exponential functional specification. However, they find that the

best fit for capital augmenting change is a functional form that is hyperbolic and tends

to disappear over time – a finding that supports the Acemoglu theory that in the long
                                                               19
run, all technical change will be labor augmenting.                 Wei (2014) adopts the Antras

specification and finds “At the country level, 35 of the 40 countries exhibit net labor-




19
  In Acemoglu’s theory, with σ < 1, capital augmenting technical change reduces capital share and thus
dampens the incentives for both capital accumulation and capital-augmenting technical change.


                                                                                                   35

augmenting technical progress. However, at the industrial level, this is not always

true.”20

           In sum, the evidence in support of the capital-deepening explanations based

claims or assumptions that σ > 1 is weak and inconsistent with recent data for US

manufacturing. On the other hand, the literature provides considerable support for the

two components of the explanation I will advance. First, it shows that in both the short

and the long run, σ is less than one; and second, it has developed strong theoretical

reasons, supported by empirical evidence that on balance technological change has been

labor augmenting. The following section shows that regressions which provide

estimates of σ < 1, and labor augmenting technical change can explain the decline in

labor’s share in US income.




Section III: Combining the Components: The Decline in Labor’s Share

           This empirical analysis follows Antras (2004) who was the first to estimate the

elasticity of substitution in a specification that expressly allowed for factor augmenting

technical change. Specifically, the production function is assumed to have a constant

elasticity of substitution       and, in addition, factor augmenting technical change such

that the capital and labor augmentation grow at constant rates of λk and λl respectively.

Thus the production function for output Y and time t is

20
   Bentolia and Saint-Paul (2003) use a more complex model and reach more nuanced conclusions. “We
find for the euro area for the period 1970–2005 an aggregate elasticity of substitution below unity (about
0.7) and a pattern of factor-augmenting technical growth rates where labor-augmenting technical progress
growth dominates in the long run while capital-augmenting technical progress plays a significant role in
the interim period. We also importantly find evidence for a structural break in this pattern of biased
technical progress at the end of the 1990s with an upward shift in capital augmenting technical progress
and a downward shift in labor augmenting progress.


                                                                                                      36

        The first order profit conditions require that the marginal product of each of the

factors be equal to their prices i.e.

        Log (Yt / Kt) =      +      log (Rt /    ) + (1 -       λk.t +                      (a)

        Log (Yt / Lt) =     +       log (Wt /    ) + (1 -       λl.t +                      (b)

        Subtracting equation (a) from equation (b) we obtain

        Log (Kt / Lt) =      +      log (Wt / Rt) + (1 -        (λl – λk).t +               (c)

        We can also express the equations by reversing the dependent and independent

variables.

        Log (Rt /    )=      + (1 /       log (Yt /Kt) – [(1 -          /    λk.t +         (d)

        Log (Wt/      )=     + (1 /      log (Yt /Lt) – [(1 -       /       λl. t +         (e)

        Again subtracting equation (d) from equation (e) we obtain

        Log (Wt/ Rt) =       + (1 /      log (Kt/Lt) – [(1 -        /       (λl – λk).t +   (f)

        For our purposes these specifications are useful because running these

regressions not only give us estimates of σ the estimate of σ can then be used to solve

for the growth rate of capital and labor augmenting technical change in equations (a)

and (b) respectively, and for the difference between labor and capital augmenting

change in equation (c). Similarly estimates and σ and factor augmenting change can be

obtained from equations (d), (e) and (f). Changes in the effective capital-labor over

time t dlogk = (λK.t + dlogK) / (λl.t + d logL) can then be calculated and used to predict

changes in labor’s share (Ls) using equation (1) which re-specified in terms of the

effective capital-labor ratio is:

                                                Data

        Dale Jorgenson and his associates (2012) have developed measures of labor and

capital inputs, services and prices. Their labor input measure combines data on work

hours from the BLS and labor matrices of 192 demographic characteristics (gender,

class of worker, age, education from the work of (Jorgenson, Ho and Samuels 2012).

Expressed as an index, it is thus a measure of the quantity of labor services. Given

income of labor, the price of labor, (the wage rate) is then derived. Similarly, the

capital-services measure used in the production function estimates reflects weighting of

90 different types of assets divided into five major categories: intellectual property,

equipment, structures, inventories, and land.21 Given capital income (i.e. the net

operating surplus, and the index of capital services) the price of capital (rate of profit) is

then derived. Wherever possible, I use these data to estimate labor’s share at the

aggregate and industry level. However, for more disaggregated industry analysis I will

use the data developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to explain total factor

productivity at the industry level. These also provide estimates of output and capital and

labor inputs and prices.

        Antras (2004) uses an earlier version of the Jorgenson data. He obtains estimates

of     ranging between 0.641 and 0.892 and his estimates of net labor augmenting

technical change (λl – λk) obtained from equations (c) and (f) are 3.08 and 3.15 percent

21
   Intellectual property accounts are now a fifth category of major asset types that include the 90
individual assets. Intellectual property products are composed of three broad classes of assets: software
(originally in a category called fixed business equipment and software), research and development, and
artistic originals.

respectively. In the Jorgenson data, the ratio of capital to labor service inputs increases

at an annual average rate of 2.46 log points between 1948 and 1998. Thus Antras’

estimates provide a preview of the results to be reported below in that they imply that

on average over his period of estimation the effective capital-labor ratio was a declining

i.e. the annual growth rate of net labor-augmenting productivity change was about half

a percent higher than the growth rate of the capital-labor ratio. The average of Antras’

estimates of        are 0.78. Over the 50 years, given the initial labor share of 58 percent in

1948, using equation (4) leads to a prediction of a small decline of -.031 log points in

labor’s share between 1948 and 1998. Labor share in income in the Jorgenson data was

actually 62 percent in 1998. While not perfect, the estimates using this methodology

thus do reasonably well in predicting the relative stability of labor’s share in income

over the five decade period.

           Table 5 uses the results of estimates of equations (c) and (f) for various periods.

Each of these equations provides estimates of                    and after manipulation the annual

difference between labor and capital augmenting technical change is extracted.                    The

results are quite mixed and prior to 1980, the estimates of                    are not statistically

significant. However, the σ estimates are significant for the period 1980 through 2010.

of 2.4 implies a negative effective capital labor ratio and predicts a decline in labor

share of 8.8 log points, which is close to the 8.4 log point decline that actually took

place. In the W/R regression, specification (f) for the same period        is higher but less

than one and less significant (p=.10). Moreover, with a decline in the effective capital

labor of -.0287, the result predicts a decline in labor share of 4.5 log points -- about half

of the actual 8.4 log point fall. Thus, averaging the two equations suggests σ = .54, an

annual decline in k – the effective capital-labor ratio of 2 log points and a decline in

labor share of 6.7 log points compared with the actual decline of 8.4 log points between

1980 and 2010.

       Neither of the estimates of σ for the shorter period 1999 through 2010 are

significant although taken together the equations do a reasonable job in predicting

declines of -.127 and -.059 as compared with the actual decline of -.09. Indeed, the

average of the two predictions with an estimate of σ = 0.494 and an annual change in k -

.0229 leads to a prediction of -.086, which is almost precisely correct.



[TABLE 6]



       The results explaining labor’s share in manufacturing in Table 6 are much

stronger than those for the aggregate economy. Most of the coefficients in both

specifications are significant and in all periods they indicate that σ < 1. In addition, the

results from the equations can be used to track the changes in the labor share over time.

Over the period 1947 through 1980, the averaged results closely predict the slight

increase (2.5 log points) in the labor share that actually took place. The equations then




                                                                                          40
                                                                                       41


capture the dramatic change that took place after 1980. Both specifications indicate

accelerations in net labor augmenting technical change and lower σ’s after 1980. This

combination of strong net labor augmenting technical change and σ < 1 leads to

predictions of large declines in labor’s share in income. On average the equations do

well in explaining the decline especially over the past decade. Between 1980 and 2010

the actual decline of 37.1 log points exceeded the average predicted decline of 31.8 log

points by 5.3 log points and between 1999 and 2010 the actual decline of 23.1 log

points differs from the predicted decline by just 1.9 log points. In sum, it appears that

this specification can explain the aggregate behavior of labor’s share in US

manufacturing since 1980.



[TABLE 7]



       Using data that have been developed by the BLS for estimating productivity

growth, that are similar but not the same as those from Jorgenson et. al,          I have

undertaken a similar exercise for individual US industries between 1987 and 2011 at the

three digit NAICS level. I report both equations (c) and (f). Again, all regressions have

been run using the Prais-Winston method for dealing with autocorrelation.

        The shift share analysis indicated that three manufacturing industries had

changes which together account for two thirds of the declining labor share within

manufacturing. In all three industries, as reported in the Table 7, the estimated

elasticities of substitution are very low and in all three, technical change is net labor

augmenting and in excess of the increases in the actual capital-labor ratios. As a result,




                                                                                       41
                                                                                          42


very large declines in the labor shares in log points are predicted. The W/R

specifications are more accurate and on average their predictions of declines of 53 log

points are fairly close to the 43 percent actually experienced.



[TABLE 8]



       In Table 8, the results of the K/L and W/R regressions for all 18 three-digit

manufacturing industries are reported. As can be seen, while as shown by the shift-share

analysis, the impacts were concentrated in the three industries discussed above, the

declines in labor’s share were quite pervasive across manufacturing. They occurred in

14 of the 18 industries and averaged 17.9 log points. In the K/L specification, only ten

of the estimates of σ are statistically significant (seven though at the P =.01 level). In no

case in the k/l regressions does σ come close to unity. Indeed, the significant estimates

are extremely low, ranging from 0.0331 for transportation and 0.0499 for petroleum to

0.286 for fabricated metals. The W/R regressions are generally stronger with thirteen

significant estimates. There are four estimates of σ greater than one, but none are

significant, and the significant estimates have σ ranging between 0.09 for transportation

to 0.755 for plastics. Strikingly, in all of the 18 industries when K/L is the dependent

variable and in 15 of the 18 when W/R is the dependent variable, there is net labor

augmenting technical change. Moreover, the magnitude of this change is greater than

the increase in the capital-labor ratio in 14 cases with the K/L specification and 16 of

the 18 cases with the W/R specification implying that in the vast majority of

manufacturing industries the effective capital-labor ratio was declining. The model does




                                                                                          42
                                                                                        43


well qualitatively, although in some cases there are fairly large prediction errors that

reflect the use of σ coefficients that are not significant (e.g. food, textiles, paper and

especially plastics). On average, because of these errors, the k/l model over-predicts an

average decline in labor share of 41.4 log points versus the actual average decline of

17.9 log points. However, the W/R regressions have much smaller forecast errors and

on average predict a decline of 17.5 percent, which is remarkably close to the actual

average decline of 17.8 percent. All told, therefore, it appears that in addition to the

industries that had the largest impact on labor’s share in manufacturing, there were

more pervasive combinations of low substitution elasticities and declining effective

capital-labor ratios that help explain why manufacturing experienced such large

declines in labor’s income share.

       Finally, the information and mining sectors have played an important role in the

declines in labor’s share in income since 2000. Estimates using the Jorgenson data for

mining, and posts and telecommunications (which include the information technology)

sectors are reported below.



[TABLE 9]



       For the period 1980 through 2010, while they are both able to account for almost

the entire large decline in labor share of 32.6 log points in post and telecommunications,

the estimates of σ from the two regressions are quite different. The prediction of the k/l

regression is based on a low σ and a decline in the effective capital-labor ratio while the

prediction using the W/R regression combines an estimate of σ = 1.2 with an estimate of




                                                                                        43
                                                                                         44


net capital augmenting technical change that is not, however, statistically significant.

All told therefore, these are quite mixed results and lend some support both to the

capital-deepening and the declining effective capital-labor explanations. Remarkably,

however, despite the relatively small sample, both the equations explaining labor’s

share in the income in post and telecommunications do very well in explaining the large

decline in labor’s share after 1999. For this period, the regressions provide very similar,

statistically significant estimates of σ of 0.8 and 0.9 from the K/L and W/R regressions

respectively, and they both estimate very substantial increases in labor augmenting

technical change. These in turn imply declining effective capital-labor ratios and result

in predictions of the decline in labor’s share of 26.4 log points with errors of just over 1

log point.



[TABLE 10]



       The equations explaining mining and quarrying also provide an account of the

declining labor share after 1980 and especially after 2000 that can be couched in terms

of a low σ and a declining effective capital-labor ratio. The W/R regressions have

higher levels of significance and smaller errors in prediction, especially in the recent

period. What is interesting is that between 1947 through 1979, the W/R regressions

explain the declining labor share on the basis of σ > 1, and capital deepening due to net

capital augmenting technical change. These regressions also predict the declining labor

share of 11.7 log points with only a small error. However, more recently especially after

2000, again as in the case of posts and telecommunications, both the k/l and W/R




                                                                                         44
                                                                                        45


regressions estimate σ to be low (.207 and .436 for the K/L and W/R regressions) and

find a decline in the effective capital ratio to which a fall in actual capital-labor ratio

contributes. The predictions of the W/R equation is very accurate (a decline of 18.2 log

points versus an actual decline of 20.6), while the K/L regression also predicts a decline

but with an error of 8.7 log points. All told, the earlier behavior of these sectors

provides additional evidence that since 2000 the combination of a σ < 1 and declining

effective capital-labor ratios explain the declines in labor’s share in income.

       In summary, for the period 1980 through 2010 there is overwhelming evidence

that despite the measured increase in the capital-labor ratio, the effective capital-labor

ratio has declined. This is the case for the total economy, for the manufacturing sector

as a whole, for the three industries that together accounted for more than two thirds of

the decline in labor share within manufacturing, for the majority of the three digit

industries within manufacturing, as well as for the mining sector. It has also been the

case for the posts and telecommunications sector since 2000.


                               Concluding Comments

       The share of labor compensation in US national income has fallen to levels not

seen since the 1950s. The decline has been especially concentrated within industries in

manufacturing, mining, and information technology. In these sectors the explanation

does not lie with relatively weak wage growth because globalization has reduced labor’s

bargaining power. Indeed, the rise in worker compensation in manufacturing has been

similar to the rise elsewhere. Instead, it is rates of return in manufacturing that have

increased. There is however considerable evidence that relatively rapid labor-



                                                                                        45
                                                                                        46


augmenting technical change in combination with  < 1 has played the key role. This

finding may seem paradoxical given the attention that has been focused on innovations

in computers and automation, which might at first glance seem to be capital

augmenting. However, in the Hicks framework, innovations are classified by their

relative impact on the marginal products of capital and labor. It is quite possible that

improvements in equipment and software could increase the marginal product of labor

by more than they increase the marginal product of capital and thus induce a decline in

the effective capital-labor ratio that is used to produce a given quantity of output.

       It is also paradoxical to think that enhancing labor’s productivity could reduce

labor’s share in income, and reduce wage/ rental ratios. However, this should not be

surprising once it is recognized that technical change, which doubles each worker’s

productivity, is equivalent in supplying “effective labor” to doubling the number of

workers in labor force. Just as, in the face of an inelastic demand, an increase in the

supply of a product could reduce its price by enough to reduce total revenue, so too,

could an increase in the effective labor-capital ratio reduce labor’s share in income, and

even wages per worker, when labor and capital are not easily substituted.

       In the Hicks terminology, labor augmenting technical change, which at the

margin encourages the use of labor rather than capital, is termed “capital-saving”; thus

another implication of labor-augmenting technical change is that less capital is required

to produce a given amount of output. This implies that if output is constrained by

inadequate demand for example, investment would be weaker. The conventional

wisdom is that there have been huge breakthroughs in information technology that




                                                                                        46
                                                                                          47


might have been expected to lead to unusually strong investment. Yet, as we have seen,

investment has been weak. This could be part of the explanation.

       The issue of whether capital and labor are gross complements or substitutes is

crucial for determining the impact of measures that seek to affect the functional

distribution of income. As noted, the leading proponent of these factors as substitutes,

Thomas Piketty (2014), argues that to address a development that he regards as

inequitable, capital formation should be slowed by higher taxes on capital and wealth.

However, this study suggests such measures could be counterproductive and actually

reduce labor’s share in income by further lowering the effective capital-labor ratio.

Instead, the evidence here corroborates many others in concluding that in the United

States the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is less than one. It has also

found that in the face of this low elasticity, the cause of labor’s falling share recently is

the weakness of investment in the face of faster labor-augmenting technical change,

rather than more capital deepening in the sense of rising capital-output ratios. This

suggests that measures that boost investment and capital formation would lead to higher

wages, raise labor’s share in income, and reduce income inequality.

       A tax system that could achieve such a goal might be a progressive consumption

tax. This would boost investment by removing the taxes on capital while at the same

time allow income to be redistributed by imposing higher taxes on those with higher

levels of consumption. Such a system would also allow the United States to become

more a more competitive location for international investment.

       While the conclusions of this paper are salient for debates about the causes of

some forms of income inequality these results are sufficiently important that they




                                                                                          47
                                                                                        48


should be the subject of further research. This paper has applied Occam’s razor to

explain changes in the functional distribution of income and finds considerable

evidence to support an explanation that points to the combination of σ’s < 1 and

declining effective capital-labor ratios. The simplest neoclassical explanation of the

functional distribution of income thus appears to explain the facts. However, to produce

these results many simplifying assumptions have been made. These include treating

factors as homogenous, assuming competitive conditions (i.e. no variations in markups),

constant returns to scale, constant elasticities of substitution between labor and capital,

no adjustment costs and frictions, and factor-augmenting technical change that is

characterized by constant exponential parameters. In addition, the estimates are derived

using fairly primitive econometric methods, relying on ordinary least squares

regressions and corrections for autocorrelation using the PRAIS method, rather than

employing time series and/or systems estimation methods.

        Many of these assumptions and methodological choices deserve further scrutiny.

The measures of capital and labor developed by Jorgenson et. al. (2012) used in most of

the regressions have been derived by aggregating inputs with fundamentally different

characteristics. The measure of labor services, for example, reflects a weighting of 192

work-hour categories that are distinguished by gender, class of worker, age and

education. The measure of capital-services reflects a weighting of 90 different types of

assets divided into major categories that include equipment, structures, inventories, land

and intellectual property, which in turn aggregates software, research and development

and artistic originals.




                                                                                        48
                                                                                                 49


           However, there is considerable evidence that the substitution possibilities

between different types of capital and labor are not the same. For example, capital is

often viewed as complementary to skilled labor but substitutable with unskilled

labor(Griliches 1969, Krusell, et al. 2000). In addition, different types of capital such as

equipment and structures are also viewed as having different substitution possibilities

both with each other and with other factors. These differences imply that the

composition of capital and labor (i.e. relative supplies of different types of labor and

capital) could affect their aggregate substitution possibilities. For example, as Elsby et

al. (2013) show, if capital and skilled labor are less substitutable than capital and

unskilled labor, an increase in the share of skilled workers in the labor force could result

in a decline in the overall σ between capital and labor.23

           In addition, with models with more than two factors, the predictions about the

impact of technical change on the functional distribution of income could be affected by

the degree to which technical change augments particular types of capital and labor.

Given the large number of studies that have concluded that skill-biased technical change

has been a powerful source of the rising skill premium in the United States, there are

good reasons that further disaggregation of the nature of technical change could be

important.

           In empirical work that seeks to capture these effects, the results will be affected

by the manner in which the production function is modelled and the degree of

substitution possibilities between different types of labor and capital that are assumed or

calibrated. It is customary to try to capture this greater realism by building models that

use nested production functions. For example, Krussel et al. (2000) undertake an
23
     See Elsby et al. (201331-33) for a discussion of the impact of changes in skill-mix on σ.


                                                                                                 49
                                                                                      50


exercise with four factors of production (structures, equipment, skilled and unskilled

labor). At the highest stage of aggregation they specify a Cobb-Douglas production

function that has one type of capital – structures – and a composite CES, which in turn

combines two underlying CES production functions. One of these is comprised of

skilled labor and equipment that are assumed to be complements, and this function is in

turn nested in another function in which both skilled labor and equipment are assumed

to be substitutes for unskilled labor. Arpai et al. (2009) similarly explain changes in

European factors using such nested production functions. In their model, since capital

and skilled labor are complements, capital augmenting technical progress has the effect

of raising the skill premium. However, since unskilled labor is highly substitutable with

the composite of capital and skilled labor, skilled capital-augmenting progress also

leads to a decline in the overall labor share. As Atkinson (2009) discusses24 and these

examples indicate, dealing with more than two factors adds considerable complexity to

the analysis and entails making additional assumptions in order to ensure tractability

and apply calibration methods. Moreover, as he discusses and as shown by Blackorby

and Russell (1989) we cannot in general talk about two factors being complementary

without specifying the direction of price change envisaged.

           Factor diversity is not the only source of additional realism that might be

relevant. Other sources of change that have been omitted could be important

determinants of the functional distribution of income. As incorporated in their

explanations of changes in labor share in Europe, for example, research by Bentolia and

Saint-Paul (2003) and Arpai et al. (2009) explicitly considers the potential role of

changes in markups, the role of intermediate input prices, adjustment costs and changes
24

                                                                                      50

in the price and wage determining processes. Rognlie (2015) also finds an important

role for mark-up changes. Combining the view that capital’s share is higher because of

higher mark-ups with the finding here presents a puzzle, since it might have been

expected that increased globalization would reduce rather than raise mark-ups.

However, this is an issue that needs further exploration.

       In addition, a considerable literature has been devoted to developing

econometric methodologies for estimating the elasticity of substitution that may be

more suitable than those applied here. Antras (2004) and several other papers that apply

his methodology, use Generalized Instrumental Variables to correct for the endogeneity

of his regresssors as well as time series methods to correct for non-stationarity and the

possibility of spurious correlations. Klump et al. (2007) use normalized production

functions as recommended by Klump and De La Grandville (2000). They also allow for

more complex functional forms for factor augmenting technical change that can

accommodate exponential, logarithmic, and hyperbolic growth as special cases. Their

estimation is undertaken using a three equation supply side system, which includes both

the estimation of the production function and factor income equations and contains

cross-equation parameter restrictions. León-Ledesma et al. (2010) demonstrate using

Monte-Carlo methods that this combination of normalization and jointly modeling the

production function and first order conditions produces superior estimates. Additional

research using these techniques should be undertaken to explore whether the

conclusions obtained here are robust. Nonetheless, despite all these potential
