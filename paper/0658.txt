                                    ABSTRACT



     Conventional analysis of the welfare effects of U.S. oil price regu—

lation in the 1970's focuses on the deadweight losses in the oil market.

This paper argues that such analysis substantially understates the benefits

from decontrolling prices, because decontrol will lead to an improvement

in the U.S. terms of trade with respect to other oil importing countries.

A simple model of the relationship between oil decontrol and the terms of

trade is developed, and the impact is calculated for plausible parameter

values. The results suggest that the terms of trade benefits are several

times larger than the benefits as conventionally measured.

 Introduction

      What are the benefits from decontrolling U.S. oil prices? Essentially,

 decontrol is a way of reducing oil imports by increasing domestic supply and

 reducing domestic demand. Reduced imports, in turn, release resour-ces for

other uses: if the U.S. spends less on oil imports, it can export less

or import more of other goods. The standard analysis of oil price decontrol

argues that the social cost of imported oil, in terms of additional exports

or foregone imports of other goods, can be measured by the world price --    or
perhaps by the world price plus a premium reflecting the political costs of de-

pendence. Decontrol , by bringing the prices faced by producers and con-

sumers closer to this true social cost, leads to a better allocation of

resources.

     The purpose of this paper is to argue that the world price of oil

does not measure the social cost of oil imports to the U.S. -- even thouyh

it may be the right measure if we consider the interests of the oil—importing

countries as a whole. The reason for this lies in the process by which a

reduction in oil imports releases resources for other uses. Only a fraction

of these resources will be released through a direct, compensating reduction

in U.S. exports to OPEC. For the most part, the gains from U.S. decontrol

will take the form of reduced exports to and increased imports from other

oil—importing countries. To effect these changes In trade flows, the

dollar will have to appreciate in real terms. But this appreciation, by

improving America's terms of trade, provides a secondary benefit from

decontrol.

     The thesis of this paper, then, is that the benefits of oil price

decontrol come primarily via a real appreciation of the dollar; and that

because the U.S. has substantial monopoly power in world trade, these

benefits are much larger than a simple consideration of the value of oil

imports saved would indicate. This argument is presented in four parts.

Section 1 presents the standard analysis of oil price controls, then dis-

cusses its problems. Section 2 develops a model which captures the

essential role of real exchange rate adjustment. Section 3 then carries

out a computation of the gains from decontrol using plausible parameter

values. Finally, Section )4 discusses some of the international implications

of this analysis.


1. The Conventional Analysis of Decontrol

     The conventional analysis of the U.S. oil price control system —-

as presented, for example, by Arrow and Kalt (1979 )   -- is   based on a

partial equilibrium model of the oil market. A simplified version           of

such a model is illustrated in Figure 1.    tn the figure, SS is the domestic

 the entitlements system, the prices of domestic oil supply Q and imports

     Decontrolling     oil prices means allowing both     and D to rise to

the import price         Using conventional producer and consumer surplus

measures, the overall benefit is the sum of the deadweight production

gain, measured by the shaded triangle BDE, and the deadweight consumption

gain, measured by FHG. The political economy of controls also appears

clearly, since the aggregate net benefits are the sum of a producer gain

ACEB and a consumer loss CFHJ.

     The important thing to notice about this diagram is that it does not

directly show how these net benefits are realized. The costs of decontrol

are the extra resources devoted to oil production, and the reduced use of

oil, both of which can be read directly from the diagram. The benefits,

however, are measured only by the reduction in oil imports, which is not

a good in itself. We value a reduction in oil imports only because it

allows the U.S. to export less or to import more of something else.

     There is one case in which the route by which reductions in oil imports

release resources for other uses would be direct. Suppose that every dollar

reduction in U.S. imports from OPEC were to be matched by an equal re-

duction in OPEC purchases from the U.S. -—    i.e.,   suppose OPEC had a marginal

propensity to spend on U.S. goods of one. Then reduced oil imports would

translate directly into a reduction in resources used to produce goods
                                                                         5.
 and services for OPEC.

      In reality, however, OPEC's marginal propensity to spend on U.S.

 exports -- even in the long run, when OPEC spending and income are equal

 will be much less than one. Most of the reduction in OPEC's income will

 be reflected in reduced imports from other countries, rather than from

 the U.S. This means that the U.S. will realize most of its benefits

not through a reduction in resources devoted to supplying OPEC with

goods and services, but in exporting less to and importing more from other

oil importing countries.

     The mechanism through which this will be accomplished is through

real exchange rate adjustment. Reduced U.S. oil imports will mean an

initial U.S. balance of payments surplus, leading to dollar appreciation.

As the dollar rises, U.S. exports will fall and U.S. non—oil imports will

rise, the process continuing until balance of payments equilibrium is re-

stored. The principal channel through which oil decontrol benefits the

economy is through the exchange rate.

     Will the Lwelfare triangles" in Figure 1 still give an appropriate

measure of these benefits? The answer is no. As the dollar appreciates,

the U.S. will experience an improvement in its terms of trade with respect

to other oil importers. This is a secondary benefit which is not reflected

in the world price of oil.


2. A Theoretical Model

     In this section I present a model which takes account of the crucial

role of the real exchange rate in realizing the benefits of oil price de-

control. Although I make a number of simplifying assumptions, the model

is difficult to treat analytically except in special cases. Thus in the

next section some plausible parameter values are assigned and the model

is solved numerically.
                                                                              6,



      The basic structure of the model   follows   my own   earlier   work (Krugman

 l9l) in adopting a compromise between partial and general equilibrium

 analysis.    I divide the world into three regions: two oil—importing regions

 and OPEC. The two importing regions are treated in partial equilibrium

 fashion: their imports from OPEC and from each other depend only on

 nominal prices in domestic currency (so that I neglect possible changes

 in output and price levelsL OPEC, however, is treated differently. The

 effect of changes in the quantity ot oil imported on OPEC's income, and

 the effects of changing OPEC income on OPEC's imports, are explicitly

 taken into account.   In effect, an "elasticities" approach is used for

 oil importers but an "absorption" approach for OPEC. This asymmetrical

 treatment can be defended as a resonable approximation to a situation in

 which OPEC's marginal propensity to import other countries' goods is much

 higher than their marginal propensity to import oil. And the hybrid

 partial-general model is much simpler than a full general—equilibrium

 treatment.1"

      The equations of the model fall into four blocks: the equations

 determining oil prices, outputs, and imports; the equations describing

OPEC behavior; the equations of international exchange;and a set of

equations measuring welfare impacts. Since we do not know much about

functional forms, linearity is assumed wherever possible to simplify

the computations in Section 3.

A.   The oil market.

      The world price of oil is assumed to be set by OPEC, with oil

erastcally supplied at that price,    It is assumed that OPEC partially

indexes the price to the exchange rate between the dollar and other

currencies:
                                                                                                7.

                    =           +           - Ij     (OPEC pricing)                             (1)


where E is the dollar price of non-US currency and                           is a coefficient

 of indexation.

      Inside the U.S., pricing depends on the regime: the price received

by suppliers is exogenously fixed under controls, equal to the world

price after decontrol:

                =               (controls)                                                      (2)

                =
                        P       (decontrol)                                                     (21)



     Consumer prices are a weighted average of domestic and import prices

under controls, equal to world prices after decontrol:

                =
                        S           S'°D + w                    (controls)                  (3)

                =                    (decontroL)                                            (31)

     The U.S. demand for oil is decreasing in the dollar price; the supply

is increasing in the price; imports are the difference between supply and

demand:

                =           —D              -
                                                      (oil   demand)                        (4)

                =           +               -
                                                      (oil
                                     (p5                     supply)                        (5)


                =           -        (oil       imports)                                    (6)


     Finally,       foreign imports depend negatively on the foreign currency

price of oil:

                =           - 3'     [PIE —         PIE]     (foreign oil imports)          (7)

B. OPEC behavior.

    OPEC's income comes from sales of oil to the two oil importers:
                                                                               8.

              =P              + Q')    (OPEC income)                            ()
                    w [Qm        m

      I assume that OPEC always spends a share c of that income on

U.S. goods:

          X0 =      aV        (OPEC imports from us)                            (9)



C. Trade and the exchange rate.

     The U.S. is assumed to have a perfectly elastic supply of exports at

a fixed price in domestic currency. The demand for these exports

from the other oil importer depends on their price in foreign currency

and hence positively on the exchange rate:

          X =   X   +         [E-]                                            (10)


     Similarly, non—oil imports are available at a fixed price in foreign

currency, so that the domestic currency price and demand depend negatively

on the exchange rate:


          1= I- IE-EJ                                                         (11)


     Finally, we come to balance of payments equilibrium. This is a

static model.       I have elsewhere developed a model in which it is clear

that a change in energy policy will set in motion a dynamic process of

payments imbalances and exchange rate changes.         In the long run, the

result is a restoration of current account balance. Here V will suppress

the dynamic complications and assume that the exchange rate immediately

adjusts to maintain trade balance:

          X + X -        El   - P    Q =0
               0                    wm                                        (12)


D. Welfare.

    The welfare gains tram decontrol can be measured in either of two

equivalent ways. The first, which is more fundamental, is to measure the
                                                                                                    9.

 gains as the sum of the utility gained from increased consumption of
 non—oil imports and the utility lost from oil imports foregone, less

 the cost of resources used to produce oil and exports:

             U =    E   [I —    I]       + - [E-EJ [I—I]                                           (13)

                    +
                        'D     °D -              +
                                                      [P0
                                                            - D -
                                     -        —k     [P -                      - (X)       (x00)

                    (aggregate change in welfare)

      Alternatively -- and equivalently -- we can measure the change in

welfare by the changes i:n consumers' surplus in the import and oil markets,

and producers' surplus in the oil market:

                                             +              -
             U0 =        D     (P0                              P0)                                (hf)

             u =                                                                                   (15)

                        (change in producer surplus)

      It is tedious to prove but true that U =                             +         i.e., these are
                                                                      U0       US;
in fact equivalent ways of computing the welfare effects of decontrol.

Equation (13) is useful as a way of partitioning the welfare effects by

their source; (hf) and (15) let us apportion them by their recipients.

      We are now prepared to work through the consequences of oil price

decontrol.


3.   Computing the Effects of Decontrol.

A. An overview.

     The effects of decontrol can be decomposed into two parts: the

direct effects holding the exchange rate fixed, and the indirect effects
                                                                         10.


 resulting from the induced exchange rate change. Before calculating

 these effects, it is useful to talk them through.

      Holding E constant, the behavior of the oil sector is exactly

 that illustrated by Figure 1, above. Domestic supply rises), domestic

 demand falls, hence imports of oil fall. A reduction in U.S. oil imports

means a reduction in OPEC income, and this in turn will mean a fall in

OPEC's demand for U.S. exports.

     Unless all of the fall in OPEC spending falls on U.S. goods, however ——

a = 1 in equation (9) -— the story will not stop here. Instead, since

P will fall more than X0, an incipient balance of payments surplus

will develop, requiring an appreciation of the dollar. This will then

produce a whole second round ot effects. The dollar price of oil will

fall (slightly); U.S. exports to the other oil importer will fall, U.S.

non—oil imports rise.

     The welfare consequences will depend on both the inItital set of

effects and the second round. The partial equilibrium analysis of Figure 1

will give the right results only if there is no second round. By in-

specting (l1) and (15), one can see that if the exchange rate does not

change, the effects will reduce to consumer and producer surplus in the

oil market. But the exchange rate can remain unchanged in only two ci rcum-

stances. Either OPEC must spend any marginal change in income entirely on

U.S. goods (a = 1); or U.S. goods must be perfect substitutes for foreign

          +    = co). Since neither of these seems reasonable, it is
goods (
necessary to go through a full-scale computation.

B. Assumed parameters.

     Tables I and II present the numbers that will be used in calculating

the impact of oil decontrol.   In Table I are the constant terms from the
                                                                         11.


model ; the model is normal ized so that at an exchange rate of one, these

constant terms are also the equilibrium values in the presence of price

controls on oil. The numbers are chosen so as roughly to reproduce the

situation in 1978, with the U.S. importing half its consumption. Several

unrealistic features should, however, be noted. First, the complexities

of the price regulations on U.S. oil production are ignored: all oil is

assumed to be sold at theaverage price. Second, the entitlements system

is assumed to work as planned; thus I ignore the apparent fact that per-

haps half of the rents from controls went to middlemen, not consumers.

Third, the effects of small-refiner bias are ignored. Finally, the

initial position is one of balanced trade, with the actual OPEC surplus

arid oil importer deficits eliminated by a proportional scaling-up of

OPEC's imports.

     Table II presents the assumed parameter values. These are all

slopes, but the final column shows the implied elasticity in the

neighbonhood of the initial equilibrium.   I have attempted to choose

reasonable values based on a variety of empirical estimates.

     Clearly, the numbers used here are far from being the best that

careful research could produce. Thus the results should be regarded as

illustrative rather than as a definitive estimate of the benefits and

costs of decontrol.


C. Partial equilibrium results

     For comparison purposes, it is useful to have an estimate     the

welfare effects of decontrol ignoring the exchange rate adjust: ::c. That

is, we can use the equations describing the U.S. oil market to compute a

conventional, partial equilibrium set of results. These results are re-

ported in Table III.   Oil imports are calculated to fall by about one

billion barrels, producing a net gain ot 1.9 billion dollars.   It is

noticeable that this net gain is quite small compared with the redis-

tribution of income from consumers to producers. (We should keep in mind,

however, that the actual redistribution has in practice been much smaller,

since consumers actually received only part of the benefits of controlled

prices, and since much of the increase in producer surplus is taxed away).

     This partial equilibrium estimate is, however, seriously misleading

in its measurement of the net gain. As we will see, a computation which

takes the international implications into account suggests much larger

gains.


C.   A full computation

     To solve for the tull effects of decontrol, we need to solve the

whole system (l)—(15). The results of this computation are given in

Tables IV and V. Table IV shis values of the key variables. According

to this calculation, decontrol produces a 3.6 percent appreciation of

the dollar.

     The dollar appreciation produces some important effects. There is

a slight fall in the dollar price of oil, meaning slightly less supply

and more demand than in the partial equilibrium estimate. Because the

foreign currency price of oil has increased, there is a slight fall in

rest—of-world oil imports. More importantly, there is a substantial

fall in exports, primarily because of the exchange rate appreciation but

to a limited extent because of reduced OPEC income. There is also a rise

 in non-oil imports. The important point to notice is that the changes in

 trade f1cis which offset the fall in oil imports occur mostly in reduced

 exports to and imports from the other oil importer.

     The most striking effect of the exchange rate cha     however, is

the way it modifies our estimates of the welfare effects of decontrol.

Table V reports these effects. There is a net gain of 7.5 billion dollars.

This compares with 1.9 billion dollars if we ignore the exchange rate

effect. Partial equilibriumestirnatesunderstate U.S. gains by nearly

 75 percent.

     Thesourcesof the extra gains are the slight fall in the price of

oil and, more importantly, the reduced price of non—oil imports. Note

also that all of the extra gains accrue to consumers, so that there is a

reduction in the distributional impact of decontrol (although consumers

still lose heavily).

     The lcier part of Table V accounts for the gains in terms of re-

sources released and used as a result of decontrol. Here we note that

the direct effects of decontrol are costs: less use of oil, and more

resources devoted to its production. The benefits come indirectly:

fewer goods and services must be provided to OPEC, and more can be imported

from and less exported to other oil importers.

     No doubt these numbers can be questioned in a number of ways. The

main point, though, is unlikely to change: the gains from decontrol

are realized primarily through a change in the terms of trade, and these

gains are substantially larger than a partial equilibrium calculation

would have suggested.

     It must be noticed, hc.iever, that the extra gains come in the form

of a redistribution trom other oil importers to the U.S., rather than at

OPEC's expense. For the past seven years, U.S. oM policy has been ham-

strung by questions of the internal distribution of income; what this

analysis does is to suggest that some of the concern has been misplaced,

and that we ought instead to worry more about the international distribu-

tional effects of U.S. policy.
