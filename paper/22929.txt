                                        ABSTRACT

This paper examines how housing market distress affects job search. Using data from a leading
online job search platform during the Great Recession, we find that job seekers in areas with
depressed housing markets apply for fewer jobs that require relocation. With their search
constrained geographically, job seekers broaden their search to lower level positions nearby.
These effects are stronger for job seekers with recourse mortgages, which we confirm using
spatial regression discontinuity analysis. Our findings suggest that housing market distress
distorts labor market outcomes by impeding household mobility.

       Over the five years following their peak in 2006, U.S. home values fell by more than

22%. The decline in home values, combined with record-high household leverage, evaporated

households’ housing wealth and set off a chain of events that pushed the U.S. economy into a

severe recession that reduced labor demand. During the recession, which started in December

2007, employers laid off more than 3.6 million workers and cut job openings by 44% (Bureau of

Labor Statistics 2009, 2012). Much less is known, however, about how the reduction in housing

wealth affected labor supply, including the location and types of jobs that individuals were

willing to take.

       A popular idea is that the housing bust affected labor supply by reducing household

mobility. Liquidity-constrained households might not have the cash required to sell a home with

negative equity. Even when a homeowner is not underwater, diminished home equity reduces the

amount of capital available to finance a down payment for a new home, which also “locks in”

workers to their current location (Stein 1995; Genesove and Mayer 1997). Home price declines

might further reduce mobility if households are sensitive to nominal loss aversion (Genesove and

Mayer 2001; Engelhardt 2003). Although households could avoid selling by becoming landlords

and renting elsewhere, preferences for homeownership and rental market frictions make this an

imperfect substitute. As a result, workers facing home price declines might be reluctant to apply

to positions that require relocation.1

       The housing bust could also affect labor supply through a wealth effect. When

unemployed workers have lower home equity and net worth, liquidity constraints can make them

more willing to accept lower level positions (Chetty 2008; Herkenhoff and Ohanian 2015;

1
  At the same time, house value declines could increase mobility if foreclosures force defaulting
homeowners out of their homes (Molloy and Shan 2013). We estimate the net effect. Even without price
changes, transactions costs of transferring homeownership could interfere with the labor market by
reducing workers’ mobility (McCormick 1983; Head and Lloyd-Ellis 2012; Blanchflower and Oswald
2013).


                                                 1
Herkenhoff, Phillips, and Cohen-Cole 2016). Consequently, households facing price declines

might increase applications to lower level jobs and those requiring only limited experience.2

        Little is known about the housing bust’s effect on labor supply, in part, because it is

challenging to separately identify the effect on labor supply from the effect on labor demand.

Through an aggregate demand channel, falling home values and tightening credit markets

suppress consumer spending, leading to a drop in consumer demand, firm production, and labor

demand (Eggertsson and Krugman 2012; Mian and Sufi 2011, 2014; Guerrieri and Lorenzoni

2015). With data only on employment or wages, it is impossible to separate the supply and

demand channels empirically. This paper exploits data from a large online job search platform to

overcome this identification challenge.3 With microdata on nearly four million job applications

across the U.S. between May 2008 and December 2009, we hold demand fixed and examine how

labor supply to specific jobs is affected by job seekers’ housing market conditions.

        During the Great Recession, house values and mortgage leverage varied substantially

both across locations and over time. Our first identification strategy exploits the fact that local

labor markets encompass many hyperlocal housing markets. Job seekers within a labor market

have access to the same job postings, but experience different local housing market

developments. Because the job application data contain no information on individual job

seeker’s homeownership or housing wealth, we examine job applications at the ZIP code-month

level. For example, within a given local labor market, we compare the changes in job search

strategies of applicants in ZIP codes that experienced relatively stable home prices with

applicants in nearby ZIP codes that experienced larger price declines.


2
  Debt overhang after house price declines could also lead job seekers to be choosier (Donaldson,
Piacentino, and Thakor 2015; Bernstein 2016). Again, we estimate the net effect.
3
  We were provided the data under a nondisclosure agreement that restricts us from identifying the online
platform. This agreement places no constraints on the conclusions of the analysis.


                                                   2
       We find that home value declines and limited home equity lead job seekers to focus their

searches on jobs within commuting distance of their home. A 30% decline in home value is

associated with a 15% decrease in the fraction of applications submitted to jobs out of the

applicants’ commuting zone. Highly indebted households appear to be particularly tied to their

homes: underwater homeowners apply to only half as many distant positions as homeowners

with abundant home equity.

       With their search constrained geographically, job seekers broaden their search in other

ways. They apply for more positions inside their commuting zone by expanding the types of jobs

to which they apply. Using job codes assigned by the online platform, we measure the

concentration of applicants’ job search using a Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) and find that

home price declines are associated with less focused local job search. These job codes and job

requirements also provide insight into the changing nature of the search. After home value

declines, job seekers tilt their search for nearby jobs toward lower level positions. They increase

applications to jobs that require little experience, decreasing the fraction of applications to

management and executive positions. Consistent with these changes being motivated by the cost

of relocation, the effects do not extend to search outside of the commuting zone or hold for ZIP

codes dominated by renters.

       These effects on job search are particularly pronounced in states with recourse

mortgages. Some U.S. states prohibit lenders from pursuing a homeowner’s other assets if he or

she defaults and the foreclosure sale does not cover the outstanding debt. Because recourse is

costly for defaulting homeowners, it makes sense for job seekers with recourse loans to be more

locked-in to their homes after a housing market crash than job seekers with nonrecourse loans.

Consequently, housing considerations affect job search the most in recourse states.




                                                3
       Although our first empirical approach is designed to control for the greatest identification

challenge (recession-induced variation in labor demand), that approach is susceptible to a subtle

selection bias among job seekers. If less mobile individuals within a ZIP code, such as those with

less education or those with school-age children, are more likely to search for jobs during

housing downturns, then the changes in job search that we estimate could reflect differences in

the pool of applicants as opposed to differences in housing-related incentives. To address this

potential concern, we exploit the discrete change in recourse laws at state borders.

       Using a spatial regression discontinuity framework, we compare ZIP codes near a

common state border where mortgage recourse changes. These applicants face the same job

opportunities and local economic conditions, yet their job search strategies change

discontinuously at the border. Job seekers on the side of the border with recourse mortgages

pursue fewer jobs that would require relocation and apply to a broader range and lower level of

positions, relative to their counterparts immediately across the border in a nonrecourse state.

These effects are strongest in high-income ZIP codes experiencing significant home value

declines, where we would expect homeowners to have other valuable assets and be most

sensitive to recourse.

       Together, the results of the panel and regression discontinuity analyses suggest that

housing market fluctuations distort job search. These results complement Bernstein (2016), who

finds that some homeowners strategically reduce labor supply when presented with the

opportunity for an income contingent mortgage modification. Our analysis shows that

nonstrategic motivations also affect distressed homeowners’ job search by shifting the location

and type of jobs sought. We find that distressed homeowners increase labor supply to some jobs

while decreasing labor supply to others.




                                                 4
       By impeding efficient matching in the labor market, housing market frictions likely

reduce aggregate productivity and contribute to the Yagan (2016) finding that individuals’

location at the onset of the Great Recession affected their labor market participation years later.

When workers do not apply to (and, therefore, are not hired for) jobs where their skills are most

valued, they forego opportunities to build their on-the-job experience and general human capital.

Constrained job search that leads to lower short-term and long-term earnings could exacerbate

households’ financial distress and reinforce workers’ reduced mobility. Firms may also suffer if

they are unable to attract workers from the national labor market, potentially preventing them

from hiring workers with appropriate skills. More generally, if migration facilitates knowledge

transfer between regions, then job seekers who are reluctant to relocate impose an externality on

productivity (Serafinelli 2012).

       We find that job seekers act as if declines in home value and negative home equity reduce

their ability to relocate. Although Ferreira, Gyourko, and Tracy (2010, 2012) find that negative

equity reduces property sales, it might not reduce households’ actual mobility if they rent out the

property or suffer a foreclosure-related eviction (Schulhofer-Wohl 2011). Using administrative

data from the Netherlands, Struyven (2014) finds that negative equity reduced Dutch owner-

occupied mobility during the Great Recession by 20%–25%.4 U.S. data are less complete, and

the results are mixed. Kothari, Saporta-Eksten, and Yu (2013) and Modestino and Dennett

(2013) find that the housing bust affected mobility in the U.S., but other studies find no or weak

evidence of housing-related mobility declines during the same period (Aaronson and Davis 2011;

Donovan and Schnure 2011; Molloy, Smith, and Wozniak 2011; Schmitt and Warner 2011;

Farber 2012; Coulson and Grieco 2013; Mumford and Schultz 2013; Bucks and Bricker 2016;

4
 Henley (1998) and Chan (2001) find qualitatively similar results in the UK and U.S. following home
value declines in the 1990s.


                                                5
Demyanyk, Hryshko, Luengo-Prado, and Sorensen 2016). Valletta (2013) finds no effect on

unemployment durations. Our results highlight the importance of recourse, which could explain

why housing distress would affect mobility more in the Netherlands than in the U.S. We are not

aware of any other empirical work linking the housing market and mobility to workers’ actual

labor supply decisions.

       It is possible that realized mobility (i.e., actual moves) provides only a coarse measure of

housing “lock in” during a deep recession, when job finding rates are low irrespective of search

intensity. Because the recession was geographically widespread, mobility (i.e., the ability to

move) might not have been particularly beneficial for the unemployed. Indeed, the realized

mobility of unemployed renters declined substantially during the Great Recession (Farber 2012),

even though we find that renters did not significantly reduce applications to jobs outside of their

commuting zone. When unable to find a job, even many mobile job seekers will not move.

Through this lens, our results are consistent with researchers’ conclusions that the persistent

unemployment following the Great Recession was more likely explained by reduced aggregate

demand than a structural (geographic) mismatch (e.g., Farber 2012; Kothari, Saporta-Eksten, and

Yu 2013).

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We describe the data in Section 1 and

results from the panel of ZIP codes in Section 2. Section 3 reports results from the spatial

regression discontinuity analysis of mortgage recourse at state borders, and Section 4 concludes.



1. Data

1.1. Job applications

       To explore the impact of housing market distress on labor supply, we examine the




                                                6
relationship between job seekers’ applications and their local housing market conditions. The job

application data come from a large online job search platform. The platform allows firms to post

job listings and job seekers to apply to these positions. The platform earns revenues from

companies posting positions and from advertising; job seekers use the platform for free. All job

listings include the job’s location and some list experience requirements. Unfortunately, few

listings include wages. Job seekers can browse job categories—filtering by location and job

characteristics—or search the platform using key words. For most applicants, we only observe

his or her ZIP code.

       As reported in Table 1, Panel A, the sample includes data on approximately 4 million job

applications to almost 60,000 jobs posted in the financial services industry between May 2008

and December 2009.5 The job search platform has declined to provide us with data from other

industries or time periods. The postings include a wide range of positions, including jobs in retail

branches (e.g., tellers, account executives, and financial advisors) and back-office jobs (e.g.,

telephone bankers, financial analysts, software engineers, and administrative assistants) and are

spread across all fifty U.S. states roughly in proportion to population. Applications are also

widely dispersed, coming from job seekers in 12,157 ZIP codes. To match the housing market

data, we aggregate applications to the ZIP code-month level for our analysis.

       Panel B of Table 1 reports characteristics of the applications. To classify the geographic

breadth of applicants’ search, we match each job applicant and posting to one of 709 commuting

zones, defined in 2000 by the U.S. Economic Research Service. Commuting zones delineate

local economies, not political boundaries, and approximate local labor markets (Autor and Dorn

2009, 2013). We scale the volume of applications using the ZIP code’s number of finance

5
  The data are a subsample of the more than 5.5 million applications used by Brown and Matsa (2016) to
study labor supply to financially distressed firms. The current analysis examines all applications that
include the job seekers’ ZIP code for which we observe housing market information.


                                                  7
workers (from the American Community Survey, 2008–2012). Job seekers apply to nearby

positions more frequently than they apply to positions located farther away. About three-quarters

of applications are to jobs inside the applicant’s commuting zone. In an average month, we

observe 18.1 applications per 1,000 finance workers inside the commuting zone and 7.2

applications outside.

       We also characterize the breadth of job search using a classification provided by the

online platform. Posted jobs are assigned up to four of nineteen job codes, such as administrative

and clerical, sales, customer service, management, executive, and entry level. We account for

heterogeneity in the positions by considering each combination of job codes as a unique job type.

By our job type classification, for example, a customer service management position is distinct

from a customer service entry-level position. We measure the concentration of applicants’ search

using a Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI), which is the sum of the squared market shares of the

job types in a ZIP code-month. Job search concentration, which can range from zero to 10,000,

averages about 2,500 and 3,000 inside and outside of the commuting zone, respectively.

       Postings’ job codes and experience requirements also indicate a job’s level of seniority.

Six to eight percent of applications are to management positions, less than one percent are to

executive positions, and two to three percent are to entry-level positions. About 11% of job

postings (8.5% of the total applications) specify the years of experience required for the position.

When applying to jobs in the applicant’s commuting zone that specify experience requirements,

15.2% of applications are to jobs requiring less than one year of experience. This percentage is

lower, 10.9%, when applying outside the commuting zone.




                                                 8
1.2. Housing and labor market conditions

       Housing and labor market conditions are summarized in Panel C of Table 1. To measure

housing market conditions, we use monthly estimates of median home values at the ZIP code-

level from Zillow to calculate how much home value declined in each ZIP code since January

2006, when home values peaked nationally. Large, positive values reflect large price drops.

Between May 2008 and December 2009 (our sample period), home values had fallen an average

of 9.4% from their peak.

       We estimate the impact of these price movements on homeowners’ home equity using

loan servicing information from CoreLogic’s Loan-Level Market Analytics database. For

purchase and refinance loans, we estimate the property value monthly by inflating (or deflating)

the appraised value at origination using the Zillow ZIP code home value index. To filter likely

data entry errors, we drop loans in the 1% tails of loan-to-value at origination. We also exclude

loans on commercial property, mixed-use property, residential property with five or more units,

manufactured housing, and property for which type is missing. On average in the sample period,

32.3% of mortgagors had loan-to-value ratios greater than 80%, and 10.3% owed more than their

home was worth.

       We also measure local labor market conditions in each month. We measure labor supply

in the commuting zone using the unemployment rate (constructed as the population-weighted

average of county-level data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) and measure labor

demand in the commuting zone using the number of finance jobs posted (in our application data)

divided by the total number of finance workers in March 2008 (U.S. Census Bureau’s County

Business Patterns). On average, the unemployment rate is 7.5%, and there are 5.6 job postings

per 1,000 workers.




                                               9
2. Panel analysis of job applications and home values

2.1. Geographic scope

       By reducing the funds available to finance the down payment for a new home (Stein

1995) or requiring a deficiency payment from the owner in order to sell the home, home value

declines could affect homeowners’ job search behavior by reducing their mobility. Figure 1

presents a binned scatterplot of the percent of out-of-commuting zone applications against home

value declines, along with a smoothed kernel-weighted local polynomial and its 95% confidence

interval. The pattern in the figure is striking: although nearly 30% of applications are to jobs out

of the local labor market when homes have appreciated, these applications fall sharply when

home values declines. Relative to places where prices remained flat, ZIP codes in which median

home values declined by 20 percentage points are associated with 10 percentage points fewer

applications submitted to jobs outside of the local labor market—about a one-third decrease.

       These results are robust to controlling for detailed fixed effects and labor market

conditions. Table 2 presents results from ZIP code-month regressions, where standard errors are

adjusted for clustering at the ZIP code level to account for correlation in unobserved

determinants of job seekers’ behavior in a ZIP code over time. In a specification without

controls, the estimated coefficient on home value decline is negative and statistically

significant—a 30% decrease in home value is associated with a 6.4 percentage point decline in

applications to jobs out of the commuting zone, which is a 27% drop relative to the mean

(column 1; p < 0.01). Month fixed effects, which account for changing aggregate economic

conditions, have little effect on the estimates (column 2). The specifications in columns 3 and 4

account for geography- and labor market-specific differences using 305 MSA or 353 commuting




                                                10
zone fixed effects. The estimated coefficient on the home value decline, albeit smaller in

magnitude, remains negative and highly statistically significant.

       Commuting zone fixed effects control only for fixed differences between local labor

markets. To control also for local developments in these markets over time, we include time-

varying proxies for labor supply and labor demand in the commuting zone: the local

unemployment rate and the local job posting-to-worker ratio. As reported in column 5, the

estimated coefficients on these controls have the expected signs. More local unemployment is

associated with more applications out of the commuting zone, suggesting that applicants expand

their search geographically when the local market is competitive. A scarcity of open positions

relative to the local labor force also encourages workers to consider moving to a different market

where they might be more likely to find a job. Including these controls for local labor market

conditions, however, has little effect on the coefficient on home value decline. A specification

with 691 three-digit ZIP code fixed effects accounts for even finer geographic heterogeneity and

also yields negative and statistically significant results (column 6; p < 0.01).

       The most demanding specification, presented in column 7, includes ZIP code fixed

effects in addition to the local labor market controls and month fixed effects. In this

specification, the relationship between home value and job seekers’ application behavior is

identified from changes in home value within the 12,157 individual ZIP codes over time and

after controlling for both aggregate temporal patterns and developments in the local labor

market. The estimated coefficient on the home value decline suggests that a 30% drop in value is

associated with a 4.7 percentage point decrease in out-of-commuting zone applications, which is

a nearly 20% decrease relative to the mean (p < 0.01).

       This decline in the percent of applications to jobs outside of the commuting zone reflects




                                                 11
both a reduction in applications to distant jobs and an increase in applications to nearby ones. In

Table 3, we report the effects on the application volume separately for jobs inside and outside the

commuting zone. For each type of application, we examine an indicator for whether any

applications were submitted in a ZIP code-month (extensive margin) and the log of the monthly

number of applications submitted per worker residing in the ZIP code (intensive margin). Similar

to column 7 of Table 2, these regressions control for ZIP code and month fixed effects and the

local labor market controls.

       A depressed home value is associated with decreased applications to jobs outside of the

commuting zone on both the extensive and intensive margins. A 30% drop in value is associated

with a 3.2 percentage point decrease in any distant applications (column 3; p < 0.01) and, when

there are distant applications, a 12.0 log point drop in the number (column 4; p < 0.01). These

results reinforce those in Table 2 and suggest that applicants facing housing distress shift their

job search away from positions that would require relocation.



2.2. Concentration and job type

       Housing market distress and lock-in also affect the types of jobs to which job seekers

apply. With less ability to pursue positions farther away, job seekers with diminished home

equity expand their job search inside their commuting zone and apply to positions they would

not have considered otherwise. As reported in Table 3, a 30% drop in home value is associated

with a 1.8 percentage point increase in any local applications (column 1; p < 0.01) and, when

there are local applications, a 6.0 log point increase in their number (column 2; p < 0.01).

       As these job seekers expand their search locally, they also broaden the types of positions

to which they apply. To study the breadth of applicants’ search, we examine the concentration




                                                 12
measure described in Section 1.1. A larger value reflects a more focused job search. Table 4

presents regressions of the concentration measure on home value decline and controls for month

fixed effects and labor market conditions. Columns 1–4, which include increasingly demanding

geographic controls, examine the concentration of applications to jobs inside the commuting

zone.

        After home values collapse, searches for nearby jobs become less focused. After

controlling for detailed geographic fixed effects at the three- or five-digit ZIP code levels, home

value declines are associated with less concentrated search for a position within the commuting

zone. 6 A 30% decline in home value is associated with a 100–150 unit decrease in the

concentration measure, which is a 4%–6% change relative to its mean (columns 3 and 4; p <

0.01). In contrast, as we would expect, home value declines do not decrease search concentration

among positions that require relocation. When examining applications to positions outside the

commuting zone, the coefficient on home value decline is positive, relatively small, and not

statistically significant (column 5).

        To explore the change in job search in greater detail, we examine job postings’ type

codes and experience requirements. In analysis reported in Table 5, we relate home value decline

to the percent of applications submitted to management positions, executive positions, entry-

level positions, and positions requiring less than one year of experience. The analysis in Panel A

examines applications to nearby jobs, whereas the analysis in Panel B examines applications to

distant ones. Similar to column 7 of Table 2, all specifications control for ZIP code and month

fixed effects and the local labor market controls.

6
 Estimates from specifications with less detailed geographic controls, reported in columns 1 and 2, are
small and not statistically significant. This pattern, which is consistent with depressed ZIP codes having
more focused searches before prices fall, underlines the importance of accounting for geographic
differences across ZIP codes in this analysis.


                                                   13
        As job seekers in distressed housing markets broaden their search, they become less

ambitious. When home values decrease, job seekers shift their local search away from

management and executive positions. A 30% decline in home values is associated with 13%

decrease in the fraction of local applications submitted to management positions (column 1; p <

0.01) and a 65% decrease in the fraction of applications to local executive job postings (column

2; p < 0.01), relative to their respective means. The opposite may be true for entry-level

positions, to which applications increase by 8%, although this estimate is not statistically

significant (column 3). Consistent with this interpretation, job seekers increase applications to

nearby positions requiring little work experience. A 30% decrease in home values is associated

with a 14 percentage point increase in applications to jobs requiring less than a year of

experience, almost doubling applications to those positions (column 4; p < 0.01).

        In contrast, distressed job seekers do not downgrade their search when applying to

positions that require relocation. When examining applications to positions outside of the

commuting zone, a 30% decrease in home values is associated with a 46% decrease in

applications to entry-level jobs, relative to the mean (column 7; p < 0.01). Although this effect is

small in absolute terms, it is consistent with distressed job seekers being unwilling to bear the

elevated costs of relocation for a low-level position. Although home value decreases are not

significantly related to the share of applications submitted to management positions (column 5),

executive positions (column 6), or positions requiring less than a year of work experience

(column 8), the point estimates for management positions and experience are consistent with the

entry-level results.

2.3. Heterogeneity in effect

2.3.1. Renters

       Housing market distress directly affects job seekers who own their home. We expect

renters to be much less sensitive to changes in local home prices, at least in partial equilibrium,

and therefore examine their job search as a falsification exercise. Although we cannot identify

individual applicants’ home ownership status, the homeownership rate in their ZIP code provides

a proxy for the likelihood the applicant is constrained by housing debt. To limit the sample to

mostly renters, we examine ZIP codes with homeownership rates below 25% in the 2000 U.S.

Census. We repeat the previous analysis on this sample and report the results in Table 6.

       As we would expect, renters’ job search patterns are less affected by the housing

market’s collapse. In ZIP codes dominated by renters, a 30% decline in home values is

associated with only 0.8 percentage points fewer applications out of the commuting zone

(column 1). The estimate for the breadth of job search is also smaller (column 2). Neither

estimate is statistically significant. These estimates are consistent with homeowners’ housing

market distress explaining the significant effects estimated in our main analytic sample.



2.3.2. Home equity

       Although loss averse homeowners would hesitate to sell even an unmortgaged home after

its value declines, we expect home price declines to have the greatest impact on highly indebted

mortgagors. Many households considering relocation rely on their current home equity to fund a

down payment on a new home. Thus, the less home equity available, the harder it is to move. In

addition to lacking equity to put toward a down payment, households holding underwater

mortgages must find cash to cover the shortfall to sell their home.




                                                15
       We examine the role of mortgage debt in shifting application behavior in analysis

reported in Table 7. As expected, low or negative home equity is associated with fewer

applications out of the commuting zone (column 1) and less concentrated local job search

(column 2). Assuming that only the applications of high loan-to-value mortgagors are affected,

the estimates imply that being underwater leads a homeowner to decrease applications out of his

or her local labor market by 12.6 percentage points, a more than 50% decline relative to the

mean. The effect is half as big for a household whose equity position is positive but less than

20% of the property value: these households decrease applications out of the commuting zone by

7.1 percentage points, an almost 30% decline. The pattern is reversed for job search

concentration, which decreases by over 50% for households with low positive home equity and

by 13% for underwater homeowners. Home equity thus appears to be an important mechanism

through which housing market distress affects homeowners’ job search strategies.



2.3.3. Recourse law

       Throughout the U.S., residential mortgage loans are secured by the property. If the

borrower defaults, the lender can seize and sell the property to collect on the debt. Homeowners

are also personally liable for their mortgage debt in most U.S. states. In these “recourse” states,

lenders can pursue other assets from the borrower to collect on any debt not covered by the

foreclosure sale. In states without recourse, however, borrowers can default on underwater

mortgages without any additional financial liability, because lenders cannot pursue borrowers’

other assets to recover the remaining debt. Although not all residents may be aware of a state’s

debtor protection laws, potential homebuyers and sellers are likely to be informed about recourse

by their realtors and lenders. Indeed, personal liability for mortgage debt has real effects.




                                                16
Borrowers are less likely to default on recourse mortgages, even when they have substantial

negative home equity (Jones 1993; Bhutta, Dokko and Shan 2010; Ghent and Kudlyak 2011).

        If housing market conditions affect job seekers’ labor supply decisions, then we would

expect to find different patterns in recourse and nonrecourse states. Figure 2 displays the nine

states with nonrecourse mortgages, based on the classification by Ghent and Kudlyak (2011).7

Because recourse is costly for defaulting homeowners, we expect job seekers with recourse loans

to be more locked-in to their homes after home values crash than job seekers with nonrecourse

loans. As a result, job seekers facing diminished home values in recourse states are likely to

engage in more geographically constrained search than other job seekers.

        To explore this possibility, we interact home value declines with a recourse indicator in

our regression framework and control for local labor market conditions, ZIP code fixed effects,

and separate month fixed effects in recourse and nonrecourse states. Because recourse varies

only at the state level, its main effect is absorbed by the ZIP code fixed effects. The results are

reported in Table 8.

        The geographic breadth of job search is most sensitive to home value declines in recourse

states, where defaulting is particularly costly. Housing market conditions have little effect on the

geographic breadth of job search in states with nonrecourse mortgages: the coefficient estimate

on the uninteracted home value measure is small and not statistically significant. However, the

coefficient estimate on the interaction is sizeable and statistically significant, suggesting that job

search in recourse states is much more sensitive to housing market conditions. Relative to

nonrecourse states, a 30% decline in home values in a recourse state is associated with 5.1

percentage points fewer applications out of the commuting zone, which is more than a fifth of

7
  California and North Carolina allow a mix of recourse and nonrecourse mortgages. Because we do not
observe individual loans, we classify these states as recourse, but the results are similar if we classify
them as nonrecourse or drop these states altogether.


                                                   17
the sample mean (column 1; p < 0.01).

       In-commuting zone job search concentration also responds to housing market distress

differently in recourse and nonrecourse states. Whereas home price declines are associated with

more focused job search in nonrecourse states, the declines are associated with less focused

search in recourse areas, where job seekers are more locked-in to their homes. Relative to

nonrecourse states, a 30% decline in home values in a recourse state is associated with a 310 unit

increase in search concentration, which is about 12% of the sample mean (column 2; p < 0.01).



3. Regression discontinuity analysis

       Although our panel analysis finds a robust relationship between home value and the

breadth of job search in both geography and type, one might wonder whether the results reflect

differences in the type of workers seeking jobs during economic downturns instead of changes in

a consistent type of workers’ job search. For example, less educated workers are both less mobile

(Machin, Salvanes, and Pelkonen 2012) and more exposed to job loss during recessions (Hoynes,

Miller, and Schaller 2012). Thus one might ask if the shift in applications toward jobs inside the

commuting zone could be because less educated workers are searching, not because of the

changing housing market conditions. To address this possibility, we employ a second

identification strategy that compares the applications of job seekers, in a narrow region near a

state border, who face the same local economic conditions but different housing market-related

incentives because of different laws regarding mortgage recourse on either side of the border.

       To exploit the discontinuity in recourse regimes at state borders, we restrict the sample to

ZIP codes within 50 miles of borders at which recourse laws change. Figure 2 marks the

centroids of these ZIP codes on a map of the U.S., using red circles in recourse states and blue




                                               18
Xs in nonrecourse ones. This cross-state variation in debtor protection laws results from

historical factors, such as foreclosure rates on farms during the Great Depression, and is

unrelated to recent aggregate shocks or these narrow regions of the states that we analyze (Ghent

2014; Dobbie and Goldsmith-Pinkham 2015). By comparing job seekers across these

neighboring jurisdictions with different recourse regimes, we can confirm that housing market

incentives influence job seekers’ applications.

       The ZIP codes on either side of these borders are quite similar. Table 9 summarizes

demographic and economic characteristics of the two sets of ZIP codes, including age, race,

education, household income, marital status, household size, population density, owner

occupancy, historical mobility, and prevalence of low home equity. The ZIP codes appear very

similar across these dimensions. Table 9 also reports the p-value of the difference in means,

adjusting for clustering at the state level. There is no statistically significant difference in almost

all of the ZIP code characteristics analyzed. Of the 38 variables analyzed, only two age measures

(under 5 years and over 65 years) and one race measure (black) are statistically different at the

10% level. As discussed below, the results of the regression discontinuity analysis are robust to

including controls for age and race.

       To further ensure that we only compare ZIP codes that are in close proximity, we follow

Mian, Sufi, and Trebbi (2015) and divide the borders into 10-mile strips. The resulting 10-mile

by 50-mile strips of ZIP codes are perpendicular to the state border, and each strip is specific to a

border pair (e.g., Minnesota-South Dakota). Throughout our analysis, we control for very local

conditions by including fixed effects for these strips. As such, we compare only ZIP codes that

lie in the same 10-mile strip running across the state border in question. We also interact these

border strip fixed effects with commuting zone fixed effects to ensure that all comparisons are




                                                  19
within the same commuting zone. For conciseness, we refer to these interacted fixed effects as

simply “location” fixed effects.



3.1 Geographic scope

       Table 10 reports results from regressions of the percent of applications out of the

commuting zone on an indicator for whether the state allows recourse mortgages, as well as

month and location fixed effects. Job seekers submit 37 percentage points fewer applications to

jobs outside of the commuting zone on the recourse side of the border (columns 1; p < 0.01).

After including additional controls for the distance to the border, distance squared, and distance

cubed, the estimate’s magnitude reduces to 21 percentage points but is still highly statistically

significant (columns 2; p < 0.01).

       Because recourse allows lenders to seek deficiency payments from defaulting

homeowners, recourse is most salient for homeowners with other valuable assets. In contrast,

borrowers without substantial wealth beyond their homes face similar repercussions regardless of

recourse. As a proxy for homeowners’ wealth, we use ZIP codes’ average adjusted gross income

(AGI) from the Internal Revenue Service’s Statistics of Income for September 2008. We repeat

the analysis from column 2 separately on above-median and below-median AGI ZIP codes and

report the results in columns 3 and 4, respectively. Recourse is associated with geographically

narrower job search in high-income areas but not in low-income areas. In high-income ZIP

codes, job seekers apply to 22.5 percentage point more jobs outside of the commuting zone on

the recourse side of the border than on the nonrecourse side (column 3; p < 0.01). But there is

essentially no difference in lower income areas (column 4; p = 0.83).

       The discontinuity at the border is readily apparent in a nonparametric analysis. Figure 3




                                               20
depicts the percent of applications submitted to jobs outside of the commuting zone in high-

income ZIP codes near state borders where recourse changes. We regress this variable on 50

indicators for each one-mile interval on either side of the border, with negative values in states

with recourse mortgages, as well as month and location fixed effects. The figure plots the

coefficient estimates on the distance indicators in those regressions, along with separate

smoothed kernel-weighted local polynomials on either side of the border and their 95%

confidence intervals. The vertical line represents the state border. ZIP codes in states with

recourse mortgages are on the left and ZIP codes without recourse are on the right.

       Figure 3 reveals a sizeable jump in applications to distant positions. Job seekers in states

with recourse mortgages submit substantially fewer applications to jobs outside of their

commuting zone relative to their counterparts, just across the state border, who hold nonrecourse

mortgages. Although the average fraction of applications to distant positions is somewhat flat as

you approach the state border from either side, it jumps discontinuously at the border. Like in the

panel analysis reported in Section 2, these reductions seem to reflect both a decrease in

applications to distant positions and an increase in applications to positions nearby (see

Appendix Figure A1 and Appendix Table A1).

       Border ZIP codes in recourse and nonrecourse states are statistically indistinguishable in

almost any dimension (see Table 9); however, there are small but statistically significant

differences in the prevalence of child, elderly, and black residents. We suspect that these

differences result from random variation. Nevertheless, to confirm that these differences cannot

explain the regression discontinuity results, we augment the specification in column 3 of Table

10 with the full set of age and race variables listed in Table 9 and report the results in column 5.

The jump at the border remains similar in magnitude and is statistically significant (p < 0.05).




                                                21
       We would expect recourse to be most limiting after home values decline substantially.

Absent a price drop, homeowners are unlikely to be underwater or face a shortfall in default. In a

final specification, we use an indicator to control for ZIP codes with above median declines in

home value and interact this variable with the recourse indicator. As expected, we find that

applications to distant positions are particularly sensitive to recourse eligibility in places that

experience large price drops. The coefficient estimate on the interaction of recourse and large

price declines is negative and statistically significant. The jump at the border in applications to

jobs outside of the commuting zone is 6.1 percentage points larger in areas suffering more

substantial price declines (column 6; p < 0.05). This interaction provides further evidence that

the differences in job search behavior are tied to housing related lock-in.



3.2 Concentration and job types

       Results from the regression discontinuity analysis also confirm our findings about the

concentration of applications and types of jobs sought. Table 12 reports results for the

concentration of local job search. Except for the dependent variable, the specifications are the

same as those presented in Table 11. With their search constrained geographically, job seekers in

states with recourse mortgages search more broadly for positions within commuting distance

from their home. Job seekers on the recourse side of the border search with 1,000–1,900 units

less concentration than job seekers on the opposite side, a 40%–75% reduction relative to the

overall sample mean (columns 1 and 2; p < 0.05).

       The effect of recourse on job search concentration comes from high-income ZIP codes, as

we would expect. In high-income areas, job search concentration is 1,200 units lower on the

recourse side of the border than on the nonrecourse side, a 50% reduction relative to the mean of



                                                 22
2,400 in high-income areas (column 3; p < 0.01). This pattern is not present in low-income ZIP

codes, whether the difference is positive, smaller, and not statistically significant (column 4; p =

0.37).

         Figure 4, Panel A, displays these results nonparametrically and reveals a discrete jump in

local search concentration at the state border. When searching for jobs in their commuting zone,

job seekers in states with recourse mortgages submit substantially less concentrated applications

than their counterparts, just across the state border, who hold nonrecourse mortgages.

Furthermore, the applications’ average concentration is mostly flat as you approach the state

border from either side, and it jumps discontinuously at the border.

         We also examine the concentration of search for distant positions as a falsification test. If

job seekers in states with recourse mortgages search more broadly for nearby positions because

reduced mobility constrains their search geographically, then we would not expect the same

effects on their search for distant positions. Figure 4, Panel B, plots the concentration of

applications to positions outside of the job seeker’s commuting zone. The concentration of these

applications is flat over the whole region, including at the border. The regression analysis also

detects no significant difference (Table 11, column 7; p = 0.24). This result provides further

evidence of the similarity of job seekers on either side of the border in actions not affected by

recourse.

         Finally, we confirm that recourse reduces local job search concentration the most in areas

suffering large price declines. As reported in column 6 of Table 11, the coefficient estimate on

the interaction of recourse and large price declines is negative and statistically significant. The

drop in the concentration of in-commuting zone applications at the border is 330 units larger in

areas suffering substantial price declines (column 6; p < 0.01). This interaction further reinforces




                                                  23
the conclusion that housing distress creates lock-in that affects labor supply.

       The regression discontinuity analysis also confirms that, as job seekers in distressed

housing markets broaden their search, they become less ambitious. Table 12 reports effects on

the percent of applications submitted to each of the job types examined in Table 5, presented

separately for jobs in (Panel A) and out (Panel B) of the commuting zone. The regressions,

which control for month and location fixed effects and a flexible function of distance to the

border, are restricted to ZIP codes with above median income.

       Job seekers on the side of state borders with recourse mortgages tilt their search toward

lower level jobs nearby. When searching for positions in their commuting zone, job seekers

submit 59% more applications to entry-level positions (column 3; p < 0.10) and 40% more

applications to jobs requiring less than one year of experience (column 4; p < 0.01), relative to

the overall sample means. As a result, the share of applications to management positions drops

by 28% (column 1; p < 0.05). Although it is imprecisely estimated, the point estimate suggests

that recourse also reduces applications to executive positions by 54% (column 2; p = 0.43).

Appendix Figure A2 plots the discontinuities in these variables at the state borders.

       As we would expect, recourse does not cause a similar tilt in applicants’ search for jobs

that require relocation. We find no evidence that jobs seekers with recourse mortgages apply for

more entry-level or limited-experience positions when searching for positions outside of their

commuting zone (columns 7 and 8). If anything, these job seekers appear to shift their search for

distant jobs in the other direction, increasing applications to management positions by 35%

(column 5; p < 0.01). Although it is again imprecisely estimated, the point estimate suggests that

recourse also increases applications to executive positions by 84% (column 6; p = 0.27).

Appendix Figure A3 plots the discontinuities in these variables at the state borders. These effects




                                                 24
are consistent with locked-in job seekers being willing to bear the elevated costs of relocation

only for a high-level position.



4. Conclusion

       We match a unique data set from a large online job search platform to housing market

data to explore the relationship between home values and workers’ labor supply decisions. We

find that home value declines and negative equity lead job seekers to focus their searches on jobs

within their commuting zone. Constrained geographically, job seekers broaden their search in

other ways by considering lower level positions and those requiring less experience. These

effects are more pronounced in recourse states where lenders can go after a defaulting

homeowner’s other assets. As a result, we find discontinuous jumps in workers’ job search

strategies at borders between recourse and nonrecourse states. After house values decline, it

appears that job seekers lack the liquidity to fund the down payment for a new home or a

protracted job search.

       Housing-related constraints on job search have mixed implications for firms. When

workers focus their searches on jobs nearby, firms lose access to the national labor market. At

the same time, in areas where job seekers are locked in to their homes, firms face less

competition from the broader labor market. These firms gain access to workers who are more

qualified for a given position and, potentially, hire workers at lower cost.

       From the workers’ perspective, these outcomes are costly and potentially long-lived.

Workers who accept positions below their skill or experience levels forego opportunities to build

their human capital. Moreover, constrained workers, who apply to jobs they would otherwise

have avoided, crowd out other job seekers. For example, an experienced manager who applies to




                                                 25
a lower level position can displace a younger worker from that job opportunity. Even if housing

market constraints are short-lived, they can impose long run costs on both workers. Indeed,

employment status during a recession affects labor market outcomes years later (Yagan 2016).

The broader labor market impact and distributional consequences of constrained mobility are

important areas for future research.

                Applications out of the commuting zone and home values




This figure presents a binned scatterplot of the percent of applications to jobs out of the
commuting zone against home value decline (from January 2006, %). The sample consist of
ZIP code-months between May 2008 and December 2009, and the bins are two units wide.
Percent of applications out of the commuting zone is weighted by the total number of
applications submitted from the ZIP code that month. The lines represent a smoothed kernel-
weighted local polynomial and its 95% confidence interval, calculated by bootstrapping
clustered at the ZIP code level.

       Nonrecourse
       Recourse


This figure categorizes states in the contiguous U.S. by whether most residential mortgage lenders can seize a
borrower’s personal assets if the borrower defaults and owes more than the property is worth. Alaska has nonrecourse
mortgages, and Hawaii allows recourse. ZIP codes within 50 miles of state borders where recourse law changes are
marked with blue Xs (nonrecourse) and red circles (recourse).

                 Percent of applications to jobs out of the commuting zone




This figure plots the percent of applications to jobs out of the commuting zone for the months
between May 2008 and December 2009 for U.S. ZIP codes that are near a state border where
recourse law changes and had above median adjusted gross income in 2006. We regress the
percent of applications on one-mile distance-to-the-border indicators, and month and location
(10-mile border strip × commuting zone) fixed effects. The distances are labeled as negative for
states with recourse mortgages. The figure plots the coefficients on these dummies, along with
separate smoothed kernel-weighted local polynomials on either side of the border and their 95%
confidence intervals.

These figures plot the concentration of applications to jobs in (Panel A) and out (Panel B) of the commuting zone for the
months between May 2008 and December 2009 for U.S. ZIP codes that are near a state border where recourse law changes and
had above median adjusted gross income in 2006. Variables are defined as in Table 1, and the methodology used is the same as
in Figure 3. The distances are labeled as negative for states with recourse mortgages.

This table reports summary statistics for the application sample, which includes applications to 59,469 jobs
at large financial services firms between May 2008 and December 2009. Panel A describes the job
postings. Panel B summarizes application characteristics separately for jobs in and out of the applicant‘s
commuting zone, as defined by the U.S. Economic Research Service in 2000. The percent of total
applications in (and out) of the commuting zone is weighted by the number of applications submitted from
the ZIP code that month. The volume of applications is scaled by the number of finance workers (in
thousands) in the ZIP code, based on the American Community Survey, 2008–2012. Posted jobs are
assigned up to four of nineteen job codes by the online platform, and each combination of job codes
defines a unique job type. The concentration of applications is measured by a Herfindahl-Hirschman index
based on the shares of these job types in a ZIP code-month. Management, executive, and entry-level
positions are classified using the job codes. These job type variables are weighted by the number of
applications submitted to jobs in (or out) of the commuting zone from the ZIP code that month. Required
experience is weighted by the number of applications for which experience information is available (in the
commuting zone, mean = 5.2, SD = 7.5, N = 40,984; out of the commuting zone, mean = 3.5 SD = 3.1, N
= 29,628). Panel C describes local economic conditions. ZIP code-level home value decline since January
2006 is based on monthly estimates of median home value from Zillow. Home equity measures are
estimated from CoreLogic’s Loan-Level Market Analytics database. The commuting zone unemployment
rate is the weighted average of county-level data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of
jobs posted in the commuting zone is divided by the total number of finance workers (in thousands) in
March 2008, based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns.

This table summarizes results from regressions of the concentration of applications on the ZIP code-
level home value decline. All regressions include monthly measures of local labor market conditions
and month fixed effects. Where indicated, regressions also include fixed effects for metropolitan
statistical area (MSA), commuting zone, three-digit ZIP code, and five-digit ZIP code. Variables are
defined as in Table 1. Regressions are weighted by the number of applications submitted to jobs in
(columns 1–4) or out (column 5) of the commuting zone from the ZIP code that month. Standard errors,
adjusted for clustering at the ZIP code level, are reported in parentheses. * and *** indicate statistical
significance at the 10% and 1% level, respectively.

This table summarizes results from regressions of the percent of applications
out of the commuting zone or the concentration of applications in the
commuting zone on the ZIP code-level home value decline and its interaction
with an indicator for whether mortgage lenders in the state typically have
recourse against borrowers’ other assets. All regressions include monthly
measures of local labor market conditions and fixed effects for month and ZIP
code. The main effect of recourse is absorbed by the ZIP code fixed effects.
The regression in column 1 is weighted by the total number of applications
from the ZIP code that month, whereas the regression in column 2 is weighted
by the number of applications submitted to jobs in the commuting zone.
Variables are defined as in Table 1. Standard errors, adjusted for clustering at
the ZIP code level, are reported in parentheses. * and *** indicate statistical
significance at the 10% and 1% level, respectively.

This table reports summary statistics for ZIP codes within 50 miles of state borders where the
recourse law changes. Means, standard deviations, and p- values of the difference in means, adjusted
for clustering at the state level, are reported. Home equity measures are ZIP code averages for May
2008 to December 2009, estimated from CoreLogic’s Loan-Level Market Analytics database.
Distance to commuting zone border is the geodesic distance. All other ZIP code characteristics are
from the 2000 U.S. Census.

This table summarizes results from regressions of the percent of applications out of the commuting zone on an indicator for
whether mortgage lenders in the state typically have recourse against borrowers’ other assets, after restricting the sample to
ZIP codes within 50 miles of state borders where recourse law changes. All regressions include month and location (10-
mile border strip × commuting zone) fixed effects. Where indicated, regressions include controls for distance to the state
border, and the age and race variables listed in Table 9. High (low) wealth ZIP codes are ones with above (below) median
adjusted gross income in 2006. The specification in column 6 includes an uninteracted indicator for ZIP codes that
experienced an above median price decline. Variables are defined as in Table 1. Regressions are weighted by the number of
applications submitted from the ZIP code that month. Standard errors, adjusted for clustering at the state level, are reported
in parentheses. ** and *** indicate statistical significance at the 5% and 1% level, respectively.

various types for the months between May 2008 and December 2009 for U.S. ZIP codes that
are near a state border where recourse law changes and had above median adjusted gross
income in 2006. Variables are defined as in Table 1, and the methodology used is the same
as in Figure 3. The distances are labeled as negative for states with recourse mortgages.

This table summarizes results from regressions of measures of the volume of applications on an
indicator for whether mortgage lenders in the state typically have recourse against borrowers’ other
assets, after restricting the sample to ZIP codes within 50 miles of state borders where recourse law
changes. The specification is the same as in column 3 of Table 10. Variables are defined as in Table
1. Standard errors, adjusted for clustering at the state level, are reported in parentheses.
