We study the effect of exporting on the organization of production within firms. Using French
employer-employee matched data together with data on a firm’s exporting activity, we find that
firms that enter the export market and expand substantially reorganize by adding layers of
management, hiring more and paying, on average, lower wages to workers in all pre-existing
layers. In contrast, firms that enter the export market and expand little do not reorganize and pay
higher average wages in all pre-existing layers. We then present some evidence that these effects
are causal using pre-sample variation in the destination composition of exports, in conjunction
with real exchange rate variation across countries. Our results are consistent with a growing
literature using occupations to study the internal structure of firms and how their organization
responds to opportunities in export markets.

1    Introduction
Exporting a¤ects the organization of production. In order to produce at the scale needed to access
export markets, …rms need to hire teams of workers with a di¤erent set of skills, pay them di¤erent
wages, and give them di¤erent roles within the organization. In this paper we explore how a …rm’s
organization reacts to new or improved export opportunities. Guided by the theory of knowledge-
based hierarchies,1 we understand organization as the characteristic and roles played by the workers
within a …rm. Hence, we explore how the number of management layers, as well as the number of
workers and wages in each of these layers, change when the …rm starts exporting or expands its
presence in foreign markets. Our goal is to document these relationships and attempt to rationalize
them using available theories. Given that these reorganizations have important implications for the
size, hiring practices, and productivity of exporting …rms, the …ndings are relevant to understand
the overall e¤ects of trade liberalizations, as demonstrated by Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012,
from now on CRH).
    We follow the work in Caliendo, Monte and Rossi-Hansberg (2015, from now on CMRH) that
uses matched employer-employee data to document empirically how …rms change their organization
when they grow. The paper identi…es four hierarchical layers of the …rm using a French classi…cation
of occupations (PCS) based on an occupation’s hierarchical position in the …rm. That paper shows
that …rms actively manage their organizational structure. When they grow substantially, they
reorganize by adding a layer of management,2 lowering average wages in all preexisting layers of
the …rm (including the layer of workers), and hiring more employees in all of these layers. In
contrast, when they grow little, they tend not to reorganize, and so they grow by adding workers
in preexisting layers and increasing average wages. This behavior can be rationalized using the
theory of knowledge-based hierarchies. Firms that grow substantially want to economize on costly
knowledge by concentrating it into a few managers and lowering the knowledge of workers that
do more routine tasks. Hence they add a management layer and lower skill, and consequently
average wages, in preexisting layers. Firms that grow little do not …nd this change pro…table
since it requires a more costly management structure, so they prefer to grow by hiring more and
better workers and managers in preexisting layers that require less managerial help. In follow
up work, using Portuguese data, Caliendo, Mion, Opromolla and Rossi-Hansberg (2015) con…rm
these …ndings for an additional country, but more importantly, show that they are associated with
changes in quantity-based measures of productivity of the …rm. So, reorganizations that add layers
also increase the ability of the …rm to transform inputs into physical units of output.
    None of our work so far, however, has studied empirically the relationship between organization
and exporting. This is our aim in this paper using the same French dataset that we used in CMRH.
This data covers the vast majority of French manufacturing …rms during the period 2002-2007.3

Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012).

     Adding a layer is identi…ed empirically as hiring an agent in an occupation classi…ed in a layer where the …rm
did not hire before.

     We refer the reader to CMRH for a detailed description of this data.


                                                        2
We start by exploring the organization of exporters relative to non-exporters. Exporters are larger,
employ more hours of labor, pay higher wages, and have more layers. Firms with more layers are
much more likely to be exporters. For example, among …rms with three layers of management (the
highest number of layers given that they also have a layer of workers), 90.2% of the value added is
generated by …rms that also export. All of these facts are consistent with the standard …nding in
the literature that exporters are larger and are also consistent with CRH where larger …rms have
weakly more layers. Hence, it is perhaps more interesting to turn our attention to new exporters.
      We …nd that new exporters are more likely to add layers than non-exporters (and symmetrically
…rms that exit exporting are more likely to drop layers). In addition, new exporters that add layers
decrease average wages in existing layers while exporters that do not add layers increase them.
The well-known …nding (see Bernard and Jensen 1995, 1997, and Verhoogen 2008) that …rms that
become exporters pay higher wages is the result of a composition e¤ect. In fact, the …rms that
expand signi…cantly as a result of exporting, namely, the ones that add layers, reduce average
wages. Furthermore, they do so at all pre-existing layers. In contrast, new exporters that do not
change layers barely expand but do increase wages. Since there are more new exporters that do
not change layers than there are exporters that do change layers, the average e¤ect on wages is
positive but small. The result is relevant for the conceptualization of new exporters. The notion
that new exporters expand and increase the wages of their employees either because they upgrade
their technology (and so the marginal product of labor is higher) or because pro…ts are higher
and they share them with workers (via a wage sharing or bargaining mechanism) is at odds with
our data.4 The data are consistent with a view in which new exporters that expand signi…cantly
change their organizational design and economize on knowledge by employing less knowledgeable
employees who are paid less.
      The …ndings above do not document the causal e¤ect of exporting on organization, but rather
the fact that exporting and organizational change are related in the data. To try to measure
the causal e¤ect of exporting on organization, we exploit pre-sample variation in the destination
composition of a …rm’s exports, in conjunction with real exchange rate variation across countries,
to build an instrument for exports. Similar instruments were used by Bertrand (2004), Brambilla
et al. (2012), Revenga (1992), and Verhoogen, (2008). We then use this instrument to evaluate if
the probability of adding layers is causally related to increases in exports. We …nd that the …rst
stage is somewhat noisy and weak across the subsamples of …rms with di¤erent numbers of layers,
but the second stage shows that for …rms with one, two or three layers exporting does increase the
probability of adding layers signi…cantly. The result is not signi…cant for …rms with four layers,
perhaps due to the fact that our identi…cation of layers in the data allows for a maximum of only
four layers so those …rms can only reduce the number of layers. Perhaps more interesting is that,
using this instrument, the causal e¤ect of increases in the number of layers due to better access to
foreign markets is to reduce wages in preexisting layers and to increase the number of employees

    Felbermayr, et al. (2008), Egger and Kreickemeier (2009), Helpman, et al. (2010) and Eaton, et al. (2011a)
propose models were the exporter-wage premium is the outcome of a bargaining mechanism.



                                                      3
in all of them. This holds for all layers in …rms with any number of layers. More work is needed
to establish this causality de…nitively, and we discuss several other papers that have tried to do so
with other samples of …rms and countries in Section 5, but this evidence is, we believe, encouraging.
         The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reproduces some of the theory in CRH
to clarify the logic behind the relationships that we look for in the data. Section 3 presents the
empirical description of the relationship between organization and exporting. Section 4 represents
our causal results and Section 5 reviews the related literature using occupations to understand the
organization of the …rm and its relationship to foreign markets in a variety of countries. Section 6
concludes.


2          Exports and Reorganization: Theoretical Implications
In this section we discuss brie‡y the framework in CRH. Given that the purpose of the current
paper is to describe and understand the data, we present the theory in its simplest form and do
not discuss all the details fully. The interested reader is directed to CRH for the more technical
discussions and all proofs of the results.
         We consider an economy with N identical agents. Agents acquire knowledge in order to solve
the problems they encounter during production. Agents that acquire more knowledge command
higher wages according to a function w (z) with @w (z) =@z > 0.5
         Firms are started and organized by a CEO. She pays a …xed entry cost f E in units of labor
to design her product. After doing so, she obtains a demand draw                       from a known distribution
G( ): The draw                       determines the level of demand of the …rm. If the entrepreneur decides to
produce, she pays a …xed cost f in units of labor. Production requires labor and knowledge. Agents
employed in a …rm act as production workers (layer ` = 0) or managers (layers `                     1). We denote
by       n`L ,   zL` ,   and    `;
                               wL    the number, knowledge, and total wage of employees at layer ` = 0; 1; 2::: of
an organization with L layers of management (or L + 1 layers of employees, given that we call the
layer of workers layer zero). Workers use their unit of time to generate a production possibility that
can yield one unit of output. For output to be realized, the worker needs to solve a problem drawn
from a distribution F (z) with F 00 (z) < 0: Workers learn how to solve the most frequent problems,
the ones in the interval 0; zL0 : If the problem they face falls in 0; zL0 ; production is realized;
otherwise, they can ask a manager one layer above how to solve the problem. Managers spend h
units of their time on each problem that gets to them. A manager at layer ` = 1 tries to solve the
problems workers could not solve. Hence, they learn how to solve problems in zL0 ; zL0 + zL1 . In
                                                                                 P
general, the …rm needs n`L = hn0L (1 F (ZL` 1 )) managers of layer `; where ZL` = `l=0 zLl :6
         Let C (q; w) denote the minimum variable cost of producing q units, and CL (q; w) the same
     5
      In CRH the wage is interpreted as the compensation for the time endoment of the workers, w; plus the compen-
sating di¤erential for the cost of acquiring knowledge. Learning how to solve problems in an interval of knowledge
of length z costs wcz (c teachers per unit of knowledge at cost w per teacher). Hence, the total wage of an employee
with knowledge z is given by w (z) = w[cz + 1]:
    6
      To derive some of the implications of the theory, CRH specify the distribution of problems as an exponential, so
F (z) = 1 e z .


                                                                4

an equilibrium wage function w ( ). Then, the organizational problem of the …rm is given by,
                                                                              XL

                             n`L = hn0L [1        F (ZL` 1 )] for L      ` > 0;                    (4)

                              L    = 1:                                                            (5)

So one entrepreneur, nL                                                                 `
                      L = 1; chooses the number of layers, L, employees at each layer, nL ; and
the interval of knowledge that they acquire, zL` , subject to the output constraint (2), the prevailing
wage function (3) and the time constraints of employees at each layer (4).
   The problem above has several implications on the internal organization of …rms as they grow.
Consider …rst the choices zL` and n`L as function of q, but conditional on L. That is, consider
a …rm that decides to produce more without changing the number of layers, that is, without
reorganizing. To expand production, the …rm needs to increase either total knowledge, ZLL ; or
the number of workers, n0L : Since knowledge and the number of workers are linked through the
time constraint (4), the …rm does a bit of both. The only way to have more workers is to make
them more knowledgeable so they ask less often and the CEO can have a larger span of control.
Since the knowledge of agents at di¤erent layers is complementary, the …rm does so at all layers.
Hence, the number of workers in all layers increases, as does the knowledge and, consequently,
wages of all workers. Note also that since every worker has to learn more in order to expand the
…rm, the marginal cost of production is increasing in quantity conditional on the number of layers
(@ 2 CL (q; w) =@q 2 = @M CL (q; w) =@q > 0). It is increasingly costly to expand production in an
organization with a …xed organizational structure as re‡ected by the number of layers.
   In contrast, as proven in CRH, as …rms increase the number of layers by one in order to produce
more, the number of agents in each layer increases and the knowledge in all pre-existing layers, and
therefore the wage, decreases. The logic is straightforward. Firms add layers to economize on the
knowledge of their workers. So when they add a new top layer, they make the new manager deal
with the rare problems and make lower level employees know less, and consequently they pay them
less. The lower knowledge in all pre-existing layers reduces, by equation (4), the span of control
of each manager in the organization. However, the number of employees in all layers still goes up
since the span of control of the new top manager is larger than one. The marginal cost also declines
discontinuously at the quantity produced where the …rm adds a layer. The organization is building
capacity by adding an extra layer, and that reduces the marginal cost discontinuously.
   So far we have not said anything about how the quantity produced is determined. To do so we
need to turn to the pro…t maximization and entry decision of the …rm. CRH embed the cost function


                                                       5
discussed above into a standard Melitz (2003) type framework with heterogeneity in demand. The
model in CRH also allows us to study the e¤ect of a new opportunity to export on the organization
of …rms. We sketch some of those arguments here.
    We now embed our economy, that we denote by i, in a world with J foreign countries, with
typical index j. Let xij ( ) be the quantity demanded of an agent in country j for good                                              produced
in country i, and let pij ( ) denote its price. The name of the good                                          is also a demand shifter
that implies that agents like varieties with higher                               better. So that with constant elasticity of
substitution (CES) preferences with elasticity of substitution                                 > 1;

In contrast with the standard model, xii ( ) and xij ( ) enter the marginal cost function through
qi ( ) as well. That is, a …rm’s level of total production a¤ects its marginal cost and therefore how
much it sells in each market. Importantly, the decision to export a¤ects the cost of production of
the goods sold in the local market.7 Hence, as usual, the price in each market is given by a constant
markup over marginal cost, namely,

                                       pij ( ) =          ij M C    (qi ( ) ; wi ) = pii ( )           ij :
                                                     1
    7
      This implies that even when fij > fii all …rms in the economy could enter the exporting market. Of course, if fij
is large enough, then only the most productive …rms will export. This is a key distinction with Melitz (2003) where,
for the case of two symmetric countries, all …rms will export if and only if fij fii .


                                                                     6
      Note that, as we argued above, since @M CL (q; w) =@q > 0 the price of …rms that expands
increases conditional on the number of layers and declines discontinuously with a reorganization.
Furthermore, a …rm that starts to export to a new market, as a result of a marginal increase in           or
an idiosyncratic reduction in   ij   or fij , increases qi ( ), which results in higher marginal cost, higher
wages and more employees in all layers, if the …rm does not reorganize. However, if exporting to
the new market makes the …rm add a layer, it will reduce its marginal cost discontinuously which
will decrease its price and expand its quantity more than in the previous case. The reorganization
is accompanied by reductions in knowledge and wages in all preexisting layers, and increases in the
number of workers in all layers, as discussed above.
      To sum up, the model has the following implications.

    1. Exporters are larger and have more layers than non-exporters.

    2. A …rm that becomes an exporter, or enters a new export market, as a result of a marginally
        higher   or marginally lower     ij   or fij for some j,

         (a) increases L weakly;
                                                ` and n` at all `;
        (b) if L does not change, it increases wL      L
                                          ` and increases n` at all `;
         (c) if L increases it decreases wL                L

      Armed with these implications, we now turn to our empirical analysis.


3      Exporting and Firm Organization: Evidence from France
We use con…dential data collected by the French National Statistical Institute (INSEE) for the
period 2002 to 2007. It combines the BRN dataset with manufacturing …rm balance-sheet informa-
tion with the DADS which includes worker characteristics. The details of the data construction can
all be found in CMRH. Our sample includes 553,125 …rm-year observations in the manufacturing
sector and all monetary values are expressed in 2005 euros.
      We use the PCS-ESE classi…cation codes for workers in the manufacturing sector to identify
the hierarchical layer in the …rm. For manufacturing, it includes …ve occupational categories given
by:

    2. Firm owners receiving a wage (which includes the CEO or …rm directors).

    3. Senior sta¤ or top management positions (which includes chief …nancial o¢ cers, heads of
        human resources, and logistics and purchasing managers).

    4. Employees at the supervisor level (which includes quality control technicians, technical, ac-
        counting, and sales supervisors).

    5. Quali…ed and non-quali…ed clerical employees (secretaries, human resources or accounting
        employees, telephone operators, and sales employees).

                                                        7
   6. Blue collar quali…ed and non-quali…ed workers (welders, assemblers, machine operators and
         maintenance workers).

       As in CMRH we merge classes 5 and 6, since the distribution of wages of workers in these two
classes is extremely similar. Hence a …rm can have a maximum of four layers, three of management
and one of workers. We refer to the number of layers in the …rm by the number of management
layers. So a …rm that has a layer of workers and one layer of managers is referred to as a …rm with
one layer.

3.1      Cross-sectional Comparisons between Exporters and Non-Exporters
It is well known by now that exporters are larger in terms of value added and employment (see
Bernard and Jensen, 1999, and Bernard, et al., 2007, among others). This is clearly the case in
our data as well.8 They also pay slightly higher wages. As Table 1 shows, they have more layers of
management as well. The average number of layers of management among non-exporters is 1.25,
meaning that the average exporter has a layer of workers, a layer of management and a fraction of
a second layer of management. If we look at exporters, they have 2.11 layers of management on
average. Hence, as we would expect from the fact that they are larger, exporters have more layers.

                                       Table 1: Description of exporters

                                                               Average
                                                VA          Hours     Wage      # of layers
                     Non-exporters            667.97      24,112.07 23.06          1.25
                      Exporters              6,754.35     164,534.30 23.71         2.11
                     The di¤erence in wages is signi…cant at 1%.


       In …gure 1 we present the distribution of value added by layer and by export status. For …rms
with a given number of layers, each of the panels compares the distribution of exporters and non-
exporters. As can be seen from comparing the dark lines across panels, …rm with more layers have
a distribution of value added with a higher mean. We document this carefully in CMRH. Our
emphasis in this paper is the comparison between exporters and non-exporters. Clearly, for all
layers exporters tend to be larger in terms of value added. The size advantage of exporters is there
conditional on the number of layers. Nevertheless, the size advantage of exporters is clearly larger
across …rms with more management layers. These …gures look very similar after we control for time
and industry …xed e¤ects. The distributions of hours employed also exhibits similar shifts to the
right for exporters with the di¤erence growing larger for …rms with more layers.
       The comparison is not as clear when we compare the distribution of wages across exporters
and non-exporters with a given number of layers. Exporters do tend to have a distribution of
average hourly wage slightly shifted to the right, but the di¤erences are small, and if anything,
   8
    Part of our data is used in Eaton, et al. (2011b) to study the exporting behavior of …rms. As a result, some of
these facts for France are known from their paper. However, they have no results on layers or …rm reorganization
conditional on changing or keeping constant the number of layers.

more pronounced for …rms with less layers. Clearly, the fact that the average hourly wage combines
employees with di¤erent skills and di¤erent roles in the organization that earn very di¤erent hourly
wages, makes this comparison not particularly informative. As it is, the analysis combines the
average wage of the CEO and the janitor. The theory of the organization of the …rm outlined
above can help us unpack these average e¤ects. In fact, this theory tells us that exporters should
pay more to the top layers, but less to the bottom ones. These two implications cancel each other
out, at least partially, when we look at average wages.

           About 44% of the …rms in our data export, and they account for slightly more than 83% of
value added, with some variation across years. More relevant for our purposes is that the …rms that
export tend to have more layers. As Table 2 shows, of the …rms with three layers of management,
66.7% of them export, while for …rms with only workers, only 9.5% of them export.
           Table 3 presents the composition of …rms by number of layers. Out of all exporters, only 15.5%
have only a layer of management, while 44.3% have two layers of management, and 35.5% have
three. So there is substantial heterogeneity in the number of layers of exporters and non-exporters.
Furthermore, most exporters have many layers, while most non-exporters have only one or two.
           Taken together, the results in this section corroborate Implication 1 of the theory. We now turn
to the behavior of …rms over time.

3.2   New Exporters
We now focus on …rms that become exporters during the period in our sample: new exporters. New
exporters are more likely to add layers than non-exporters. Table 4 shows that the probability of
adding one or more layers for new exporters is signi…cantly higher than for non-exporters, regardless
of the initial count of layers. The probability of keeping the same number of layers goes down if
the …rm has zero or one layer of management, while the probability of keeping the same number
of layers increases for …rms with two or three layers. Given that …rms with three layers cannot
add layers, this is natural. We conclude from this evidence that new exporters tend to add layers,
consistent with the fact that they grow as a result. Of course, there are some that also drop layers,
but there are fewer of those …rms than those that do not start to export. Table 5 shows that …rms
that exit the export market are also more likely to drop layers than exporters that do not exit. So
the e¤ect is symmetric: …rms that enter the export market are more likely to add layers and …rms
that exit are more likely to drop layers. These two tables corroborate our Implication 2a.

   In fact, the new exporters that add layers expand on average much more than the ones that
do not reorganize. Table 6 shows the changes in hours, normalized hours, value added and average

wages for all new exporters, the ones that add layers, and the ones that do not change L. We
present results when we detrend using trends for all …rms in the economy (not only new exporters,
of course). Firms that start exporting increase value added on average by 3.6%. The ones that add
layers increase value added by much more, 11.7%, while the ones that do not change layers increase
value added by only 3.1%. We …nd similar numbers for hours and normalized hours. Namely, new
exporters that add layers expand much more than …rms that do not add layers.

   Now let’s look at wages. After detrending, new exporters pay wages similar to those paid before;
so do …rms that do not change layers. In contrast, …rms that increase layers decrease wages by
a signi…cant 4.5%. Perhaps more relevant is that this average change masks a composition e¤ect
between the new top manager and pre-existing layers. When we focus on wages of employees in
pre-existing layers, we …nd that wages fall by 14.3% in …rms that add layers (16.3% if we detrend),
while they increase 1% in …rms that do not change layers (although the change is insigni…cant when
we detrend).
   The results paint a picture consistent with the one presented in the previous section. New
exporters that reorganize reduce wages in pre-existing layers. Furthermore, these are the new
exporters that actually expand signi…cantly. The …rms that add layers account for 14.17% of new


                                                               12
exporters and 46.59% of the total increase in value added by new exporters. In sum, many …rms
expand little when they become exporters; these …rms increase the salaries of all their employees.
Some …rms expand a lot when they start to export. They reorganize, add layers, and pay lower
wages to employees in the pre-existing layers and higher than average wages to the new top manager.
   We now proceed to verify that these results hold layer by layer. We look …rst at …rms that do
not add layers. We estimate the regression

                                            ~ `Lit =
                                       d ln n          `      g

where i denotes a …rm, L denotes the total number of layers, t denotes time and d denotes a yearly
time di¤erence. n                                       g
                ~ `Lit represents normalized hours, and V Ait is the value added of a …rm that stays
at L layers for two consecutive years; we have removed from both variables the economy-wide trend.
The only di¤erence is that now we use only …rms that either start to export or stop exporting in
                                                                                              `
the year in which we measure the change in normalized hours. The results for                  L   are presented in
Table 7. Many of these estimates are not signi…cant. The ones that are, are positive as predicted
by the theory. As we showed using Table 5, the …rms that do not add layers expand very little, so
                         `
it is hard to estimate   L   precisely enough to have signi…cant results.

   We estimate a parallel equation for wages, for the sample of …rms that change export status:

                                       d ln w `
                                            ~Lit =     `      g
                                                       L d ln V Ait   + "it                                    (9)

where w ` is the detrended change in layer-level wages. Results are presented in Table 8. Now the
      ~Lit
estimates are much more signi…cant and robust. All the values of                 `   are positive and signi…cant
                                                                                 L
and they tend to increase with ` given L. The ranking of the elasticities is not always signi…cant,
but it is in most cases, and when it is, it corresponds to the one predicted by the theory. Namely,
the wage of the higher-level managers expands proportionally more than that of the lower-level
ones. Hence, Implication 2b is also corroborated by the evidence.
   The …nal prediction of the theory to contrast with our data is Implication 2c, which states that
                                        ` and increase n` at all `: We have already argued in
new exporters that add layers decrease wL               L
the previous section that …rms that add layers decrease wages and increase hours at all layers, and
Table 4 shows that new exporters tend to add layers. So it is natural to expect that in fact the

predictions of the theory will be corroborated by the data.

   Table 9 presents the average log change in the number of hours for all transitions and all layers.
The table uses the sample of …rms that enter the export market and add layers and …rms that exit
the export market and drop layers. The results establish that, for all transitions and layers, …rms
that add layers increase the number of hours, while …rms that drop layers decrease them.
   The next step is to look at wages. Again, we study the change in average log wages for all
transitions and layers for the sample of new exporters that add layers and …rms that exit the export
market and drop layers. The results are displayed in Table 10. The prediction in Implication 2c is
broadly corroborated by the data (although the change in log wages for the case in which we do
not have many observations is not signi…cant). New exporters that add layers decrease wages and
the …rms that exit the export market and drop layers increase wages. As we show in Table 4, new
exporters tend to add more layers than non-exporters. Similarly, …rms that exit the export market
tend to drop more layers than exporters.

   So, exporters tend to reduce wages as a result of adding layers. To consider an example, a new
exporter that had one layer of management and added another as a result of its decision to start
exporting reduces the wages of its workers in layer zero by 8.2%, and the wage of managers in layer
one declines by 30%. In contrast, as Table 11 (discussed below) shows, the newly hired second
layer manager earns 90.2% more than the average wage in the …rm before the change.
   The result should change our view on the distribution of the gains from exporting. The view
that new exporters pay higher wages is misleading. Most new exporters expand little and do not
change their organization. They hire more hours and pay higher wages. The new exporters that
expand substantially add layers of management. They hire substantially more workers but pay
these workers less (since according to the theory they also know less). The new exporters that
expand and add layers exhibit more dispersion in wages within the …rm.

   Table 11 separates the change in wages in the …rm in the contribution to the average of the new

                                                14

top manager and the change in the wage of the pre-existing layers. The top left panel shows that
the average wage of all existing layers decreases as …rms add layers (and we know from Table 10
that it decreased for each layer individually). The top right panel shows the wage of the new top
manager relative to the mean wage of the …rm before the change. Clearly, wage dispersion in the
…rm increases substantially when it starts to export and adds layers.
       We end this section with a graphical representation of the change in …rms as they become
exporters. Figures 3 to 5 show how the typical organization of …rms change when they enter or
exit the export market: in each …gure, the …rst row in each graph represents the old and new
organization when the …rm adds layers and starts to export, while the second row represents a
current exporter which leaves the export market.9 Perhaps the most striking observation coming
out of Figures 3 to 5 is how large the changes are as …rms actively manage their organization. This
is in stark contrast to the very small changes for those …rms not reorganizing, as reported in Tables
7 and 8. Hopefully, these …gures are convincing in showing that new exporters expand by adding
layers, adding employment, and reducing wages. The reduction in wages challenges, as far as we
know, all theories of trade that do not add explicit organizational choices.

     To estimate the representative hierarchies before a transition, we compute the average number of normalized
hours and wage only in the subset of …rms with L layers that will enter the export market and have L + 1 layers
the following period. To estimate the representative hierarchy after the transition, we use the estimated log changes
for …rms entering the export market from Tables 9 and 10. For transitions one layer up, the change in the hourly
wage for the top layer after the transition is estimated as the average log change in the wage of the top layer

4         How do Firms Change the Average Wage in a Layer?
Table 12 shows that for …rms that change their export status (either entering or leaving the ex-
port market without adding layers), the only signi…cant adjustments occur via changes in formal
education, and especially at lower layers.

         Table 13 shows that when a change in the export status is accompanied by a reorganization,
…rms tend to mostly act upon experience, while formal education is almost never signi…cant. These
patterns are consistent (although somewhat more noisy) with our …ndings for the general population
of …rms.



5         Exogenous Export Demand Shocks and Reorganization
In this section, we explore a more causal relation between reorganization and layer-level outcomes.
In particular, we exploit variation in …rm-level exports induced exogenously by country variations
in real exchange rate as a “foreign demand shock”. In the theory, …rms close to the reorganization
threshold should add a layer following a demand shock large enough; such reorganization will trigger
changes in layer-level outcomes.
         To compute plausibly exogenous …rm-level demand shocks, we exploit pre-sample variation in
the destination composition of exports, in conjunction with real exchange rate variation across
countries. For each …rm, we observe the shares of export to all its destinations in 2002, sid ; we then
build the following measures of exposure for …rm i at time t :

                                                      (k)

                                                    Wit =         sid wdt                                           (10)

In this notation, i denotes a …rm, t denotes time, and L denotes the number of layers …rm i has at

   The …rst equation is a linear regression; it describes the change

controls: year dummies and log value added of …rm i with L layers at the beginning of the year (to
proxy for how close the …rm is to the threshold).
    The second equation is an ordered probit: it models the probability of any change in the number
of layers as a function of the …rm change in exports and the same set of controls (the parameters
 L;N   are the standard thresholds for the latent variable).
    We focus on the set of …rms who export throughout the sample period. We estimate this model
separately for all …rms with initial number of layers L.

last column in the table shows the probability of adding one layer for …rms at the 90th percentile of
value added implied by these coe¢ cients, following a 10% increase in export demand: for example,
exporters with 1 layer at the 90th percentile of size within the group have a 33.7% chance of
reorganizing if they are hit by an exogenous 10% increase in export demand.

       Equations (12.1) and (12.2) are similar to (11.1) and (11.2) respectively, except that the coef-
…cients are layer `-speci…c. We estimate this model separately for each initial number of layers L
and layer-level outcome `: the estimation sample includes all …rms that start with L layers and
have at least ` layers the following period. For example, one model would only look at all …rms
with L = 2 layers initially, and study change in hours and wages at layer ` = 1, using all the …rms
that have at least 1 layer the next period.
       The third and fourth equations in model (12) are linear regressions that relate the change in
normalized hours and wages, respectively, at a given layer ` for a …rm with L layers initially, as a
function of the change in layers.
                                                                `         ` .14
       Table 15 shows the estimates of the coe¢ cients          L   and   L       The coe¢ cients can be read as the
impact of adding 1 layer to the …rm on the correspondent layer-` outcome: for example, adding one
layer in …rms with L = 1 layers implies a decrease in average wages of 100 (1                       exp f0:132g) % =
  14: 1% in wages, but an increase of 100 exp f1:037g % = 282% in the normalized number of hours
in layer 0.
       Overall, these results emphasize that …rms react to shocks to their ability to trade by reorga-
nizing in exactly the way we would expect from the logic in the theory. These reactions change
their performance and in equilibrium have further repercussions both on trade and on other eco-
nomic outcomes as emphasized by CRH. Other papers have also explored some of these responses
empirically in other countries and context. In the next section we describe these contributions.
  14
    Note in this Table that when estimating outcomes in the top layers, observations drop somewhat. This happens
because outcomes in the top layer are not observed when the …rm drops it. This is also why layer-3 outcomes in …rms
with 3 layers cannot be estimated: the sample only includes …rms with which do not change layers (dLayersLit = 0),
so that there is no variation on the RHS; morevoer, the left-hand side d ln n~ 33it also has no variation since normalized
hours at the top are always 1.
  Table A1-2 in the Appendix reports the main coe¢ cients in the …rst two equations. As above, the contribution of
individual regressors is noisily estimated, but the joint model (12) is highly signi…cant.

6    Organizational Change and Trade in other Economic Context
The starting point of this empirical agenda on organizations is that using changes in occupational
categories to identify organizational structure and reorganizations is economically meaningful in
that it is related to a variety of other …rm characteristics like size, wages, employment, productivity,
among others. CMRH presented the evidence for the case of France, and since then several studies
document that mapping layers of management to occupations is meaningful across countries with
very di¤erent labor market regulations and/or at very di¤erent stages of development. Moreover,
some of these empirical studies …nd that reorganization not only has e¤ects on …rm level outcomes,
but also aggregate implications for the economy.
    A few studies have veri…ed and reproduced the results in CMRH for di¤erent time periods and
countries. For example, recent work by Bernini, Guillou, and Treibich, (2016) use French match-
employer employee data as in CMRH. They validate all of CMRH’s results for a more recent period,
the years 2009 to 2013. Also for France, Spanos (2016b) also shows that higher ability workers are
employed in the higher layers of …rms, and presents evidence of positive assortative matching
between workers in the di¤erent layers. Tåg (2013) uses the Swedish Standard Classi…cation of
Occupations 1996 (SSYK) which is a national version of the International Standard Classi…cation
of Occupations (ISCO-88 (COM)). He …nds that the empirical patterns in Sweden match the
theoretical predictions of CRH (2012). In particular, he …nds that …rms in Sweden are hierarchal,
i.e. higher layers have less workers and a higher mean wage than lower layers. Reorganizing by
adding layers is accompanied with an increase in …rm size and decrease in …rm wages at pre-existing
layers, while the reverse holds for …rms that delayer.
    In developing countries, Cruz, Bussolo and Iacovone (2016) study the Brazilian economy using
the Classi…cao Brasileira de Ocupacao (CBO). Using this classi…cation, they …rst document that
…rms are hierarchical in terms of hours and wages. Then, they …nd that in re-organized …rms
inequality of wages increases, as …rms pay higher wages in added higher layers than in pre-existing
ones. Also, and importantly for the main implications of the evidence in this paper, they document
how the change in …rms’ organization is positively correlated with export performance. So the



                                                  23
results we …nd in France are very much consistent with their results for Brazil.
   In order to try to be more detailed on the identi…cation of the e¤ect of exporting on organi-
zational change, Friedrich (2016) uses con…dential data collected by Statistics Denmark to study
the internal organization of Danish …rms. He …nds evidence for how trade a¤ects wage inequality,
focusing on changes in …rm hierarchies. Its main contribution is that the paper identi…es a causal
e¤ect of trade shocks on …rm hierarchies and wage inequality. Namely, Friedrich (2016) shows that
trade shocks do generate changes in the way …rms organize production and as a result the way in
which wage inequality changes inside the …rm. To do so, the paper uses two di¤erent identi…cation
strategies, one based on foreign demand and transportation costs, and the other using the Muslim
boycott of Danish exports after the Cartoon crisis. Both of these identi…cation strategies result in
robust e¤ects of trade shocks on within-…rm inequality through changes in the number of manage-
ment layers. The evidence from the paper is consistent with models of knowledge-based hierarchies.
He …nds that adding a hierarchy layer signi…cantly increases inequality within …rms, ranging from
2% for the 50-10 wage gap to 4.7% for the 90-50 wage gap. These results reinforce our …nding that
reorganization can be an important channel by which trade a¤ects wage inequality.
   In this paper our focus has been mostly in the reorganization associated with entry/exit behavior
in foreign markets and the e¤ects on layer-level changes in wages, span of control, and knowledge
composition. We have not explored the reverse channel by which organization a¤ects trade, which
is of course present in the general equilibrium theory of CRH. Spanos (2016c) complements our
…ndings for France by looking at the e¤ect of organization on export performance. He uses a
similar dataset as our study and shows evidence that …rms with more layers sell a larger number
of products, and to more destinations, compared to the ones with fewer layers. He identi…es these
export margins as the ones more correlated to productivity and number of layers. In fact, these
results complement nicely with the study on Portugal by Mion, Opromolla, and Sforza (2016), who
…nd that export experience acquired by managers in past organizations can result in more exports
in their current …rm. Put together, these results underscore that the channel from organization to
export performance is also important and active in the data on top of the e¤ect of exporting on
organization that we have documented.

6.1   Other Outcomes
The studies above look at the two-way link between organization and some …rm level outcomes,
including their participation in export markets. We have argued that this is important because
the way …rms organize determines their productivity and costs. Several papers have studied the
link between organizational change and productivity. For example, Caliendo, Mion, Opromolla
and Rossi-Hansberg (2015) show that the reorganization of …rms is an important source of the
aggregate productivity gains in the Portuguese economy. They …rst document that the empirical
patterns in the Portuguese economy match the theoretical predictions of CRH. They then study
empirically the prediction of the CRH model, that reorganization reduces the marginal cost of
the …rm, and therefore prices, while increasing the physical productivity of the …rm by reducing


                                                24
average variable cost. As a result, revenue based productivity should fall, while quantity based
productivity should increase, as …rms add layers. The results are stark. The study does not
…nd any case in which the evidence can falsify this prediction on how a reorganization a¤ects
both types of …rm productivity. Moreover, the paper presents some evidence of a causal e¤ect of
changes in layers on productivity, using …rm speci…c exchange rates based on a …rm’s import and
export patterns. In sum, changes in organization a¤ect signi…cantly the physical productivity of
the …rm. For France, Spanos (2016a) …nds that …rms in larger markets have more layers and are
more productive. Furthermore, Spanos (2016a) …nds that between 8% and 40% of the productivity
di¤erences across locations within France can be explained by …rms having a greater number of
layers and more complex organizations. This provides a relevant rationale for why we care about
the results on export opportunities and organization that we have documented in this paper.
    Finally, more recent research has also shown that using organizations can help to shed light on
business creation. In particular, using a sample of 16 million observations of Swedish workers and
occupational categories, Tåg, Åstebro, and Thompson (2016) provide evidence that the hierarchical
structure of a …rm matters for the likelihood of business creation among its former employees. The
results are striking; employees at the highest layers, namely CEOs, directors, and senior sta¤,
are three to four times more likely than production workers to found a limited liability company.
Unfortunately, given data limitations, the results cannot be interpreted as casual.


7    Conclusion
A …rm’s sales in foreign markets are correlated with a variety of …rm level outcomes. Some of
them are well known. For example, we know that trade makes …rms more productive and larger
in terms of total sales and employment. In this paper we show that exporting is also associated
with …rm reorganizations. Firms that start to trade are more likely to add management layers.
In fact, among all the …rms that start to trade, the ones that grow signi…cantly are the ones that
reorganize. These …rms also exhibit particular patterns for wages and employment in preexisting
layers. In particular, the …rms that reorganize when they start exporting pay workers in preexisting
layers less, and workers in the top new layer much more. So, wage inequality within those …rms
increases. In contrast, …rms that start to export but do not reorganize increase wages modestly at
all layers.
    Our …rst set of results only describes an equilibrium relationship between exporting and orga-
nization, not a causal e¤ect. As such, these results are helpful to discriminate between theories,
but not to understand the impact of, say, a trade liberalization on organization. So, we attempt
to go further and estimate causal e¤ects using a Bartik-style shock. The results are encouraging
in that the causal e¤ects are in general, signi…cant and large. Still, more work needs to be done
in identifying instruments that produce a more systematic …rst stage. Other studies have tried a
variety of other instruments in other countries and yield results that are surprisingly consistent
with ours.


                                                25
   All together, the evidence that we have presented, as well as the one in the existing literature,
is starting to paint a consistent picture in which part of the e¤ect of access to foreign markets is
realized through the reorganization of production. Furthermore, as we argued in the last section,
a variety of studies have linked these reorganizations to changes in productivity.
   Firms are complex organizations that react to changes in their environment. Only if we under-
stand how globalization a¤ects the internal structure of …rms are we ever going to understand its
full and true impact. We hope this research is starting to illuminate some of the contents of one of
the more resilient black boxes in economics.
