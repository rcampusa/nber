HIV and Fertility Revisited

                                               ABSTRACT

Young (2005) argues that HIV related population declines reinforced by the fertility response to the
epidemic will lead to higher capital-labor ratios and to higher per capita incomes in the affected countries
of Africa. Using household level data on fertility from South Africa and relying on between cohort
variation in country level HIV infection, he estimates a large negative effect of HIV prevalence on
fertility. However, the studies that utilize the recent rounds of Demographic Health Surveys, where
fertility outcomes are linked to HIV status based on testing, find no effect of the disease on the fertility
behavior. This paper tries to bridge this gap by revisiting Young's findings. Young (2005) includes
data before 1990, when no data are available on HIV prevalence rates. He assigns all the fertility observations
before 1990 with HIV prevalence rates of zero, and this appears to drive the significant negative effect
found in his study. When one restricts the sample to the period 1990-1998, where actual HIV data
are available, the effect of HIV prevalence on fertility turns out to be positive for South Africa. Simulating
Young's model utilizing these new estimates shows that the future generations of South Africa are
worse off.

1         Introduction
In a seminal paper, Young (2005) suggests that population declines brought upon by the
HIV epidemic will lead to higher capital-labor ratios and to higher per capita incomes in the
affected countries of Africa. He argues that widespread community infection will not only
reduce labor, but also lower fertility, both directly through a reduction in the willingness to
engage in unprotected sex, and indirectly, by increasing the scarcity of labor and the value of
women’s time. Using household data on fertility from South Africa and relying on between
cohort variation in country level HIV infection, he estimates an eighty percent reduction in
fertility due to HIV.
        In contrast, the studies that utilize the recent rounds of Demographic Health Surveys
(DHS), which link an individual woman’s fertility outcomes to her HIV status based on
testing, find no effect of HIV on the fertility behavior.1 This paper tries to bridge this gap
by revisiting Young’s findings. We argue that given the existing trends in South African data,
in particular due to abolition of apartheid and the ongoing demographic transition, Young’s
key identification strategy might not be appropriate. His strategy rests on constructing a
panel by tracing fertility histories of women. This is because for South Africa there is only
one Demographic Health Survey (DHS), and this was conducted in 1998. He constructed a
panel using each woman’s birth history since age 12, covering the period between 1961–1998.
He then matches this with country level HIV by age and exploits between cohort variation.
Since HIV data are not available until 1990, all women are assigned HIV prevalence rates of
zero for the period before 1990. This might not be an appropriate strategy since substituting
zeros for HIV before 1990—when the actual HIV rates may or may not truly have been
zeros—creates a discrete jump in the HIV data, leading to a mechanical downward trend in
the residuals. In fact, when one restricts the sample to post-1990, using the actual HIV data,

    1
    For example, for thirteen African countries, Juhn, Kalemli-Ozcan, Turan (2008) find no significant effect
of the community HIV prevalence on the fertility behavior of HIV negative women. This finding holds
both in a cross-section of women and also over time by utilizing the available information on each woman’s
birth history. Fortson (2009) arrives at the same conclusion both for HIV negative women and also for all
women using data from twelve African countries and utilizing different time paths for HIV. See also Fink
and Linnemayr (2008) for a similar result.

                                                     1
the effect of HIV prevalence on fertility turns out to be positive and significant for South
Africa. Simulating Young’s original model using our new estimate shows drastically different
results. Although we did not consider the “other” detrimental impacts of the disease, such
as a decrease in human capital accumulation, we still find that future generations of South
Africa are much worse off.
        The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data and presents
the empirical analysis. Section 3 presents the model in Young (2005) and simulates it using
both Young’s estimates and our new estimates from section 2. Section 4 concludes.



2         Empirical Analysis
Young (2005) shows that there is a negative effect of country-wide HIV prevalence on in-
dividual fertility in South Africa. We start by replicating his results and then show that
restricting the analysis to observations where HIV prevalence data are actually available are
sufficient to overturn the finding of a significant negative effect of HIV on fertility.
        The fertility data are from South Africa 1998 DHS.2 Following Young (2005), only women
who are 25 or older are used in the study, and there are 7276 of them in the data set. The
panel is constructed using each woman’s birth history since age 12, and it includes the period
between 1961–1998. Retrospective fertility is the number of pregnancies of each woman in
each year, including pregnancies that were lost before term or resulted in stillbirths.
        Young (2005) uses the antenatal clinic sero-prevalence rate for each woman’s age group
at that time of their life from South Africa Department of Health. These rates are available
since 1990. We have attempted to get the same HIV data from the same source, but in spite
of many emails and calls these data could not be obtained from South Africa Department
of Health. Since South Africa Department of Health is cited as the main source in the U.S.
Census Bureau’s HIV/AIDS Surveillance Database (2005), we therefore use South Africa
HIV prevalence rates by age group from the U.S. Census Bureau, HIV Surveillance Database

    2
        The survey covers all women, not only the women of color.


                                                       2
(2005). We match Young (2005) number of observations exactly, i.e., 171206 women.
       We have to note that the country level HIV estimates for any given country in Africa is
based on the HIV-1 incidence among pregnant women, whether it is from country’s depart-
ment of health or from the U.S. Census Bureau, HIV Surveillance Database. The reason
is that the country level estimates are coming from the antenatal clinics and not based on
testing data from a population based survey. Hence these estimates are in general very high
and representativeness of these estimates for the general population is debatable.3 More
recently, DHS started providing results from population based HIV testing. These new esti-
mates are much lower than the U.S. Census Bureau estimates.4 The new population based
DHS estimates are only available for a limited set of countries for their latest survey year
though and not available for South Africa.
       Young’s (2005) identification comes from variation in HIV exposure by age. He controls
for the effects of age and cohort using linear (and sometimes polynomial) trends in birth
year and age, all of which will control for a smooth trend.5 To replicate the results of Young
(2005), we use a Poisson count model. Table 1 shows the replication.6 Young (2005) finds the
coefficient on HIV as –1.63. Using the data from the U.S. Census Bureau, HIV Surveillance
Database, we find a coefficient of –1.36 as shown in column (1) of Table 1. By an imprecise
reading of the data off of a graph in the printed version of South Africa Department of
Health Report (2004), we find a coefficient of –1.58. All these coefficients are significant at 1
percent level. Following Young’s methodology, column (1) assumes a HIV prevalence rate of
0 before 1990. In column (2) only part of the panel that is after 1990 is used in regressions.
Columns (3) and (4) repeat the same exercise by using OLS estimation. The coefficient of

     In a country like South Africa one can imagine the existence of more complicated trends due to the
abolition of apartheid, which is a discrete change.
   6
     Wage index is the estimated wage for each individual depending on own education, where wage regressions
are done following Young’s methodology. Using OHS (1995) wage is estimated as a function of sex, age,
education and their squares. Individual education levels reported in OHS are converted to standardized
years of education, as shown in appendix. These educational categories are then used to construct wage
index. Wage index is calculated as: BE ∗ Ei + BE 2 ∗ Ei2 , where BE and BE 2 are the return to education
coefficients coming from the regression of wages on sex, age, education and their squares.


                                                     3
interest changes sign and becomes positive significant when the analysis is restricted to the
post-1990 part of the panel.
      Table 2 investigates the relationship between HIV and fertility for different sub-periods.7
This corresponds to decreasing the number of fertility observations that are assigned zero
HIV prevalence in each reported regression. The estimation is Poisson. The coefficient
increases from –1.36, which is estimated using the years 1961–1998, to 0, which is estimated
using the years 1986–1998 and then up to 1.64, when only the 1990–1998 part of the panel
used, i.e., the actual data. The coefficient switches from being negative significant to being
insignificant and then to being positive significant. Hence, the negative effect found in the
1961–1998 sample is not only due to assuming zero prevalence before 1990, but rather the
number of years, where HIV is assumed to be zero. Using the years 1986–1998 also means
assigning zero prevalence to the fertility observations before 1990, but now we find no effect
of HIV on fertility. This result is consistent with Juhn et al. (2008) and Fortson (2009), who
both used a similar identification strategy.
      The explanation for Young’s large negative finding is straightforward. Figure 1 plots the
mean residuals (blue circle line) from a regression of fertility on other control variables except
for HIV against the mean residuals (black triangle line) from a regression of HIV on other
control variables for every year; an exercise that yields the same OLS coefficient as in column
(3) of Table 1 by Frish-Waugh theorem. Assuming zero HIV for every woman before 1990
creates an artificial trend in the residuals—as opposed to the case where we use only the part
of the panel after 1990—resulting in a negative association between HIV and fertility. In
symbols this can be expressed as follows: Figure 1 plots residualsT F R against residualsHIV ,
where residualsT F R come from a regression of fertility on other control variables and hence
residualsT F R = T F R − âX. residualsHIV come from a regression of HIV on other control
variables and hence residualsHIV = HIV − b̂X. Given HIV = 0 before 1990 and X is
increasing in years residualsHIV has a mechanical downward trend. Because HIV is zero
until year 1990 and then increasing, the predicted HIV is negative, which is reflected in the

residuals. And since fertility is increasing over time, there is a spurious negative correlation
between the negative mechanic trend in HIV pre-1990 and fertility and a positive correlation
between the positive trend in HIV post-1990 and fertility. The latter could be also spurious
since fertility was increasing even before 1990.
   Another way to depict the same relation is shown in Figure 2 that plots mean fertility
residual at each year against mean HIV residual at that corresponding year. This figure
helps to see the flipping relation due to employing different periods more easily.
   It is clear that the significant negative effect of HIV on fertility in South Africa is not a

robust finding since it has been driven by creating an artificial discrete trend in the data. In
fact out of 171206 observations, 112998 observations are pre-1990. Hence sixty-six percent
of the fertility observations are associated with zero HIV prevalence rates since for sixty-six
percent of the sample HIV data did not exist. If we focus on the age group of 25-29 that
has similar number of observations before and after 1990 we see a striking change in the
mean prevalence rate. Before 1990 there were 17537 women aged 25-29. After 1990 there
are 13368. The mean HIV prevalence for this group jumps from 0 to 7.2 percent, a jump
that is most likely not true in the actual data.



3         Simulation
Although we showed that the estimate for the impact of the disease on fertility behavior
changes dramatically from negative to positive when one uses data in the post-1990 period,
we still do not know how important this particular input to the results in the Young’s
paper.8 Young (2005) brings together different inputs, such as fertility response and human
capital accumulation, in the context of a model to simulate the evolution of the South
African economy, where a decreasing fraction of population is dying from the disease until
the disease ends at some point in the future. However, among all these inputs everything but
a negative fertility response contributes to the detrimental impact of the disease on economic
development. The negative response of fertility to the disease is most critical since in the
absence of any fertility response the other inputs have a negative effect on development.
Conditional on the fraction of population that is dying from the disease this will lead to an
unambigious decline in income per capita in the absence of a negative fertility response. If
fertility responds negatively to the disease then population growth will be reduced drastically
not only because of the dying but also because of the lower fertility and hence the income
per capita might increase, making the future generations better off.
        In order to show the importance of the sign and magnitude of the fertility effect for this

    8
        We thank our referee to make us see this point and force us to undertake the following exercise.

result, we, first replicate Young’s simulation using his exact model and estimates. We focus
on his basic scenario and abstract from different scenarios (such as detrimental effect on
human capital investment and orphaned children) so that we can show clearly that a change
in the estimate for the fertility response turns over the conclusions of his original simulation.
Following Young (2005), we assume a Cobb-Douglas production function:


                                            Y = AK α (EL)1−α                                             (1)

where EL, effective labor, denotes a weighted average of labor inputs.9 K is the initial level
of capital stock in 1995 from Federal Reserve Bank of South Africa’s estimate of total fixed
capital stock. The path followed by GDP per capita is as follows:

                                             (1 − δ)          s
                                   kt+1 =             kt +          Ak α                                 (2)
                                            (1 + nt )      (1 + nt ) t

The depreciation rate, δ, saving rate, s, and labor share, α, are taken as 0.06, 0.175 and 0.62,
respectively. Total factor productivity growth is assumed to be zero. We use these values
exactly as in Young (2005). We also assume as Young that HIV prevalence rates sinusoidally
declines to zero by 2050. We use the same national HIV prevalence rates as before.10 1995
birth and death rates are from World Development Indicators Database. We also follow
Young on estimating non-AIDS and AIDS mortality. Population growth rate, nt , is basically
determined by AIDS mortality, non-AIDS mortality and fertility behavior. Fertility will be
estimated as a function of HIV prevalence and wages as in Young (2005).
       We simulate the model under three scenarios: (1) “No HIV,” the economy without
HIV/AIDS epidemic; (2) “Young’s Estimate,” the economy with the epidemic and Young’s

   9
      Associated weights are from estimating a wage function using 1995 October Household Survey. Specifi-
cally, before-tax wages per hour is estimated as a function of sex, age, education and their squares. Results
are shown in Appendix Table A-1. Coefficients from this estimation are used as weights to calculate the
effective labor.
   10
      Specifically, national HIV prevalence data from US Census Bureau, HIV Surveillance Database is used
for pre-2000 period. Post-2000 HIV prevalence evolves according the function HIVt = HIV2000 ∗ sin[(π/2) ∗
(2050 − t)/50].

negative fertility estimates, (3) “Our Estimate,” the economy with the epidemic and our pos-
itive fertility estimate. Scenario (1) and (2) replicates Young (2005). Specifically, in scenario
2, at a 100 percent HIV prevalence rate, fertility would be about 20 percent less. Whereas,
in scenario 3, according to our estimate, at 100 percent infection rate fertility would be 500
percent higher.11 Recall that “our estimate” is nothing but redoing Young’s estimation using
the actual HIV data between 1990–1998 instead of using 1961–1998 where HIV is assumed
to be zero between 1961–1989 as in Young (2005).
       Figure 3 shows the evolution of GDP per capita under these two different scenarios
relative to the path taken in the absence of epidemic (scenario 1). In scenario 2, “Young’s
Estimates,” GDP per capita remains above “No HIV” path as a result of the large negative
fertility response to HIV/AIDS estimated by Young (2005). This is the exact replication of
the result found by Young (2005), where future generations are better off because of this
increase in GDP per capita. Whereas in scenario 3, fertility response to the epidemic is
positive as estimated by us, an effect that dominates the deaths from the disease, and hence
GDP per capita decreases and remains under “No HIV” path.12



4        Conclusion and Discussion
The relationship between fertility and the HIV/AIDS epidemic is one of the most important
missing pieces in the puzzle of AIDS and development. Data from the latest rounds of
the DHS surveys show a widespread stall in the demographic transition in Africa, which is
inconsistent with declining fertility found in Young (2005) as a result of the HIV epidemic in
South Africa. Recent studies using newly available population based HIV-testing data find
no significant effect of HIV on the fertility behavior. This paper tries to bridge this gap by
revisiting Young’s original findings.

  11
     To ease the interpretation, poisson regression coefficients are converted into incidence rate ratios by
exponentiating the poisson regression coefficients in Table 1 of Young (2005) and of this paper. Associated
coefficients in Young (2005) and this paper are –1.633 and 1.637, respectively.

     See also Figure A-1 in appendix for the scenario without any fertility response to HIV/AIDS, which will
correspond to our insignificant estimate.

   Using identical individual-level fertility and country-level HIV data as Young (2005), we
re-examined the relation between HIV and fertility. The analysis using South African data
and cohort-time variation in HIV suggests a significant negative effect of HIV on fertility for
the period 1961–1998, a significant positive effect of HIV on fertility for the period 1990–
1998, and a zero effect for the period 1986–1998. As a result we cannot draw any generalized
conclusion. If one restricts oneself to the years in which there are data, one finds a positive
association between HIV and fertility in South Africa—not the negative association that is
induced by the artificial trend in HIV rates that are an artifact of assuming zero HIV prior
to 1990. Simulating the growth model outlined in Young (2005) with these new estimates
show that future generations of South Africa are worse off.

Notes: Only women who are 25 or older are used and there are 7276 of them in the dataset.
The panel is constructed using each woman’s birth history since age 12, and it includes
the period between 1961–1998. Retrospective fertility is the number of pregnancies of each
woman in each year, including that were lost before term or resulted in stillbirths. HIV
prevalence rates for South Africa are available since 1990, therefore, in columns (1) and
(3) HIV prevalence is taken as zero before 1990. In columns (2) and (4) only part of the
panel that is after 1990 is used in regressions. Wage index is the estimated wage for each
individual depending on own education. Each regression has a constant. Incidence rate
ratios are given to ease the interpretation of poisson coefficients. Robust clustered standard
errors by individual are in parentheses. ∗ ∗ ∗ denotes 1% significance.

Appendix
Education: Reported education levels are converted into standardized years of education as
follows: (i) No schooling or less than one year completed = 0 years; (ii) Sub A/sub B/grade
1/grade 2/Std 1 = 2 years; (iii) Standards 210 = standard year = 2; (iv) Diploma/certificate
with Std 9 or lower or further studies incomplete = 13 years; (v) Diploma/certificate with
Std 10 or diploma/other postschool complete = 14 years; (vi) Degree or further degree com-
plete = 16 years.


   Fertility: We use women’s birth histories in DHS to construct the number of births in
each year of their lives. We count pregnancies that were lost before term or resulted in still-
births as births. We exclude women younger than 25 at the time of the survey from sample.
Finally, following Young(2005) we do not include the fertility history since each woman’s
last birthday.


   Before-tax Wages per Hour: 1995 October Household Survey is used to construct before-
tax wages per hour. Individuals report their income in terms of intervals and state whether
this income is daily, weekly, monthly or annual. Additionally, they report weekly in-kind
income (transport, food, and other) they received. Using this information annual income for
each individual is calculated. Dividing the annual income by the hours of work in the last
seven days the individual worked gives annual before-tax wages per weekly hour of work.
Only individuals worked for someone else are used in the calculations. 424 individuals who
stated that they worked both for themselves and someone else are excluded from the sample.
Individuals who are younger than 25 and at still school-going age are also included in the
calculations.

 Notes: Data is from 1995 October Household Survey. Constructions of log before-tax wages per hour and
education variable are described in the appendix. Since wage data are interval coded interval estimation is
used. It maximizes the likelihood that the dependent variable falls within the interval brackets. All females
and males worked for someone else in the last seven days, including the ones still at school-going age, are
used in the regressions. Standard errors are clustered on enumeration area and in parenthesis.
