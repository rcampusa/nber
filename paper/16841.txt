The American Family in Black and White: A Post-Racial Strategy for Improving Skills to
Promote Equality

                                               ABSTRACT

In contemporary America, racial gaps in achievement are primarily due to gaps in skills. Skill gaps
emerge early before children enter school. Families are major producers of those skills. Inequality
in performance in school is strongly linked to inequality in family environments. Schools do little
to reduce or enlarge the gaps in skills that are present when children enter school. Parenting matters,
and the true measure of child advantage and disadvantage is the quality of parenting received. A growing
fraction of American children across all race and ethnic groups is being raised in dysfunctional families.
Investment in the early lives of children in disadvantaged families will help close achievement gaps.
America currently relies too much on schools and adolescent remediation strategies to solve problems
that start in the preschool years. Prevention is likely to be more cost-effective than remediation. Voluntary,
culturally sensitive support for parenting is a politically and economically palatable strategy that addresses
problems common to all racial and ethnic groups.

Disparities between Blacks and Whites are persistent features of American society. On many

measures, Blacks as a group perform worse than Whites and the trends are not encouraging.

These disparities are continuing reminders of America's troubled history of racial discrimination.

They clash with American beliefs about equality, opportunity and social mobility.

        What makes discussion of these disparities so painful is that in the past, American public

policy has been so wrong. The institution of slavery, the all-too-slow dismantling of segregation

in the South and discriminatory practices elsewhere, prevented ready acceptance of Blacks into

the mainstream of American society. When America was finally goaded into abolishing state-

sanctioned discrimination by the activities of the Civil Rights Movement, integration of African

Americans into the economy accelerated. There was a surge in Black economic status in the late

1960s and early 1970s. Progress was especially rapid in the previously segregated South.1

        Some 40 years later, despite the visible success of an elite group within the Black

population, the economic and social progress of a large segment of African Americans has been

painfully slow. If anything, the official statistics overstate the progress of African males.2 The

success of the Civil Rights Movement in reversing discrimination on the books gave rise to the

hope that active government policy in the economy, the schools, and in the courts could produce

full equality in the larger society.

        Why have these hopes not been realized? What can we learn from this stalled progress

and how should public policy respond? Setting aside preconceived notions and examining the

body of evidence amassed since 1960, are the factors producing their slow economic and social

progress unique to African Americans or are they the consequence of common forces that

operate equally on all Americans?
                                                                                                     4


         Black America has a unique history and now faces unique challenges. Nonetheless, there

is great wisdom in the insight of William Julius Wilson3 that the first order problems facing

African Americans in contemporary society are shared by many other groups. In particular, the

shortfalls in achievement in the 21st century stem from shortfalls in skills, not in the rewards

accorded those skills. Skills include education and on the job training as well as cognitive and

personality traits.

         Unskilled persons of all races and ethnicities are challenged by common global economic

forces that cannot easily be reversed. Secular trends in trade and technology have boosted the

demand for skilled labor and the supply of skills has not kept pace. The percentage of

Americans graduating college is the highest in history. At the same time, the high school

dropout rate, properly counted, has increased in the past 40 years.4 American society is dividing

into affluent haves and disadvantaged have nots, with skills primarily determining advantage and

disadvantage. For Americans of all racial and ethnic groups, the supply of skills has responded

slowly to shifts in market demand. The response is particularly slow for African American

males.

         President Lyndon Johnson recognized the importance of skills when he launched the War

on Poverty around the same time he promoted the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Our understanding of

the skills that are important and the strategies that are effective in fostering them has improved

greatly since that time. Many of the programs and policies designed to boost skills that were

launched in the 1960s War on Poverty failed.5 However, people continue to advocate many of

these unsuccessful approaches, especially those most concerned about closing racial gaps. Just

as we need to rethink the sources of racial inequality in contemporary American society, we need

to rethink our strategies for promoting skills.
                                                                                                      5


       Public policy to promote skills has to reckon with three essential truths distilled from a

large body of research conducted in the wake of the War on Poverty. First, the skills needed for

success in life are multiple in nature. Success requires more than cognition and smarts. Soft

skills are important. Conscientiousness, perseverance, sociability, and other character traits

matter a lot, even though they are largely neglected in devising policies to reduce inequality.

       Second, skill formation is a dynamic, synergistic process. Skills beget skills. They cross

foster and promote each other. A perseverant child open to experience learns more. Early

success fosters later success. Advantages cumulate. Young children are flexible and adaptable

in ways that adolescents and adults are not. It is much easier to prevent deficits from arising in

the early years than to remediate them later. The War on Poverty took a shotgun, scattershot,

approach to fostering the skills of disadvantaged persons of all ages and stages of development.

Its policies did not target the years when interventions to promote skills are most effective.

       Third, families play an essential role in shaping the skills of their children. Skill

formation starts in the womb. The early years of a child’s life before the child enters school lay

the foundations for all that follows. Large gaps in abilities between the advantaged and the

disadvantaged open up early before children enter school. Unequal as they are, American

schools do little to widen or narrow these gaps. The family plants and nourishes the seed that

grows into the successful student and adult. Families in jeopardy produce children in jeopardy

who often grow into adults who fail to realize their potential. We know much more about the

powerful role of the family in shaping adult skills than we did in the 1960s.

       Across all race and ethnic groups, the American family is under strain.6 This fact has

substantial implications for the skills of the next generation because of the crucial role families

play in shaping the early lives of children. Currently, over 40% of all American children are
                                                                                                       6


born out of wedlock and more than 12% of all children live in families where the mother has

never married. Such families provide fewer financial and parenting resources for child

development. It is well documented that the children of lone parent families perform worse in

life on many outcomes.7 Any effective policy to foster skills has to recognize the importance of

the family, the mechanisms through which families create child skills and the stress under which

many families operate.

       When the Moynihan report on the state of the African American family was written,

roughly 26% of all African American children were born out of wedlock.8 The figure is now

72%. A venomous reception greeted Moynihan’s analysis. He was falsely charged with

“blaming the victim” because he pointed out the adverse consequences of out of wedlock birth

for children. For years it was politically incorrect to discuss the family as a contributor to Black

disparity. Fortunately, and due in no small part to the writings of William Julius Wilson, it is

now possible to have honest discussions of this delicate issue.9

       Moynihan used strong language and focused exclusive attention on “the pathology of the

Negro family,” an unfortunate choice of words that obscured an important insight. It is now

recognized that the warnings raised by Moynihan apply more generally to all American families.

Dysfunctional families are on the rise in many quarters of American society. They often produce

dysfunctional children. They are major contributors to inequality in contemporary society.

       Understanding that in 2011 the problems facing many African Americans are also the

problems facing many other Americans, reframes the policy discussion and helps us move past

traditional flash points. Many American children across all races and ethnicities are in the same

sinking boat.
                                                                                                      7


       Policies that recognize the importance of the early years, the central role of the family in

producing skills, and the importance of skills other than those measured by achievement tests are

likely to be far more effective than current school-based strategies and adolescent remediation

programs. Policies based on these three essential truths prevent, rather than remediate, problems.

They bolster schools by assisting families in creating and supporting successful students. They

relieve the burden on other social institutions by creating more capable and achievement-

motivated youth.

       Strategies that address inequality by recognizing the common problems facing all

Americans shift the dialogue about disparity beyond racial boundaries. Such strategies are much

more likely to gain widespread political support than race-based policies.

       We need to learn from the ineffective programs launched by the War on Poverty so that

we can implement effective programs that recognize the powerful role of the family and the early

years in shaping the skills that matter. In an era of massive government deficits at all levels,

strategies for promoting skills must be cost-effective. They need to harness all of the resources

in the private sector to promote skills, including the love of mothers for their children.

       This essay proceeds as follows. I first summarize a substantial body of evidence that

shows that discrimination in the labor market is no longer a first order cause of racial disparity. I

then discuss the skill gap: which skills matter and the important role that the family plays in

producing those skills. I then consider the consequences of adverse trends in American families

that retard skill formation and create widening inequality between the advantaged and

disadvantaged. Effective policies to supplement the resources of disadvantaged families are

proposed. The true measure of child poverty is parenting, and an effective skills policy bolsters

the parenting resources of the disadvantaged.

Overt Discrimination is No Longer a First Order Problem in American
Society
Discrimination exists and should be eliminated. The evidence suggests, however, that

discrimination in the reward to skills is not the primary driver of the achievement gap in

contemporary America. At this moment, inequality in skills is the first order problem.

        The skills persons bring to the market, to school and to other quarters of society,

determine their success. So do the rewards to those skills. In the labor market, wages are the

rewards to skills. One group can have lower wages than another because payments per unit skill

are lower, because their skills are lower or because both factors operate. What is the relative

importance of each factor? Recent research addresses this question.

        The columns labeled “actual” in Table 1 show the percentage shortfalls in hourly wages

of all employed Blacks and Hispanics compared to the wages of all employed Whites. To gauge

if disparity in wages is a uniquely African American experience, I compare their shortfalls with

those of Hispanics. A negative number denotes a shortfall. Black males earn 25% less than

White males. Hispanic males earn 15% less than White males. The corresponding figures for

females are 17% lower wages for Blacks and 7% lower wages for Hispanics. The gaps in annual

earnings are generally larger because minorities tend to be employed fewer hours.10 These gaps

are large and statistically significant, that is, they are not likely to arise solely by chance.

       This pattern of disparity is replicated in many other measures of social and economic

achievement: schooling, health, incarceration, occupational success.11 Blacks and Hispanics

have worse outcomes than Whites in American society. Furthermore, Blacks on average fare

worse than Hispanics.

       Are these disparities due to pervasive labor market discrimination or to gaps in skills?

These two interpretations of the evidence in Table 1 (and their counterparts for other outcomes,

presented in the web appendix) have profoundly different implications for public policy. If

persons of identical skill are treated differently in the market on the basis of race or ethnicity, a

more vigorous enforcement of civil rights and affirmative action policies would be warranted. If,

on the other hand, the gaps are due to the skills that people bring to the labor market, then

policies that foster skills should be emphasized.

       To resolve this issue, I adjust adult wages by scores on scholastic ability tests measured

in the teenage years.12 (See the columns labeled “adjusted” in Table 1.) After adjustment, the

gaps substantially diminish for Black males and are essentially zero for Hispanic males. The

gaps actually reverse for females—that is, adjusting for their ability, minority females earn more

than their White counterparts. (A positive number means that on average the ability-adjusted

wages of minorities are higher than those of Whites.)
                                                                                                    10


          There are gaps in educational attainment as well. High school dropout rates are higher

for minorities and a smaller proportion of them attend and graduate college. See the evidence in

Table 2. In this table, the proportion of Blacks entering college is 12 points lower than that of

Whites. For Hispanics, the figure is 14 points.

Adjusting for their differences in scholastic ability with the same measure of scholastic ability

used to adjust wages in Table 1, Blacks are 16 points more likely to go to college and Hispanics

are 15 points more likely. After accounting for differences in adolescent ability, family income

in the college going years and tuition costs play only minor roles in explaining the gaps.14

          Any serious accounting of economic and social disparities must reckon with the

importance of skills in American society.15 Saying this does not deny the validity of a variety of

studies that show discriminatory inclinations in the labor market by firms. America is not yet a

color blind society. However, discrimination at the individual level is different from

discrimination at the group level, although these concepts are often confused.

          Racial discrimination is present if an otherwise identical person is treated differently by

virtue of that person's race, and race has no direct effect on productivity. Audit pair studies

identify racial discrimination in sampled firms by sending auditors with equal qualifications of
                                                                                                   11


different races and ethnicities to apply for jobs. They show evidence of pervasive

discrimination.16

        Finding discrimination by race or gender at a randomly selected firm does not provide an

accurate assessment of the discrimination that takes place in realized market transactions.17

People sort in the labor market. Minorities avoid bigots and are hired by the less-bigoted firms.

Measured wages reflect this sorting. The impact of market discrimination on wages is not

determined by the most discriminatory participants in the market, or even by the average level of

discrimination among firms, but rather by the level of discrimination at the firms where ethnic

minorities or women actually end up working. Numerous studies that document discrimination

by audit pair methods do not detect the margin at which market transactions actually occur.

        Thus there is no conflict between the discrimination reported in numerous audit studies

and the small gap in ability-adjusted wages. Blacks constitute roughly 12% of the U.S.

population. If 12% or more of the jobs are at nondiscriminating or slightly discriminating firms,

the contribution of discrimination to overall wage gaps would be small.

        This is not to say that minorities do not face unfair situations regarding bigotry or to

downplay the real costs of locating nondiscriminating employers. But unequal reward to skills is

not the first order explanation for observed gaps in racial achievement in contemporary

American society. Any serious attack on the problem of racial and ethnic disparity in American

society has to address disparity in skills.18
                                                                                                       12




Gaps in Skills

The data reveal an uncomfortable fact. Minority abilities as a group are generally lower than

those of White abilities. The gap is quite pronounced for the measure of scholastic ability used

to adjust wages and schooling in Tables 1 and 2.19

       One response to racial and ethnic disparities in test scores is that the tests are culturally

biased. However, a large literature refutes such claims.20 The tests used to make the adjustments

in Table 1 predict performance in a number of activities for all race and ethnic groups.

       The test scores reflect in part the differences in the years of schooling attained at the time

people take the test. Minorities generally have lower levels of schooling when they take the test

and hence get lower test scores. Accounting for this disparity does not change the main message

of Table 1—that it is gaps in skills not gaps in payments to skills that determine the lion’s share

of racial wage disparity.21

       It is sometimes claimed that expectations of discrimination in the labor market

substantially reduce the educational aspirations of African American parents for their children

and of the children for themselves. The evidence shows otherwise.22

       Some have argued that a large portion of the gap in test scores between minorities and

Whites is due to “stereotype threat.” Convincing evidence shows that minority students who are

told that the tests they are taking are being used to compare the abilities of minorities with those

of Whites perform worse on such tests compared to tests administered without such framing.23

       The test used to produce the evidence in Tables 1 and 2 does not frame the exam in the

way that produces stereotype threat. In addition, the quantitative importance of the stereotype

threat in accounting for test score gaps is slight.24 The test score gaps between minorities and
                                                                                                     13


majorities are real and they measure something that matters for performance in economic and

social life, although by no means do they estimate all that is important.



Gaps in Soft Skills

Most discussions of racial and ethnic achievement gaps focus on measures of scholastic ability.

Indeed, for many analysts, the achievement gap is only about differences in scores on tests of

scholastic ability. This emphasis reflects a broad consensus in American society about the value

of achievement tests that are used to monitor the success and failure of schools and students in

schools. The No Child Left Behind program has pushed this focus to what some have described

as a mania. The program has created a culture of teaching to the test in schools, with consequent

neglect of the subjects and byproducts of schooling that are not tested.25

        An emerging body of evidence shows that, as is intuitively obvious and commonsensical,

more than book learning, or the smarts measured by achievement tests, is required for success in

life.26 As Woody Allen put it: “Eighty percent of success is showing up.”27 While the cognitive

skills measured by achievement tests are powerful predictors of life success, so are socio-

emotional skills—sometimes called “soft skills” or character traits. These involve motivation,

sociability (the ability to work with and cooperate with others), attention, self regulation, self

esteem, the ability to defer gratification and the like. Good schools and functional families

produce soft skills as well as cognitive skills.28 For many outcomes, soft skills are as predictive,

if not more predictive, of schooling, wages, participation in crime and participation in healthy

behaviors as cognitive skills.29 There is evidence that disadvantaged children of all race groups

have lower levels of soft skills.30
                                                                                                                   14


The Early Emergence of Skill Gaps

Gaps in skills between the advantaged and the disadvantaged emerge at early ages and persist.

Figure 1 shows achievement scores by age for White children classified by their mother’s

education, a measure of the social advantage of the child. More educated mothers marry more

educated men, have access to more financial resources for their children, and provide their

children with nurturing and supportive environments than do less educated women.31


Figure 1. Average Achievement Test Scores of Children by Age by Maternal Education




Scores are reported in standardized units (they are transformed to “z” scores, i.e., normalized scores with unit
variance.).32


         There are two noteworthy features of this figure. First, gaps in achievement test scores

by social background of the child are substantial. The test score gap between more educated

Whites and less educated Whites is about the same as the gap in the test scores between Blacks

and Whites. Second, the gaps arise early and persist. Schools do little to budge these gaps even

though the quality of schooling attended varies greatly across social classes.33 Much evidence
                                                                                                    15


tells the same story as Figure 1. Gaps in test scores classified by social and economic status of

the family emerge at early ages, before schooling starts, and they persist.34 Similar gaps emerge

and persist in indices of soft skills classified by social and economic status.35 Again, schooling

does little to widen or narrow these gaps.36



Biology and Genetics
Genetic determinists would argue that heritability of genes explains the performance of children

and the environments provided to them by their parents. They would interpret Figure 1 as

showing the power of genes in perpetuating inequality across the generations.

       In The Bell Curve, Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray implicitly attribute Black-

White gaps in scholastic achievement test scores to genetic differences between Blacks and

Whites. Their book raised a firestorm of criticism that, ironically, has been successful in

discrediting the genetic explanation as the sole or even main source of Black-White disparity.37

       The standard estimate of heritability in behavioral genetics is 50%.38 That is, 50% of the

variability across persons in measured behaviors is estimated to be due to genes inherited from

parents. Genes do not fully determine life outcomes. Neither do environments. Extreme claims

about genetic determinism are clearly at odds with the evidence. So are extreme claims about

environmental influences.

       A striking example of the power of culture and environment is the gap in achievement

test scores between genetically very similar Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews in Israel. They are

roughly 2/3 of the gap in measured achievement between Blacks and Whites.39 The results from

the intervention analyses discussed below strengthen the conclusion that environments shape

outcomes and that they can be favorably improved.
                                                                                                   16


       Schooling raises the scores on achievement tests, which are tests that measure acquired

knowledge along with “pure ability.” Herrnstein and Murray used such an achievement test to

measure intelligence.40 In addition, personality traits account for a substantial portion of the

variability in the test score they used (which is the test score used in the analyses of Tables 1 and

2).41 Furthermore, interventions can enhance these traits.

       The lessons of modern genetics are more subtle. The Nature vs. Nurture debate is over.42

Environmental conditions affect gene expression. Substantial evidence shows that early adversity

affects biology and human development. Disadvantage literally gets under the skin and serves to

shape the biology of disadvantaged children.43

       The gene expression of genetically identical (monozygotic) twins has been studied.

Environmental conditions trigger gene expression.44 Early environments are especially

important. By age three, and certainly by age 50, the genetic expressions of “identical” twins

differ as a result of their separate life experiences. This produces diverse behavioral and life

outcomes within twin pairs.45

       One study of gene-environment interactions shows that a variant of the MAOA gene

predicts male conduct disorder and violence. However, the variant of the gene is most strongly

expressed when child-rearing environments are adverse. Many other such gene–environment

interactions have been documented.46 The heritability of traits is substantially modified by the

environment in which a child is raised. Children from less advantaged environments display

diminished heritability of traits (30% versus the standard 50% in behavioral genetics).47

       Recent research establishes the validity of a form of Lamarckian evolution. Adversity is

partly heritable. The adversity of the mother affects the gene expression of the child. Early

environmental influences are especially important.48,49 History gets embedded in the expression
                                                                                                  17


of our genes. Failing to address early disadvantage produces a biological legacy that persists

over generations.50



How Best to Foster Skills
What are the best ways to promote skills and reduce achievement gaps? Is it fixing schools? Is it

supplementing the resources of families? It is both but with proper timing and measure. In the

current fiscal climate, we cannot afford to duplicate the ineffective programs of the War on

Poverty and try to do everything. Prioritization is essential. Bad schools should be improved,

but supplementing the parenting resources of disadvantaged families is an effective and less

commonly understood way to improve educational outcomes.

       One year after the Moynihan report circulated, the eminent sociologist James Coleman

and his colleagues51 produced a study that challenged a central premise of American policy.

The report showed that families and not the attributes of schools, the focus of much current

public policy, determined the success of children in schools as measured by their performance on

achievement tests.

       After 40 years, the wisdom of Coleman and Moynihan has not yet been incorporated into

American public policy. Yet, their message is clear. Family matters, American families are in

trouble, and families are the main drivers of the success of children in schools.

       At the present time, our social policy for fostering the skills of children largely focuses on

improving schools. This strategy is politically palatable because it avoids the charge of “blaming

the victim” and avoids any hint of intrusion into the sanctity of the family—a deeply held

American value. At the same time, a strictly school-based policy ignores the evidence about the

inequality present when children enter school.52 School-based policy does not attack skill gaps

at their source—the lack of family resources for effective early childhood development.
                                                                                                  18


        The evidence on the success of school reforms is at best mixed.53 For example, not all

charter schools are more effective than public schools. The latest evaluations show that 20% are

better; 20% are worse and most—60%—about the same.54 Moreover, parental involvement and

encouragement appear to be essential ingredients of successful charters.

        Surely we can and should improve our schools. But, in light of the evidence from the

Coleman Report and a vast body of scholarly literature that arose from that study, improving the

schools by hiring better teachers, monitoring their performance, reducing classroom sizes, and

improving access to the Internet is unlikely to be enough to eliminate gaps, although much recent

public policy and philanthropic activity is predicated on that assumption. Schools work with

what parents bring them and they are more successful if parents support them.

        Part of the hesitation in adopting any family policy is that we do not fully understand all

of the mechanisms of family influence. How do families produce advantage and disadvantage

across the generations? Research is active in this area. Much remains to be known. However,

we know for certain that parents do a lot more than pass on their genes, and good parenting

matters a lot.



Family Environments for All American Children Have Worsened
By many measures, family environments have worsened for children of all race and ethnic

groups, although the severity of the problem differs greatly among groups. Figure 2 shows that

in 2010 almost 30% of all American children live with a single parent. The greatest source of

growth in the past 30 years has been in the category “never married.” Numerous studies in

economics, demography and sociology confirm Moynihan’s concern that the child rearing

environments of children in single parent families are compromised and with them child

outcomes.55
                                                                                                   19

The Consequences of Early Adversity
The central role of the family in producing child skills and in forming character has been

recognized since time immemorial. American public policy has to shift to acknowledge that the

core skills needed for success in life are formed before children enter school. The main lesson

of Figure 1—that gaps in child test scores open up early and persist and that schools contribute

little to these gaps—needs to be acted on.

        Corresponding to gaps in performance, a gap has emerged between the environments of

children of more educated women and the environments of children of less educated women.

Sara McLanahan refers to this as the “Great Divide” and notes that the children of the

advantaged and of the disadvantaged face “Diverging Destinies.”56
                                                                                                   20


       Fewer than ten percent of college educated women bear children out of wedlock. More

educated women marry later and marry more educated men. They work more. They have more

resources, have fewer children, and provide much richer child rearing environments that produce

dramatic differences in a child’s vocabulary, intellectual performance, nurturance, and

discipline.57 These advantages are especially pronounced for children of two parent stable

marriages.58 Children of such marriages appear to be at a major advantage compared to children

from other unions.

       Even though they work more than less educated women, college-educated mothers

devote more time to child rearing than less-educated mothers, especially in providing child

enrichment activities.59 They spend more time reading to children and less time watching

television with them.

       Disadvantaged mothers, as a group, talk less to their children and are less likely to read to

them daily. Exposure to this type of parenting leads to substantial differences in the verbal skills

of disadvantaged children when they start school.60 Disadvantaged mothers encourage their

children less and tend to adopt harsher parenting styles. Disadvantaged parents tend to be less

engaged with their children’s school work.61 The environments provided by teenage mothers are

particularly adverse.62 Fetal alcohol ingestion alone, which is more frequent with teenage and

less educated mothers, appears to have substantial deleterious consequences on adult outcomes.63

A central premise of Geoffrey Canada’s much discussed Harlem Children’s Zone project, and

especially his Baby College, is that parental engagement from the earliest years is an essential

aspect of creating success for disadvantaged children.64

       Child poverty is not solely or even mainly about access to financial resources.65

Johnson’s War on Poverty attempted to remediate financial poverty, but neglected other
                                                                                                    21


important factors. An overwhelming body of evidence suggests that parenting plays a crucial

role—what parents do and do not do; how they interact with and supplement the lives of their

children, especially their early lives. The true measure of child affluence and poverty is the

quality of parenting. A lone mother living in financial poverty can create a stimulating early

environment for her child.66



Supplement Disadvantaged Families, Don’t Blame Them
How to best aid struggling families? How to produce a cost-effective child skill formation policy

that recognizes the trends affecting many American families? Many great minds over the ages

have recognized that the family is a major source of social inequality. They have proposed

replacing the family to reduce inequality. That policy has been tried with disastrous

consequences.67 There is no good substitute for a mother’s love and care.

       Public policy needs to be reformulated to recognize the dynamics of skill formation—the

biology and neuroscience that shows that skills beget skills; that success breeds success; that

disadvantage gets embodied into the biology of the child and retards the development of children

in terms of their health, character, and smarts.

       While we do not yet know all of the mechanisms through which families influence their

children, we know enough to suggest the broad contours of an effective child development

strategy. Supplementing the early years of disadvantaged children addresses a major source of

inequality. Many programs that supplement the child rearing resources of families are effective.

While much remains to be known, much is also known.

       For example, the Perry preschool program targeted disadvantaged, subnormal IQ African

American preschoolers in a city just outside Detroit.68 For two years, the program taught

children to plan, execute and evaluate daily projects in a structured setting. It fostered social
                                                                                                 22


skills. There were weekly home visits to encourage parenting. The Perry Program was

evaluated using random assignment with long-term follow-up for 40 years. Rates of return are 7-

10% per annum—higher than the return on equity over the post-war period 1945-2008 and

before the recent market meltdown.69 The Perry program did not boost the IQs of participants.

It worked by fostering soft skills.70

       These and other successful child development programs work because they start early.

Benefits include enhanced school readiness, and reduced burdens on the schools for special

education. They produce benefits in the teen years with better health behaviors, reduced teenage

pregnancy and lower dropout rates. They promote higher adult productivity and self-sufficiency.

They supplement the family by working with both the parent and the child. They provide a

strong boost to character skills that matter. Successful programs offer a lifeline of family

supplementation for disadvantaged families. They engage the parents, are voluntary, and do not

impair the sanctity of the family. Disadvantaged families of all race groups gladly take up

opportunities to enhance the lives of their children. Most mothers, however disadvantaged, want

the best for their children. The voluntary nature of these programs avoids coercion and

condescension and promotes dignity.

       The logic underlying enrichment of the early environments of disadvantaged children is

based on a deeper understanding of the life cycle of skill formation than was available to the

architects of the War on Poverty. More motivated and healthier children are better learners. The

process is dynamic and feeds back on itself—academic success and social success promote

greater self-confidence and a willingness of children to explore.
                                                                                                      23


          A strategy that places greater emphasis on parenting resources directed to the early years

is a strategy that prevents rather than remediates problems. It supplements families and makes

them active participants in the process of child development.

          Remediation strategies as currently implemented are much less effective. This is the flip

side of the argument for early intervention. Many skills that are malleable in the early years are

much less so in the teenage years. As a consequence, remediating academic and social deficits in

the teenage years is much more costly. Even at great cost, remediation policies have not been

effective and certainly earn annual rates of return far below the 7-10% found for the Perry

Program.71

           For high quality early childhood interventions, there are none of the trade-offs between

equity and efficiency that plague most public policies. Early interventions produce broadly

based benefits and reduce social and economic inequality. At the same time they promote

productivity and economic efficiency. They are both fair and efficient.

          In contrast, the school-focused No Child Left Behind program72 diverts teaching away

from fostering other skills that matter for success in life besides tested math and reading.

Because it ignores inequality at the starting gate, No Child Left Behind leaves many children

behind.



Dynamic Synergies and the Timing of Effective Interventions

High quality early childhood programs are investments with rates of returns far higher than those

found for most governmentally provided skills programs. Figure 3 summarizes the evidence

from a large body of research in economics and developmental psychology. The figure plots the

rate of return to investment for an extra dollar of investment in the early years, in preschool, in
                                                                                                      24


school and in job training for a person who has an initial (low) common baseline investment at

all ages. The return to investment at the earliest ages is high because it creates the foundation of

skills that make later investment productive.73 This pattern is a manifestation of dynamic

synergism—what economists call “dynamic complementarity.” For example, children who enter

school with character and cognitive skills gain more from formal education.74

          Early investment percolates throughout the life cycle. If the base is not strong, and has

been compromised by early family disadvantage, skill investments at later ages are much less

productive. This is due to the lessened malleability of older children and adults compared to that

of young children.

                                                                                                    25


               The negative side of dynamic complementarity is that there is an equity-efficiency

tradeoff for skill investment programs targeted toward disadvantaged adolescents and adults who

lack a strong skill base. Remediation in the late adolescent and adult years to achieve the same

level of competence is much more costly. This feature of dynamic complementarity accounts for

the sorry record of a variety of skill enhancement programs, launched in the War on Poverty, that

still receive substantial public support.76 Current policy does not heed the wisdom inherent in

Figure 3. We overinvest in attempting to remediate the problems of disadvantaged adolescents

and underinvest in the early years of disadvantaged children.

       In contrast to the 7-10% per annum earned by the Perry program and other early

childhood programs, returns on many other skill enhancement programs are much lower. They

are certainly lower for public job training, criminal rehabilitation programs, adult literacy

programs, and a variety of other later life remediation programs targeting disadvantaged

adolescents and young adults with low cognitive and character skills.77 For example, a recent

evaluation of the Job Corps showed meager earnings benefits a negative rate of return.78

Reducing pupil-teacher ratios in schools also has a negative rate of return.79 We need to listen to

the logic of developmental biology to devise strategies to reduce disparities in parenting across

all racial and ethnic groups.



Engage the Private Sector

How can we fund such programs? Times are hard and government budgets are strained.

Nonetheless, it would be possible to fund effective new programs if they replaced the numerous

ineffective programs currently in place. Few governmental programs of any sort would meet the
                                                                                                   26


standard set by the high rates of return earned by childhood programs. As high quality early

childhood programs are implemented, the budgetary burden of remediation will be lessened.

        Engaging the private sector—philanthropic, community and religious organizations—

bolsters the resource base supporting early childhood. Bringing in diverse partners encourages

experimentation with new approaches that build on the success of templates like Perry and the

Abecedarian program.80 Educare is one promising program that fosters public and private

partnerships.81 Engaging diverse groups encourages development of culturally and religiously

sensitive intervention programs that respect the sanctity of the family and the diversity of values

that characterize modern American society.


A New Strategy Based on New Knowledge

In contemporary American society, the racial gap in achievement is primarily due to gaps in

skills. Modern society is based on skills, and inequality in achievement across all race and ethnic

groups is primarily due to inequality in skills. Both cognitive and personality skills determine

life success.

        Families are major producers of skills. They do much more than pass along their genes.

Inequality in skills and schools is strongly linked to inequality in family environments. While

the exact mechanisms through which families produce skills are actively being investigated, a lot

is already known. Parenting matters. The true measure of child poverty and advantage is the

quality of parenting a child receives, not just the money available to a household.

        A growing fraction of American children across all race and ethnic groups is being raised

in dysfunctional families. The growing contrast between the early environments of advantaged

and disadvantaged children threatens to create greater inequality in the next generation of

Americans from an already high level.
                                                                                                   27


       We have learned a lot about how to foster skills since the 1960s when the War on Poverty

attempted to remediate skills deficits of people of all ages and developmental stages. The

science of skill formation shows how skill begets skill.

       Investments that foster early life skills enhance the productivity of investment at later

ages. They support the schools and enhance the productivity of adult job training. Because of

the percolation effects of early investment due to the dynamic complementarity of skill

formation, policies that attack inequality at its early source are cost-effective. They promote

equality and, at the same time, promote economic efficiency. There is no equity-efficiency

tradeoff for such policies.

       The malleability and plasticity characteristic of young children declines with age. This

effect is what makes investment in disadvantaged, low skilled young adults so difficult. To

achieve the same adult outcomes, later life remediation for disadvantage is far more costly than

early life prevention. There is an equity-efficiency tradeoff for later-life remediation activities.

As early life programs pay off, the budgets spent on remediation can be substantially reduced.

       Our current policies to reduce achievement gaps ignore these simple truths. America

currently places too much emphasis on improving what goes on in schools compared to

improving what goes on in families. Supplementing the parenting resources of disadvantaged

Americans will bolster American schools and enhance the effectiveness of school reforms. It

will lower the burden of remediation. A comprehensive, cost-effective policy to enhance the

skills of disadvantaged children of all racial and ethnic backgrounds through voluntary,

culturally sensitive support for parenting is a politically and economically palatable strategy.
