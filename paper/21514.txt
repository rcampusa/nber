                                          ABSTRACT

Using large firm-level and industry-level data sets from eighteen countries, we find that foreign
direct investment (FDI) and trade have positive spillover effects on product and technology
innovation by domestic firms in emerging markets. The FDI effect is more pronounced for firms
from advanced economies. However, while we detect the spillover effects with micro data at the
firm-level, when we use linkage variables computed from input-output tables at the industry level
we find much weaker, and usually insignificant, effects. These patterns are important for policy,
suggesting that spillovers are localized to firms engaged directly with multinationals and in trade,
rather than affecting all domestic firms in industries with FDI presence.

1. Introduction

A major question that has arisen in the last few decades is whether domestic firms have become stronger

or weaker with the opening up of most economies to foreign trade and investment. More specifically, has

the efficiency of firms in emerging market economies improved with the growing presence of foreign

direct investment (FDI) within their borders and the opening of these economies to trade? While there is

substantial evidence that multinational enterprises (MNEs)1 are more productive than domestic firms,2 the
                                                                         0F                                                   1F




evidence on productivity spillovers of FDI and trade remains mixed.3                 2F




         The mixed evidence points to the need to understand better the mechanisms through which

horizontal and vertical relationships with foreign firms and international trade improve or hamper

efficiency of domestic firms. Innovation is the presumed conduit through which globalization affects

productivity, yet there has been little research testing the relationship between globalization and

innovation. In this paper, we provide the first analysis based on industry-level (“indirect”) and firm-

level (“micro”) data to address this question.

         Foreign firms may have efficiency and other “spillover” effects on local competitors (horizontal

spillovers) as well as on upstream and downstream domestic firms (vertical spillovers). 4 Most studies           3F




1
  In this paper the term MNEs refers to foreign-owned firms, although we recognize that domestically owned firms can also
be multinational in their production and sourcing.
2
  See e.g., the seminal work of Caves (1974) and the more recent work of Djankov and Hoekman (2000), Haskel, Pereira
and Slaughter (2007) and Sabirianova, Svejnar and Terrell (2005).
3
  Various literatures examine the impact of globalization on efficiency of firms in emerging markets. For a review of the literature
on foreign direct investment, see e.g., Gorg and Greenaway (2004); for a review of the trade literature, see e.g., Wagner (2007).
4
  The spillover (broadly defined as a transfer of managerial practices, production methods, marketing techniques or any
other knowledge embodied in a product or service) may occur through a number of channels. Local firms may for instance
learn to imitate a new process or improve the quality of their products or services through observation, or find out about
better processes or marketing methods through interaction with foreign managers in business chambers and from former
employees of MNEs. Local firms may also benefit from the entry of new professional services or suppliers as a result of
the MNE entry. Foreign firms may act as catalysts for domestic suppliers to improve quality or time efficiency by
demanding higher standards. On the other hand, foreign firms may have a negative effect on domestic firms’ output and
efficiency if they “steal” their market or best human capital. If domestic firms cut back production in the face of foreign
competition, they may experience a higher average cost as fixed costs are spread over a smaller scale of production (Aitken
and Harrison, 1999). Similarly, if the best employees leave for foreign firms, efficiency declines.

                                                                 2

The effect of foreign presence on the productivity of domestic firms in a given industry is captured by the

coefficient on the share of foreign firms’ output or employment in that industry. The evidence from this

research is mixed. Most studies of developing countries suggest that the horizontal spillover effect is nil

or negative. 6 On the other hand, several studies find positive horizontal spillovers in the more developed
              5F




economies such as the UK.7 Hence, there is a puzzle that is of considerable interest.
                                 6F




         While studies of horizontal productivity spillovers are numerous, until recently there were few

empirical studies on vertical spillovers. This is surprising given the early analysis by Lall (1980) of the

positive backward linkage effects of foreign firms on the Indian trucking industry. 8 Moreover, vertical 7F




spillovers are more likely to be positive than horizontal spillovers since MNEs have an incentive to

improve the productivity of their suppliers rather than that of their competitors. 9 The empirical papers
                                                                                                    8F




that have appeared more recently do indeed find evidence that is consistent with the view of technology

transfer through backward linkages in the manufacturing sectors of for example, Hungary (Schoors and

van der Tol, 2001), Indonesia (Blalock and Gertler, 2005), Lithuania (Javorcik, 2004), Czech Republic

(Stancik, 2007) and the United Kingdom (Girma, Gorg and Pisu, 2008). However, these studies rely only

on a variable that is constructed from input-output (I-O) tables at the industry level, rather than a direct



5
  The literature on FDI spillovers has been burgeoning in recent years. We do not attempt to summarize the large and rapidly
growing literature, but simply highlight the work that has motivated the analysis in this paper. We refer the interested
reader to a survey by Gorg and Greenaway (2004).
6
  See for example studies of Morocco by Haddad and Harrison (1993); Venezuela by Aitken and Harrison (1999); Bulgaria
and Romania by Konings (2000); Russia by Yudaeva et al. (2003); the Czech Republic by Kosova (2004); and China by
Abraham, Konings and Slootmaekers (2006). In the Chinese case, Abraham, Konings and Slootmaekers (2006) find positive
horizontal spillovers for certain types of firms. More recently, using firm-level data from ten transition economies, Damijan
et al. (2012) find that horizontal spillovers tend to be positive in more productive firms and negative in less productive and
smaller ones. Moreover, Davies, Lamla, and Schiffbauer (2016) find that spillovers tend to be temporary in that they depend
on MNEs continuous presence.
7
  See e.g., Haskel et al. (2007) and Keller and Yeaple (2003).
8
  On the other hand, there are numerous case studies which provide specific examples of how MNEs provide training and
assistance to their suppliers. See for example, Moran (2001).
9
  Blalock and Gertler (2005) point out that MNEs may establish a relationship with multiple suppliers to reduce dependency
on a single supplier and that this will then benefit all firms that purchase these vendors’ output. Consistent with this view, Lin
and Saggi (2007) show theoretically how exclusivity in the contractual relationship between a multinational and its local
supplier reduces the competition among local suppliers and can lower backward linkages and local welfare relative to autarky.

                                                                3
firm-specific measure. More recently, Gorodnichenko, Svejnar and Terrell (2010, 2014) use firm-specific

linkage variables to examine the productivity effects of the share of sales to multinationals, share of

exports in total sales and share of imported inputs in total input cost in the Business Environment and

Enterprise Performance Surveys (BEEPS) data. Moreover, Vacek (2007) uses a firm-specific linkage

variable to examine the productivity effects of share of sales to multinationals within a small sample of

large firms in four two-digit NACE manufacturing sectors in the Czech Republic. Finally, Barrioso et al.

(2011) find evidence of positive backward linkages using plant level data from Ireland, while Di Ubaldo,

Lawless and Siedschlag (2018) find a nil or negative effect using firm-level Irish data.

        There has thus been considerable advancement within the productivity spillover literature, but the

mixed results suggest that one needs to (a) examine directly the effect of FDI and trade on innovation and

(b) assess whether the widely used industry-level linkage measures (e.g., Javorcik, 2004) provide an

adequate approach or whether it is preferable to employ firm-level linkage measures in addressing these

issues. The direct examination of the effect of FDI and trade on innovation is desirable because theories

usually make predictions about the effects on innovation by firms rather than about the (derived)

productivity effect. Furthermore, as argued by Gorodnichenko (2008) and others, measured productivity

captures the revenue generating ability of firms (which includes both market power and technology level)

rather than the technology level of firms. The comparison of the indirect effects based on (aggregate)

industry-level linkages and direct effect based on firm-level (micro) linkages is highly desirable because

it is not clear that the typical measures of vertical linkages at the industry level, which rely on I-O tables

(e.g., Javorcik, 2004) provide a sufficiently precise measure of the linkage. In particular, studies based on

I-O tables cannot identify whether the spillover effects are broad-based, affecting all firms in a given

industry, or whether they are specific to firms engaged with multinationals.

        In this paper we carry out this analysis by combining the rich ORBIS™ data base of firms with the

2002 and 2005 BEEPS of firms in 18 emerging market (transition) economies and Turkey. We use these


                                                      4
firm-level data together with industry-level input-output data that we have collected individually from

national statistical offices and international organizations. The combined data set enables us to provide the

first study of innovation effects of both industry-level (input-output) and firm-level (micro) measures of

horizontal, backward and forward linkages of local firms to MNEs. As mentioned earlier, we also include

in the analysis of vertical spillovers the concept of selling to or buying from firms outside of the country,

i.e., importing and exporting, since vertical spillovers need not be constrained to linkages with foreign

firms within the host country alone. In doing so, we recognize that others have analyzed the link between

firm-level innovation and imports or exports.10 The advantage of our approach derives from the fact that
                                                     9F




we analyze vertical linkages as sales to multinationals, as well as exports and imports, and that unlike other

studies we carry out our analysis on many countries.

         Second, we are able to provide much larger comparative evidence on more heterogeneous firms

than has been possible in this area to date. 11 Our analysis covers firms in both the service and
                                                          10F




manufacturing sectors, while existing studies focus on manufacturing. This is important because most of

the recent FDI is in services. We are also able to estimate the effects separately for small firms, while

much of the existing evidence is for medium and large firms. Being able to cover smaller firms is important

because smaller firms tend to be the new entrepreneurs and engines of growth in many emerging market

economies. Finally, we also test for differences in spillovers among new and old firms – in our case firms

that existed prior to 1990 (before the fall of the communist regime) and those that started afterwards.




10
   These include Bustos (2011), who uses a theoretical model and evidence from Argentine firm-level data to show that
firms update technology when faced with the opportunities presented by trade liberalization. Long, Raff and Stahler (2011)
also use a theoretical model to show that trade liberalization increases firm-level innovation in a set-up with heterogeneous
firms (although they describe innovation in terms of cost-saving R&D). Fernandes and Paunov (2010) use Chilean firm-
level data to evidence product innovation or quality upgrades by firms faced with import competition. One other paper
examines both directions of causality between innovation and exporting -- Damijan, Kostevc and Polanec (2010) use
Slovenian firm-level data to show that exporting leads to productivity improvements, especially for firms that report changes
to their production process.
11
   Our analysis includes firm level data from Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Georgia,
Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Turkey, and Ukraine.

                                                                5
        Third, we check the robustness of our base results using a control function approach and find

that the base results are quite robust.

        We find that FDI and trade have strong positive spillover effects on innovation by domestic

firms. However, our results indicate that the spillover effects can be detected with micro data at the

firm-level, but using linkage variables computed from I-O tables at the industry level yields much

weaker, and usually insignificant, estimated effects. Furthermore, whether we use input-output matrices

to calculate immediate linkages to industries with strong foreign presence or to calculate total linkages

across industries (based on the inverse of input-output matrices) appears to make relatively little

difference for the estimates of the industry-level effects. Thus, the spillover effects on innovation

appear to be localized, reflecting effect on firms that are directly engaged with multinationals, rather

than being broad-based, reflecting an effect on all firms in a given industry. Moreover, the strength of

estimated spillovers is heterogeneous. For example, spillovers of FDI from more advanced countries

(OECD or high productivity countries) are more tangible than spillovers of FDI from less advanced

(non-OECD or lower productivity) countries.

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe our data and analytical

methodology. In Section 3 we present our findings and we interpret them in the concluding Section 4.



2. Data and Methodology
We use firm-level data from the ORBIS™ and BEEPS data bases. 12 The BEEPs survey was first
                                                                                1F




undertaken in 1999–2000, when it was administered to approximately 4,000 enterprises in 26 countries

of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to assess the

environment for private enterprise and business development. The second and third rounds of the




12
  The description of the data draws heavily from Synovate (2005), the report from the firm that implemented the BEEPS
instrument and provided the EBRD and World Bank with electronic data sets.

                                                         6
BEEPS were implemented in 2002 and 2005 on approximately 6,500 and 9,500 enterprises,

respectively, in the same CIS and CEE countries, and expanded to include Turkey from the second

round and Turkmenistan from the third round. The 2005 BEEPS survey instrument approximates the

coverage, sampling frames and specific questionnaire items of the second round of the BEEPS. 13 For             12F




all countries, the BEEPS survey is representative of the private sector at the national level; for some

countries it is also representative at the subnational level.14 Examining individual variables such as

markups, one observes that the values reported in BEEPS are largely consistent with values estimated

for emerging market economies by De Loecker and Eeckout (2018).

        In this paper we use primarily the 2002 and 2005 BEEPS surveys as they contains data on the

variables of interest. 15 The original 2005 data base contains a total of 9,655 firms, with 200 – 975 firms
                       13F




per country. The share of firms in services ranges from 50% to 65% across the 28 countries. Between

two-thirds and three-quarters of the firms have less than 50 employees. Approximately 10% of the

firms are foreign owned and another 10% are state owned. The share of firms that export more than

20% of their output varies widely across countries: from 5% in Kazakhstan to 30% in Slovenia. The

2002 BEEPS has a similar structure and composition.

        To construct measures of foreign presence in an industry in a given country, we use information

on foreign ownership from the ORBIS database – a global firm-level database constructed by Bureau

van Dijk. 16 The ownership data include owner’s country of origin (not only whether a firm is foreign-
          14F




owned), allowing us to identify whether or not foreign ownership is from an OECD economy.

for the AMADEUS database, which business and economics scholars have used for more than a decade for Europe-focused
firm-level studies. ORBIS is the global superset of AMADEUS. It is arguably the world’s largest database of public and
private companies, and it distinguishes itself by being the only global dataset that comprehensively identifies parent-
subsidiary relationships between firms. (Bureau van Dijk aggregates ownership and financial information from official
sources worldwide – primarily using sources like national registers of companies like the United Kingdom’s Company

                                                          7
         In addition to the ORBIS™ and BEEPS data, we rely on data from I-O tables to construct the

industry-wide spillover variables. We are only able to obtain recent I-O tables for 18 of the economies

covered by the survey, therefore we focus our analysis on these countries and we pool the 2002 and

2005 survey data. 17 We take the I-O tables from GTAP 7. 18
                     15F                                              16F




         The BEEPS sample includes a variety of firms, from very small firms with as few as two

employees to larger firms with up to 10,000 employees. Moreover, the data include firms in the rural

areas as well as large cities, and firms in industry as well as firms in the service sector, which is the

new dynamic (yet understudied) sector in these economies. 19 Hence the data enable us to analyze
                                                                            17F




diverse firms in a large number of countries.

         In addition, the data set contains a panel component, where several hundred firms that were

surveyed in 2002 were surveyed again in 2005. 20 However, our analysis relies primarily on the pooled
                                                         18F




2002 and 2005 data since many variables of interest have a retrospective component in each survey and

because it is hard to detect robust relationships with a small panel of heterogeneous firms, especially

when we use a number of control variables.

         An important advantage of our data is that firms self-report various types of innovation activity.

Most studies on innovation use patent data or R&D expenditures, which have well-known limitations as

measures of innovation. Patents are generally viewed as having three weaknesses: 1) they measure

inventions rather than innovations; 2) the tendency to patent varies across countries, industries and




House, private information services like FAME™, credit analysts like D&B, and the public records of listed companies.
By 2010, it covered more than 80 million firms from 180 countries and territories). ORBIS firm-level data coverage overlaps
with all the years for which we have BEEPS data –its scope similarly extends to firms of all sizes and industry sectors.
17
   We have attempted to impute values for countries with missing input-output tables by using the average values from the
two closest neighboring countries but we have found that such imputation introduced too much noise in the data.

19
   According to Fernandes (2009), “During the 1997-2004 period, services represent an increasing share of value-added …
in the [Eastern European] region, averaging 46% … remarkable given the underdevelopment of the services sector …
during the communist period”.
20
   The relatively small size of the panel should not be associated with intensive exit of firms in these countries. The exit
rate was about 8% (average across countries). The size of the panel is mainly brought about by a refusal of firms to
participate in the new wave of the survey (42%) and inability to reach eligible responders within firms (25%).

                                                               8
processes; and 3) firms often protect their innovations by using methods other than patents (maintaining

technological complexity, industrial secrecy, and lead time over competitors). Using R&D expenditures

may also be inappropriate because not all innovations are generated by R&D expenditures (Santamaria et

al, 2008), R&D does not necessarily lead to innovation (it is an input rather than an output), and formal

R&D measures are biased against small firms (Michie, 1998; Archibugi and Sirilli, 2001; Lin et al, 2010).

Perhaps most important for the purposes of this paper is the fact that in emerging market economies these

types of innovations are less likely to be observed as firms are expected to engage more in imitation and

adaptation of already created and tested technologies, rather than in generating new inventions and are less

likely to expend resources on R&D.

        In this study, we define innovation broadly as the development and upgrading of new products and

adoption of new technologies. Specifically, we use binary variables based on top managers’ answers to the

question about whether a firm has undertaken any of the following two initiatives in the last three years:

developed successfully a major new product line or upgraded an existing product line (hereafter New

Product); acquired new production technology (hereafter New Technology).

        As noted above, since we are studying emerging market economies, it is expected that these

two measures of innovation may have some element of imitation or adoption rather than “in house

development.” From the survey, we know for example, that the new technology used in the firm can

be acquired in a number of ways. It can be developed by the firm (17% who answered that they acquired

a new technology said this was the way the technology was introduced) or it can be acquired by hiring

new personnel (5%) or transferred from elsewhere (universities, business associations, etc., 3%).

However, the vast majority (75%) of acquired new technology was embodied in new machinery or

equipment that was purchased or licensed from other sources. 21          19F




21
  One may be concerned that a vast majority of new technology is due to imitation and wonder whether our results extend to
genuine in-house innovations made within firms. We applied our econometric specification (discussed below) to two in-house
measures of innovation—positive R&D expenditures and “new technology developed by the firm” —and found similar effects.

          The BEEPS data also permit us to control at the firm level for the effects of pressure from

foreign and domestic competition. In particular, we use as a control variable each firm’s markup, a

“sufficient statistic” for the degree of competition. 22                    20F




          In addition to providing competition, foreign firms may also transfer capabilities. The BEEPS

data permit us to capture the extent of vertical linkages between domestic and foreign firms, which allow

transfer of capabilities or “knowledge spillovers.” We use three variables for vertical linkages: SMNE,

the share of a firm’s sales to multinational enterprises; 23 Exports, the share of sales exported; and Imports,
                                                                                  21F




the share of “material inputs and supplies” imported.24 Whereas SMNE can be construed as capturing

downstream relationships with foreign firms within the country, Exports can be viewed as capturing

downstream relationships with foreign firms outside the country.

   Note that Imports refer to material inputs and supplies rather than imports of machinery and equipment, which could
introduce a mechanical correlation between import share and the dependent variable. In fact, in our data the correlation

 firms, sector, country, and time, respectively. Variables dated with period 𝑡𝑡 − 3 are taken from

 retrospective questions about the firm’s performance three years prior to the current date.

        The first three variables capture industry-level, foreign linkage variables: horizontal, backward

and forward. These linkages are common across firms in a given industry, time, and country. We

compute them as direct linkages and total linkages. With 𝐴𝐴 being an I-O matrix, total linkages include

direct and indirect effects and are based on the (𝐼𝐼 − 𝐴𝐴)−1 matrix, while direct linkages do not take into

account the indirect multiplier effects and are based only on 𝐴𝐴. The existing literature uses only the

direct linkages. Specifically, we compute the linkages for industry j as follows:

suggested by a demand-driven and supply-driven model of the economy, respectively.




                                                                                   11
        The next three explanatory variables capture vertical linkages or transfer of capabilities: SMNE

(the share of sales to multinational enterprises), Export (the share of export in sales), and Import (the

share of imported inputs).

        In addition to sector (𝜆𝜆𝑠𝑠 ), country (𝜗𝜗𝑐𝑐 ) and year (𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡 ) fixed effects, we include the following

variables to control for firm-specific factors deemed to be important in the literature: 25        2F




        L (the number of employees) and L2 measure the size of the firm. The argument for including

size is that large companies have more resources to innovate and can benefit from economies of scale

in R&D production and marketing. 26      23F




        EDU (the share of workers with a university education) and SKILL (the share of skilled workers)

capture human capital in the firm. These variables may be expected to be positively correlated with

innovation if EDU reflects the involvement of workers in R&D and more skilled workers (SKILL) are

able to give feedback to the firm on how to improve a product.

        Age of the firm is the log of the number of years since the firm began operations in the country.

Two hypotheses are plausible: one suggesting that older firms developed routines that are resistant to

innovation and another suggesting that older firms will accumulate the knowledge necessary to

innovate. There is evidence for both hypotheses.

        CNM is a dummy equal to one if the firm competes in the national markets and zero otherwise

(e.g., when a firm only competes in a regional or local market). We expect CNM to have a positive

effect on innovation, given that the firm operates in a larger market.

        State Owned Enterprise (SOE) is a dummy variable equal to one if the government owns 50%

or more of the firm and zero otherwise. This variable is expected to be negatively correlated with

  This variable is probably one of the most studied firm characteristics determining innovation, in part because it also
captures one of Schumpeter’s (1943) hypotheses.

innovation for a variety of reasons, including a poor system of rewards for innovative activities in these

enterprises.

       FOREIGN is a dummy variable equal to one if foreigners own 50% or more of the firm and

zero otherwise.

       CU is capacity utilization. Adding this variable allows us to adjust the effects of the firm size

variable(s) with an index of factor-intensity.

       Lopt is the optimal size of employment relative to the current employment. (This information

was collected from managers as part of the survey). Like CU, Lopt can be interpreted as a measure of

capacity utilization. The expected coefficient sign for CU and Lopt is ambiguous.

       Location (Loc) is a set of dummies for size of population where the firm is operating or

headquartered. This will control for potential differences in knowledge available in larger v. smaller

cities. Appendix Table A1 contains a more detailed description of our variables.

       To assess the extent to which the estimated effects are specific to particular settings or nonlinear

in key variables, we also separately estimate the basic specification for each of the following subsamples:

       Sector: manufacturing, services;

       Ownership: private domestic, foreign, and state;

       Employment size: 1= 2-10 employees, 2 = 11- 49, 3 = 50-99, 4 = 100+;

       Regions: CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States -- Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia,

                  Kazakhstan, Russia), EU (European Union -- Slovenia, Poland, Hungary, Czech

                  Republic, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia), and SEE (South-Eastern Europe --

                  Albania, Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey);

       Red tape: firms are grouped into three bins based on manager’s time spent with official. (1=

                  least time, 3 = most time).

3. Empirical Results
In Tables 1 and 2 below, we report the summary statistics. As may be seen from Table 1, our sample

covers 18 emerging market economies in the EU, SEE (including Turkey) and the CIS. The sample

contains several hundred firms in each country, with larger countries (Kazakhstan, Poland, Romania,

Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine) each having more than 800 firms. Croatia has the smallest sample with

291 firms. The mean and standard deviation statistics in Table 2 suggest that the values taken on by

the variables used in our analysis are reasonable and display considerable variation. About 38% of the

firms report that they introduced a new product, while about 30% have introduced a new technology.

Both the total and direct horizontal, forward and backward linkages (common across firms in a given

industry, time, and country) take on values in the 0.3 - 0.5 range, while the corresponding linkages with

respect to OECD fall in the 0.2 – 0.3 range. The share of sales going to multinational firms averages

0.07, the share of sales exported averages 0.09 and the share of imported inputs in the value of all inputs

averages 0.29. The average share of skilled workers is 0.49, while workers with a university education

average 27% of the firms’ total labor force. About 10% of the firms have majority state ownership,

while about 12% have majority foreign ownership. Finally, about 70% of the firms report competing

in the national as opposed to only the local market.



3.1    Baseline Estimates
In Tables 3-6, we report the estimated coefficients on the industry-level linkages 𝛼𝛼 and firm-level

(micro) linkages 𝛽𝛽. In these tables we report estimates based on total linkages (using the (𝐼𝐼 − 𝐴𝐴)−1

matrix), while in the appendix tables we report the corresponding estimates based on direct linkages

(using the 𝐴𝐴 matrix). As may be seen from the first row of Table 3, the estimated product innovation

                                                    14
spillovers based on the entire data set for the usual industry-level, input-output linkage variables are all

statistically insignificant. This finding is consistent with much of the literature that finds insignificant

spillover effects on productivity. In contrast, the corresponding product innovation spillovers based on

the firm-level data are all positive and statistically highly significant. Quantitatively these estimates are

also substantial. When converted to marginal effects at means, our point estimates on

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆, 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 and 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 range from 0.07 to 0.09 and the standard deviations of these variables are

between 0.2 and 0.4. Thus, a one standard deviation increase in 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆, 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸, 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 can raise our

measures of innovation by about 0.015 to 0.030, or approximately 4 to 7 percent, given that the

unconditional means of the dependent variables are about 0.3 to 0.4. Our estimates based on both the

firm-level and industry-level approaches hence indicate that the industry-level data do not capture the

positive innovation spillover effects that can be detected with firm-level data. The two sets of estimates

hence suggest that spillovers are isolated to firms engaged with multinational firms rather than affecting

all firms in industries with multinationals.

        The uniformly positive and statistically significant firm-level spillover effects are also found in

Table 3 when we carry out the estimation on the following subsamples of firms: service sector firms,

old firms, new firms, state-owned firms, domestic privately-owned firms, firms located in EU countries,

and firms in which officials spend considerable time with local officials (i.e., considerable red tape).

Moreover, there are several categories of firms in which we find the effect of the share of sales to

MNEs to be insignificant, but the effects of the share of sales exported and share of inputs imported to

be positive and significant: manufacturing firms, de-novo firms, small and medium-sized firms, MNEs,

firms located in SEE, and firms in which officials spend little or only moderate amount of time with

officials (low red tape). The positive effect of interacting with foreign firms is hence positive for most

types of firms, with manufacturing being the only sector (about one-third of the sampled firms) where

a greater share of sales going to MNEs is not associated with greater product innovation. Interestingly,


                                                       15
as may be seen from all the rows of Table 3, when we carry out estimations for the various subsamples

of firms, the estimated industry-level linkages are virtually all statistically insignificant, 27 again                  24F




suggesting that the aggregate analysis based on input-output tables does not capture the effects found

with firm-level data. Finally, as may be seen from the Appendix Table A2, the estimates based on direct

linkages are similar to those based on total linkages.

            The finding that industry-level estimates of product innovation spillovers are statistically

insignificant has led us to explore this interesting issue further. In particular, in Table 3A we present

estimates from specifications where we exclude the firm-level linkage variables from the regressions. We

find that excluding the firm-level linkages leaves the estimated industry-level linkages virtually unaffected.

Moreover, when we leave out the firm-level linkages and aggregate the innovation variable to the industry

level (i.e., when we estimate with industry-level data) in Table 3B, we again find similar results. The

results could also be affected by not including capital stock and purchases of intermediate inputs as control

variables. We do not include these regressors in the base specification because approximately one-half of

the firms in the sample do not report values for these variables. However, when we include these control

variables, the results (reported in Appendix Table A6) are similar to those obtained with the full sample.

Finally, the question arises as to whether a “horse race” between the industry- and firm-level linkages is

fair, given that at the industry level we use only one piece of information (ownership share of foreign

firms), while at the firm level we use three pieces (MNE sales, export and import shares). We agree that

the amount of variation for industry-level linkages may be smaller than for firm-level linkages, but this is

a key reason why firm-level, cross-country analyses like ours are important -- they may exploit more

variation in the data and lead to more precise estimates. We also note that while the three variables at the

industry level are not perfectly correlated (because the I-O tables are not symmetric), we agree that one

may be concerned that the comparison is unfair as long as the correlation across industry-level linkages is


27
     Of the many estimated coefficients in the first three columns of Table 3, only 8 are significant and two of these are negative.

                                                                 16
higher than across firm-level linkages. We address this issue by reporting in columns (8) and (10) of Table

3 F-tests of the hypothesis that coefficients on a given type of linkages are jointly equal to zero.28 As may

be seen from the table, even these tests do not overturn our conclusion that statistically the firm-level

linkages are much stronger predictors of product innovation than industry-level linkages. Hence, our

results are quite robust.

         Our findings with respect to the adoption of new technology are similar to those obtained for

developing a new product. Using the total linkage method, we find in Table 4 that the estimated spillovers

based on the firm-level micro data are all positive and statistically highly significant for the sample of all

firms, as well as for the subsamples of manufacturing firms, service sector firms, old firms, domestic

private firms, and firms whose managers do not spend much time with officials. Our firm-level technology

innovation findings are hence even stronger than our corresponding findings with respect to product

innovation in that manufacturing firms register a positive spillover effect not only with respect to exporting

and importing, but also with respect to supplying the locally based MNEs. Firms in a number of other

subsamples generate significant positive effects with respect to exporting and importing, but insignificant

effects with respect to sales to MNEs: new firms, de-novo firms, firms that spend a moderate amount of

time with officials, and firms operating in SEE and CIS. In contrast, large firms, state-owned firms and

firms operating the EU countries benefit from selling to MNEs and exporting, but not from linkages

derived from importing inputs. As before, spillovers based on industry-level variables are mostly

insignificant.29 This finding is again consistent with much of the literature that finds insignificant spillover
                25F




effects on productivity. Finally, the estimates based on direct linkages, reported in Table A3, are similar.

         As we did with product innovation, we have also estimated the technology innovation

regressions with the firm-level linkage variables excluded from the regressions. As may be seen from



28
   Intuitively, a high correlation between regressors may make individual coefficients on these regressors statistically insignificant
(because of collinearity) but the F-test is immune to this issue because it tests the joint predictive power of regressors.
29
   Of the few that are statistically significant, most are negative.

                                                                 17
Table 4A, excluding the firm-level linkages leaves the estimates of industry-level linkages virtually

unaffected. Moreover, when we leave out the firm-level linkages and aggregate the technology

innovation variable to the industry level (i.e., when we estimate with industry-level data) in Table 4B,

we again find similar results. When we estimate on a smaller sample of firms by including in the

regression capital stock and purchases of intermediate inputs as control variables, we obtain estimates

(reported in Appendix Table A7) that are similar to those recorded with the full sample. Finally, when

we report in columns (8) and (10) of Table 4 F-tests of the hypothesis that coefficients on a given type

of linkages are jointly equal to zero, we again find that these tests do not overturn our conclusion that

statistically the firm-level linkages are much stronger predictors of product innovation than the

industry-level linkages.

       Overall, our findings in Tables 3, 3A-3B, 4, and 4A-4B indicate that firm-level linkages are

better predictors of innovation than industry-level linkages, suggesting that spillovers are limited to

local firms that are engaged with MNEs and trade. Our findings also suggest that some of the earlier

studies reporting significant industry-level relationships for a given country may have identified

specific cases that do not necessarily generalize to other countries.



3.2    Spillovers by the Source of FDI
One may hypothesize that the potential for spillovers differs depending on whether FDI comes from a

similar or very different country in terms of development and hence productivity. In Table 5 we present

the estimated product innovation spillovers when we distinguish whether foreign presence is from OECD

or non-OECD countries. As may be seen from the table, the firm-level micro linkage effects, which

cannot distinguish OECD vs. non-OECD FDI effects, are virtually identical to those found earlier. The

industry-level estimates may be split by OECD vs. non-OECD origin and they suggest that the presence

of OECD firms, as compared to non-OECD firms, has a positive horizontal linkage effect in the sample


                                                   18
of all firms, as well as in subsamples of firms that operate in the service sector or are new, large, in

domestic private ownership, or in CIS. The backward OECD linkages are all insignificant except for the

service sector firms where one finds a significant positive linkage effect of OECD as well as non-OECD

firms, and the backward OECD linkage effect of firms in the EU countries, where one finds a surprisingly

negative effect. The forward OECD linkage effects are all insignificant except for a positive effect in

firms operating in the European Union. It is notable that the presence of non-OECD firms has a negative

horizontal linkage effect on very small firms and a positive backward linkage effect on firms in the service

sector and on large firms. The corresponding direct linkage effects, reported in Appendix Table A4, are

similar for OECD horizontal linkages but they suggest that a number of OECD backward linkages and

forward non-OECD linkages are positive and few are also negative. These findings suggest that relying

on the direct linkage effects may provide an incomplete picture.

       The corresponding estimated technology innovation spillovers that distinguish between foreign

presence from OECD and non-OECD countries are reported in Table 6. The firm-level linkage effects

that cannot be split between OECD and non-OECD FDI presence are again strong and similar to those

found for technology innovation earlier. Unlike in the case of product innovation, the estimated

technology innovation spillovers at the industry-level suggest that the presence of non-OECD firms

has a negative horizontal linkage effect in the sample of all firms, as well as in several specific

subsamples of firms: firms operating in the service sector, firms that are old, medium-sized firms, SOEs,

foreign owned firms, privately owned firms, firms that spend moderate amount of time with officials,

and firms in SEE. The difference is that there are now more subsamples of firms where one detects a

positive horizontal spillover effect of OECD presence: firms that operate in the service sector, are small,

have domestic private ownership, and spend moderate amount of time with officials. We also find a

positive backward linkage effect associated with the presence of OECD firms in the sample of all firms,

as well as the subsamples of firms in the service sector, old firms, micro, medium-sized and large firms,


                                                    19
SOEs, and firms that spend moderate amount of time with officials. In all these cases except for the

medium-sized firms, the base effect of non-OECD foreign presence is insignificant rather than negative.

Finally, the forward linkages associated with both OECD and non-OECD firms’ presence are mostly

insignificant or negative, with the exception of a positive non-OECD linkage of firms in SEE. In terms

of direct technology innovation spillovers, we show in Appendix Table A5 that these estimates are

somewhat similar to those based on total linkages in the case of horizontal spillovers, but they differ

considerably from total linkage effects with respect to forward and backward spillovers. This result

strengthens our earlier finding that firm-level spillover effects are more consistent than the partial or

direct industry-level effects common in the literature.

       In order to check the robustness of the above results we have also used country-level TFP from

Penn World Tables to group linkages into those relating to countries that are close vs. far apart in terms

of TFP. For example, we normalize TFP=1 in the US and find that it is 0.36 for Russia and 0.23 for

Ukraine. Accordingly, we classify American FDI into Ukraine as being long-distance and FDI from

Russia into Ukraine as being short-distance. Using this approach, we split source countries into long-

and short- distance, making the approach comparable to the OECD vs. non-OECD split. We find that

this alternative approach does not have a material effect on the estimates, the reason being that the

classification of FDI is similar, with low productivity OECD countries (e.g., Portugal) having relatively

little FDI in the transition economies.



3.3 Further Robustness Tests – A Control Function Approach
In the previous sections, we have documented an interesting set of patterns for the sample as a whole and

for a number of subsamples. However, these patterns do not necessarily imply causal relationships, which




                                                   20
are difficult to establish in observational studies. A major concern in our context is that we may be

omitting factors that potentially limit the growth of firms and thus also their incentives to innovate.30

         To address this concern, we employ the control function approach in which we use proxies to

control for potentially omitted factors that might bias the estimated linkage effects. The main advantage

of using this approach is that BEEPS provides a rich set of proxies that enable us to rule out a number

of alternative explanations. In particular, we use each firm’s self-reported assessment of a large number
                                 6F




of potentially limiting factors, ranging from constraints imposed on the firms by corruption to

regulation, taxes, and electricity problems. Our approach is to add to our basic specification an

additional regressor capturing a particular omitted factor. Ideally, we would like to include all of these

potentially important controls simultaneously. However, since many variables have missing

observations or are collected only in one of the BEEPS waves, including all variables would shrink the

sample size dramatically. As a result, we include variables one at a time. However, even if we include

many controls simultaneously, our results do not change materially.

         The estimated coefficients of the augmented specification for a new product innovation are

reported in Table 7, while those for a new technology innovation are reported in Table 8. We first explore

if factors related to problems with various aspects of infrastructure (telecommunications, electricity,

transportation, access to land, and title or leasing of land) lower the firm’s ability to innovate via its

industry-level and firm-specific linkages. We find that these factors have no effect in that the estimated

linkages are very similar to those found in our original specification. We obtain the same result when we

construct an index of limiting factors (average score). We next estimate augmented specifications that


30
   In the absence of an exogenous shock that we could use for identification, we spent considerable amount of time trying
to find valid instrumental variables. In doing so, we considered three candidates for instrumental variables. The first two
instruments were (i) self-reported constraints imposed by transportation difficulties and (ii) custom and trade regulations.
Both of these constraints are likely to limit long distance trade, thus making it more likely that MNEs wishing to sell in the
country will open plants in the country and domestic firms will supply and purchase from the MNEs, as well as compete
with them. The third instrumental variable was based on how important business associations and chambers are in finding
suppliers. It may be expected that if firms use business associations and chambers, they are more likely to find a foreign
firm than if they use more proximate channels (friends, family, government, and former employees). We found using these
instrumental variables yields the same qualitative conclusions although the effects are imprecisely estimated.

                                                             21
control, alternatively, for tax rates and tax administration, various forms of regulation, skills and

education of the labor force, economic uncertainty and instability, corruption and crime, anti-competitive

practices and contract violations, education of a manager, indebtedness, productivity, access to and cost

of finance, quality of courts, information about suppliers and customers, unofficial payments and tax

reporting, various forms of competitive and customer pressures, and experience with lost electric power,

water, and phone connection, as well as lost products due to breakage, spoilage or theft while in transit.3127F




Each of these factors may arguably co-vary with the linkages and including these factors as regressors

could in principle reduce the significance of our estimated effects of linkages on innovation. We show

that controlling for each of these factors has no effect on our baseline results. Only in three of the forty

two regressions that we estimate in Table 7 and in one of the forty two regressions that we estimate in

Table 8 does the coefficient on the share of sales to MNEs become marginally insignificant. All the other

249 firm-specific linkage coefficients remain significant. Hence, the robustness of the baseline estimates

to this large battery of control function tests is remarkable and it suggests that we could be indeed

identifying a causal relationship.



4. Conclusions
Using large firm-level and industry-level data sets from 18 countries, we find that FDI and trade have

strong positive spillover effects on innovation by domestic firms in emerging markets. However, we find

that the spillover effects can be detected with micro data at the firm-level, but that using linkage variables

computed from input-output tables at the industry level yields much weaker, and usually insignificant,

estimated effects. Furthermore, there is generally little difference in whether the industry-level spillover

effect is computed as a direct effect based on the input-output matrix (the usual approach in the literature)

or as a total effect based on the inverses of input-output matrices.


31
     Lost power, phone and water are measured in days. Lost product is measured as percent of sales.

                                                             22
       These patterns are consistent with spillover effects being rather proximate. In other words,

spillover effects on innovation from foreign firms to domestic firms appear to be limited to domestic

firms immediately connected to foreign firms. Simply being in an industry populated by foreign firms

or an industry buying from or selling to industries with strong foreign presence generally has a weak,

if any, effect on innovation. An immediate policy implication of these findings is that local government

requirements that foreign firms have significant local content (i.e., a certain fraction of value added or

inputs having to be local) may make sense.

       We also document heterogeneity in the strength of the effect across sources of foreign presence.

Our firm-level data do not permit us to distinguish between the effects of FDI from more advanced

(OECD) and less advanced (non-OECD) countries, but we are able to do so at the level of the industry

(input-output) linkages. Our estimates suggest that the presence of OECD firms, as compared to non-

OECD firms, has a positive horizontal linkage effect on product innovation in the sample of all firms, as

well as in subsamples of various types of firms. The backward OECD linkages are all insignificant except

for the service sector firms where one finds a significant positive linkage effect of OECD as well as non-

OECD firms, and the backward OECD linkage effect of firms in the EU countries, where one finds a

surprisingly negative effect. The forward OECD linkage effects are all insignificant except for a positive

effect in firms operating in EU. It is notable that the presence of non-OECD firms has a negative

horizontal linkage effect on very small firms and a positive backward linkage effect on firms in the service

sector and on large firms. Unlike in the case of product innovation, the estimated technology innovation

spillovers at the industry-level suggest that the presence of non-OECD firms has a negative horizontal

linkage effect in the sample of all firms, as well as in several specific subsamples of firms.

       Our results have important implications for interpreting the existing literature, which has focused

on the effects of FDI and trade on (total factor) productivity rather than on innovation, has tended to use

the industry-level rather than firm-level measures of horizontal and vertical linkages, and usually used


                                                    23
data from a single country. Since measured productivity (a) captures the effects of both market power

and efficiency (rather than just efficiency) of firms, (b) is a noisy outcome variable, and (c) suffers from

endogeneity problems in estimation, our focus on innovation provides potentially more direct estimates

of the true effects of foreign presence on the performance of local firms.

Notes: the table reports estimated coefficients for specification (1) with New Product indicator variable as the regressand. Standard errors clustered by industry × country × year are reported in parentheses.
Columns (8)-(11) report F-stats and associated p-values for the hypothesis that coefficients on industry-level linkages (columns 1-3) or coefficients on firm-level linkages (columns 4-6) are jointly equal
to zero. ***, **, * denote statistical significance at 1, 5 and 10 percent.

Notes: the table reports estimated coefficients for specification (1) with New Technology indicator variable as the regressand. Standard errors clustered by industry × country × year are reported in
parentheses. Columns (8)-(11) report F-stats and associated p-values for the hypothesis that coefficients on industry-level linkages (columns 1-3) or coefficients on firm-level linkages (columns 4-6) are
jointly equal to zero. ***, **, * denote statistical significance at 1, 5 and 10 percent.

Notes: the table replicates Table 4 in the paper but the set of regressors also include log fixed assets and log materials. The sample used is smaller as
many firms do not report data on fixed assets and/or material supplies.
