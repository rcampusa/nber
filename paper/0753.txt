                   Inflation, Tax Rules and the Accumulation of
                      Residential and Nonresidential Capital



                                     ABSTRACT



      The present paper analyses the effect of the interaction between

tax rules and inflation on the size and allocation of the capital stock

with particular emphasis on the role of owner—occupied housing. The analysis

is developed in the framework of an economy that is in equilibrium and

in which a constant fraction of disposable income is saved. In this model,

I show that, with current U.S. tax laws, an increase inthe rate of in-

flation reduces the equilibrium amount of business capital employed in

the economy and raises the amount of housing capital. The analysis also

shows that a higher rate of inflation lowers the real net—of—tax rate

of return to the provider of business capital. In a richer model than

the current one, i.e., in a model in which the rate of personal saving

was an increasing function of the net rate of return, a higher inflation

rate would therefore lower the rate of saving.

     The present analysis also shows that permitting firms to depreciate

investments more rapidly for tax purposes increases the accumulations of

business capital but that, unless firms are permitted to expense all in-

vestment immediately, an increase in inflation continues to depress the

accumulation of business capital.

                For nearly two decades, the United States has pursued a series of

    short—run policies that have increased the     rate   of inflation and sustained it at

    a high level. The rate of increase of the general         price   level (as measured by
    the   GNP deflator) rose from less than 2 percent a year in the early 1960's to

    more than 8   percent a year in the late l970s. The expansionary monetary and
    fiscal policies began in the early   i960s    as an attempt to lower the

 unemployment      rate and expand the level of   output. Easy money, lower tax rates
 on   capital income, and specific incentives for business investment          were combined
with       the aim of stimulating investment and thereby, through the traditional
multiplier process, reduc:Lng unemployment. Although the rate of             inflation   began
to rise, many economists argued that "moving up the iillips curve" to              higher

inflation and lower unemployment represented a desirable trade off. Then came
the       decision by President Johnson to expand both the Vietnam War and his Great

Society programs. He insisted on doing so without a tax increase but with an

easy money policy aimed at keeping interest rates from rising. This moved the

inflation rate up sharply to more than five percent as the 1910's began.

               In the l910's, inflationary   monetary and fiscal policies continued to
be    pursued despite a lack of agreement on the rationale for those policies even

among the prevailing economists of that decade. In effect, these economists and

the politicians agreed on the treatment of the econonr even though they

disagreed about the proper diagnosis of its economic condition. First, there

were those who continued to believe in a long—run Phillips curve trade—off be-
                                                                        policy in the
tween inflation and unemployment. They advocated expansionary

hope of reducing unemployment permanently even if that meant accepting a higher

inflation rate. Second, there were those who recognized that no long—run trade-

                                                                 unemployment rate had
off exists but who misjudged how high the noninflationary

become because of changes in the demographic structure of the labor force and in

the transfer programs that encouraged higher unemployment.            They advocated

expansionary monetary and fiscal policies because they believed that the econorrvi

was   still operating with "too much unemployment." Finally, there were those who
correctly perceived that the econonvr was at or below the       noninflationary


unemployment   rate but who     resisted a tightening of   monetary   and fiscal policy

because they were unwilling to pay the price in higher unemployment for slowing

the rise in inflation or reducing its level.

            In this way   the   econorrr drifted to higher and higher rates of

 inflation.1 Although some of the year to year changes in inflation were

unexpected, the general level and even some of the upward drift clearly

 came to be anticipated. For more than a decade now, a major debate among

 American macroeconomists has been about whether such anticipated inflation has

 any effects on the real econonr. At least since Milton Friedman's    (1968) presi-
 dential address, economists have recognized that expected inflation is perfectly

neutral in a simplified econoimj with flexible prices, inelastic money demand and

no    taxes. Subsequent research by Barro (l97), Lucas   (1972), Sargent and
Wallace (1975) and others has refined this idea and emphasized the corresponding

neutrality of expected changes in the stock of money.1

            The important question, however, is whether the neutrality of antici-

pated changes in money and in the price level are relevant to the actual econoIrr

in which we live. James Tobin (1965) emphasized that even fully anticipated

inflation is not neutral because the demand for money balances varies inversely

with the nominal interest rate and therefore with the expected rate of

inflation. An increase in inflation caused by a more rapid growth of money

would therefore raise the capital intensity of the economy by inducing house-

holds to substitute real capital for money in their portfolios. Stanley Fischer

(1979) has recently examined the lead and lag patterns by which expected changes

in the money stock can alter the capital stock and real output through the Tobin

money—capital substitution effect. Although this portfolio substitution process

is analytically correct, it is generally agreed that the magnitude of the Tobin

effect is extremely small.2

            By contrast, the interaction of inflation and the tax rulcs can have

very substantial effects on the incentive to save and on the relative returns to

   the Tobin effect is empirically too small to matter.

different types of investments. In Feidstein (1916) I examined the way in which

the tax—inflation interaction could lower total capital formation by reducing

the incentive to save. Then in Feldstein (1980a) I showed how the tax—inflation

interaction would encourage individual investors to substitute interest bearing

government debt for real capital in their portfolios and thereby reduce the real

capital intensity of the econorrw. The present paper extends this analysis to

examine how inflation diverts capital from plant and equipment to owner—occupied

housing.

           Under present U.S. tax law,2 an individual who owns his own house way

deduct the interest payment in calculating taxable income and does not pay tax

on   the implicit rental income provided (in kind) by his   house. In addition, the

capital gains on owner—occupied housing are virtually untaxed. Because nominal

interest payments are deductible, the tax advantages of investment in owner—

occupied housing rise substantially with inflation. If, for example, the

mortgage interest rate is 4 percent in the absence of inflation, an individual

with a rginal tax rate of 40 percent pays a 2.4 percent real net rate of

interest. If an expected inflation rate of 8 percent raises the interest

rate to 12 percent, the real net interest rate falls to minus 0.8 percent. The


     I have previously discussed the way that inflation and tax rules combine to
     achieve this distortion in Feidstein (198Gb, 1980d) but have not previously
     presented a formal model. For other analyses of the way that the tax—
     inflation interaction affects the demand for residential capital, see
     Rendershott (1979, 1980) , llendershott and Hu (1919), Hendershott and
     Shilling (1980), Poterba (1980) and Summers (1981).

value of the tax deduction of nominal interest rates rises from 1.6 percent to .8

percent.

           In contrast, the tax burden on business capital rises when there is

inflation. Under existing U.S. tax rules, inflation affects the taxation of

business capital in three important ways.    First,   because of the "historic cost"

approach to calculating the cost of production, a higher rate of inflation

reduces the real value of depreciation allowances and understates the costs of

replacing the goods withdrawn from inventory. Second, the owners of the equity

of business firms pay capital gains tax on the rise in the nominal value of the

capital stock. And, third, the firm gets to deduct nominal interest payments

(thereby understating its taxable profits) but the creditors iast pay tax on

nominal interest receipts (thereby overstating their taxable income). Since the

effective tax rate on the reduced corporate income is very close to the effec-

tive tax rate on the increased creditor income (Feldstein and Summers, 1980),

this third effect is very small. On balance, inflation therefore raises the

tax burden on the income from business investment.

           Since the stock of housing capital is about i4 percent of the stock of

nonresidential capital1- an incentive to shift capital from plant and equipment

to housing can have a significant effect on the amount of plant and equipment in

the econony. The ratio of net investment in residential capital to net invest—

  occupied housing accounts for )-r2 percent of fixed capital alone. The data
  on capital stocks and inventories are from the Federal Reserve Board's
  Balance Sheets of the U.S. Economy.

ment in plant and equipment rose from 52 percent in the last half of the 1960's

to i6 percent in the last half of the 1910's. In Feldstein (1980e) ,   I   presented

econometric evidence that the interaction of tax rules and inflation reduced the

incentive to invest in plant and equipment and that this can explain most of the

variation in the share of GNP devoted to such investment during the past three

decades.

           The present paper analyses the effect of the interaction between tax

rules and inflation on the size and allocation of the capital stock with par-

ticular emphasis on the role of owner—occupied housing. The analysis is deve-

loped in the framework of an economy that is in equilibrium and in which a

constant fraction of disposable income is saved. In this model, I show that,

with current U.S. tax laws, an increase in the rate of inflation reduces the

equilibrium amount of business capital employed in the econoirr and raises the

amount of housing capital. The analysis also shows that a higher rate of infla-

tion lowers the real net—of—tax rate of return to the provider of business capi-

tal. In a richer model than the current one, i.e., in a model in which the rate

of personal saving was an increasing function of the net rate of return, a

higher inflation rate would therefore lower the rate of saving.

           The present analysis also shows that permitting firms to depreciate

investments more rapidly for tax purposes increases the accumulations of busi-

ness capital but that, unless firms are permitted to expense all investment

immediately, an increase in inflation continues to depress the accumulation of

business capital.

                  The model considered in this paper is a very simple one. To keep the

 analysis tractable and informative, I ignore several issues that I have con-

 sidered     in   earlier papers: changes in the saving rate; changes in the demand

 for money; government debt; and the mixture of debt and equity in corporate

 finance.1 A model        cannot be a complete picture of reality but should     help to
 elucidate some particular aspect of reality.

              One    final point   should   be emphasized before turning to the formal
analysis.         Because the relation between inflation and capital formation depends

on the fiscal structure of the econorr, the specific distorting effect of infla-
tion is not a universal constant but differs among countries and even within the
same country from time to time.

1. A GrowjnEconom with Inflation and Housin
              The simplest framework within which to examine the effect of inflation
on the composition of the capital stock is an economy with two sectors. The
corporate business sector produces a general good that can be used for both con-
sumption and investment. The unincorporated household sector produces the ser-
vices of the owner—occupied housing stock. The population grows exogenously in

this economy at a constant rate (n) and the labor force is a fixed fraction of

the population. Labor is employed only in the production of the general good;

housing services are proportional to the stock of housing and are produced

without labor.2



     See   Feldstein (1976, 1980)     and   Feldstein, Green and Sheshinski (1978).

2 The model also ignores the land used in housing. In the current framework,
  inflation would raise the relative price of land.

The Business Sector

             If the general good is produced with constant returns to scale, the

techno1or can be described by a production function that relates output per

employee (y) to the capital stock per employee used in this sector (k):


(1.1)                              y =   f(k).

For simplicity, output is measured net of depreciation and all technical

progress is ignored.

             The pretax rate of return on corporate capital is f'. In the absence

of inflation, corporations pay tax at rate t on this return to capital. The net

of tax returns on the marginal investment, (l—i)f', mast in equilibrium be equal

to the firms' net cost of funds. The analysis is greatly simplified by assuming

that all marginal investments are financed by debt.1 On these funds, firms pay

interest rate i. Since interest expenses are deducted in calculating a firrnts

taxable income, the net cost of borrowed funds is (l—r)i and the firm's

equilibrium condition is (l—'r)f'        (l—T)i or just f' =   i.
             It   is worth noting that the analysis of this paper could be done

equally easily for an economy without any debt finance. In such an economy,

firms would use only equity finance and homeowners would have no mortgages. The

same basic results about the allocation of capital would be obtained, indicating

that the fundamental issue is the inflation—induced rise in the relative taxation of

business income and not the deductibility of nominal interest payments on

mortgages.


1   The rationale for all "debt at the margin" finance is developed in Stiglitz
    (1913 ) and a model of growth equilibrium with such finance is presented in
    Feldstein (1916). More realistically, the costs of debt and equity funds
    depend on a firm's debt—equity ratios see Gordon and Malkiel (1981)    and
    Feldstein, Green and Sheshinski (191b, 1979).
                                                —9—



             If there is inflation and the price level rises at a constant rate, it,
the nominal pretax rate of return on capital is f' +       inflation did not
                                                                it.   If

alter the measurement of real taxable profits, the tax liability per unit of
capital (ignoring for a moment the tax treatment of debt) would be if'                    and   the
resulting nominal after—tax rate of          return   would be (i—i)f'     + it.   In   fact,

with    the tax accounting rules that have prevailed in the United States, infla-

tion causes taxable profits to increase relative to real profits. Both historic

cost depreciation and the use of first—in—first—out inventory accounting cause

an understatement of the true cost of production and therefore an overstatement

of taxable profits.1 As an approximation, the increase in taxable income per

unit of capital can be written as a constant rrultiple of the inflation rate, Air,

per   unit of capital.2     The additional tax is thus iXir. The nominal rate of

return to the corportion net of tax is therefore (l—r)f' + it — itAit.

            Since   the nominal interest rate is deducted in calculating taxable

income, the net of tax cost of borrowed funds is (l—T)i. The equilibrium con-

dition that requires equating the nominal net returns on the marginal unit of

capital to the net cost of funds therefore implies


(1.2)                     (1—r)f' + (1   —
                                             tA)it    (1—T)i.




      If depreciation schedules permit tax depreciation that is faster than econo-
      mic depreciation, taxable profits in the absence of inflation will be less
      than true profits. The increase in real taxable profits caused by infla-
      tion may leave taxable profits greater or less than true profits. What mat-
      ters is the change in the size of this difference, i.e., profits relative to
      real profits, and not the sign of the difference.

2     See Auerbach (1979) for an explicit derivation of the relation between it, ft
      n, the true rate of depreciation and the increase in taxable income caused
      by historic cost depreciation. Feldstein (1980c) discusses the additional
      contribution of FIFO inventory accounting. For the United States, a value
      of A = 0.50 is a reasonable approximation with the tax laws in effect in
      the late 1970's.

           Before proceeding to discuss the housing sector, it is interesting to

note that equation 1.2 implies

In   contrast to the traditional conclusion of Irving Fisher that the nominal

interest rate rises point for point with the rate of inflation, equation 1.3

shows that, for a fixed real marginal product of capital, the rise in the

interest rate reflects the tax deductibility of nominal interest and the

mismeasurement of depreciation and inventory profits. With economic depre-

ciation and no artificial inventory profits, A = 0 and di/dir = 11(1—i).                      With

existing depreciation and inventory rules, 0 <              A   <   1 and 1 <   di/diT   <


            If   the individuals who provide capital to the business sector pay tax

at rate 0 on nominal interest income, the real net—of—tax interest that they

earn is (1—8) i—it. From equation 1.3 it follows that


                  (1—0)i -    = (1—o)f'       +     t—8-(1—0)tX]

The impact of inflation on the real net return to lenders depends on two things.
First, t—0 reflects the difference between the advantage of deducting nominal
interest payments at the corporate level and the disadvantage of paying tax on
nominal   interest income at the personal level. Second, (l—0)tX reflects the

additional tax paid at the corporate level because of the mismeasurement of

depreciation and inventory costs. For any marginal personal income tax rate

greater than 30 percent, i.e, for 8                .30, the coefficient of it      is    negative.2


1 The expression is more complex when firms use equity as well as debt in
   marginal finance. It is important to emphasize that these expressions for
   di/dit are partial equilibrium relations that assume f' fixed.

2 Empirical research by Feldstein and Summers (1980) showed that for the
   econonr as a whole including financial institutions (i.e., not just for
   potential homeowners), T — 8 is approximately zero.

The Housing Sector

             The owner—occupied housing sector uses capital but no labor to produce

housing services. Since in the long—run capital can irove freely between the two

 sectors,   the equilibrium price of a unit of housing capital is the same as the
price of a unit of business capital which in turn is the price of a unit of        the

general goodJ The price of housing services therefore depends on the cost          of

owning    one unit of housing capital and of maintaining that capital.
             More specifically, for each dollar of housing capital the individual
pays    or foregoes net interest of (l_O)1.2 Local property tax, maintenance,
depreciation and a standard risk premium add an additional net cost of z per

unit of housing capital.3 Since the value of net housing capital rises at the

rate of inflation, the real net cost of owning and maintaining a unit of housing

capital is:


(1.5)                         r = (l—O)i + z—'i


Note    that r is thus the implicit rental cost of a unit   of   owner—occupied housing
capital.
            The demand for housing capital by individual home owners reflects both
the   demand for housing services and the demand for housing capital as a port—



      By contrast, in the short run the stocks of housing capital and business
      capital are given and equilibrium must be achieved by changes in the prices
      of these capital stocks. See Poterba (1980) and Summers (1981).
2     This assumes that individuals borrow and lend at the same interest rate. It
      also reflects the U.S. tax rule that permits individuals to deduct mortgage
      interest payments in the calculation of taxable income.

3     I say "net" cost because local property taxes are a deductible expense in
      calculating individual taxable income. By "standard risk premium" I mean
      the premium for a "standard" or "basic" amount of housing capital; the risk
      premimiu.m may be a function of the amount of housing capital in a way
      specified below.

folio asset. Since I have assumed that the amount of housing service is propor—

tiorial to the housing stock, it is not necessary to distinguish the demand for

services from the demand for a portfolio asset. Instead, the demand for housing

capital can be   considered   directly with its determinants reflecting both the

portfolio and service characteristics. The simplest such specification is



(1.6)                                 h =




where Ii is the housing capital stock per employee and '<     o.-
           In terms of the demand for housing services, equation i.6 implies that

the relative demand for housing services and for other goods varies inversely

with the implicit rental price of housing. A more general specification would

make the demand for housing a function of real income and of wealth. Within the

current paper, however, the equilibrium values of real income and wealth remain

constant except for changes in the efficiency of resource allocation. If the

initial  condition of the econonr is regarded as one of optimal resource alloca-
tion, the changes in resource allocation that result from a small increase in
the rate of inflation do not change real income to a first order approximation.
A large change in inflation would, however, reduce     real income. Similarly, a

small   increase in inflation would reduce real income   if, in   the initial con-
dition, non—neutral tax rules cause there to be too much housing capital.         A

reduction in real income would cause individuals to consume less housing and




    Since the other goods represent the numeraire, r is also the       rental   price of
    housing relative to the price of other goods.
    this would partially offset the      inflation--induced   transfer of capital from the
    business   sector   to housingi   There   is •the further effect that a reduction in
    real income reduces saving and therefore the total capital stock; that effect is
    explicitly included in the modeL,
               Even in the restricted form of equation 1.6, the demand for housing
    capital as an asset influences the form of the demand function, .      par-In
    ticular, since each individual must own the housing capital that produces his
housing     services, an increase in the consumption of housing services beyond some

level involves increasing portfolio risk.2 This implies that, for high values

of h, the demand for housing capital is less responsive to the implicit rental

price than would be true if individuals did not have to own their housing

capital.3 en when the implicit rental price would otherwise be zero or nega-

tive, risk      considerations li.mit the demand for housing ca1Dital)


       Shifting one unit of capital from the business sector to housing reduces
       real income by the difference between the real marginal products of capital
       in the two sections and this income effect reduces the demand for housing
       capital by the marginal propensity to own housing capital as a function of
       real income, The real marginal product difference is less than f' which is
       approximately 0.12 in the United States. The marginal housing—to—income
       ratio is less than three. Thus this real income effect offsets at most
       about one—third of any shift of capital from the business to housing
       sectors.

2
       This is particularly true when the acquisition of housing capital is
       financed by borrowing.
3
      The model assumes that all housing is owner—occupied when in reality about 15
      percent of the housing capital stock is owner occupied. The tax advantages
      and other aspects of home ownership outweigh risk considerations at most
      income levels. The •tax advantge of home ownership is increased by inflation
      since rental property is adversely affected by historic cost depreciation
      rules.

      I believe that the risks associated with increased investment in housing
      capital kept the price of houses from rising even faster in the 1910's. For
      many individuals with high marginal tax rates, the implicit rental cost of
      housing was then zero or negative.

The Demand for Money
            Money plays two quite distinct roles in a model of equilibrium

growth. First, the exogenously given rate of growth of the nominal money

stock determines the rate of inflation. This follows directly from the fact

that the stock of real money balances per employee imist remain constant in

equilibrium growth since real income per employee, real assets per employee and

the rate of interest are all constant.1 If real money balances per employee

are to remain constant, the rate of growth of the nominal money stock (M/M) must

equal the rate of growth of prices plus the rate of' growth of the labor force:



(i.7)                          =   if   + fl•
                           M




            The second role of money is as an asset that absorbs savings and

thereby reduces the equilibrium size of the real capital stock, k +     h.   Tobin

(1965)    has emphasized   that an increase in inflation, by increasing the real cost

of holding money balances, encourages households to economize on real money

balances and therefore to devote a larger share of their wealth to real capital

formation. The importance of this substitution effect depends on the size of

the stock of "outside money" (i.e., money that does not represent a liability of

any private entity) relative to total wealth and on the elasticity of money

demand with respect to the nominal rate of interest. The monetary base, a

reasonable measure of the stock of outside money,2 was only $160 billion in 1980


1    If there is technical progress, the statement is true with "employee"
     interpreted   as "effective employee".
2    Itould be wrong •to include in the measure of outside money
                                                           would
                                                                  any interest
                                                                  adjust with
    bearing government debt since the market interest rate
    inflation. Tobin' s procedure of combining moneyaand government debt  is
                                                      model that distinguishes
     therefore misleading; see Feldstein (1980a) for
     money, government debt, and private real capital.
or less than 3 percent of      the   total stock at' private wealth. Since all esti-
mates of the interest elasticity of money demand are substantially          less   than one,
it is clear that even major changes in the nominal        rate   of interest would   have

very     little effect on the fraction of savings devoted to real capital formation.
I shall therefore ignore the interest elasticity of demand         completely   and write
the     demand for real money balances per employee (m) as a constant fraction (u)

of   the corresponding real capital assets:



(1.8)                                m   ii(k +   h).


Public and Private Consumption

             The   government consumes a fraction (i) of real national income and
households consume a fraction (1—o) of real disposable income. National income
consists of the output of the business       sector plus the output of the owner—

occupied housing sectorJ To combine these two products, I assurie a constant

relative price of housing services, i.e., an implicit rental of p per unit of
                                                                     0
housing    capital; national income per employee is thus y + ph.         Real govern-

ment spending per employee is


(1.9)                                ;=y(y+ph).


     This ignores the value of the services of the stock of money, an omission
     that has no qualitative effect on the results      of this analysis.
2    The value of p is the initial rental price of housing services. A small
     change in the rental price changes real income to the extent that (1) it
     reallocates capital between h and k and (b) the marginal product of business
     capital differs from p. That is, the change in real income is f'dk + pdh.
     It would be incorrect to include a term of the form Mr in evaluating the
     change in real income since dr represents either a change in the implicit
     price that individuals pay themselves on housing or a change in the ax con-
     sequences of home ownership that would macrely be offset by a change in other
     taxes.
                                         —16—


          Disposable income may be defined as national income minus both taxes

paid (t) and the loss in real money balances caused by inflation (Jim).1 Thus

consumption per employee is


(1.10)                        c = (i—a) (y + ph —   t—    ¶m).


Since the government deficit equals the increase in the stock of money balances

(g—t = (Ir+n)rn), equation 1.10 can be rewritten:


(1.11)                     c     (1—a) (y + ph — g + nm).


This formulation, which is essentially due to Tobin (1965), assumes that house-

holds regard their increase in real balances as a component of disposable income

even though the real resources available to households (i.e., the maximum

feasible consumption) are only y + ph —     g.2   The amount that households save,

including the amount that is saved in the form of increased real money balances

is therefore


(1.12)                          s = a (y + ph — g + rim)



or, using 1.9 to substitute for g,


(1.13)                          s =   a[(l—y)(y+ph) +   mimi




1 Taxes include the taxes on capital income from corporations and industries
   and an additional nondistorting tax. Changes in tax revenue that result from
   changes in inflation are offset by changes in the nondistorting tax to keep
   total tax revenue unchanged. If the offsetting change in other sources of
   tax revenue were in a distortionary tax, the effect of inflation on real
   income would be more couplex than the current analysis indicates. See
   Feldstein (1916) for a discussion of this issue.

2 Ignoring run in 1.10 or sm in 1.9 would not change any of the qualitative
   results.

 Growth Equilibrium

                 Real   savings per employee are divided into the increase of real busi-
 ness capital per employee (K/N) , the increase of real housiqg capital per
 employee (H/N), and the increase of real nney balances per employee (Hip) IN):

In     steady—state equilibrium, all three stocks grow at the                                         rate as the popu-
lation, implying that

(1.15)                                      =   n(k + h       +   m).

                Combining      1.2 and i.4 gives the basic equation of growth equilibrium:

(i.16)                               [(l-y)(y+ph)+nm1 = n[k+h+m].

Using 1.8 to substitute for is, 1.6 to substitute for h, and 1.1 to substitute
for y, equation 1.16 can be rewritten

(1.17)                  [ (l-) (f+p)    +    n(k+) I              n{k +            + (k     +   )I

implicit       rental price to be r          (l—O)i   —       z   —    it.       Equation 1. shows        that   the
households'         real net interest rate is given by (1—O)i - it                                (1—0)1' ÷ x
where x = {T—0-.(l—0)TXJ/(1_T).              Thus


(1.18)                                   =      [(i-o)'           +   xii + z].

that   determines the stock of business capital as a function of the inflation

rate and the tax rules.


Disequilibrium Adjustments

            The next section uses equations 1.11 and i.i8                    to   examine the

equilibrium effects of changes in the rate of inflation and the tax rules.

The complex expressions that result are readily interpreted in terms of the

disequilibrium adjustments of the capital stock. This permits determining the

directions      of equilibrium change without having to specify numerical values for
individual parameters.
             Two very plausible disequilibrium adjustment assumptions will be made.

First,   the Net Adjustment Assumption: an increase in either type of capital
stock per employee above its equilibrium value causes total wealth per employee
to   decline:


(1.19)                            d(k +   h + m)            <0
                                       dk


and


(1.10)                            d(k +    h   +   m)   —   <   0
                                          dh


Equation 1,19 is satisfied if, when k exceeds its equilibrium value, k falls and

the other types of wealth (housing plus real money balances) do not increase by

an even greater amount. Second, the Partial Adjustment Assumption:                          when the

stok of business capital per employee exceeds its equilibrium value, the total

wealth per employee will decline even if housing                    wealth   per employee is held

constant:
                                         —19--




 (1.21)                           a (k + h + m)           <   0


Since     the fall in k (i.e., k<0) is likely to raise the housing stock, holding

housing constant should make it easier to satisfy the condition that a positive

pertubation of k causes total wealth to decline. In this sense, 1.21 is a

weaker assumption than 1.19 and 1.20.


2. Effects of Changes in Inflation

             We are now in a position to examine the effect of inflation on the

capital intensity of the business sector, on the consumption of housing ser-

vices, and on the real net return to savers. Before beginning the forrnaj. deri-

vation of these effects, it is useful to consider the general logic of the process.

             A higher rate of inflation reduces the after tax profitability of

investment because the tax accounting procedures for dealing with depreciation

and inventories raise the effective tax rate. This lower after—tax profitability

means that firms can pay only a lower real net rate of return to the creditors

who supply their capital.

             The net return to the suppliers of business capital is also affected

by the fact that firms deduct nominal interest payments and that lenders pay tax

on nominal interest receipts. This matters, however, only to the extent that

the tax rates of borrowers and lenders are different.

             balance, inflation lowers the real net rate of return and therefore
             On

reduces the implicit rental cost of housing. This in turn raises the consump-
tion of housing services relative to the output of other goods. The present
section    will now show explicitly that this    reduces the equilibrium amount of
                                                   —20—


business capital per employee and therefore the productivity of the labor force.

The decrease in productivity and the reallocation of production to housing also

lowers the real income per capita. Although the analysis takes the saving rate

(a) as fixed, the reduction in the real net rate of return implies that the

saving rate in a more general model would probably also be reduced, thereby

further decreasing the capital intensity of production.

               The equilibrium growth condition of equation 1.17 can be rewritten by

collecting terms as:


(2.1)      a(1—y)f +      [anll —   n(l+i)]k   +   a((i—y)p+nij         —   n(1+i)]   =   0


Using equation 1.18 for             and totally differentiating 2.1 with respect to k and

if
     yields:

(2.2)            {a(1_y)f'+Iant.i—n(l+ll)ldk

                 + [a[(1—y)p+np] — n(1+)]'[(l—O)f"dk + xd] = 0



Define   the coefficient of dk as


(2.3)
                 =   a(l-i)f'   + anp—n(1+ii) +        [a[(i_)p+nt1_n(1+i)l (1_8)f!
and let

(2.)                                =   a[(i-1)p   +   nI   —   n(1-i-.i)

The effect of inflation on equilibrium capital intensity can now be written:



(2.5)                dk =        —___
                     dii

               The appendix shows that Q1 is equal to the derivative of the rate of

change of total wealth per employee with respect to a divergence between
                                                              —21--


the       actual business capital per employee and its equilibrium value:

Qi =          d(k      +   h + m).     The net adjustment assumption of equation 1.19 implies
      <       0.       The appendix also shows that Q2            is     equal to the derivative of the

rate of change of total capital per employee with respect to a divergence bet-

ween the housing capital per employee and its equilibrium value: Q2 =

d(k       +   h    +   m).     The net adjustment of equation 1.20 implies Q2                   < 0.
                           Since   housing consumption varies inversely with the implicit rental
cost of housing (i.e., since j' < 0), the sign of dk/dii is the same as the sign
of x = [T—0—(i—0)TA]/(i—T). As I noted above, with realistic values of T and A,
x<0 for any 0                  0.30 and therefore dk/dir < 0.
                       Since a higher rate of inflation unambiguously                      reduces   the real

equilibrium capital intensity of the business sector, it increases the pretax

real rate of return (f'). The net of tax real rate of return and the rental

cost of housing nevertheless declines. To see this, note that since

(1—0)1 —            it = (i—o)f' + 'lix,



(2 6)                                    d[ (1—0)1—it]                d[ (1—e)f' +
                                              dir                          dir




                                                          =     (l—o)f"      dk
                                                                                 dir
                                                                                       +   •
Since f",              dk/drr and     x are all negative, it          seen   at first as if the effect of
inflation              on the real net return is ambiguous. However, sLlbstituting 2.5

for dk/d'rc yields

Using 2.3 and 2. for Q1 and                Q2   gives

                           d[(l_3)i—1TI

Since both x and          are negative, the                 sign    of d[(l—O)i--irl/dlI is the same   as   the

sign of

            Since the demand for housing is a function of the real irtherest rate,

an increase in inflation unambiguously increases the equilibrium stock of

housing capital:

Since    all four terms are negative, dh/dii > 0. Note again that, to the extent

that housing is also a function of real income and real income declines, this
                                                                                       1
will partially offset the value of dh/diT derived in 2.10.


1 At the conference at which this paper was presented, Penti Kouri suggested
   considering a model in which saving is optimized in a Raimsey model by indivi-
   duals who live forever. In this case, the real net rate of return, (1—0) i—iT,
   is fixed. This in turn means that r and therefore h are not influenced by
   inflation. It follows, however, from equation i.L that f' maist rise to keep
   the right hand side constant; since f"<O, dlc/dir<0. In words, to earn the
    same real       net return when inflation raises the effective tax rate, the pretax
    return might increase.
                                                —23--


             The final effect of inflation that I wish to examine is on total real

income, y + ph.      If the initial allocation of capital between business and

housing were optimal, a small increase in inflation would leave real income

unchanged;    this is   an implication of the common proposition that any small

change    from an optimum involves no loss to a first order approximation. But if
taxes and inflation make        the   initial condition suboptimal, the rea11ocaiori of

capital caused by an increase in inflation will have a first order effect on

real income. More specifically, the very favorable tax treatment of owner—

occupied housing implies that even in the absence of inflation the real return

to marginal housing capital (p) is less than the return to business capital

(f'). A positive inflation rate widens the gap. This implies that a realloca-

tion of capital from the business sector causes a loss of real income. More

formally the change in real income induced by an inflation—induced change in the

allocation of capital is


2.ll                        d(y+ph)
(
                          ___________    = ft               + p    h

Substituting from 2.5 and 2.10 implies


                           d(y+ph)
(2.11)                    __________      = (Q3 - f'Q2)

Using    2.14 and 2.9 to substitute for Q2 and Q3            yields,

                d(y+ph)    =   [p((l—y)f'   +           —
                                                            n(l+)) - f'(a(l—y)p +

                               (f'—p)n[1+(1—o)M)'x/Q1.
Thus with f'>p, real income falls since '<0, x<0 and Qi<0.

3.   Indexing the Tax Rules

             Inflation causes a misallocation of capital between the business and

housing sectors because the tax laws mismeasure capital income and expenses.                              A

complete indexing of the tax laws would eliminate this source of the distortion

caused by    inflation.       Complete indexing has three aspects:                  (1) eliminating the

mismeasurement of depreciation and inventory profits that causes business

operating profits to be overstated; (2) limiting the deductions for business

interest to real interest payments only; and (3) limiting the taxation of house-

hold interest income and expenses to the real interest rate. This section shows

the neutrality of inflation when all three of the features are present and

examines     the non—neutrality when there is only partial indexing.1
              If firms pay tax rate 11           on   operating profits net of real interest
expenses     but deduct the inflation component against their tax liability at rate

         the firms' equilibrium condition (analogous to equation 1.2) is


(3,1)               (1-T1)f' +       (1i1X)it =       (1—T1)i +


If   households are taxed on real interest receipts at rate O and on the

inflation component of interest payments at rate 02, the real net rate of

interest is j_01(i_1T)—021t_1t
                                      =
                                          (l—01)i     +
                                                          (Oi_Oc)ir
                                                                      —   it.   Since   the irtiplicit rental


cost of housing is the real net rate of interest plus the "other costs per unit

of housing capital" (z), the rental cost of hoasing is


                          r                                 -   + z
 (3.2)
                              =
                                  (l-01)i + (81_02)it


 1   These three forms of indexing are discussed in Feldstein, Green and
     Sheshinski (19T8) but there is no housing sector in that model and all of the
     distortions are in financial returns.

 2    Under existing law, '2 =            '1;   with complete indexing, '2 = o.
                                                —25—


 and, using 3.1 to eliminate i,


               r =   (1_81)ft   +
 (3.3)                                        (i-X)                 (T1-T2)

                                + (01—02)ir — ii   +z

When

same
         there is no indexing (
         implicit
                                      i   =    and   ei   =
                                                              02), equation 3.3 reduces to the
                    rental cost that has already been analyzed. With complete

indexing     (02=r2=A=O), equation 3.3 reduces to

(3.14)                              r = (i—01)f' + z

Here the implicit rental price is independent of inflation.-
          It is sometimes proposed that the elimination of historic cost depre-
ciation be coupled with limiting the business interest deduction to the real
cost of funds. In terms of equation 3.3, this implies X=T20 but 01= 02. The

resulting implicit rental cost of housing is then:


(3.5)                  r = (l—0)f'    +   z+1    1—8      —   18         —
                                                                             ii   ir
                                                 l—t1         lt]   T1



                         =   (l—o)f   + z —    (1_t1)Oir

An increase in inflation reduces the implicit rental cost because the firm is

denied a deduction for the inflation premium in                 the interest rate      but the house-

hold pays tax on that premium. An increase in the rate of inflation thus redu-

ces the.real net return to households on business capital and thereby lowers the

cost    of funds that enters the housing rental cost. Thus a partial                   indexing

1
    The allocation of capital still favors housing because the net services of
    housing are not taxed while interest income is taxable and the mortgage
    interest payments are deductible (Bi > 0) but this is a separate matter.
                                                    —'- —


approach that focuses only on the firm may exacerbate the bias in favor of
housing that is caused by inflation and clearly does not leave an inflation—

neutral allocation of capital.

            Most countries have dealt with inflation by accelerating the rate of

depreciation used for calculating taxable profits but without changing the tax

treatment of interest income and expenses. Accelerating depreciation has two

distinct effects. First, at any rate of inflation (including zero), this

lowers the effective tax rate on operating profits. In the notation of

equation 3.1, it is equivalent to increasing f'; note that it is not equivalent

to lowering T1      since    that would also affect          the tax treatment of interest.
Second, irore     rapid     depreciation reduces the sensitivity of the tax to the rate
of   inflation, i.e., it lowers A. To see the effects of these changes on the

irlicit    rental cost of housing, I           set T2 =        and   02 = Oi in equation 3.3 and

evaluate   the total differential of           r   with respect to f'     and A:



(3.6)              dr   =   (l—0)df'   —   (l0)     -riidA
                                           (1—t)

            The decrease in        A   raises the implicit rental cost of housing since it
reduces the excess tax on business capital caused by historic cost accounting

methods. Similarly the rise in f' raises the return on business investment

and thus directly increases the implicit rental cost of owner occupied housing.

Although full indexing avoids all of the tax induced distortions associated with

inflation, the right acceleration of depreciation can achieve the same effect

for any    given rate of inflation.

1.    Conclusion

             It   is ironic     that an easy money policy aimed at stimulating investment
in   plant and equipment is likely to have just the opposite effect: reducing the
                                         —27—


long—run capital intensity of production. Whatever the short—run virtue of

expansionary policies, the long—run consequence of inflation under existing U.S.

tax laws is to reduce investors' demand for business capital and to increase it

for owner—occupied housing.

            The simple model developed in this paper shows more generally how the

expectation   of further inflation of the sort that resulted from the inflationary
experience of the   1960's   and 1910's can have very   substantial   effects on the
real economy. The notion •that a fully—anticipated monetary expansion or infla-
tion has no effect on the real econorr is not plausible in a modern econonr with
a complex set of tax rules. The specific effect of inflation will, moreover,
vary   from country to country and from time to time as a function of the par-

ticular features of the country's fiscal structure.

            It would be useful to extend the current analysis in a variety of

ways. Of particular interest would be replacing the debt—only assumption of

corporate finance with a mixture of debt and equity. This would bring out the

more limited significance of the corporate deductibility of nominal interest

payments and would show the relevance of the taxation of nominal capital gains.

A further (or alternative) extension to include interest bearing government debt

as well as money would be of interest because this would permit the government

to vary the real interest rate through its debt management policy and would show

the effect of inflation on residential investment when low—risk government debt

is an alternative asset. Finally, since the analysis here is limited to U.S.

tax rules, it would be quite interesting to see it altered to describe the tax

rules of other countries and used to analyze the effect of inflation in these

settings.

          The present model, either in its current form     or   with the extensions

described above, could be the basis for a more explicit dynamic       analysis   of the

transition   path when the expected rate of inflation changes. This in turn

would provide a sounder foundation for the empirical analysis of the effect of

inflation on   the   accumulation of residential and nonresidential capital.

                                                 Appendix

            This appendix discusses the relation of Q1, Q2 and                           of section 2 to

the disequilibrium adjustment process and to the stability conditions of the

model.

            Combining equations 1.13 and 1.114 yields


(A.l)      oj(l—y)(y+ph) +            =          + _L +       SM/p)
                                            N          N           N


It follows directly from differentiating k with respect to time that


(A.2)                                      k +   nk.
                                 N


Similarly H/N =h + nh and (M/p)/N = in + nm.                       Thus A.l can be rewritten


(A.3)                  [(1—y)(y+ph) +nml = n[k+h+m) + k+h+m


           Along   a   balanced growth path, k =               h   = m = 0 and this condition was

imposed for the analysis in the text. But when k, h or in and not at their

equilibrium values, these ratios will change to bring about equilibrium.

           By substituting ii =        4   and m =         u(k+h),     equation A.3 can be rewritten:


(A.14)   [(i—y)(f+p) +      n(k+)1         —    n(l+)(k+)          =   k   +   h   + m


Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to k yields:


(A.5)    a(1—i)f' +     anji —   n(l+ji)   +([(l—y)p +

                           = d(k + h       +    m)/dk,
                                                     —30—


or


(A.6)                   =   d(k   + 'n +       rn)/dk.


Similarly the     derivative   of A.2 with respect to h yields


(A.7)            [(l—y)p + np}        —    n(l+ii)       d(k +   h   + m)/dh


or


(A.8)                             =   d(k      + h +   m)/dh.


The net adjustment assumptions (1.19 and 1.20) imply directly that Q1 < 0 and

     <   0.

              To derive the interpretation of                    of equation 2.9, take the partial

derivative of both sides of equation A. with respect to k holding h (i.e. )

constant:

                                                           (k+h+m)
(A.9)              [(1—y)f' +         n'   —   n(l+.t)1 = ______——
                                                                               h

or

                        3(k+h+m)
(A.1o)



The partial adjusted assumption (1.21) implies that                            <   0.
