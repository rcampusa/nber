                                              ABSTRACT

Using wage income tax statistics, we construct continuous series of upper wage income shares in Japan
from 1951 to 2005 to document the evolution of top wage incomes and investigate their long-run determinants.
We find that, while the middle wage income class gained enormously both in absolute and relative
terms during the period of high economic growth, the upper wage income class faired comparatively
better after 1975. In particular, the share of total wage accruing to the top 1% wage earners has risen
steadily in the last ten years. Using a simple time-series regression analysis, we find that marginal
income tax rates, corporate performance, female labor participation, and labor disputes are important
determinants of top wage income shares in post-WWII Japan. Although not conclusive, our results
suggest that much of the recent gains in wage income shares at the top can be explained by the changes
in these four factors, placing a less emphasis on a story of structural change.

1. Introduction

Japan has been known for its solid middle class and relatively egalitarian society for much
of the post-WWII era. Recently, however, there is growing perception among the
Japanese public that income inequality is rising. Scholars have documented a gradual
increase in inequality since the 1980s using a variety of household survey data. Yet, there
is much debate over the timing and extent of the recent changes in income inequality, as
well as its causes and implications for a future course of development (Tachibanaki 2005;
Ohtake 2005).
        With respect to wage income, labor economists have identified ageing of the
Japanese workforce, an increase in non-standard employment, and the rise of
unemployment among the youth as major factors contributing to rising inequality (Ohtake
2005; Genda 2005). At the same time, some argue that intra-firm pay inequality is also
increasing as top executives are receiving higher compensation in recent years due to
changes in corporate governance and payment structure. We know relatively little about
the upper end of wage distribution, however, due to the lack of adequate data. In this
paper, using wage income tax statistics, we study the evolution of top wage incomes in
1951-2005, evaluate recent trends from a historical and comparative perspective, and
investigate the determinants of top wage income shares.


2. Data and Methods

We briefly describe our data and methodology for estimating top wage income shares
(see Appendix for a complete description). Our wage income data are compiled from
wage income tax statistics published annually in the Survey on Private Wages and
Salaries by the National Tax Administration since 1951. 1 The statistics cover all
employees in the private sector who worked for the same employer throughout a calendar
year, but exclude employees in the public sector, day laborers and temporary workers
whose job duration was shorter than a year, and employees who were hired midyear. 2
Because the survey is based on the data filed by employers of all sizes who are legally
responsible for withholding income tax at source for their employees, it provides
comprehensive and accurate information on private wages and salaries. In particular,
compared to household surveys, it offers more precise data on the high end of wage

 Our data thus include part-time workers and workers employed by temporary help firms, provided they
worked for the same employer throughout a year.

                                                    2
income distribution. Wage income in our definition is the sum of wages, salaries, bonuses,
overtime pay, allowances, and taxable part of non-cash compensation, but excludes non-
taxable fringe benefits and retirement benefits. As a result, our wage income data are
subject to income shifting where employers manipulate the form of compensation to avoid
taxation. Because of an extensive and sophisticated withholding system, however, wage
income in Japan is subject to a minimum tax evasion, i.e., unlawful underreporting of
income (Hayashi 1987; Ishi 2001).
         Top wage income groups (e.g., top 0.1%, 1%, 10% groups) are defined relative to
the total number of regular employees in the private sector in Japan. 3 The unit of
observation is thus individual and not household. We estimate the total wage income
denominator based on total salaries from National Accounts. Table 1 presents the number
of wage earners and total wage income for 1951-2005. We estimate the wage income
numerator (i.e., the amount of wage income accruing to a given top group) from wage
income tax statistics using Pareto interpolations. Our estimates of top wage income
shares for 1951-2005 are reported in Table 2.
         We also estimate the effective marginal tax rates for various upper wage income
groups for 1951-2005. The estimates are made for an individual with a non-working
spouse and two dependent children, assuming that all income is employment income. Our
estimates incorporate both national and local income taxes and take standard exemptions
into account, but exclude non-standard exemptions and social insurance contributions.
We summarize major changes in income tax laws from 1951 to 2005 in Table 3. Our
estimates of the marginal tax rates series are reported in Table 4.


3. Top Wage Incomes in Japan, 1951-2005

In preceding work, Moriguchi and Saez (2007) have presented the shares of wage income
that accrued to the top 1% and 5% population of the wage income earners in Japan from
1929 to 2005. We briefly summarize the earlier findings to motivate this paper (see Figure
1). First, the top 5% and 1% wage income shares in Japan were substantially higher in
pre-WWII years and then declined dramatically in 1935-45 due to tightening labor markets
during military expansion and far-reaching wartime labor regulations. Second, the shares
increased rapidly in the 1950s in Japan, temporarily surpassing the U.S. levels during the

3
  According to the definition used by the Japanese government, “regular employees (joko)” include not only
employees on indefinite contracts but also those who have worked for the same employer for more than a
year under repeated one-year contracts. Therefore, regular employees include full-time as well as part-time
employees who have stable employment relations.

                                                      3
early 1960s. Third, compared to the U.S. where the top wage income shares show an
enormous gain since the 1970s, the shares in Japan have been relatively stable, where
we find a steady but modest increase in these shares over the last decade. 4 Taking
advantage of more comprehensive wage income tax statistics starting in 1951, this paper
improves and expands our previous estimates for top wage income shares and empirically
investigates the long-run determinants of top wage incomes in post-WWII Japan.


3.1 Top Wage Income Shares and Levels in Japan, 1951-2005

We construct series of wage income shares for various upper wage income groups,
starting with the top 40% wage earners and going up to the top 0.01% wage earners. 5
Table 5-a presents the threshold wage income levels for nine upper wage income groups
in 2005, the most recent year for which the statistics are available. In 2005, the average
wage income of regular employees in the private sector in Japan was 4.3 million yen (or
$39,000). To be part of the top 10% group, one must earn an annual income of at least
7.8 million yen (or $71,000). The thresholds for the top 1% and 0.1% groups are 15.7
million yen (or $143,000) and 39 million (or $355,000), respectively. Table 5-a also
presents the number of wage earners in each of nine “disjoint” intermediate income
groups and their average wage income in 2005. For example, the average income of the
bottom half of the top 10% wage income group (denoted by “top 10-5%”) was 8.8 million
yen ($80,000), and the average income of the bottom half of the top 1% group (denoted
by “top 1-0.5%”) was 25 million yen ($160,000). The top 0.01% group consists of 4,600
wage earners with the average income of 130 million yen (or $1.2 million). To provide a
comparative perspective, Table 5-b presents the threshold and average wage incomes in
the U.S. in 2004 and Japan in 2005 (all expressed in U.S. dollar). The U.S. estimates are
from Kopczuk, Saez, and Song (2007). Although the average wage incomes in the two
countries are virtually equal, due to dramatically more dispersed wage distribution in the
U.S., the threshold wage income for the top 1% group in the U.S. is 1.5 times higher
compared to Japan, and that for the top 0.1% group is 2.5 times higher. The average
wage income of the top 0.1% group in the U.S. is in fact 4 times larger than that in Japan.
        To provide an overall picture of the changes in employees’ living standards in
postwar Japan, Figure 2 presents the growth of the average wage incomes (expressed in

causes are still debated. See Lemiex (2007) for a comprehensive survey.

  Note, however, that our top 0.01% wage income share series rely heavily on interpolations and are less
precisely estimated.

real 2002 yen) for top wage income groups over the 1951-2005 period. For all groups, real
income grew very rapidly from 1951 to 1973 during the period of high economic growth
and continued to grow at a modest pace after the 1973 Oil Crisis until the end of the
Bubble period in 1990. Except for the top 1% group and above, real income grew little in
1990-2005. For example, the average wage income for the top 40% group rose 4.3 times
in 1951-73 and 5.9 times in the entire period. Its compound annual growth rate was
impressive 6.8% in 1951-73 but declined markedly to 1.0% in 1973-2005, with the
average growth rate of 3.4% over the entire period. For the top 5% group, their real
income grew at 6.1% in 1951-73 and 1.1% in 1973-2005, with the average rate of 3.1%
for the entire period. By comparison, for the top 0.1% group, it grew more slowly at 5.3%
in 1951-73 but at a higher rate of 2.1% in 1973-2005, resulting in six-fold increase in real
income over the 1951-2003 period. These data indicate that the lower-middle class in
Japan gained more relative to upper-middle and elite class during the high-growth period,
while the upper class gained more relative to the lower-middle class in more recent
decades.
       To examine the evolution of wage income inequality more precisely, we construct
top wage income shares series. Figure 3-a depicts the changes in the top 40% shares
from 1951 to 2005. The share of total wage income accruing to the top 40% wage income
earners has increased substantially over the period from 51% to 66% with short-term
fluctuations. Figure 3-b decomposes the top 40% share into the shares of the top 10%,
next 10% (denoted by “top 20-10%”), and the bottom half of the top 40% groups. It shows
that the gain in the top 40% share during the first 25 years of the period accrued primarily
to the bottom half of the top 40% group, while the gain in the last 25 years went mostly to
the top half of the same group. On average, the top 10% group received 25% of total
wage income in 1951-2002.
       Figure 3-c decomposes the top 10% wage income shares into the shares of the
top 1%, next 4% (denoted by “top 5-1%), and the bottom half of the top 10% groups. The
three shares show similar time trends. The top 1% group received 5% of total wage
income on average with long-run fluctuations: it peaked in 1961, then declined steadily
until 1975, and increased modestly since 1997 from 4.6 % to 5.6%.
       We decompose the top 1% wage income shares into the shares of the top 0.1%,
next 0.4%, and the bottom half of the top 1% wage income groups (Figure 3-d), and
further decompose the top 0.1% shares into the top 0.01%, next 0.04%, and the bottom
half of the top 0.1% groups (Figure 3-e). Again the shares of within the top 1% groups



                                             5
exhibit similar time trends: a sharp increase in the 1950s followed by a sharp decline in
1961-75, little change in 1975-95, and a marked increase since 1997. On average, the top
0.1% group received just 1% of total wage income in Japan in 1951-2005. Over the last
ten years, the top 0.1% share increased by 44% from 0.9% to 1.3%, but it still is less than
its historic peak reached in 1962. While the top 0.01% wage income share shows a
sharper rise in recent years, as our estimates on the very top group rely heavily on Pareto
interpolations especially for recent decades, we have less confidence in this observation.
        In summary, we find that the shares of the top 10% wage income group and above
rose initially in the 1950s but declined in the subsequent two decades, reaching their
lowest in the mid 1970s.        Since then, the shares have been relatively stable, but show
some sign of increase since the late 1990s particularly at the very top wage income
groups.


3.2 Evidence from Corporations Financial Statement Statistics, 1960-2005

The above observations suggest that a faster growth of wage income at the high end of
the distribution might be another driver of rising inequality in recent years. We hence turn
to the Corporations Financial Statement Statistics published annually by the Ministry of
Finance since 1960 to document the trends in executive compensation.6 The statistics
are based on a survey of incorporated companies in all industries except for finance and
insurance. 7 It reports financial data of corporations by industry and the size of
corporation, including directors’ salaries and bonuses and employees’ salaries. Directors
are defined as the board of directors including corporate executives who are also
employees of the company, while employees are defined as non-director employees.
Bonus is defined narrowly as bonus that is paid out of net profits at the end of fiscal year,
and any other compensation (including wages, allowances, and bonuses in a broader
usage of the term) that is part of labor cost is classified as salary.8 By this definition,
bonus is exclusively paid to directors.
        In large publicly-traded firms in Japan after WWII, virtually all directors have been
employees, consisting of a chairman, a CEO, vice-CEOs, senior executives (who typically
hold major departmental positions in the company), and junior executives, with few
outside directors (Kato 1997; Kubo 2005). As such, one could view directors’

  Because employees in finance and insurance industry receive the highest average wage income among all
industries in Japan according to the Survey of Private Wages and Salaries, the statistics understate wage
income inequality.

  Bonuses paid out of net profits are not deductible for tax purposes, while labor cost is.

                                                    6
compensation as de facto executive compensation. Since 1997, however, a series of legal
reforms reportedly led firms to increase a number of outside directors albeit gradually
(Kubo 2005). According to Abe (2003), among all listed Japanese manufacturing
companies, the average number of directors per firm declined from 16.3 in 1990 to 11.6 in
2001, while the number of outside directors per firm declined comparatively less from 3.2
to 2.6. Therefore, the use of directors’ compensation as a proxy for executive
compensation is less valid in recent years, potentially biasing the data.
       Figure 4 presents the ratio of the average director compensation, with and without
bonus, to the average employee salary by firm size. “Medium” corporations refer to firms
with capital 10 to 100 million yen, “large” corporations refer to firms with capital 100 million
to 1 billion yen, and “very large” corporations refer to those with capital over 1 billion yen.
The average compensation in each category is weighted by employment. Because these
categories are fixed at nominal value over 45 years, one must note that the composition of
firms within each category has changed substantially over time. For this reason, Figure 4
also plots the changes in firm size measured by employment in each category. In fact, the
average number of employees in “very large” corporations declined from 5,000 in the early
1960s to 1,200 in the early 2000s. Table 6 reports the average numbers of employees
and directors per firm by category, as well as the distribution of firms across categories.
For the period after 1990, “very large” firms stably represents the top 0.2% of all
corporations with roughly 500,000 directors (or executives in our interpretation). As
positive correlations between firm size (measured by employment) and the level of
executive compensation are well documented (Kato and Rockel 1992; Xu 1997), the
directors in “very large” corporations likely make up large part of our top 0.1% wage
income group in 1990-2005.
       One of the striking patterns in Figure 4 is a drastic compression of director-
employee wage disparity from 1960 to 1975 in all firm categories. This, however, is largely
driven by the declining firm size (measured by employment), as bigger firms exhibit higher
intra-firm pay differentials. One robust finding is that the ratio of director compensation to
employee compensation in “very large” corporations has increased sharply from 2.5 times
in 2000 to 4.8 times in 2005 despite the continuing decline in firm size measured by
employment (see Figure 4-d). In particular, the percentage of bonus in director’s total pay
jumped from the average of 11.9% in 1990-2000 to 48.8% in 2005.
       To examine whether the recent increase in director/executive compensation can
be explained by corporate performance, Figure 5 plots the compensation ratio series



                                               7
against returns on sales (ROS) series for “large” and “very large” corporations. Although
ROS has also increased in 2001-5, historically, we observe no strong positive correlations
between the two series. To see whether or not the recent change is associated with a
change in corporate governance, we also plot the ratio of dividends to capital. The
dividend-capital ratio shows a similar increase (or much sharper increase for “large”
corporations) in 2001-5, departing from relatively stable trends during the previous
decades.
       There is small but growing literature on the determinants of executive
compensation in Japanese firms. In principle, the amount of individual directors’ bonus in
Japan is set by a CEO based on their rank and performance. Directors’ monthly salaries
are also determined by a CEO, but in practice, they are said to be often determined as a
proportion of the highest paid employees’ wages (Kubo 2005, p.430).     Empirically, some
studies have found a positive relationship between firm performance and executive or
director compensation (Kaplan 1994; Xu 1997; Kato 1997), while others have found no
such relationship in Japanese data (Kato and Rockel 1992; Kubo 2003). Kubo (2003)
finds positive correlations between director’s salaries and employee wages. Interpreting
weaker correlations between executive pay and firm performance in Japan compared to
the U.S., Abe et al. (2005) go further to suggest that, executive compensation in Japan is
designed primarily to motivate employees who will be promoted to directors as a prize,
rather than to motivate directors to improve firm performance. The stable director-
employee compensation ratio among “very large” corporations from 1975 to 2000 despite
the sizable fluctuations in ROS is largely consistent with the above view. We need further
research, however, to determine whether the recent change is a temporary phenomena
explained by short-term economic factors or a break from historical trends driven by a
structural change in corporate governance or executive labor markets.


4. The Determinants of Top Wage Incomes in Japan

In this section, we investigate the long-run determinants of top wage income shares using
time-series regression analyses. We first estimate the effects of income tax on reported
wage income by exploiting across-time variations in the data.


4.1 Income Tax Policies and Marginal Tax Rates in Japan, 1951-2005

As Table 3 documents, from 1951 to 2005, the Japanese income tax system has
undergone several major tax reforms. The highest statutory marginal tax rate for national

                                            8
income tax, for instance, rose from 55% to 75% between 1951 and 1962 and then fell
from 75% to 35% between 1983 and 1999. Accordingly, effective marginal tax rates for
wage income earners have changed substantially over the postwar period. Furthermore,
due to the changes in progressiveness of income tax over time, tax rates have evolved
differently across wage levels. To assess the impact of government tax policies on wage
income shares, we first construct annual series of marginal tax rates (MTRs) for various
upper wage income groups (see Appendix for details).
        We estimate effective marginal tax rates faced by the average individual in each
wage income group, assuming that an individual has one non-working spouse and two
dependent children and that all incomes are wage income. The average marginal tax
rates in each group are weighted by wage income. Our marginal tax rates incorporate
both national and local income taxes, but exclude social insurance contributions,
corporate taxes, and non-income taxes. To obtain tax rates using tax schedules, we
convert wage income to its taxable amount by adjusting for standard deductions (basic,
spouse, dependent, and employment income deductions) and tax reductions (e.g.,
proportional tax reductions in 1994-96 and 1999-2005), which are summarized in Table 3.
To our knowledge, we offer the first precise and continuous estimates of marginal tax
rates for a wide range of wage income groups in Japan over the entire postwar period
(see Table 4). 9
        Figure 6-a depicts the average marginal tax rates of national income tax for
various upper wage income groups. The highest statutory marginal tax rates (denoted by
“top MTR”) are also reported in the figure. It is important to note that the changes in the
top marginal tax rates do not necessarily correlate with the changes in the effective
marginal tax rates even for the highest wage income group (i.e., top 0.01%). This is
because the effective marginal tax rates are affected also by the changes in deductions as
well as income brackets. For example, the 1957 tax reform simultaneously increased the
number of income brackets and tax rates and expanded employment income deductions
(Table 3). As a result, the effective rates fell sharply across most income groups, while the
top statutory rates increased. We will come back to this point when we discuss an
instrument for the effective marginal tax rates in our regression analysis.
        Figure 6-b presents total marginal tax rates, the sum of national and local income
taxes, for various upper wage income groups. Local income taxes in Japan consist of
prefectural and municipal inhabitants income taxes. As local income taxes have evolved
9
  By comparison, our previous estimates in Moriguchi and Saez (2007) incorporated neither local income
taxes nor full details of exemptions, and were produced for a few selected top wage income groups.

                                                    9
largely in parallel to national income tax, the overall time trends in the total marginal tax
rates are similar to the trends in national rates. The levels of the total marginal tax rates
are 5 to 19 percentage points higher after the inclusion of local taxes. Importantly, due to
a progressive structure of local income taxes, their inclusion magnifies across-group
variations in marginal tax rates.
       Using Figure 6-b and Table 4, we briefly discuss the evolution of income tax
policies in postwar Japan. From 1951 to 1970, income tax became increasingly
progressive as the government raised both the number of brackets from 11 to 19 and top
marginal tax rates from 55% to 75%. As the economy grew rapidly, marginal income tax
rates increased during this period for all groups, but higher income groups experienced
larger increases. The 1974 reform, which liberalized employment income deduction,
decreased the marginal tax rates only temporarily. The 1984 tax reform reduced the
number of brackets and tax rates for the first time since 1951, followed by the 1987-89
reforms that quickly brought down the top marginal tax rates to 50% and the number of
brackets to 5. The reforms in the 1980s, however, affected only the top 0.1% group and
above. As a result, marginal tax rates for the top 1% group and below continued to rise
until the 1994 reform that provided a large one-time tax break in the form of proportional
tax reduction to stimulate the economy. The 1999 reform further reduced tax rates and the
number of brackets, while instituting a permanent proportional tax reduction. Reflecting
these policy changes, the difference between the average marginal tax rates of the top
0.01% group and the top 40% groups has evolved from 32% in 1951, to 42% in 1960,
61% in 1970, 55% in 1980, 34% in 1990, and 25% in 2005.


4.2 Estimating Tax Elasticity of Wage Income Shares

Taking advantage of large temporal and across-group variations in the effective marginal
tax rates (MTRs), we empirically investigate the effect of income tax on wage incomes by
wage income group. Figure 7 plots the top wage income share series against the
marginal tax rate series for top 10%, 1%, and 0.1% groups. We observe no clear
correlation between the two series for the top 10% group (see Figure 7-a). By contrast,
the two series are seemingly negatively correlated for the top I% group (see Figure 7-b)
and for the top 0.1% group (see Figure 7-c).
       We estimate the elasticity of wage income with respect to the net-of-tax rate,
defined as 1-MTR, expressed in %. In general, we expect lower net-of-tax rates to
negatively affect reported wage income in the tax statistics through three main channels:


                                             10
(1) tax evasion or underreporting of wage income by workers, (2) income shifting by
employers from taxable to non-taxable form of compensation, such as fringe benefits and
perquisites, and (3) the reduction in labor supply in response to lower net returns
(assuming no income effect). As mentioned, our data are subject to minimum tax evasion
due to Japan’s sophisticated withholding system, but are subject to income shifting. For
example, even though all non-cash compensation is in principle taxable in Japan, in
practice it is not the case. Expense accounts for business purposes and employers’
contributions to private pensions are fully exempted, and company housing is partially
exempted. Stock options are typically taxed, not as wage income, but as capital gains at
the point of exercise. 10 Recreation or entertainment provided exclusively for executives is
fully taxed, however. Accordingly, we need to interpret our results with caution, particularly
in terms of their welfare implications.
         There is extensive literature estimating the effects of marginal tax rates on taxable
income (e.g., Lindsey 1987; Feldstein 1995; Slemrod 1996). In the following empirical
analysis, we closely follow the methodology described in Saez (2004) and adopt a simple
time-series regression framework using repeated cross-section data from 1951 to 2005.
Our dependent variable is log of wage income shares. 11 Because we expect the elasticity
to differ across different wage income groups, all our regressions are run for a single
wage income group. In the simplest specification, we regress log of wage income share
on log of net-of-tax rate (NOTR), defined by 1-MTR, and a constant term. Descriptive
statistics for these variables are reported in Table 7. In addition, to control for non-tax
related wage income growth (due, for example, to capital deepening, technological
progress, or human capital accumulation) in each group, we also add linear and quadratic
time controls. In the subsequent section, we explicitly control for non-tax factors in
multivariate regressions. Finally, due to the progressive structure of income tax, higher
nominal wage income leads to higher marginal tax rates (i.e., “bracket creep”), indicating
reverse causality that may bias our elasticity estimates downward.12 A standard way to
counter this problem is to use the top statutory marginal tax rate as an instrument for the
effective marginal tax rate under the assumption that the former is exogenously
determined by law but correlated with the latter.


10
   In Japan, stock options were legalized for the first time in 1997 and not yet widely practiced (Naito and
Fujiwara 2004).
11
   We use shares, instead of levels, to control for economy-wide nominal and real wage income growth
documented in Figure 2. Our results are robust to an alternative specification in which we use threshold wage
income levels (relative to mean wage income levels) instead of wage income shares.
12
   Note that the elasticity is defined with respect to the net-of-tax rate, not marginal tax rate.

                                                     11
           Table 8-a presents our regression results for a number of specifications from the
top 40% group to the top 0.01% group. The first column presents the results from the OLS
regression in the simplest specification with robust standard errors. As low Durbin-Watson
statistics indicate serial correlations in the error terms, we report the Newey-West
standard errors in the second column. 13 We add linear and quadratic time controls in the
third and fourth columns, respectively, to control for group-specific time trends. In the last
column, we report the results from a 2SLS regression where the marginal tax rates are
instrumented by the top statutory marginal tax rates to address the issue of reverse
causality.
           In almost all specifications, the coefficient, i.e., the elasticity of wage income share
with respect to the net-of-tax rate, increases monotonically as we move from the top 40%
to top 0.1% wage income group. In other words, as one would expect, higher wage
income earners are more responsive to changes in marginal tax rates either through tax
planning or labor supply decisions, if not both. This pattern is broken at the top 0.01%
group, however, and what is more, the elasticity estimates for the top 0.01% group are
sensitive to the specification as they vary widely from -0.57 to 0.40. We attribute this to the
fact that the top 0.01% wage income shares are less precisely estimated than the other
shares, as we rely heavily on Pareto interpolations due to top coding in the data.
Therefore, in the rest of the analysis, we focus primarily on the estimates for the top 0.1%
group and below. The specification with quadratic time controls performs better for the
lower wage income groups, largely because, for the top 1% group and above, net-of-tax
rates and quadratic controls are highly collinear. With the 2SLS regression, the elasticity
estimate for the top 0.1% group increases substantially from 0.45 to 1.16, suggesting
potentially large underestimate resulting from reverse causality. The IV estimates,
however, are highly sensitive to specification and are often not statistically significant. This
is probably because our instrument, top statutory MTR, is not highly correlated with the
effective MTR below the top 0.01% group as we observed in Figure 6.
           In our most preferred specification, i.e., the regression with linear time controls, the
elasticity for the top 0.1% group is estimated to be 0.67; that is to say, the decline in the
marginal tax rate by 1% will increase the wage income share by 0.67%. For the top 1%
group, our estimate is 0.43, and for the top 10% group, it is 0.20. For the top 40% group,
the elasticity is effectively zero, which is consistent with the fact that this group faces the
average marginal tax rate of only 20 to 30%. According to these results, a 26.6%

13
     We also ran regressions including lagged dependent variables and obtained similar results.

                                                       12
reduction in the marginal tax rates (from 65% to 47.7%) for the top 0.1% group from 1995
to 2000 would have increased their wage income share by 17.8% or 0.16 percentage
point, from 0.89% to 1.05%. The actual top 0.1% share in 2000 was 1.03%.
         Finally, in Table 8-b, we compare our elasticity estimates for Japan with the U.S.
counterparts obtained by Saez (2004) using the 1960-2000 data and similar methodology.
The estimates are roughly comparable in magnitude, but the U.S. estimates are larger for
the top 1% wage income group and above.


4.3 Determinants of Top Wage Income Shares, 1953-2005: Multivariate Analysis

We introduce additional variables to the regression analysis to study more generally the
long-run determinants of top wage income shares. First, motivated by our discussion on
executive compensation, we include corporate performance, measured by the average
returns on sales (ROS) of all corporations. Second, to account for changes in workers’
bargaining power, we also include labor disputes rate (DISP), defined by the share of
workers involved in labor disputes with dispute acts14, or alternatively, we use unionization
rate (UNION), defined by the share of union membership in total employment. We also
control for the heterogeneity of labor force, measured by female labor participation rate
(FLP). Finally, we include inflation (INFL) to control for nominal wage rigidity that may
differ across income groups. Table 7 presents the definitions of the variables and
descriptive statistics. In the regression analysis, we take log of all variables, except for
INFL (which takes negative values), to provide elasticity estimates.
         In Table 9, we first report the regression results for the top 0.1% wage income
group in a variety of specifications. In Panel A, the regressions (1)-(4) include no time
controls, in Panel B, the regressions (5)-(8) include linear time controls, and in Panel C,
the regressions (9)-(12) include both linear and quadratic time controls. In each panel, we
progressively add more independent variables. Although not reported in the table, UNION
was not statistically significant in any specifications. 15 We report Newey-West standard
errors for all specifications to correct for serial correlations. Comparing Panels A and B,
we note that linear time trends are statistically significant and tend to improve adjusted R-
square. Moreover, most coefficients are fairly robust to the inclusion of linear time trends.
By contrast, comparing Panels B and C, we note that the coefficients for NOTR and FLP

14
   Dispute acts include lockouts, strikes, and slowdowns.
15
   The lack of union effect on top wage income shares may seem surprising, but it is consistent with empirical
studies that find little union wage premium in Japan in contrast to the case in the U.S. (Tachibanaki and Noda
2000; Rebick 2005, p.81).

                                                      13
are sensitive to the inclusion of quadratic time controls, while the coefficients for quadratic
time trends themselves are not significant and virtually zero, indicating possible
multicolinearity between quadratic time trends and the other two variables. We thus select
the specification with linear time controls.
           Observe that, when we explicitly control for non-tax factors, the elasticity estimate
for the top 0.1% group drops substantially from 0.67 to 0.28 (see the regressions (5) and
(7)), indicating a potentially large omitted variable bias in the estimate with only time
controls. According to the results from the regression (7), 1% rise in net-of-tax rate,
corporate profitability, and female labor participation will increase the top 0.1% wage
income share by 0.28%, 0.27%, and 0.71%, respectively, whereas 1% rise in labor
disputes will reduce the same share by 0.10%.
           To highlight across-group differences more clearly, in the following analysis, we
use the wage income shares of eight “disjoint” wage income groups (e.g., top 40-20%, top
20-10%, top 10-5%) as our dependent variables, instead of “nested” groups (e.g., top
40%, top 20%, top 10%). In Table 10, we present the results for three specifications with
linear time trends. We focus on Table 10-b as the most preferred specification, but our
results are robust to alternative specifications (see Tables 10-a and 10-c). In Table 10-b,
except for the top 0.01% group whose shares are imprecisely estimated, the coefficients
for the log of NOTR, ROS, FLP, and DISP change monotonically as we move from the
lower to higher wage income groups. In particular, for the top 40-20% group, the elasticity
estimates with respect to the net-of-tax rates are negative and significant, implying that
wage earners in this group increase their wage incomes, relative to other groups, in
response to lower net-of-tax rates. This can be attributed either to possible downward bias
in our elasticity estimate due to reverse causality, or to income effects that may dominate
substitution effects for the lower income groups. Corporate performance has positive
effects on wage income shares across all groups, but benefits the higher wage income
groups comparatively more than the lower groups.16 For example, 1% rise in ROS will
increase the top 0.1-0.01% share by 0.24%, but for the top 1-0.5% share the increase will
be 0.17%, and for the top 10-5% group only 0.04%. The same pattern holds for female
labor participation, where 1% rise in FLP will increase the top 0.1-0.01% share by 0.85%,
the top 5-1% share by 0.61%, and reduce the top 40-20% share by 0.84%. We attribute
these results to a low share of women in managerial positions and substantive and
persistent female-male pay differentials in Japan (Rebick 2005). For labor disputes with

16
     We obtain qualitatively the same results when we use GDP growth rate instead of ROS.

                                                     14
dispute acts, 1% rise in DISP will reduce the top 0.1-0.01% share by 0.08%, but increase
the top 40-20% share by 0.03%. Therefore, our estimates indicate that labor militancy
reduces wage income disparity.17
         Finally, using the regression coefficients in Table 10-b, we generate fitted values
and plot them against the actual values of wage income shares for each wage income
group in Figure 8. Except for the top 0.01% group, the predicted values track the actual
values fairly well. In particular, for the top 1% wage income group and above, Figures 8-
e, 8-f, and 8-g show that much of the rise in their shares in the last ten years can be
accounted for by the changes in the four variables and their historical coefficients. That is,
the fall in marginal tax rates in the mid 1990s, the improvement in corporate performance
since 2001, and the downward trends in labor disputes since the 1980s are likely to be
major driving forces behind the recent increase in wage income inequality, offsetting a
negative effect of the decline in female labor participation in the 1990s.


5. Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we used wage income tax statistics to document the evolution of top wage
incomes in Japan after WWII. Using a simple time-series regression analysis, we then
investigated the long-run determinants of wage income shares for various upper wage
income groups. Our data indicate that, while the lower middle wage income class gained
enormously during the period of high economic growth both in absolute and relative terms,
the upper wage income class faired comparatively better since 1975, and especially
during the last decade. The recent increase in the wage income shares for the top 1%
group and above in Japan, however, is very modest compared to that in the U.S.
         We identified marginal income tax rates, corporate performance, female labor
participation, and labor disputes as important determinants of the top wage income
shares. In particular, even after explicitly controlling for socio-economic factors, we found
that marginal income tax rates have negative and sizable effects on the top 1% wage
income shares and above. Although it is less than conclusive, our results suggest that
much of the recent gains in the wage income shares at the top can be explained by the
above four factors, placing less emphasis on a story of structural change.




17
   When we use labor disputes rate defined by labor disputes in general (rather than labor disputes with
dispute acts), the results are not significant.

Appendix

A1. Wage Income Shares, 1951-2005

The National Tax Administration has annually published the statistics on wage income in the
                                                          18
Survey on Private Wages and Salaries since 1951. The survey covers all employees in the
private sector, but excludes day workers, employees in the public sector, and retirees. It also
excludes employees in those establishments where no employee has withholding income tax to
pay. Because the survey is based on the data filed by employers of all sizes who are legally
responsible for withholding tax at source for their employees, it provides accurate and
comprehensive information on wage income. From this survey, we use the statistics for employees
in the private sector who worked under the same employer throughout a calendar year, which
include full-time and part-time workers with job duration longer than a year but exclude temporary
workers with shorter job duration as well as full-time workers who were hired midyear. It also
excludes employees in an establishment in which no employee has an amount of income tax
withheld. The statistics include a distribution table that reports the number of wage earners and the
amount of annual wage income by wage income brackets, which we use to estimate top wage
income shares.

Our definition of wage income includes wages, salaries, bonuses, overtime pay, allowances, and
taxable part of fringe benefits, but excludes retirement benefits and non-taxable fringe benefits. It is
before subtracting employee’s social insurance contributions (for national health and pension
                                                                            19
plans) and before including employer’s social insurance contributions. Although all non-cash
compensation is in principle taxable in Japan, expense accounts for business purposes are fully
exempted, and so is company housing if employees bear at least 50% of its costs based on official
valuation. Recreation or entertainment provided exclusively for executives is fully taxed, however.
Stock option, which was legalized in 1997 and liberalized in 2002 in Japan, is in principle not taxed
                                                                     20
as wage income but taxed as capital gains at the point of exercise.

We use a standard Pareto Interpolation method to estimate top wage income shares. We define
top groups relative to the total number of regular employees in the private sector in Japan. Note
that the definition of “regular employees (joko)” in the government statistics in Japan includes not
only employees on indefinite contracts but also those employees who have worked for the same
                                                            21
employer more than a year under repeated fixed contracts. Therefore, regular employees include
both full-time and part-time workers with stable employment, corresponding closely to the
employees covered by the wage income tax statistics discussed above. The series for regular
                                                                       22
employees are estimated using the Labour Force Survey as follows. We define the number of
regular employees (joko) in the private sector as the total number of employees minus the
number temporary employees (rinji) minus the number of day labourers (hiyatoi) minus government
employees (komu). Because the number of temporary employees in 1948-58 and the number of
government employees in 1951-52 are not available, we use the ratio of temporary to total
employees in 1959 and the ratio of government to regular employees in 1953 to estimate the
numbers for missing years. Our estimates are reported in Table 1. As shown in the table, the
coverage of the survey has rose from about 60% of regular employees in the private sector in the
1950s to over 90% by the early 1970s. The lower coverage of the survey in the early period is likely
due to high exemption levels that removed a large number of (presumably small) establishments

from the survey’s sample as they had no employee with income tax withheld. In fact, according to
our MTR estimates, only the top 20% wage income earners paid positive income tax in 1953-60
and only the top 40% did so in 1951-71, supporting the above conjecture.

To obtain top wage income shares, we divide the amounts of wages and salaries accruing to top
wage income groups by 90% of total wages and salaries from National Accounts. The denominator
is reported in Table 1, under the label, “total wage income.” To be consistent with our definition of
wage income, total wages and salaries from National Accounts include employees’ social
insurance contributions but exclude employers’ social insurance contributions. In recent years,
where the coverage of the survey is virtually complete for regular employees in the private sector,
total wage reported in the survey are approximately 90% of wages and salaries from National
Accounts. Thus, we use the factor 90% to correct for the exclusion of day laborers, temporary
workers, and government employees in the wage income survey. We present all values in real
2002 yen, using CPI. Our estimates for wage income shares for 1951-2005 are reported in Table
2.

A2. Marginal Tax Rates for Top Wage Income Earners, 1951-2005

To estimate the average marginal tax rates (MTRs), we first estimate MTRs at the threshold wage
income level for each wage income group for each year. We assume that a taxpayer at each
threshold income has only employment income and forms a household with a non-working spouse
and two dependent children. Our estimates include both national and local income taxes and take
standard deductions into account, but exclude non-standard exemptions (e.g., exemptions for
housing loans, life insurance premiums, and medical expenses), social insurance contributions,
corporate income tax, and non-income taxes. To obtain net taxable income, we subtract basic,
spouse, and two dependent exemptions as well as employment income deductions from the
threshold wage income. We then use a statutory tax schedule, which presents increasing marginal
tax rates by income brackets, to obtain tax liability. Finally, we adjust tax liability to account for tax
reductions (e.g., proportional tax reductions) to compute MTR for a given taxable income level.

We estimate MTRs at the threshold wage income levels for national and local income taxes
separately, as they employ different tax schedules, exemption rules, and tax reductions. Detailed
tax codes for national income tax are obtained from Japan National Tax Administration (1988),
pp.154-207, for years 1951-88; OECD (1988-96), Tax/Benefits Position of Production Workers, for
years 1986-94; Ishi (2001), pp.344-5, for year 1995; OECD (1997-98), Tax/Benefits Position of
                                                                                                 23
Employees, for years 1996-7; and OECD (1999-2006), Taxing Wages, for years 1998-2005.
Table 3 summarizes the changes in tax codes from 1951 to 2005. For local income taxes in Japan,
as part of inhabitant taxes, municipal and prefectural governments introduced progressive income
taxes on the same income base as the national income tax, since 1950 and 1954, respectively. Tax
codes for municipal and prefectural income taxes are collected from online publications by the
                                                   24
Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. Unlike in the U.S. or Canada, Japanese local
governments in principle adopt uniform “standard tax schedule” set by the national government,
and hence there is virtually no variation in local tax rates. Total MTRs are simply the sum of the
MTRs for national income tax and the MTRs for local income taxes.

To estimate the MTR for the average taxpayer in each wage income group, we take the income-
weighted average as follows. We denote highest statutory MTR by “TopMTR,” MTR at wage
income threshold for the top 0.01% group by “MTR P99.99,” average MTR for the top 0.01% group
by “MTR 0.01%,” and the top 0.01% wage income share by “Share 0.01%.” First, we compute the
MTR for the top 0.01% group as:

         MTR 0.01%= (MTR P99.99 + Top MTR) / 2,
where a simple average is used as an approximation for this group. We then compute the MTR for
the top 0.05% group as:
         MTR 0.05%= { Share 0.05-0.01% * (MTR P99.95 + MTR P99.99) / 2 + Share 0.01% * MTR
         0.01% } / Share 0.05%.
This amounts to estimating MTR 0.05% as the average of MTR 0.01% and MTR 0.05-0.01%,
weighted by income shares, where MTR 0.05-0.01% is computed using a simple average, (MTR
P99.95 + MTR P99.99) / 2, as an approximation. We then repeat the same procedure to estimate
the MTRs for the next top wage income groups, using MTR 0.01% and MTR 0.05% estimated
above. Our estimates for the average MTRs are presented in Table 4.

Our marginal tax rates do not take into account social insurance contributions. Since their
introduction in the early 1950s, social insurance contributions for public pensions and national
health insurance in Japan have been determined as a fixed percentage of monthly earnings up to a
maximum amount of monthly earnings set by law. The cap on monthly earnings has been set at
                                                                                                    25
around twice the average earnings of all insurers and revised periodically to adjust for inflation.
As a result, including social insurance taxes would hardly affect our estimates for MTRs for top 1%
wage income group and above, but increase those for the lower wage income groups.

Notes: The table reports the (income-weighted) average marginal tax rates for top wage income groups for an individual with a non-
working spouse and two dependent children, assuming that all income is employment income. Marginal tax rates include national and local
(prefectural and municipal) income taxes, but excludes social security contr butions, corporate income tax, and non-income taxes.
Standard deductions (basic, spouse, dependent, and employment income deductions) and tax reductions are taken into account,
but non-standard exemptions for housing loans, insurance and pension premiums, medical expenses are not incorporated.

Notes:
Dependent variable is log (top wage income share) for t=1951-2005.
Independent variables are a constant and log (net-of-tax rate) with or without time trends.
For the OLS regression in the first column and 2SLS regression, robust standard errors are reported in the parentheses.
For the other OLS regressions, Newey-West standard errors with 8 lags are reported in the parentheses.
For the 2SLS regression, log (net-of-tax rate) is instrumented with log (100 - highest statutory MTR).
***= significant at 1%, **= significant at 5%, *= significant at 10%.
