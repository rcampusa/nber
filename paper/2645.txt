                    THE STABILIZATION OF THE U.S. ECONOMY:
                        EVIDENCE FROM THE STOCK MARKET


                                     ABSTRACT




     Until recently,    economists widely believed that economic activity had

become less variable in the United States following the end of World War             II.


Challenging    this belief, new research suggests that key historical         time

series are spuriously volatile,      a finding that is highly controversial.

Data from the stock market may provide a vehicle for resolving the

controversy.     Economic theory relates stock prices to real activity;

empirical   tests also show a strong link between stock prices and activity.

Financial   data are accurately measured over long spans of time and hence are

free of most of the measurement problems in other time series.           Measures of

stock prices show no stabilization      in the post-World   War   II period   relative

to the pre-Worid War    I   or pre-Depression   periods.   These stock market data

thus support the hypothesis      that real activity has not been stabilized.

     Is the apparent       stabilization    of the post-war U.S. economy a "Figment

of the data" as Christina Romer suggests in an important series of papers?1

The answer to this question has clear and important implications for

macroeconomic analysis and policy-making.           Major economic time series as

officially published       show clear stabilization in the post-World War      II era


compared to earlier periods.        This (apparent) fact is often taken as

evidence that economic policy has been effective          in reducing the magnitude

of economic fluctuations.2        The policies include activist monetary and

fiscal policy and passive built-in stabilizers such as progressive            income

taxation, unemployment insurance,          and deposit insurance.

     In studies of a wide range of time series of interest to

macroeconomists and policy makers, Romer finds that each series is too

volatile    in the early data.     The excess volatility    occurs for different

reasons in the different       series; Romer's findings do not point to a single

methodological    difficulty in the work of early researchers.        It is

accidental that each series is excessively rather than insufficiently

volatile.    According     to Romer, the main source of the excess volatility in

the unemployment     series is interpolations      of employment and labor force data

that do not take into account the pro-cyclicality          of productivity and

participation.     The main source of the excess volatility in the GNP data is

an overstatement of co-movements          of GNP and output of commodities.

     Romer's findings have not gone unquestioned.              David Weir (1986) offers

an analysis of the original       unemployment data that does suggest

stabilization    since the end of World War II.        Nathan Balke and Robert Gordon

(1986) present alternative       pre-1929 estimates of GNP that also show

stabilization.     They find that calculations underlying the original GNP data

did not overstate the relationship between commodity and non-commodity GNP.

Moveover,    they offer data on railroad transportation and construction--

components    of non-commodity    GNP--that are more volatile than commodity

output.

     Further and even more detailed study of the underlying data is perhaps

needed to resolve the impasse.        I    am skeptical,    however,       that such research

would help most economists frame an opinion concerning the debate unless it

were to lead to a consensus.       The steps in constructing the data are

complicated and require judgement.3           Ultimately,    only the participants in

the debate may be able to make informed judgments             about each of these

detailed steps and how they color the final answer.              Instead of reexamining

the issues raised by Romer, Weir, and Balke and Gordon,                I   propose to examine

the issue by using a completely       different    set of data, but one that in

theory should be very useful in resolving the question raised by Romer.

     I    propose to use asset price data to study the volatility of real

activity in the U.S. economy after World War          II    relative to earlier periods.



     3For example, some of the difference between Romer and Balke and Gordon
arises through the choice of years for benchmarks.

Asset price data are particularly well-suited for addressing this issue for

several reasons.

     First, asset price data are usually much better measured than data on

real economic activity.    Aside from issues of data alignment          and

construction   of index numbers, there is little doubt about what a time

series of asset market data is measuring.          There is no reliance on survey or

census data, there is no need to interpolate data because prices are

observed virtually continuously,     and there     is   relatively little scope for

judgement   in the compilation of asset market statistics.

     Second, data on stock prices are readily available over a long span on

a consistent basis.    There is no need to splice together series constructed

with different techniques from different types of data.

     Third, economic theory predicts that there should be a strong link

between economic activity and asset values.             The stock price is the

discounted present value of the firm's payout.             Insofar as this payout must


ultimately be a function of real activity, there is a link between real

activity and stock prices.

     Finally, studies of the data confirm that stock prices are related to

real economic activity.     Stock prices are an important component           in the U.S.

Index of Leading Indicators.4      The strong link between stock prices and

activity has also been emphasized recently by Stanley Fischer and Robert

Merton (1984).     R. Officer   (1973) finds   a   significant,   positive relationship

between estimated volatility of aggregate            stock prices and industrial

production in post-World War        I   data.5

      If the variance of the fundamentals is unchanged, so should be the

variance of stock returns.        Comparing      these variances seems an important

step in answering the question raised by Romer.



                I.   Link Between the Stock Prices and Economic Activity

     This paper exploits the link between economic activity and the stock

market to learn about the volatility of the economic activity.             In this

section,    I   discuss the theoretical linkage between stock price changes and

changes in the fundamentals and evaluate some of the pitfalls in making

inferences      about the distribution    of the fundamentals from the distribution

of asset market data.

     In a simple model, Robert Lucas (1978) shows that there is a unique

relationship between the level of economic activity and the value of the

stock market. The tight relationship between real activity and asset

prices carries over to more complicated and realistic models where no simple

solutions    are available.     Yet, the lessons from this paper do not rely upon

a specific model of asset pricing.          The null hypothesis is that the

distribution of the fundamentals driving the economy has not changed.              The

validity of evaluating that hypothesis by examining asset returns only



     5Monthly data on industrial production is available beginning in 1919.
For this study, one could envision estimating a
                                                 relationship between output
and stock market data in order to translate
                                             implications for stock
volatility into those for output volatility.   Given that doubts about the
accuracy of the output data motivate this study, that line of research             is
not pursued here.

                                  apply for all time periods of interest.   The
requires that the same model

                                                             market data
power of this approach derives from the quality of the asset

rather than recourse to a parametric model of the relationship between

fundamentals and asset prices.

     In the conventional    valuation model, stock prices are the present

discounted value of future dividends.       Despite doubts raised about how well

this model fits the data [Robert Shiller (1981) and N. Gregory Mankiw, David

Romer, and Matthew Shapiro    (1985)1, as long as stock values bear some

relation to fundamental    values, examination of stock market data should be

useful in addressing the question of the volatility of the fundamentals.           No

rejections of the conventional      valuation model   suggest the complete absence

of a relationship between real variables and asset prices.        Indeed, Sanford

Grossman   and Shiller   (1981) find that the consumption-basedversion of the

conventional    valuation model   is broadly descriptive of U.S. data at least

over some sub-samples.     John Campbell and Shiller (1986) show that there is

substantial    evidence that price-dividendratio reflects the rational

expectation    of future dividends.    Finally, as long as the departures from

the valuation    model remain the same in the two sub-samples,    testing whether

asset data have equal or greater volatility      in the two samples should be

useful in testing whether the process for the fundamentals        is the same in

the sub-samples.6




     6All that is required is that variance of the "fad" component remains
unchanged.   This assumption is appropriate in testing the null hypothesis of
no stabilization.   If the fads component has a high variance, the power of
the tests will, however, be low.
        An objection to inferrtng changes in real activity from
                                                                changes in
market value is that the market value represents a long
                                                        average of future
real activity.      Consequently,   transitory movements in real activity will
have little effect on market value. There is growing evidence,
                                                                however,
that changes in output are dominated by
                                        permanent or very persistent

components [Charles Nelson and Charles Plosser (1982) and Campbell and

Mankiw (1987)).     Under this statistical model of real activity, one would

expect a tight relationship between innovations in activity and innovations

in market value.

        Changes in corporate financial structure will change the variability of

stock prices even if the variability of the fundamentals remains
                                                                 unchanged

[Fischer Black (1976)).      Specifically,   an increase in leverage will   increase

stock volatility.     Changes in leverage could therefore cause incorrect
inferences about the variability of the fundamentals from the
                                                              variability of
stock returns. Data on the aggregate corporate balance sheet are available

in a National Bureau of Economic Research study by
                                                   Raymond Goldsmith, Robert
Lipsey, and Morris Mendelson (1963) for selected years between 1900 and 1958

and in the Federal Reserve Board's Flow of Funds Accounts for
                                                              years since
1946. Table     1 gives debt-equity    ratios for the aggregate U.S. nonfinancial

corporate sector for certain years between 1900 and 1985.       This ratio is
defined as liabilities divided by the difference of assets and liabilities.

1900.

Assets are valued at replacement cost in current dollars.8 In the years

when the two series overlap, the Federal Reserve Board's series gives a

substantially    lower ratio.9       Yet, the series move together closely in years

when each is available; earlier data can be scaled down for comparability.

Table 1 shows that the debt-equity ratio is substantially lower during the

recent period compared with the earlier period.            This alone should make the

stock market more volatile in the earlier period.            Changes in leverage bias

tests of the stabilization       hypothesis   using the stock returns data in favor

of the alternative that real activity has become less variable in recent

years.



                               II.     Variables and Data

     In this section,    I   discuss the financial variables      whose volatility     I


will study and the data used to measure them.          I   also address data problems

that might arise in using these series to assess changes in volatility.                The

basic measure of volatility of the stock market will be the standard

deviation    of return on holding the stock market.         The return--defined   as

capital gain plus dividend yield--is essentially distributed           independently

over time.     Hence, the sample variance should be an unbiased estimate of the


            ratio is not the ratio of debt to the market value of equity,
which is unavailable in the Goldsmith, Lipsey, and Mendelson data.   The use
of replacement cost valuation of equity to make the leverage comparisons
across the decades is problematic only if the mean of Tobin's q differs over
the sub-samples.

     9The major difference between the two balance sheets is that the FRB
consolidates the corporate sector by netting out most intra-sectoral assets
(mainly securities) while the NBER researchers do not net out these assets.

population variance.'0 The raw stock market return is a nominal variable.

Several approaches are taken to obtaining       a real measure.    The real return
can be measured by deflating dividends       and the stock prices by appropriate

price deflators.    Although this produces a theoretically        valid measure of

the real return,   it does introduce non-financial      data into the calculation.
The excess return on the stock market over a short nominal interest rate can

be measured by financial-market    data alone.               the nominal stock
                                                  Finally,

return is of independent interest.     The   in of the rate of inflation      has

clearly changed over the last century.11       If the variance of inflation is

unchanged   over the two periods, one can compare the variance of the nominal

stock returns over the two periods as
                                      long as they are computed about
different means.    In any case, the excess, real, and nominal stock returns

yield very similar results.
      I also consider the price-dividendratio.         The price-dividend ratio is

an attractive measure of movements in the stock market for two reasons.

First, the price-dividend ratio can be stationary        even if neither variable

is.   Hence, the price-dividend   ratio is a measure of the level of the stock

market that has a well-defined variance.       Second, it is intrinsically a real

measure.

      In addition to these returns variables,     I
                                                      present statistics showing
movements   in dividends. The dividend is ultimately tied to the profits of


     '0See Mankiw, Romer, and Shapiro (1985) and Marsh and Merton
                                                                   (1986) for
a discussion of how serial correlation in measures of the
                                                          igyi of stock
prices (such as Shiller, 1981) can lead to serious bias in estimates of
volatility.

     11Robert Barsky (1987) argues persuasively that the mean inflation rate
was essentially zero before 1914.
                                         -9-

the underlying capital,       so it is potentially an interesting indicator of

activity.        But the year-to-year link between the two may be weak if

corporate    dividend policy makes dividends respond slowly to changes in

profits.     I   examine this issue in the next section.      I present results for

both log detrended       and percent change in dividends    because of the

difficulty of establishing which procedure is the appropriate transformation

to render the series stationary.12

        In summary, the stock returns--nominal,       real, and excess--are the major

variables    to be examined.     These are supplemented    by the price-dividend

ratio and measures of change in dividends.        I   now turn to a discussion of

the specific data used to measure these variables.

        The statistics    are computed for the period 1872 through    1987 and for

various    sub-periods.    Although the underlying data are measured monthly,        I


consider variances measured for annual data.'3          The stock price is an index

of industrial stocks.       The stock price index refers to the month of January.

For 1871 through 1925, the data are Cowles's (1939) All Stocks Index (series

P-i).     Since 1926, they are the Standard and Poor's Composite,      which extends

Cowles's series.       The dividend data give the total dividends during the year

(Cowles's series Da_l for 1871 through 1925 and the Standard and Poor's


     '2Campbell and Shiller (1986) reject the hypothesis that log dividends
have a unit root in favor of a trend stationary alternative. They find,
however, that the log dividend-price ratio is trend stationary while log
prices are not. As they point out, these three findings are inconsistent.

     13More precise estimates of the variance of stock price growth can be
obtained by using higher frequency data, but the dividend data required to
compute the returns are only available annually in the early period.
Variances of stock price growth computed from the monthly data show the same
pattern across time as the annual returns data used in this paper.

series   since 1926).    The returns are calculated for holding the index from

January to January and are expressed as percentages.14

       Except for the possibilities       of errors in the transcription             of the raw

data underlying these series or arithmetic errors in constructing these

series, we can be confident that these stock market data are accurate

measures.'5 The monthly Cowles index is the average of the high and low for

the month rather than the average of all the days.                 This procedure does not

introduce   important    bias into the variance of the annual returns measure.'6

       The firms represented   in the stock market index do not create all the

output of the economy.      Consequently,      how well the stocks in the index

represent the economy as a whole needs to be evaluated.                      The most dramatic

change in the economy over the sample period is the reduction                     in the



       '4The return is               +              -
                         100((Pt+,       Dt)/Pt         1) where   Pt
                                                                        is   the January price

and Dt is the calendar-year dividend.              The price-dividend ratio is defined

as
     Pt/Dt_i.


     '5Jack Wilson and Charles Jones (1987) examine the monthly Cowles price
index for coding errors. They appear to have found an error in the June
1884 price. They also find problems in the Cowles cumulative returns
series.  They do not find problems with the data used in this paper.

     '6To check this, I carried out a simple simulation.   I generated data
assuming stock prices followed a geometric random walk at daily frequency
with an innovation standard deviation of 16.0 percent annual rate.   I
generated data for forty years of data with 300 days per year.   I then

computed the standard deviation of the "January" to "January" returns using
the Cowles and Standard and Poor procedures for obtaining monthly data.
For Cowles, the January value was taken to be the average of the minimum and
maximum observation during the first twenty-five days of the year; for the
Standard and Poor, January was taken to be the average of the first 25 days.
In 1000 replications, the mean absolute deviation of the standard deviation
of the return measured by either the Cowles or Standard and Poor procedure
averaged about three percent of the true standard deviation.

importance of    agriculture.   At the beginning of the sample, over half of

output was in the agricultural sector; at the end, it was about two

percent.'7 Clearly, farms are not traded on the stock exchange although the

returns to industrial companies     are likely to be affected by agricultural

shocks.   That stock market data exclude the direct contribution of the farm

sector is probably a virtue.      The debate over the stabilization of the

economy centers on changes in government policies and institutions that are

unlikely to affect year-to-year movements         in agricultural   output.   Hence,

it is appropriate    to use measures that apply to the industrial        sector as

evidence in the stabilization debate.

     Within the industrial      sector and within the stock market index, the

composition of firms has changed over the sample.          For example, railroads

were much more important      in the earlier period than they have been in the

recent period.     Changes in the mix of stocks in the index should reflect

changes   in the mix of economic activity.        To make inferences about the

volatility of the fundamentals from the volatility of asset returns requires

that that relationship between the returns on the major companies             in the

economy and the underlying economic activity has not changed over the sample

period.   This maintained hypothesis seems an appropriate component of the

complicated,   composite   hypothesis that the volatility of the economy in

unchanged.     Nonetheless,   the limited coverage of the stock price index and

of the stock market itself is a drawback of the approach in this paper.



     '71n 1869, agricultural output was 2.54 billion dollars and total
output was 4.83 (Historical Statistics, series F238 and F240). In 1986,
agricultural output was 93.0 billion dollars and the total was 4,235.0
billion dollars (Economic Report of the President 1988, Table 8-10).

     To obtain     a real return, stock prices are deflated by an index of the

monthly wholesale price and dividends by an index for the calendar year.

For 1871-1889,     the price index is the George Warren and Frank Pearson (1935,

Table 1) series.'8 Since 1890, it is the Bureau of Labor Statistics

Wholesale Price Index (now called the Producer Price Index))9             The stock

price is deflated by the January price index; the dividend by the calendar

year index.      Deflating    by this price index might introduce a number of

problems in calculation of the returns volatility.         Measured price indexes

might be too stable if they are based on posted or administered prices

rather than market prices.        On the other hand, the producer price index

might be an excessively volatile measure of inflation.            First, producer

prices are more variable than consumer prices, at least in recent data.2°

Second, there is an important        bias in the retrospective   work to construct

the historical     data.     The price data that is easily collected tends to be on

commodities   that are traded in asset markets.       These commodity prices are

certainly more volatile than average producer prices.            Therefore,   it is very

difficult   even to sign the bias in the volatility of the inflation rate.            In




     '8The annual Warren and Pearson series is also in Historical             Statistics
of the United States, Series E-52.

     19The annual wholesale price index is Series E-23 in Historical
Statistics.  The monthly series is in the BLS LABSTAT file beginning in
1913. The monthly series from 1890 through 1912 is from Bureau of Labor
Statistics, Index Number of Wholesale Prices on Pre-War Base. 1890-1927
(Washington: GPO, 1928).

     20Over 1948 through 1988, the standard deviation of annual inflation
(January to January) is 5.4 percent measured by the Producer Price Index and
3.5 percent by the Consumer Price Index.

practice,   the volatility of the nominal returns swamps the inflation

volatility in the calculation of real returns.

     Moreover,   as noted above, consideration      of the excess return avoids

having to introduce measurement errors in a price index.         For this span of

data, the short term commercial     paper rate provides a measure of a short

term, low-risk interest rate.     The interest rate is the annual six-month

commercial paper rate on a bank discount basis published        in the Federal

Reserve Bulletin.    It is linked to the four to six month commercial       paper

rate in Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz (1982).




                                   III.   Results

     The basic facts about the variability of the asset market data emerge

clearly in Figures   1   through 5, which present the levels and rolling

estimates   of the standard deviations of the excess and real stock returns,

the price-dividend ratio, dividend growth,       and detrended dividends.       The

level of the series are plotted as solid lines.         The standard deviations of

the series are computed over rolling, eleven year sample intervals.             These

are plotted as broken lines at the mid-point        of the intervals.   There    is no

apparent stabilization    of either the real or excess stock returns, although

volatility increased in the inter-war period.21         The price-dividend ratio      is




     21Officer also finds that the Depression years were especially
volatile.  He emphasizes that stabilization of the stock market following
the Depression cannot be attributed to the creation of the Securities
Exchange Commission because post-World War II volatility is no greater than
that in the first two decades of the twentieth century.  G. William Schwert
(1987) finds that high frequency changes in stock volatility are not closely
related to changes in volatility of either macroeconomic variables or
leverage.  He does find increases in volatility during the inter-war period.

more volatile   in recent   years.22        Dividend     growth alone does show some

stabilization   after World War I!.

      Sample statistics confirm what the eye sees in the figures.               Table 2

gives the sample standard deviations of the series for the entire sample and

for selected sub-samples.          The sub-samples are 1872-1913,       1872-1929,   1914-

1946, and 1947-1987.      The first two sub-samples           are based on alternative

ending dates for the earlier period.               The first sub-sample ends with the

beginning   of World War    I, the collapse          of the classical gold standard, and

the founding of the Federal Reserve.               The second sub-sample ends with the

stock market crash.     The third sub-sample includes the turbulent years from

the beginning   of World War       I   through the recession following World War II.

       The standard   deviations        of both real stock returns and of the price-

dividend ratio are lower in the early period (ending in either 1913 or 1928)

than in the period after World War           II.      Excess returns have about the same

variability in the earlier periods and the recent period.                The variability

of the stock market is consistent with the hypothesis that real activity in

the U.S. has not been stabilized.            Only dividend growth shows substantial

stabilization in the recent period.




     22Note that changes in the price-dividend ratio presented in Figure 3
can be interpreted in terms of changes in the required rate of return. High
price-dividend ratios correspond to low required rates of return.   Figure 3
suggests that the required rate of return was lower in the post-World War II
period than in the pre-World War I period, but that both the early and later
periods had lower required rates of return than the middle period. James
Poterba and Lawrence Sunvners (1986) examine the relationship between
volatility, stock returns, and the required rate of return.   They find
volatility changes are not persistent enough to yield large changes in the
required rate of return.

     Table   3 gives formal tests of the null hypothesis that the variance of

the series in the 1872-1913 and 1947-1987 sub-samples            are the same.       The

first column presents the ratio of the variances            in the two sample periods.

The second column gives a test statistic            for the hypothesis    that the

variances    are equal.23 The third column gives one minus the probability                 of

                                                                           confirm what
rejecting that the variances are equal.             The test statistics

is apparent from the figures and from Table 2.             Only for dividend growth can

one come close to rejecting the hypothesis that the variance of the series

are the same in favor of the hypothesis that it is smaller in the more

recent data.24

     Of the asset market data, only dividend growth shows stabilization                    in


the post-War period.     Dividends   paid are ultimately constrained by the real

return on the underlying asset.       But as Marsh and Merton (1986) stress, the

timing of dividend payments    is largely       at the discretion   of management.         The

smoothing    of dividends in the post-War period may well reflect a change                 in



     23Because the series may be serially correlated (serial correlation is
non-trivial in the price-dividend ratio and the dividend series), Goldfeld-
Quandt tests of equal variance are not appropriate. The probabilities
reported in Table 3 are for a test that is valid under very general forms of
serial correlation.  It is constructed by regressing squared deviations from
sub-sample means on dummies for the sub-periods and testing whether the
dummies have equal coefficients.  The test statistic is based on a
covariance matrix corrected for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation (8-
quarter lags) within the sub-sample but assuming that observations are
uncorrelated across sub-samples.   See Donald Andrews and Ray Fair
(forthcoming) for a general treatment of tests for structural change with
heterogenous    processes.

     24The test for real dividend growth illustrates the importance of
taking into account the serial correlation in the time series.   Even though
the variance of real dividend growth is half of its pre-World War I value in
the post-World War II period, the difference is not statistically
significant using conventionally-sizedtests.

dividend    policy rather than a change in the underlying driving process.

 Suppose that managers,   for example, decided to spread over several years

changes in dividends that would have previously been made over one year.

This change in policy would have little effect on the distribution of stock

returns.    Yet it would reduce the variance and increase the                   of
                                                              persistence

year-to-year changes in dividends.        It is clear from the Figure 4 that the

serial correlation   of the dividend growth has increased since World

War il.25    This increased serial correlation is consistent with more

smoothing of dividend changes.    Tables 2 and 3 include statistics      for the

change in dividends measured over four years (expressed at annual rate).

Although there is a decline in the variability of this series, it is much

smaller than for the year-to-year changes.

     Finally,   all the measures considered show dramatic increases      in

volatility in the period between the beginning of World War I and the end of

World War II.    The finding accords with the volatile
                                                       history of that period

(the roaring twenties, the Great Depression,       the World War II boom).    The

participants in the debates over the historical economic data do not dispute

that this period saw an increase in volatility       of real activity.

Additionally,   the large decline in the value of the stock market itself at

the onset of the Depression would itself increase
                                                  volatility through the

leverage effect.

                                  IV.    Discussion

      The previous section documents that stock market returns show no

 reduction in variance when the pre-Worid War I or
                                                   pre-Depression periods are
 compared to the post-World War    II period.         The lack of stabilization   in

 stock prices supports the view that activity has not been stabilized.

      It is inappropriate,   of course, to offer evidence of the inability to

 reject a hypothesis as evidence for the hypothesis.            Indeed, if one believes
that the stock market is determined by fads or will o'
                                                       wisps" one might
maintain that the test lacks power against the alternative that the variance

of the fundamentals has changed.        The variance of fundamentals could be

overwhelmed by the variance of the fad component.            In the worst case, all

changes in stock market value are caused by speculative bubbles, but there

is, as discussed    above, evidence that does link the fundamentals to stock

prices.   Indeed, about forty to seventy percent of the standard deviation of

the log dividend-price ratio can be explained by the rational
                                                              expectation of
future dividends and interest rates in the context of the conventional

valuation model.26    Given that the size of any fad component          is thus

circumscribed,   the tests presented    in this paper should have
                                                                  power against
the alternative that the variance of the fundamentals has
                                                          changed.

     Another issue of power may arise if the stochastic process for
                                                                    output
has shifted during the sample.    The greater the persistence of the shocks to

the fundamentals,   the more the stock market will
                                                   respond to an innovation            of

     26See Campbell and Shiller (1986). Note that this
                                                        finding is put
forward by a strong proponent of fads models [Shiller (1984)].           and
Shiller (1988) do find that a lower fraction of variance in the Campbell
dividend-price ratio is explained when a long moving average of earnings is
included in the information set.

a given size.     Campbell   and Mankiw (1987) find evidence that the persistence

in shocks to output growth has increased in the U.S. since World War II.

Consider the implications of the persistence of output fluctuations               for the

relationship between variance of output and variance of stock returns.                  The

more persistent are changes in the fundamentals,            the greater does the

variance of stock returns magnify the variance of innovations in the

fundamentals.      Conversely,    if the fundamentals     are negatively

autocorrelated,    the stock return will respond little to an innovation              in the

fundamentals.      In the limiting case where shocks to the fundamentals          are

perfectly transitory,     for example, where a shock this period is offset by a

shock of equal and opposite present value the next period, changes               in

fundamentals    lead to virtually no changes in stock values.          Suppose

macroeconomic stabilization policies have reduced the variation               in output by

attenuating     high frequency,   negatively autocorrelated changes in output.27

Under this view of policy, stabilization of output would leave the

distribution of stock returns relatively unchanged,            but year-to-year output

changes could be reduced substantially.             Hence, if stabilization    policy

operates only at the short end of the spectrum, stabilization may have been

effective,    but would go undetected by the tests in this paper.             This line of

reasoning    also suggests that the debate over stabilization should focus more

on high frequency movements in output rather than on total variability.

Doing so will be difficult        given the weakness and relatively low frequency



     27Dividend growth clearly shows greater persistence and lower
innovation variance in recent years. As noted above, this change in the
stochastic process for dividends could be caused by a change in firms'
dividend policies.
                                         19 -



of   the existing data.     In any case, the findings of this paper rule out

stabilization    at the long end of the spectrum.       Any defence of the

stabilization    hypothesis   must therefore point to high frequency output

fluctuations in the early period that have disappeared in recent years.

       In suninary,   financial data provide an excellent    vehicle for testing

whether real activity has been stabilized when the direct data on real

activity are suspect.      The financial data are available over a long span,

are accurately measured,      and are related in theory and in practice to real

activity.    Stock returns since World War      II   have essentially the same

variance as in earlier periods.       Given the evidence that innovations    in

output are essentially permanent,      the constant variance of stock returns

supports Romer's important finding that the stabilization         of the post-Wor'd

War II economy is illusory.
