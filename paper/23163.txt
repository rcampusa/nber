                                           ABSTRACT

The magnitude of and heterogeneity in systematic earnings risk has important implications for
various theories in macro, labor, and financial economics. Using administrative data, we
document how the aggregate risk exposure of individual earnings to GDP and stock returns varies
across gender, age, the worker’s earnings level, and industry. Aggregate risk exposure is U-
shaped with respect to the earnings level. In the middle of the earnings distribution, aggregate risk
exposure is higher for males, younger workers, and those in construction and durable
manufacturing. At the top of the earnings distribution, aggregate risk exposure is higher for older
workers and those in finance. Workers in larger employers are less exposed to aggregate risk, but
they are more exposed to a common factor in employer-level earnings, especially at the top of the
earnings distribution. Within an employer, higher-paid workers have higher exposure to the
employer-level risk than lower-paid workers.

   How are the labor earnings of a worker tied to the fortunes of the aggregate economy, his
employer, and his industry? How do these risk exposures vary by gender, age, the worker’s
earnings level, industry, and the size of his employer? The answers to these questions have
important implications for various theories in macro, labor, and ﬁnancial economics. In
this paper, we use a large and clean panel dataset on individual earnings from the US
Social Security Administration to answer these questions. In particular, we estimate the risk
exposure of a worker’s earnings to three important risk factors: the aggregate economy, the
performance of the worker’s employer, and the performance of the worker’s industry.
   Our main empirical approach is a pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) regression of a
worker’s real annual earnings growth on either real gross domestic product (GDP) growth
or real stock returns, the average earnings growth of the worker’s employer, and the average
earnings growth of the worker’s industry. The use of big data allows us to estimate these risk
exposures, which we call “worker betas”, more accurately and at a granular level, resulting in
a clearer picture of how income risk from various sources is distributed across the population.
    We document ﬁve main facts:

  1. Aggregate risk exposure (to either GDP growth or stock returns) is U-shaped with
     respect to the earnings level.

  2. Males are more exposed to aggregate risk than females.

  3. Younger workers are more exposed to aggregate risk than older workers, except at the
     top of the earnings distribution where the relation reverses.

  4. In the middle of the earnings distribution, males, younger workers, and those in con-
     struction and durable manufacturing have the highest aggregate risk exposure. At
      the top of the earnings distribution, those in ﬁnance have the highest aggregate risk
      exposure. Workers in health and education have the lowest aggregate risk exposure
      throughout the earnings distribution.

  5. Workers in larger employers are less exposed to aggregate risk, but they are more
     exposed to a common factor in employer-level earnings, especially at the top of the
     earnings distribution. Within an employer, higher-paid workers have higher exposure
      to employer-level risk than lower-paid workers.

   Our measurement exercise has important implications for several literatures in macro,
labor, and ﬁnancial economics.
   For example, our ﬁndings relate to a large literature that estimates or calibrates individual
income processes motivated by an incomplete markets model. This literature usually speciﬁes

                                               2
a worker’s log earnings as the sum of an aggregate shock (modeled as a time ﬁxed eﬀect),
a Mincer earnings function of age and education, and the residual that is interpreted as
an idiosyncratic shock. According to our ﬁndings, the standard approach underestimates
systematic risk by ignoring the diﬀerential exposure across workers to aggregate risk as well
as employer- and industry-level risk. Thus, the standard approach misinterprets the residual
from the wage regression as purely idiosyncratic when in fact it contains several sources
of systematic risk. Properly decomposing earnings through a factor model, as we do in
this paper, makes the residual closer to the theoretical concept of idiosyncratic risk that is
unrelated to aggregate outcomes and pertains only to the circumstances of the individual
worker.
   The decomposition of earnings into systematic versus idiosyncratic components is a key
input into the macro debate on the cost of business cycles and the beneﬁts of stabilization
policies (Krusell and Smith 1999, Lucas 2003, Krebs 2006, Krusell, Mukoyama, Şahin and
Smith 2009). The standard speciﬁcation of earnings based on time ﬁxed eﬀects that we
described above would imply that business cycles and stabilization policies have homoge-
neous eﬀects on income growth across the population. In contrast, our estimates based on
heterogeneous exposure to risk factors imply that the cost of business cycles is borne asym-
metrically across the population depending on gender, age, the worker’s earnings level, and
industry. Therefore, monetary or ﬁscal policies that stabilize business cycles would also have
heterogeneous beneﬁts across the population.
   Our ﬁndings also have implications for the importance of intergenerational risk sharing
through a social security system (Allen and Gale 1997, Ball and Mankiw 2007). In an
overlapping generations economy, an important source of market incompleteness arises from
the inability of generations that live in diﬀerent periods to insure aggregate risk through
ﬁnancial markets. A government can improve welfare through a fully funded social security
system that transfers income from lucky to unlucky generations. This transfer system could
be improved with better knowledge of how aggregate income risk is distributed across the
population.
    Turning to another important issue, a theory of risk sharing under heterogeneous risk
preferences implies that more risk-averse individuals should bear less aggregate consumption
risk. One mechanism through which eﬃcient risk sharing could be achieved is for more
risk-averse individuals to choose jobs or occupations where income has less aggregate risk
exposure (Schulhofer-Wohl 2011, Mazzocco and Saini 2012). When combined with estimates
of risk preferences (e.g., from survey data), our estimates of aggregate risk exposure could
be used to test this theory more precisely. Our ﬁnding that higher-paid workers have higher
exposure to the employer-level risk than lower-paid workers could also be consistent with


                                              3
theories of risk sharing within ﬁrms (Guiso, Pistaferri and Schivardi 2005). Lower-paid
workers need more income insurance if they are more risk averse or have more limited self-
insurance opportunities.
    A theory of portfolio choice in the presence of risky labor income implies that the optimal
allocation to stocks depends on the covariance of income growth with stock returns (Bodie,
Merton and Samuelson 1992). More speciﬁcally, the formula for the optimal portfolio share
in stocks is a weighted average of the mean-variance portfolio and the hedging portfolio
(Campbell and Viceira 2002, equation 6.11). Hedging demand implies that the optimal
portfolio share in stocks decreases with stock return beta, which is exactly what we estimate
in this paper. Therefore, our estimates of stock return beta could be used for normative
advice on how investors with diﬀerent income risks should tilt their allocation to stocks.
When combined with data on portfolio choice, our estimates of stock return beta could be
used to test the theory of portfolio choice.

                           I.   Administrative Data on Earnings

Our annual panel data on earnings are from the Master Earnings File of the Social Security
Administration from 1978 to 2013. These administrative data are representative, complete,
and free of measurement error because they are based on all employer ﬁlings of Form W-2
for all US workers with a Social Security number. Importantly, the earnings data are not
top coded and include all wages, salaries, bonuses, and exercised stock options as reported in
Box 1 of Form W-2.1 For each worker, we aggregate earnings across all his/her employers in
a given year. We deﬂate earnings to 2009 real dollars using the GDP implicit price deﬂator.
    In addition to earnings, we use demographic information from the Master Earnings File
including gender, year of birth (or age), and the Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation (SIC)
code of the primary employer. Because of computing resource constraints, our analysis is
based on a 10 percent representative sample of the Master Earnings File. We further limit
our sample to workers who are in their prime working years from ages 26 to 65.
   We compute real earnings growth as the diﬀerence in log real earnings between year t
and t − 1. As a proxy for “permanent income”, we also compute average real earnings over
ﬁve years from year t − 6 to t − 2. When ﬁve years of earnings history are not available for a
worker (primarily in the ﬁrst four years of the panel from 1978 to 1981), we use the longest
consecutive period (between one to four years) that is available. We emphasize that there
is no overlap between the period over which earnings growth is computed (i.e., year t − 1 to
t) and the period over which average earnings are computed (i.e., year t − 6 to t − 2). This
  1
    In addition to W-2 wages, the Master Earnings File contains self-employment income. However, we do
not use self-employment income in our analysis because it was top coded prior to 1994.

ensures that there is no mechanical correlation between our measures of earnings growth
and average earnings. The data requirements for computing earnings growth and average
earnings imply that to enter our sample, a worker must have positive earnings in years t,
t − 1, and at least one year between t − 6 and t − 2.
    In each year, we group our sample into four age groups: 26–35, 36–45, 46–55, and 56–
65. We also group our sample into 12 earnings percentiles (i.e., 10th to 90th, 99th, and
99.9th) conditional on gender and age group, based on average earnings that we described
above. Finally, we group our sample into ten industries based on the four-digit SIC code
of the primary employer: construction (1521–1799), nondurable manufacturing (111–1499,
2011–2399, 2611–3199, and 3951–3999), durable manufacturing (2411–2599 and 3211–3949),
transportation (4011–4971), retail and wholesale (5012–5999), ﬁnance (6011–6799), services
(7011–7999, 8111, and 8322–8999), health and education (8011–8099 and 8211–8299), and
other industries (9111–9999 and missing SIC code).
   Table 1 summarizes our sample by gender and age. An advantage of our administrative
data is that our sample is much larger than in typical studies of household ﬁnance that are
based on surveys. For example, we have 5.073 million observations of males aged 36–45 who
fall between the 50th and 60th percentiles of the earnings distribution. The median earnings
for this group is $45,000. We also have 457,000 observations of males aged 36–45 who fall
between 99th and 99.9th percentiles of the earnings distribution, where median earnings
is $333,000. We even have 51,000 observations above the 99.9th percentile, where median
earnings is $1.073 million.


                           II.   GDP and Stock Return Beta

                                       A.   GDP Beta

Let Δyn,t be the log real earnings growth of individual n in year t, and let Δyt be the log
real GDP growth in year t. Our main regression speciﬁcation is

(1)                               Δyn,t = αg + βg Δyt + n,t .

We estimate the coeﬃcients αg and βg by pooled OLS, separately by gender, four age groups,
and 12 earnings percentile bins. The assumption, for example, is that males aged 36–45 whose
earnings fall between the 50th and 60th percentiles have the same GDP beta.
   Figure 1 reports GDP beta across the earnings distribution at age 36–45 by gender. For
both males and females, GDP beta is U-shaped in the earnings level. That is, workers at
the tails of the earnings distribution have the highest aggregate risk exposure. In particular,

males at the 99.9th percentile of the earnings distribution have a GDP beta of 3.70. Parker
and Vissing-Jorgensen (2009) also ﬁnd that income is most cyclical at the top of the earn-
ings distribution. Throughout the earnings distribution, males have higher GDP beta than
females. For example, males at the 50th percentile of the earnings distribution have a GDP
beta of 1.09, compared with 0.69 for females.
   Figure 1 also reports GDP beta across the earnings distribution for males by age group.
Within each age group, GDP beta is U-shaped in the earnings level. Below the 90th percentile
of the earnings distribution, younger males have higher GDP beta than older males. For

example, males aged 26–35 at the 50th percentile of the earnings distribution have a GDP
beta of 1.55, compared with 0.30 for males aged 56–65. Above the 90th percentile of the
earnings distribution, however, this relation reverses so that older males have higher GDP
beta than younger males. For example, males aged 56–65 at the 99.9th percentile of the
earnings distribution have a GDP beta of 4.23, compared with 2.90 for males aged 26–35.
    Figure 2 reports GDP beta across the earnings distribution for males aged 36–45 by indus-
try. There are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in GDP beta across industries. At the 50th percentile
of the earnings distribution, the industries (and corresponding GDP beta) ranked from the
most to least cyclical are construction (2.31), durable manufacturing (1.97), services (1.17),
retail and wholesale (1.05), nondurable manufacturing (0.88), ﬁnance (0.87), transportation
(0.47), and health and education (0.23). This ranking should not surprising, except for the
fact that ﬁnance is one of the less cyclical industries. However, the cyclicality of earnings
in the ﬁnance industry is highly dependent on the earnings level. At the 99th percentile of
the earnings distribution, ﬁnance is actually the most cyclical industry with a GDP beta of
3.05.

We now repeat regression (1) with real stock returns instead of real GDP growth as the
explanatory variable. Real stock returns are the Center for Research in Securities Prices
value-weighted index deﬂated by the GDP implicit price deﬂator. In aligning earnings growth
with stock returns, we use the beginning-of-period timing convention, which leads to a higher
correlation between GDP growth and stock returns than the end-of-period timing convention

(Campbell 2003). That is, we align earnings growth from year t − 1 to t with stock returns
during year t − 1.
   Figures 3 and 4 reports results that are analogous to Figures 1 and 2 for stock returns.
In our sample from 1980 to 2013, the correlation between real stock returns and real GDP
growth is 0.59. Therefore, it should not be surprising that our main ﬁndings for stock return
beta are similar to those for GDP beta.

Variation in earnings growth that remains after taking out the aggregate exposure to GDP
growth need not be purely idiosyncratic. In particular, earnings growth could be correlated
across workers within the same employer or industry. To examine the importance of factor
structure in earnings growth at the employer and industry levels, we modify regression (1)
to include employer- and industry-level factors.
    Let Δye\n,t be the log real growth rate of average earnings for other workers working for
worker n’s employer (deﬁned by the Employer Identiﬁcation Number) in year t, where we
exclude worker n in computing average earnings. By excluding worker n from the average, we
avoid any mechanical correlation in earnings growth between the worker and the employer.
Similarly, let Δyi\n,t be the log real growth rate of average earnings for worker n’s industry
in year t, where we again exclude worker n from the average. Our regression speciﬁcation is

(2)                                             Δyn,t =αe + βg Δyt + βg,e Δye\n,t + βg,i Δyi\n,t + νn,t ,

where αe are employer ﬁxed eﬀects.
   To isolate meaningful factors in employer-level earnings, we limit our sample to employers
with at least ten observations in our sample. In each year, we group our sample by employer
size with cutoﬀs at 50th, 90th, and 99th percentiles. Our four groups correspond to median
employer sizes of 13, 31, 154, and 1,210 observations in our sample. Because we start with
a 10 percent representative sample, these employers on average have 130, 310, 1,540, and
12,100 workers. To estimate regression (2), we ﬁrst take out the employer ﬁxed eﬀects by

cross-sectionally demeaning. We then estimate the coeﬃcients by pooled OLS, separately
by gender, 12 earnings percentile bins, and 4 employer-size groups.
   Figure 5 reports GDP, employer, and industry beta across the earnings distribution for
males by employer-size groups. Two important facts emerge. First, GDP beta decreases
in employer size, while employer beta increases in employer size. GDP beta decreases from
1.13, 0.83, 0.68, to 0.31 by employer size at the 50th percentile of the earnings distribution.
At the same time, employer beta increases from 0.37, 0.45, 0.48, to 0.54 in employer size.


                                                                    10
There is no such monotonic pattern in the industry beta. Second, employer beta increases
in the earnings level. This means that within an employer, higher-paid workers absorb a
higher share of the employer-level risk.
   In summary, we have uncovered interesting heterogeneity in risk exposure across workers
coming from aggregate-, employer-, and industry-level sources. A further exploration of
the implications of systematic earnings risk for macro, labor, and ﬁnancial economics is an
exciting area of research, which we intend to undertake in future work.
