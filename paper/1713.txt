     If   firms are indifferent about the timing of dividends, the

government's cash flow from taxes on dividends is indeterminate.

In an earlier paper, I showed in the context of a world without

uncertainty that variations in tax receipts from this source

would have no real effects. The extension of the analysis to a

world of risk turns out to involve new elements that may be of

some general interest. In particular, the conditions for neu-

trality seem less likely to be fulfilled in a practical context.

1.   Introduction.




     This paper concerns an aspect of the question: When do government

deficits matter? It takes as a starting point previous work (1981)

showing how endogenously generated deficits might have no real effect, a

result obtained under an assumption of perfect substitutability between

government and private debt. The extension to a world of risky debt

where the latter no longer holds turns out to involve new elements that

may be of some general interest. In particular, the conditions for

neutrality seem less likely to be fulfilled in practice.




Princeton University and National Bureau of Economic Research. This
paper has been prepared, with gratitude, for a festschrift in honor of
my dissertation supervisor, Kenneth J. Arrow. I would like to express
my appreciation for helpful discussions with Pete Kyle, David
Starrett, Joseph Stiglitz, and seminar participants at the
National Bureau of Economic Research and at the Workshop on Economic
Structural Change of the International Institute for Applied Systems
Analysis.

     The underlying idea is that it should not matter when taxes are

paid, provided there is an appropriate compensating interest element in

the postponed liability. This notion conflicts with the assumption often

employed that it is the government's cash flow balance that counts, even

though current deficits may be offset by correspondingly larger liability

for future tax payments, and surpluses may reflect drawing down liabili-

ties for future taxes. This issue arises especially strongly in the

context of analysis of proposals for consumption-type taxes, where there

is a choice between a literal consumption tax and a tax on wage and

transfer receipts. Typically the two approaches generate the same

liabilities in a present value sense, but very different cash flows. In

some systems (for example, the Cash Flow Tax analysed in Bradford et al.

(1984)), the taxpayer has wide latitude to choose between the approaches.

     The specific case I analyze here presents the same issues in a

particularly clear way. It involves a tax on distributions by corpora-

tions to equity holders, in essence, a dividend tax. If such a tax is

assessed at a flat rate which is not expected to change, and if negative

distributions (sales of new equity) are included (i.e., subsidized), the

case is quite compelling in a partial equilibrium setting that the level

of the tax should have no influence on real or financial transactions of

a corporation acting in the interest of its stockholders. The reason is

simply that the flat tax changes proportionately the consequences of all

decisions as far as stockholder outcomes are concerned. In particular,

the trade-off in the after-tax dollars for the shareholders between a

larger distribution today and the consequently smaller distribution at

some future time is unaffected by the rate of tax.
                                    -3—




      In the absence of all taxes (and transactions costs) the various

versions of the Nodigliani-Niller (1958) Theorem tell us the corporation

will be indifferent between debt and equity finance. An implication is

that the timing of dividend payments is a matter of indifference.     Since,

as I have just argued informally, a flat tax on dividends has no effect

on the optimal financial policy, something like the Nodigliani-Miller

Theorem should continue to hold. However, the choice of pay-out affects

the government's cash flow. Government receipts will be determined by

the whims of corporate managers; private wealth-maximizing calculations

are insufficient to fix the path of revenues. Will the consequent

fluctuations in tax receipts have real effects?

     In Bradford (1981) I spelled out an overlapping-generations model in

which government debt does generally influence the rational expectations

equilibrium path, but in which variations in government debt attributable

to variations in distribution-tax receipts do not matter. The indiffer-

ence about financial policy at the level of the firm, in spite of the tax

on distributions, carries over to neutrality of the economy's path to the

choice of financial policy, even though the flow of tax receipts is

affected.

     The key question is whether there are general equilibrium effects on

the rate of interest. The basis for the neutrality conclusion may be

sketched as follows: The capital investment level chosen by the firm is

governed by the going interest rate. Therefore, a decision to issue an

extra dollar of debt implies a decision to distribute an extra dollar to

shareholders. This in turn implies extra tax receipts of t dollars

(where t is the rate of tax). If real government spending is fixed,

the extra t dollars are devoted to reducing the public debt. The
                                    -4-




result thus far is a net addition of 1-t dollars to the supply of

financial assets. There remains, however, the equity interest in the

corporation, the value of which is predicted to fall, not by one dollar,

as a result of the extra debt cum distribution, but by 1-t dollars, in

reflection of the government's claim to a fraction t of all cash flows

to shareholders. As a consequence, all markets continue to clear. The

firm's decision has no real effect, even though tax receipts are

increased.

     The foregoing analysis support two conclusions. First, a tax on

corporate distributions may not have the often-assumed incentive effects

with respect to real and financial allocations. And second, variations

in government receipts attributable to changes in corporate distribution

policy may have no effect on the real path of the economy. The present

investigation concerns how the neutrality results are affected if the

perfect substitutability among financial assets, used in the argument

above and attributable to the assumption of certainty, is replaced in the

context of an explicit treatment of uncertainty.

     As it. turns out, the earlier results carry over without significant

complication when only equity is risky at the margin, while corporate

debt and marginal public debt are risk free and therefore perfect substi-

tutes. The restriction on government financial choices is a special case

of the requirement that applies when the risk characteristics of corpo-

rate debt are unrestricted. In the more general case, the neutrality

conclusions require that the government policy be describable as one of

issuing a certain pre-specified risky debt together with the purchase of

a fraction of the private debt supply equal to the tax rate.
                                    —5—




     These conditions on government behavior are not as arbitrary as

might appear. As I stressed in my earlier paper, the proportional tax on

corporate distributions in effect gives the government a fractional

ownership in the firm. Neutrality will follow if the government uses the

tax revenue incident upon an incremental distribution to purchase bonds

of the firm. This is just what is needed to preserve the pre—distri—

bution portfolio of the government, taking into account its implicit

ownership of corporate equity. The government's behavior, in other

words, is exactly what we would——in Modigliani—Miller fashion——expect of

a shareholder that receives a dividend.

     In Section 2 below I review the uncertainty results as a way of

introducing the basic model. The extension to a model with uncertainty

is presented in Section 3. Section 4 contains concluding remarks.



2. Review of the Certainty Model.

     The model underlying the analysis is in the Sanuelson (1959) con—

suniption loan tradition. Individuals live for two periods in an infinite

time horizon world. In the first life period each individual works

(offering one unit of labor inelastically), consumes, and saves for

retirement. "Retirement" describes the second life period, when each

individual dissaves and consumes, leaving nothing to his heirs.

     All production takes place in the consolidated corporate sector

which is modeled as a single price—taking firm. Production conditions

are described by a neoclassical production function of capital and labor

employed, with constant returns to scale. The capital available to the

corporation in any period is inherited from the previous period and is

thus fixed in amount before the time of actual production. The output of
                                   -6-




a period may either be consumed or frozen into infinitely durable capi-

tal. Investment is regarded as reversible.

     Savings may be held in three forms: bonds issued by the corpora-

tion, shares of its common stock, or bonds issued by the government. A

given generation of individuals acquires these financial assets at the

end of its first life period, after production for that period has been

completed, and after the investment and financial plans of the corpora-

tion have been realized.

     The holders of its common stock "own" the corporation. The owners

at the beginning of a period control that period's production and the

real investment which determines the amount of capital which will be

available for use in production at the beginning of the next period. The

owners of the firm at the beginning of a period specify as well the

financial policy for that period, which means they set the amount of

funds to be distributed to themselves as dividends and the amount of

corporate borrowing. At the end of the period the current owners sell

the equity to the young generation of savers.

     The government's real spending program is assumed fixed, for sim-

plicity at a zero level. The government is thus modeled as a mechanical

cash flow manager: In each period the inherited debt obligation must be

paid off, with any shortfall of tax receipts covered by the issue of new

debt. Since the distribution tax is the only tax, there is nothing else

for the government to do. Note that by allowing the government to make

lump-sum transfers the model could be used to permit the government to

engage in (pre-announced) intertemporal redistributions. This would

involve issue of government debt in amounts larger or smaller than the

difference between old debt obligations and distribution tax receipts.

     Notation.

     To describe the results of the analysis formally, I use the

following notation (involving minor changes from that of the 1981 paper

to facilitate extension to incorporate uncertainty):

          L: total number of labor units available for application

                 during the period (equals the number of individuals born

                 in the period, exogenously given).

          K: stock of corporate capital at the beginning of the period

                 (used for production during the period).

          B: total stock of corporate indebtedness at the beginning of

              the period, which must be repaid during the period.

     F(K,L): the production function, characterized by constant returns

              to scale.

          D: total distribution made by the corporation during the

              period.

              total stock of government indebtedness at the beginning of

              period, which must be repaid during the period.

          t: rate of tax on corporate distributions to stockholders

              (which may be negative).

    There are two ordinary prices in the model (current output is

numeraire), and one price-like "valuation function:"

         w: wage.

         d: discount factor, the current-period price of a bond

             paying one dollar next period.

 V(K÷, B+): a function relating the "ex-dividend" value of equity,

             that is, the value at the end of a period, after
                                         -8-




               production is complete, to the financial and investment

               decisions of the current owners.

      For any variable, X, let X÷, X÷, etc., represent its value in

succeeding periods: X     its value in the preceding period. In order to

determine how to value the firm's equity, individuals must form expecta-

tions about the prices and valuation function one period hence. Let

denote the value of w expected to obtain in the next period, and

similarly for d and V. I assume that everyone agrees about w, d

and V; forecasts more than one period into the future are not needed.

      There are three classes of agents in the model, two displaying

maximizing behavior. The "young" try to maximize U(c1, c) (labor is

supplied inelastically), where c1 is consumption dunn the th period

of the life cycle. The "old" manage the corporation to maximize c2,

which means maximize the sum of after-tax distributions and the proceeds "

from sale of equity, (1 - t)D     -
                                      V(K÷, B÷). The third agent is the
government which simply manages the cash flow according to dB =           -
tD.   (Reminder: d is a price, not the differential operator.)



      Evolution of the Economy.

      The situation inherited from the past is described by (K, B,

L),   with L evolving exogenously along a known path. The requirements

placed on the model world are that the evolution to (K÷, B÷, B, L+) be

determined by clearing of competitive spot markets for labor, corporate

bonds, government bonds, corporate equity and goods, and that the price

expectations on which the value of the firm depends be "rational." The

general notion of rational expectations, attributed to Muth (1961), here

encompasses two properties: Expectations are correct, and they are
                                     -9-




 determinate, in the sense that they are governed by knowledge of the

economic structure and the current state of the economy. For rational

expectations to make sense, there must be an appropriate degree of

determinacy of the model as a whole, including its expectations-forma-

tion. Solving the model involves showing that the endogenous variables,

including prices and expectations, can be expressed as stationary fu.nc-

tions of the state variables, K, B, and             given the known path of
L. Properly, there should also be a demonstration that the proposed

equilibrium path of prices is at least locally unique--otherwise, why

should the economic agents pick the required expectations-forming rule?

      My previous paper described an equilibrium path of the economy

sketched out above.   (I did not succeed in demonstrating local unique-

ness.) The neutrality result concerning the rate of tax on corporate

distributions followed from the conclusion that the valuation function on

the equilibrium path is given by



(1)       V(K, B) = (1
                         -
                             t)d(F(K÷,   L÷) -   wL - B   + K÷)



The objective of the owners of the firm is to set employment together

with K+, B+ and D to maximize (1-t)D + V(K÷, B+). If we substitute

for D in the objective function, using accounting relationship (2)

among the outlays by the firm, B+ drops out.



(2)
          DF(K,L)-wL-B+K+dB-K

Maximizing values of the other variables are independent of t, while

the financial structure of the firm is indeterminate.
                                             -10-




       Indeterminacy of financial structure corresponds to indeterminacy of

government tax receipts. The reason the equilibrium path of the econo-

my's real variables and prices is nonetheless determinate is suggested by

equilibrium condition (3), which describes equality between the value of

demanded and supplied claims to future consumption:



(3) dc(d, w)L = dB÷ +               + (1 -
                               dB            t)d(F÷(K, L) -   wL     -
                                                                         B÷
                                                                              +
                                                                                  K÷).


Here c(d, w) is the retirement-period consumption (which will take

place next period) demanded by a representative young person, the values

of K÷ and B+ are set by the current owners of the firm, and I have

taken for granted w =          w.    The expression on the left is the value of

claims demanded on the basis of life-cycle optimization by members of the

young generation. The first two terms on the right are the values of

bonds supplied by the firm and the government, and the third term is the

value of corporate equity. Exploiting the governmentt s budget constraint

dB =      - tD,    and the already mentioned accounting relationship (2)

between D and the other variables, allows us to write condition (3) as



(4) dcL =         - t(F   -   wL - B + K -
                                           K÷)
                                               +
                                                    (1-t)d(F÷(K÷,   L÷) -     wL    +
                                                                                         K÷).


Once again, B÷ has been eliminated, so the condition is independent of

corporate financial policy.

     Equation (5) expresses a further reformulation of the same condi-

tion, taking advantage of Euler's theorem:
                                       —11—




 (5) dcL K÷ +          - t(P(K,   L) - wL   -   B +   K).


 The left-hand side of (5) is, as before, the demand by the young genera-

 tion for assets. The right-hand side, the economy's net supply of

 assets, is the sum   of   the capital stock and the difference between

 government bonds carried over from the past and the tax receipts that

would be generated if the corporation were to be liquidated in the

 current period. The last term affects the real equilibrium path like an

anticipated tax receipt "asset" of the government, offsetting explicit

government debt. Through this relationship one obtains a clear sense of

why deficits or surpluses due to variations in corporate distributions

have no effect on the real path of the economy, even though government

debt does matter. An increase in distributions simultaneously reduces

government debt and the anticipated tax receipt asset by equal amounts.



3. Introducing Uncertainty.

     There are various ways one might introduce uncertainty to this

model. Taking advantage of the framework pioneered by Kenneth Arrow (see

Arrow and Hahn (1971)), suppose that future production conditions depend

upon the particular state (for example, weather conditions) occurring.

Specifically, assume that the investment decision is fixed in the current

period, but the actual production function is determined in the next

period.

     Let S stand for the set of possible states that might obtain in

the current period, S the set of possible states in the next period,

and so on. The larger dimensionality of the problem requires some new

notation. The following describes my compromise between
                                       -12-


 comprehensiveness and mnemonics. In general, variables are now under-

 stood to have a subscript to designate the state and time with which they

 are associated. Thus, w., icS+, refers to the wage rate realized in

 state i next period. Since the story starts with a known current

 state, we can let variables with no subscript refer to the values cur-

 rently realized.

      I shall also assume that S is finite in each period, and that an

ordering has been agreed upon for the states in each period, so we can

use the subscript tt+f?   to   refer to the vector of values of a variable

potentially obtaining in the next period. (I make an exception for

and L÷, which keep their previous scalar interpretation.)             Thus, w
refers to the vector of wage rates presently anticipated for next period,

with components w., icS+, and has dimensionality equal to the number of
states in S÷.

     The firm and the government must now specify, instead of the

single-dimensional bonds, vectors of state-specific claims. To simplify

matters, I assume that markets exist for each of the possible one-period

contingent claims. A unit of type i,              icS÷, pays one dollar next

period if state i is realized, and zero if another state is realized.

To issue a riskless bond is equivalent to selling one unit each of claims

of all types i, icS÷. The firm's bond financing is described by the

vector, B÷, the i.th component                .           .
                                      of which, B. (1S÷), is the amount

the firm will owe its bondholders if state i is realized next period.

     Instead of the single discount factor d, we now have a vector of

prices of unit claims contingent on the next period's state. Like the

discount factor d in the certainty case, the vector d is understood

as representing prices actually ruling in financial markets. (The prices
                                   -13-




 of unit contingent claims might be observable only by appropriately

packaging available financial instruments.) If e+ is the vector of

ones of appropriate dimension, the inner product   e+ •d is the price of

a riskiess bond. Since we shall want to continue to use the ordinary

subscript to refer to the state and time in which a particular variable

is realized (for example, d., icS+ is the vector of discount rates,

applicable to claims on output two periods hence, realized if state i

occurs next period), I shall use parentheses when I wish to identify a

particular element of d. Thus,     (d).,, icS÷, is a scalar, namely, the

present price of a claim to one unit if state i occurs next period.

The symbol d+ refers to the matrix of discount factor vectors, one for

each possible state that might be realized next period.

     We are now in a position to use the analogues in the world of risk

to the temporary equilibrium relationships discussed earlier to explore

the question whether changes in tax receipts due to changes in corporate

distributions alter the equilibrium vector of discount factors. Of

particular importance is the valuation function for corporate equity

corresponding to (1), given by (6):



                    -
(6) V(K÷, B) = (1       t)d(F÷(K÷, L) -   wL - B   +
                                                       e÷K)


This is simply the value of the vector of payoffs, contingent on the

state realized, that the purchasers of the equity expect to obtain next

period in the form of distribution plus proceeds from sale of the equity

interest.

     To analyze asset-market clearing in this case, it is not sufficient

to look at the aggregate value of present claims, as we did in (3) above.
                                           -14-


We   must now look for the state-by-state equality of supplies of and

demands for contingent claims. Recall that c(w, d) is now to be

interpreted as the vector of consumption plans by the representative

young person for the retirement period, contingent on the state realized.

Asset market clearing now requires the vector equation,



(7) c(w, d)L =      B+B        + (1 -

where, as before, we are taking for granted the determination of K+ and

w via other equilibrium relationships, given w and d.

      In the certainty case we were able to use the government budget

constraint, d•B =            - tD,   together with the accounting relationship

between D and B, to eliminate both B and B+ from the asset

market clearing condition. Under uncertainty, the combination of these

two relationships is no longer sufficient. Whereas before, constraining

the value of the government's bond sales or purchases determined the

quantity (given d), the government now may choose among various combina-

tions of state—contingent claims (i.e., deal in bonds of different risk

characteristics). Moreover, the same can be said of the firm. Thus, if

we take as a starting point that the government only issues riskiess

bonds (buys riskless bonds in the case of negative government debt), we

have still not pinned down temporary equilibrium because the risk charac-

teristics of the firm's debt have not been determined.

      If the corporation is restricted to riskless debt and the government

is restricted to riskiess debt at the margin, the argument goes through
                                               -15-


much as it did in the risk-free analysis. In that case, extra bonds

issued by the corporation generate not only the exact withdrawal in value

of government bonds (as a consequence of extra taxes paid) required to

maintain financial market equilibrium, but also the matching change in

the state-by-state contingent claims. We can see this by inspection of

equilibrium condition (7). If the firm issues another unit of bonds, it

adds directly one dollar to each component of the vector, B+, of claims

supplied on the right-hand side, but subtracts an amount (1-t) from the

anticipated recovery from owning equity in each state that might occur.

If the government issues bonds delivering t in each state, the set of

financial claims supplied will continue to balance the claims demanded.

      Note that the condition calls for riskiess bonds to be issued by the

corporation, but for the government to issue riskiess bonds "at the

margin." The requirement specifies the way the government must react to

variations in distribution-tax receipts. The government retains, howev-

er, freedom to set the risk characteristics of what we may call its basic

debt issue, which we might specify as the debt issued if there were no

corporate distributions in the period. The total value of the debt

issued is determined by the budget constraint (which could itself be

lifted by addition of, say, lump-sum taxes to the fiscal repertoire).

      This freedom cannot, however, be unpredictably exercised. In order

for the the agents of the model to be able to formulate rational expecta-

tions, the risk characteristics of the basic government debt issue must

be specified in advance (for example, by a formula relating to the

characteristics defining the different states of the world). This is a

distinct addition to the model introduced by the extension to uncertain-

ty. In the certainty case the government was wholly predictable because
                                    -16-




it had no degree of freedom within the budget constraint. Uncertainty

brings with it a range of options in each situation. Government policy

will influence the course of the model economy (because the overlapping

generations are, by assumption, not linked through bequests). In this

case, the main effect of policy is to influence the choice among risky

alternatives. It might be interesting to explore the question of optimal

fiscal policy in this model; however, for present purposes, the point to

stress is the requirement for predictability, involving pre-specification

of the characteristics of the basic debt and the rule for responding at

the margin to variations in distribution-tax receipts.

      The latter requirement has thus far been spelled out for the case in

which the corporation issues only riskiess debt. However, we can readily

formulate a more general rule relating private and marginal public debt

to preserve the property of the model whereby the firm's financial policy

has no real effect.

      The investment and employment decisions in the model are essentially

determined by the path of w and d, wages and contingent dollar-claim

prices. Suppose we had a path of w and d such that (7) is continu-

ally satisfied when the firm is restricted to riskiess debt and the

government to riskless debt at the margin. Then equilibrium condition

(7) provides us with a general condition on government finance that

assures that the path is unaffected by other choices of private financial

behavior, namely,



(8)    B = c(w,d)L    -
                          (1-t)(F÷(K÷,L)
                                           -
                                               wL   -
                                                        e÷K÷)
                                                                -
                                                                    tB

 In   words, in order for corporate financial policy to have no real effect,

 government policy must be effectively to issue basic debt, consisting of

 a pre-determined package of contingent claims, c(w,d)L -
                                                              (1-t)(F÷(K÷,L÷)
 -          +
     w+L÷       e+K÷),   and to purchase tB÷, i.e., a fraction t, of the
 bonds issued by the firm. The requirement (7) of equilibrium implies

 that if any other government policy is followed, private financial policy

 will have real effects, and hence further restrictions on behavior are

 required to close the model.



4. Concluding Remarks.

       With respect to the narrow question whether the neutrality results

obtained earlier in an all certainty model carry over to a world of

uncertainty, the analysis yields a clear conclusion. Uncertainty intro-

duces degrees of freedom to government choices that must be balanced by

restrictions. In particular, if corporate distributions are not to have

real effects, the government must use the distribution-tax proceeds to

purchase the debt of the distributing firm (or, equivalently, buy back a

set of government-issued contingent claims to generate the same effect on

the supply of each type in the market). As I have suggested in the

introductory section of this paper, there is an economic rationale for

such a policy on the part of the government. It really is the same

policy that we would expect shareholders to follow in rebalancing their

portfolios following a distribution. The distribution by the corporation

changes the characteristics of the equity claim. The portfolio can be

restored to its pre-distribution characteristics by using the dividend to

buy the firm's bonds. When we recognize that the government is an
                                  —18—



implicit equity owner, by virtue of the distribution tax, the behavior

required for neutrality seems reasonable.

     However, it is hard to imagine any actual government carrying out

this program. The systems used to account for government are typically

weak in the dimension of measuring either government liabilities to make

future payments or government claims to payment of taxes in the future

already established by existing policies. To take an example, existing

accounting conventions in the United States record the loss in tax

revenue due to contributions to tax—favored retirement plans, and make no

allowance for the resulting increase in the present value of future

liabilities implied by the same transaction (Kotlikoff (1984) develops

this general theme more fully).

     Unfortunately for the model described here, if the government does

not follow the specified behavior, incremental distribution—tax revenues

will have real effects. The problem this presents is not simply to

describe these effects, but rather to understand how it is that equilib—

rium is determined at all. For the argument that corporate distributions

are not determined in the model holds generally——it is simply a conse-

quence of price—taking by private agents in financial markets. As a

result, corporate distributions cannot be predicted. If an unpredictable

aspect of the model has real consequences, how can agents have "rational

expectations?" Thus I conclude this paper on a note of puzzlement.
