             Malfeasance in Long Term Employment Contracts:
          A New General Model with an Application to Unionism


                               ABSTRACT


      This paper argues that the structure of
                                                long—term employment contracts
 is influenced by the possibility that at least four different kinds of

 opportunistic behavior, or "malfeasance," may occur in them. While the

 consequences of some of these problems have been examined in various papers,

 no single model has yet treated all four and thus brought out their

 essential symmetry. In particular, a certain kind of malfeasance by firms

has apparently been universally overlooked —— an oversight we try to remedy

by developing a simple model here. Other advantages of the present model are

that, unlike other models, it endogenizes the path of both sides of the

contract —— wages and effort —— and
                                    has fairly intuitive first—order
conditions. It also shows how earlier conclusions, such as the notion that

wages are likely to rise faster than marginal products in

       This paper argues that the structure of
                                                 long—term employment contracts
 is influenced by the possibility that at least four different kinds of

 opportunistic behavior, or "malfeasance,' may occur in them. While the

 consequences of some of these problems have been examined in various papers,

 no single model has yet treated all four and thus brought out their

 essential symmetry. In particular, a certain kind of malfeasance by firms

 has apparently been universally overlooked —— an oversight we try to remedy

 by developing a simple model here. Other advantages of the present model are

 that, unlike other models, it endogenizes the path of both sides of the

 contract —— wages and effort —— and
                                     has fairly intuitive first—order

 conditions. It also shows how earlier conclusions, such as the notion that

wages are likely to rise faster than marginal products in equilibrium, are

 the results of less—than—general model
                                          specification, and has some interesting

implications when applied to unionism: by proposing that unions act as workers'

dismissals used by firms, it provides what is to the author's knowledge the

only consistent theoretical explanation of the quite commonly observed U—

shaped pattern of the union wage effect by age and shows how unions might

play a positive efficiency role in this regard.

     The paper begins in Section II with an overall discussion of the

malfeasance issue and a brief review of the existing literature in light of

that discussion. The model's structure is set out in Section III, and

Section IV draws out some of its more basic implications.    The model is

actually solved for optimal wage and effort profiles in Section V. while

  iL.YI Et4:     THE GENERAL PROBLE OFMALFEASCE

                                     CONTRACTS



       In    general, any contract between a firm and a worker over a

  s1gnifjcan period of time T, involves an agreement on both what
                                                                   the
  firm supplies to a worker —— a
                                 complex bundle of wages, fringes, and
 working conditions which we assume is
                                             summarized by the measure w(t) ——
  and what the worker supplies in
                                    return, which we might loosly term "effort"
 or h(t). Any such contracts can in principle be broken by both parties

 in two quite distinct ways —--
                                  first,   either party has the option, at any
 time t, of unilaterally
                            terminating the contract by withdrawing from it,
 and second, either party may attempt to alter the initial terms of
                                                                    the
 Contract ex 22.!' by supplying less of the factor it supplies than
                                                                    was
 (implicitly) agreed upon, or perhaps by making an all—or—nothing demand

 for more of the other party's factor      —   and the possibility that any of
 the above will occur is a crucial
                                     factor determining the structure such
 contracts will have.

      In short, in designing long
                                    run contracts, firmsand workers must take
account of the possibility of four different
                                                   problems arising during the
life of the contract: First, workers
                                        may quit the firm in order to avoid
their contractual obligations to the firm if they can do better elsewhere.

Second, firms may dismiss workers to whom they owe more than they expect

to receive for the same reason. We shall refer to these two activities

henceforth as "unilateral withdrawal" from the contract, or "Type 1"
malfeasance —— even though an activity like worker quitting
                                                             may not often

be thought of in these terms.    Third, workers at some point during the

contract may all of a sudden decide to supply less effort than was

  been formally treated until Hashirnoto and Yu (1980) and Hall and
                                                                    Lazear

                                                                   bargain
  is prespecified but both parties to the contract have the
                                                            right to
  terminate it unilaterally.
                               Again, "second best" contract structure,
  plus the result that quits and dismissals
                                                are greater than ootimal, are
 derived. Finally, a number of models of contracts that deal
                                                              primarily
 with the problem of e1icitjn effort from workers (TvDe
                                                         II malfeasance) have been
 developed, such as Eaton and Rosen (1981) or Lazear and Rosen (1981).

 These tend not to deal with any sort of firm malfeasance at all,
                                                                        except
 for the interestipg case of Lazear (1979, 1981): in this
                                                          model, workers
 cheat by changing the terms of the contract (Type II), i.e., supplying

 less effort in "shirking", or
                                 stealing, while firms cheat by unilaterally

 terminating the contract (Type I). Some mention of worker quits is made

 (1981, p. 612, the reference to "slavery") but it is not treated formally,

 and Type II cheating by firms is not considered.

      The present model uses some of the notation and mechanics of Lazear's

model
                                                              ,   thus dealing
with the same kind of long—run
                                 contracts (where the issue is primarily
allocation of income over the life cycle rather than over states of nature

as in Azariadjg (1975), for example), albeit
                                                  in a very simple case where
there is no uncertainty. While the need for thi9 abstraction is unfortunate,

it allows us to increase the generality of the model in other directions

and make it truly symmetrical while
                                      keeping it tractable, and even heli,s
to make the basic intuition regarding how
                                              malfeasance affects contract
structure more apparent.

                                                                     interesting

        More formally, the structure of the model is outlined
                                                              below in three

  constraint are introduced.
                                 Second, the constraints that all four kinds of
 malfeasance place on the structure of the optimal
                                                   contract are developed
 in turn, and finally the
                          competitive labor market context of the model is
 discussed.

 be true that, throughout the
                              contract period, firms and workers both expect
 to do better during the remainder
                                   of the contract within the firm than they
 can do by leaving it. Formally this
                                      means the contract must satisfy:

 utility units) that workers are able to

                             second, PVW(.) is strictly decreasing in (.)
 because a higher minimum profit
                                   level reduces the present value of utility
achievable from t to T in two ways ——
                                         both directly because of the higher
profits over the whole

duality implies PVJr {Pvw         (H)} = H   and thus by the monotonicity of PVW

      The optimal contract problem as
                                         techniques, but a simple transformation
 to standard dynamic optimization
                                                                       calculus of
 of variables suffices to turn it into a fairly conventional
                                              To do so, we define four state
 variations problem with constraints.
                                                                       values at
 variables —— p, '   , q and c4    ——
                                        equal to the remaining present
                                    disutility of effort, output, and wages,
  time t of utility of income,

  respectively. Thus we have:

                      v(t)          ;TU(.T) e_ÔTdT


                                  1t1T1              eTdt                           -




                      v(t)    —              v(t)
                                     a(t)                                           (12)

            First, when neither firm
                                     nor worker_cheating constraints are binding
   (Af   =,     = 0), the optimum
                                  contract is given by:

  Equation (28) can be written
                                            directly in terms of h using the inverse

 We call this the first—best

                                                              designing contracts. In this
 contract the wage profile is
                                        totally independent of the

                                                 more than workers and

 degree of absolute risk
                         aversion of workers. The first—best effort
 profile is more likely to be
                              rising if workers discount the future more
 than firms (&-r)>o, will tend to be rising in

 value leisure increasingly (- <9).
                                    The variation of effort over the life
 cycle diminishes as Q becomes
                               more concave and V becomes more convex (i.e.,
as it becomes more desirable

independent of the income profile.

  1. Effect of Unionism on Parameters

       Unionism can concievably have
                                       many different impacts on the components
  of the
                      parameters K and K          in our model. These include:
                                 w      f
 unions' effects on whether the
                                   constraints embodying threats or the
 others which assume passive
                                responses to malfeasance are operative, their
 effects on overall rents to being in the firm, and finally
                                                            some probably
 less—important factors that have been
                                         mentioned elsewhere in the literature.
 We discuss these in turn below.

 (a) are threats

      We propose as a working
                                hypothesis that, while any firm of a reasonable
 size is likely to have access to threats over malfeasant
                                                              workers, it is
only in unions where workers can enforce
                                            credible threats over firms. The
main reason for this is simply that the ex
                                                     bargaining game that occurs
because of the bilateral
                         monopoly situation within contracts is played many
times by a typical finn but
                            only once by a typical worker: To prevent
worker shirking, firms can make    'examp1es'   of malfeasant workers through
disciplinary dismissals and still gain in the long run because they acquire

a reputation for doing so
                            among their own labor force. To prevent workers

making all—or—nothing wage demands,f inns can categorically refuse to make

individual wage bargains, thus for example attaching wages to jobs, not

                                          —23—




     the previous hypothesis. For one, Freeman (1981) has suggested that

 unions help to realize important scale economies in the provision of

 information regarding employer compliance with complex contract provisions.

 This only strengthens our notion that unions lower Kf due to an

 ability to discipline the employer. Also, Lazear (1981) has suggested that

 unions, again unlike individual workers but like
                                                      firms, may acquire with
 their longer lifespans a reputation for delivering labor services of a

 certain quality. If unions do tend to screen and police their own members

 in this way, it reinforces the conclusion that union overall wage effects

 are likely to lower K. Finally a third factor has been commented on that

 does not fit with our proposition that unions lower both K and
                                                                Kf ——        this
 is the notion that unions
                             may interfere with firms' ability to make genuine

disciplinary dismissals, which is a factor that will tend to raise Kw in

unions. We shall not include this in
                                           our maintained hypothesis here, noting
that it would have to outweigh the two other negative effects on K ——

especially    the greater loss should a dismissal occur ——   to   make a difference,

and if this is actually true, it will become apparent when the present

example's predictions are compared with the evidence.
2.          tions of the Example and Derivation of First—Best Contracts

        To make it easy to characterize the shape of first—best contracts, let

us make the convenient assumption that utility,

and (29) no longer depend on w and h respectively but only on t, and the

optimal wage profile is linear, To further simplify

       Figure l(c) shows how second—best contracts are likely to deviate

  from first—best contracts by indicating where the first—best contract

 violates the malfeasance constraints.
                                           It shows roughly what the first—

 best path of remaining present value of utility will look like (derived

 from Figure l(a) by first depicting the
                                            instantaneous utility stream it
 implies——Figure l(b)——and then taking present values) and indicates it is

 likely to violate worker malfeasance constraints
                                                    (directly from equation
 (7) or (9)) near the ginning of the contract, and firm malfeasance con-

 straints (derived by putting the minimum PV rr levels in (8) or (10) into

 the indirect utility function PVW(.)) near the end of the contract.

      What does this mean? Near the end of the contract, workers' produc-

 tivity is low and falling, and it is optimal to utilize them less without

 lowering their compensation, But this means the remaining profits from

employing the worker are low and probably negative, so firms will cheat.

Second—best contracts will compensate for this by lowering ' and raising 1i

from their first—best levels, as is indicated when Af is positive in

(25) and (26), In other words, secondbest contracts underpay and overwork

older workers in order to reduce firms' incentives to break those contracts.

Near the start of the contract, workers should have already received an

"advance" on their future productivity in first—best contracts and now face

a period where their productivity and effort levels rise but their compen-

sation remains flat. But this means ex post utility is relatively low, so

workers will cheat. Second—best contracts compensate for this by raising

  and lowering ii of younger workers, as a positive Aw in (25) and (26)

indicates. Thus, second—best contracts give young workers less of an

"advance" on their future productivity (in other jargon, pay for a smaller
