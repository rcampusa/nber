       The paper emphaairea rhe role of institurions and inrentivea in rhe

  presence of exrernalitiea. An economy dith multiple public decision makers

  is likely to experience 'overspending," "undertaxing," "overborrowing," and

  "overinflation" unless effective inaciturions exiat for overcoming

  coordination failure. ixternal financing may weaken incentives for

  adjustment over the longer run unless assistance is made conditional on

  fundamental institutional reforms. The paper alan analyses reforma that

  strengthen            to provide effort. Uncertainty regarding future taxea
  seduces present   effort and the responsiveness of output to market signals.

  In addition, the paper addresses the adverse effects of bank insurance and

  soft budget constraints,

      Much attention Is currently being focused on marker-oriented reform

crograms for plsnned economies. In msny respects, the msin issues sre

ai,silor to those tbsc srise in designing adjustment progrsms fur economies

rbsr are market oriented to begin with. Although the difficulties that

programs must be designed to address vary considerably among countries and

change ever time, the successes and shortcomings of programs that have

already been implemented provide many general lessons. 1/

      The main body of the paper is divided into four sections,

Section' II addresses negative externalities associated with multiple

public decision makers (e.g., different ministries or regional

eurhuriries), It is shovn that, in the absence of effective institutional

systems in which tax rates are subject to agent-specific uncertainty. It

also suggests that effort and output are enhanced by credible fiscal

leadership that reduces the general level of uncertainty regarding future

taxes.

     Section '7 analyzes the implicationa of aocial "insurance (in

whatever iotm, explicit or implicit) for the behavior of banks and other

firma. The analyaia of banks illustrates that insurance can have adverse

implicationa both for the quality of the investment projecta that banks

finance and for inflation. The analysis of atate-inaured firma

illustrates that soft budget constraints can have adverse implications for

the efficient uae of reaourcea and fom the wage-price apical. These

perepectivea provide an argument for allowing banks and other firma to

foil, end for promoting a competitive environment in which the aize and

political influence of individual enterprises does not pmeclude the

poaaibility of allowing them to fail. This does not deny argumenta for

providing an adequate social safety net, but it does auggeat that aocial

aafety nets can provide counterproductive incentivea if they ace not

designed   carefully.
           Section VI provides concluding remarks.

                 II.    Sxtecnalities Associated with Multiple
                               Public Decision Makers

     One of the moat formidable tasks in designing a reform program, in

many cases, is the challenge of changing the behavior of the public

aector. The challenge can be particularly difficult when control over

public apending, or over money and credit expansion, is aptead among

nuxoeroua decision makers representing different regions of the country or

different miniatciea of the central government. It is widely acknowledged

that lack of centralized control over public deficits -and money and credit

expansion can undermine an adjustment program, but it mutt also be

acknowledged that political realities generally limit the scope for
 diluting the powers of eetablished ministries and regional authorities.

 In this oontext, it   is   essential to teoognite that the rase for puhlio

seotor rafora is basad on negative externalitiee transmitted through rhe

 inflation prooess, and that suoh externalities hold out the prospaot of

actdaspread benefits froa suooessful reforms. The undetlying problem ia

irherantlu a amtter of "ooordination failure." j/

Accordingly,             by combining conditions (l)-(4), each minister's utility

 ],./    The negative marginal utility of inflation may reflect either the

decision       maker's sensitivity to the attitudes of his constituents        or an

environment          (see Aizenman (lESEa)) in which real spending levels are
eroded by inflation.

could be undermined by incentives to cheer. Other epprcachee tc demling

with the cccrdinericn failure involve legal frameworks and penalty

mechaniama for constraining the amount of spending that miniatera can

finance. For example, the apending limira of cabinet ministers might be

apecified through a centralized appropriations proceas, while apending by

regional governmenta might be restricted (relative to tax revenues) by

constitutional law. To the extent that legal frameworka often develop

loopholes, moreover, a strong central bank can play an important role by

refusing to monetize fiscal deficits,

2.      oreenerslframework
        The previous example, of course, is draatically oversimplified in

many respects. The inflationary impact of government spending generally

stems primarily from spending in excess of tax revenues; government

deficits era often financed on credit rather than through direct money

creation; and the links between fiscal deficita and inflation may be quite

complex.

       Accordingly, it is worth noting that the same basic framework applies

to cases in which the coordination fsilute involves inadequate collection

of tax revenues (Ti) by different regional authorities tether than

excessive spending levels (Of) .   1/   Moreover, the framework extends to

 noncooperative equilibrium to the collectively optimal outcome. The

 challenge in practice, of course, is to find a politically acceptable

 mechanism. There is a large body of collected wisdom on the    strengths end
 weaknesses of different types of institutional arrangements, and on

 certain issues- -such as the importance of imposing hard budget   constraints

 on fiscal authorities and establishing strong central control over    money
 and credit expansion--there is a strong consensus of opinion. In general,

 however, we view the challenge of establishing institutional
                                                                errangements
 to overcome coordination failure as a challenge to which different

countries are likely to find different solutions, given the different

institutional arrangements end political considerations from which     they
start. Accordingly, the formulation of mechanisms for overcoming

coordination failure is largely e country-specific task end is beyond the

scope of this paper.

     A positive general theory of the requirements for overcoming

coordination failure is also beyond the scope of this paper. The

eppecling approach to developing such e theory is to focus on the

strategies that individual decision makers can employ in maneuvering for

larger oheres of the aggregate gain. The role of delay tactics hms been

emphesiced in this context, 1/

     An appealing hypothesis, however--even in the absence of e positive

theory--is that the incentive to overcome coordination failure is

positively related to the aggregate gain that con be echieved. An

increase in the aggregate benefits foregone (or coors incurred) by not

overcoming   coordination failure is likely to limit the extent to which
individual   decision makers maneuver fot s rote favorable distribution of

the benefits (or costs)       This hypothesis is consistent with the view that

it often takes a crisis to catalyze fundamental institutional reforms,


                III. External Resources and Incentives to Reform

       The previous discussion and analytic framework leads naturally to the

issue of how the availability of external resources affects the strength

ci a counttys incentives to undertake reforms.

       The impetus for a reform program or a growth-oriented adjustment

urogtam typically aaetqea from a state of general economic turmoil,

Oounttiea In need of effective progrmmm are often saddled with heuvy

extetnal d0b t   butdens   and, in any case are typically in need uf external

resoutce a for balance of payments financing. In the context of the

evolving debt strategy, there is a broad consensus that effective

adjustment requires both strong domestic policies and external resources--

as essential complereents- -along with an external environment that suppotte

the efforte of the adjusting country to strengthen its export revenues. 1/

A view ham also emerged that problem countries are trapped in a "bad

equilibrium," and that a successful transition to a "good equilibrium"

with attractive prospects for growth requires an adjustment effort- - in

terms, implicitly, of both policy actions and external resources--that Is

sufficient in scale to preclude confidence failures ./     or   credibility

crises. 1/

                                   - 12   -




       These views are virtually indisputable, but there is an important

 caveat: namely, that the prevision of externel resources can conceivably

 reduce the pressures for a counrry to underreke strong policy acrions,

 thereby putting at risk both the prospects for growth end the country's

ability to eventually repay its creditors. This caveat has been the basis

for the evolving practice of "conditionality," whereby the manner it which

external resources are provided over time is linked to the credibility of

polity intentions and the achievement of agreed performance criteria. 1/

A central question in the theory of conditionality is the extent to which

performance criteria ought to be specified in terms of the implementation

of fundamental institutional reforms, rather than simply in terms of

traditional quantitative performance indicators. /


  1/   The "theory and practice of conditionality" will undoubtedly be

affected in the period ahead by the success of the reform program

launched in Poland at the beginning of the year.   In particular, the

experience in Poland is likely to provide important perspectives on the

wisdom of a "trash program" in which reforms are introduced fairly

rapidly, rather than phased in gradually over time.

  2/ See Cuitidn (1981) for a discussion of the principles and practices

of International Monetary Fund conditionality as of the early lSPOa.       In

recant years, there has been a growing awareness within the Fund that

"structural weaknesses" impede the effectiveness of macroeconomic

policies, and that in many cases, successful adjustment requires that

"structural measures" be implemented at an early stage of the adjustment

program.

       In       this section, we extend the framework from Section II to analyze

how the availability of external resourcea affects incentives to

undertake fundamental reforms. We thus continue to focus on the negative

inflation externalities associated with multiple public decision makers

(e.g. ,     the authorities of different regions of the country) and the
potential gains from institutional reforms to deal effectively with a

situation of "coordination failure."

       The first step is to characterize the relationship between the rate

of inflation and the level of external resources (F). We view F as the

net transfer of external resources to the government, such that the fiscal

ceficit is G-T-F. This sakea it natural to assume

                                                 3m
                 it   = m(GT-E);
                                              3(0-I-F)
                                                           >0

It    is convenient to focus simply on the spending side of the coordination
problem; accordingly, we assume that tax revenues (I) are collected at the
national         level, and for the symmetric case in which the n regional

spending authorities are all alike, we represent the inflation process as.

                 it      m(n01-T-F)
As before, the utility index for the authorities of region i is written as

 and yields the utility level

            v0(T+F)       Ui(0P,m(n0.-T.F))



     The difference between v0 and pN provides a measure of the gain from

adapting institutional reforms that successfully address the coordination

 iailure and induce the individual authorities to lower their spending

levels from 0 to oH         Alternatively,          v0 -   measures the cost of

coordination failure. As in the analysis of the stability of a cartel, we

presume that higher coordination failure costs will enhance the prospects

of imposing the discipline needed to reach the cooperative equilibrium.

Similarly, if the cooperative equilibrium has already been reached, a

hegher cost of coordination failure will reduce the temptation to behave

noncooperatively.

     Another useful measure of the stability of the cooperative

equilibrium is the amount that an individual decision maker would gain if

he were the only one to move away from the equilibriuss. This measure of

the marp.inal temptation to deviate from the cooperative equilibrium is the

difference between the marginal benefit and the perceived marginal cost of

higher fiscal expenditure G evaluated at the cooperative equilibrium. As

represented on Figure 1, this is rhe vertical difference between a and b0.

     We investigate the dependency of each of these two measures on the

volume of external resources. A key result developed in the Appendix is

that a larger volume of external resources will increase the gain from

overcoming     coordination failure and reduce the temptation to deviate from
the   cooperative equilibrium. This reault has eeveral important

implications. First, it emphasizes that the provision of external

resouroes oan have two effects; in addition to allowing a oountmy to

increase its absorption in the absence of coordination, extetnal

resources can play a catalytic role in overcoming coordination failure.

Second, by also emphasizing that the temptation to deviate from the

cooperative equilibrium may strengthen after the transfer of external

teanurces has taken place end debt-servicing obligations come due, it

auggests that the full benefits of external resources are unlikely to be

.achieved unless the provision of external resources is made conditional on

adjustment measures and/or institutional reforms that ate capable of

cvecccming cootbination feilute on a lasting baaia.

 coordination failure and improving the prospects of aoving to the

 cooperative outcome. In the future, however, this effect may be mote than

 tavarsad if the inflow of external resources ends and an outward net

 resource transfer is required to servics rho- -2xrarnal debt

      In considering the possible implications for the future, however, it

is essential to recognize that new external resources provided             today not

only have affects on future debr-sarvicing requirements but also hava

affects on future output, tax revenues, and dabr-servicing capacity. More

formally, suppose chat tax revenue (T) aquals rY, where r is the            average

Tha first term on the right-hand side measures the effect on future tax

revenue while the second term measures the negative effect on the future

transfer of extarnal resources due to increased external debt. An

important role of conditionality is to ensure that the bulk of foreign

resources are used to finance investment instead of fiscal consumption.

This will increase future tax revenue and, if the investment is productive

enough, the first term will dominate the second. In this case, the

provision of foreign resources today will raise the cost of coordination

          IV. K-Efficiency end Approaches to Raising Public Revenues

      The     previous sections of the paper have iccused on the improvements
in economic conditions that can be achieved by overcoming coordination
failure in the presence of negative inflation excernslities. Another
major suurce of improvemenr in economic conditions is the potential for
raising producrive efficiency.
      gnllnwing     Leibensrein (l9gG) , mn       important disrinctinn has been drawn
between     eilocsrive efficiency end "x-efficiency," where x-efficiency is

relsted to motivation, incentives, and other nunsllocative considerations.

The   movement to e market-based price system can provide important gains in
rerrs    of allocstive efficiency, while the movement to s system in which

managers and nonmanageriel workers hmve strong economic incenrives to

increase productivity can achieve substantial gains in terms of

x-sfficiency.

1.    A simple exampig

        The   following model illustrates the nature of the x-efficiency gains
that csn be schieved by moving sway from a system in which the governirent
claims rho entire surplus of enterprise revenues over costs to a system
in which enterprise managers (or nonmsnagerisl workers) ore ullnwed to

of siloosoive affioianoy, assmse a ona-good aodal in whiob output (Y) ia

output. In tha antrepoaneurial aeoror, the labor requioaaanr par unit of

output is 1-f(s). Thus, if the aggragata supply of labor and ohs number

of entrepreneurs are denoted as b sod N, respeotively. and if eaoh

entrepreneur produoes Q        units   of output, employment in the entrepreneurial

seotor (L5) oan be written as

negatively on effort and positively on iooome (s):

a profound trnnaformation of the Chinese economy, with real CHP growth

averaging close to 10 percent per year over the 1978-88 period. These

incentives were not introduced through the tax system per ad, but rather

through a series of reforms in rural areas beginning in rhe late 1970a

(including incentives introduced through the household responatbiiiry

system) and in urban areas beginning in 1984 (including managerial

incentives   introduced through the contract responsibility ayoraa) see
Blajer and Saapary (1989). Unfortunately, in the lace i98Ua, China
experienced a deteriorating fiscal poaition and rapid inflation in the
context of a relatively low-income elasticity of tax revenues and
insufficiently a::rong central control over money and credit

 in   the tax rare could induce a higher level of effort, which nor only

would raise the after-tax incomes of managers, but also could    generate
higher tax revenue, As the figure is drawn (holding the wage bill fixed),

any tax rots in the range between to and t1 would provide at least g,,, in

tax revenue while allowing managers to enjoy incomes higher than at to.

2.        Intertemporal considerations and uncertainty

          Although lump sum taxation aay appear to be an optimal system based

on the previous example, the experience of setting enterprise-speciiic tax

rates or "effective tax" tacea has led, in some countries, to petverae

incentives over time. L'             Such perversity can arise ii enterprises come to

believe that their lump sum tax asseasmenta in iatura periods will reflect

their profitability in the currant period. Moreover, uncertainty about

future tax rates can have a depressing effect on the level of effort

expended by enttepraneuts. While the influence of pulity uncertainty on

incomes of both managers and labor, which is equivalent to a value-added

tax. Siven a target for total tax revenue (R0), the shift to a value-

added tax from a proportional tax on managerial income alone would involve

a reduction in the tax rota on managerial income, thereby inducing a

higher      level of aggregate output in our example. The output gain would be
achieved, however, through a radio tribution of income away from non-
managerial labor, which might make it unreasonable to treat the supply ad
labor     as fixed.

Pijnbergen (1985)). rhe adverse effects of policy uncertainty on effort

deserve furrher exploration.

          These points are easily illustrated wirh a simple rvo-period example.

Suppose thar rho manager's afrer-tax inoome in period i can be represented

as

         (18)       s   =
                            (l+v)E - Tj
where               is effort, T1 is a lump sum tax, and s' is a productivity

parameter. Assume in eddirion that the second-period tax burden is linked

to the manager's net income in the first period according to

         (17) T2 = T1 + hs1

where h is a random variable with expected value P and variance Vsr(k)

Suppose also that the manager's utility index can be described us

  /       This       formulation should be viewed as a reduced form epprcximetion.

It is the exact reduced form for the case in which: (1) h follows a

normal (or a truncared normal) distribution; (2) the periodic utility is

   - For      this simple setup, it is easily shown that, whatever the outcome

for period I end the setting of the tax parameter h, the optimal amount of

effort to apply in period 2 is

         Figure   5 shows some implications. As indicated in the top panel,

effort exerted in period 1 depends negatively on the expected level of

    1.        Bank insurance

              A well-functioning system of financial intemmediation con subatan-

    function of financial intermediaries is to economice on the coats of

    evaluating investment projects (or borrowers' creditworthiness) cx onte

    ex post. A second important function of intermediaries is to tcoooform

    the combinations of liquidity, yield, and rtok thor ore ovoilohlo to

    savers--and, in particular, to make it icoothie for large investment

    projects with long gestation periods to ho financed by individuals with

    small amounts of savings that they want to keep liquid.

              The following example illustrstes the importance of the information-

    gathering role of financial intermediaries and emphosires that insurance


         j/ This problem is shared by all types of economies; a dronotic recent

    example is the case of the savings and loan industry in the United

    States.

         21    In   Yugoslavia, financial discipline until recently was virtually

    nonexistent. Nonbenk enterprises enjoyed close ties with banks, and the

8   National Bank of Yugoslavia (prior to receiving new powers under

    legislation enacted in 1969) lacked authority to constrain the ccponoion

6   of bank credit.

 oars weaken incentives for intermediaries to evaluate investment projects

 effectively. Consider a simple financial system in which all

 intermediation is conducted by banks, and in which banks restrict their

 financial operations simply to accepting deposits from savers and making

 loans to investors. Under the assumption that the banking system is

competitive, each individual bank takes as given the interest oato it must

pay on deposits (°D) and the interest rate it tan charge on locus (ri)

      In the absence of insurance, the bank's profits daueud ossenrially on

the performance of irs loan portfolio. The bank selects isa portfolio

from the applications it receives for loans to finance a number of

investment projects that differ in terms of riskiness, got purposes of

simplification, it is assumed that investment projects either fail

completely, in which case the bank receives no loan payments, or ejae

succeed in generating aufficient income to meet the full amount of the

contrersual loan payments. Let        denote the failure probability ft's

The bank's expected profit rate (per unit deposit) can be expressed as

     (2i)      Rg   (l+r)(l-p) -   (l+rD)   -   x   rL-rD-(l+rL)px
where p is the average failure rate on the bank's portfolio of loans

woiald thus introduce negative externalities via the erosion of the public

budget

     The example, of course, has been designed to emphasize that insurance

schemes can have undesirable consequences when introduced in ways that

have adverse effects on incentives. In concept, insurance can be

introduced in ways that leave banks motivated to maintain low-risk loan

portfolios (e.g., insurance fees and payoffs can be based on the riskiness

of bank portfolios) and capitalization requirements con be introduced to

counter the adverse selection incentives of investors by forcing them to

share the losses when investment projects fail. In practice, however

public insurance against bank foilures-whether explicir or ir,plicir--hoo

often resulted in large losses for public budgets to absorb.

2.   Soft budzet constraints

     Insurance against bank failures is only one of many mechanisms

through which public sectors provide implicit or explicit insurance to

enterprises and thereby distort incentives of enterprise ronogers. The

bank insurance example has emphasized that insurance against failure can

undermine the motivation to evaluate investment decisions appropriately.

It is equally clear that implicit insurance against the failure of any

production unit can undermine incentives to minimize costs .Asfornsi


proportional to the gap between the realized failure rate and the average

failure rate in the pre-insuranca regime: (l+rL)(jl-po). This loss to

the public treasury would be reflected in higher incomes of private sector

borrowers, whose average return on investment projects (after compensating

banks for the insurance fee f) would be s-cT +   (lark) (l-o)

(19.79) has emphasized in coining the term "soft hudget constraint." firms

have weak incentives to use resources appropriately when choir losses are

disguised or compensated for by subsidies, favorable tax conditions, or

bail-out credits. An environment of soft budget constraints, furthermore,

is a ripe breeding ground for the wage-price spiral, as enterprise

managers grant wage demands with little resistance and either psss nn rho

higher wages directly into higher prices or finance them through a larger
drain on the public budget, which fuels the inflation protess indirentlj.
     The undesirable implications of soft budget constraints prnnide en
argument for allowing banks and other firms to fail. The- tFteet nf
failure must be credible, moreover, to morivate enterprise osnegers
appropriately.   This argues for promoting a competitive environment in

which the size and political influence of individual enterprises does not

preclude the possibility of allowing them to fail.


                          VI. c1u4Themarks
     This paper has focused on several basic issues that arise in the

design of reform programs for planned economies and growth-ocienrad

adjustment programs more generally.

     A crucial ingredient for successful program design is to hasp clearly

focused on the sources of large potential gains in output and price

stability, and to design institutional changes carefully to rssp chess

potential gains. From this perspective, cbs issues discussed in this

paper have emphasized the importance of two types of reforms:

(1) institutional changes aimed at addressing coordinstion fsilnrss snd

soft budget constraints in the presence of negative inflation externeli-
                                    -34-


ties feeding through public budget deficits; snd (2) reforms simed at

strengthening incentives to provide effort.

     In developing simple analytic fcaaeworks to address tha case fcc

institutional reforms, the paper has suggested several extensions of the

literature. The model of negative extecnalities associated with multiple

public decisions makecs builds on Aizesosan (lPSla) in pcoviding insights

into the biases toward 'overspending," "undertaxing," "overborrowing," and

"overinflating." gffectiva acccon to overcome these biases- -which we view

largely   as a matter of overcoming coordination failure-- coy require
different types of institutional changes in different countcces, but is
widely regarded as critical to the success of odjuatmeut oud reform
programs.
     The framework of multiple decision askers has been extended to

analyze how the availability of external resources affects a country's

incentives to carry through en its adjustment efforts, suggesting that on

infusion of external resources increases the short-run gains frost

overcoming   coordination failure but may weaken incentives for adjustmsnt
and reform over the longer run. This result provides an argument for
making externsl finencing conditional on fundamental institutional reforms
thst are capable of overcoming coordination failure on a lasting basis.
     Finslly, the model of the adverse effects of uncertainty regarding
future taxes on the present level of effort--and on the responsiveness of
output    to productivity developments and other macket signals--represents,

to our knowledge, e new direction in the formal literature and an

important parallel to existing literature on the adverse effects of policy

uncertainty on investment.
