How Sticky is Retirement Behavior in the U.S.? Responses to Changes in the Full Retirement

                                          ABSTRACT

We study how increases in the Social Security full retirement age (FRA) affect benefit claiming
and retirement behavior, and specifically the interaction between these two choices. Using Social
Security administrative data, we implement complementary research designs of a traditional
cohort analysis and a regression-discontinuity design. We find that while increases in the FRA
strongly and immediately shift claiming ages, retirement ages exhibit persistent "stickiness" at the
old FRA of 65. We use several strategies to explore the likely mechanisms behind the stickiness
in retirement, and we find suggestive evidence of a role for employers in individuals' responses to
the FRA.

               C. Claiming by Earnings Quartile                               D. Claiming by Gender




Notes: These figures plot claiming of Social Security retirement benefits by age, for different pre-reform and post-
reform cohorts. Claiming at a given age is defined as starting to collect Social Security benefits at that age; that is, it
is an indicator variable that is assigned the value 1 if an individual has positive benefits in a given period and no
benefits in the previous period. Panel A aggregates behavior by age at the annual level. Panel B breaks it down to ages
at the monthly level, and it also provides a breakdown by specific birth cohorts. Months prior to age 62 are dropped
due to small cell sizes (and the corresponding data reporting rules). Panel C splits the sample by earnings quartiles
based on an average over ages 25-55, and panel D splits the sample by gender.

Notes: These figures plot retirement rates by age, for different pre-reform and post-reform cohorts. Retirement at a
given age is defined by an indicator variable that is assigned the value 1 if an individual has positive earnings in a
current period but no earnings in the next period. Panel A plots retirement rates using this measure, and panel C uses
an alternative definition based on an indicator variable that is assigned the value 1 if a given age is the last data period
in which an individual has positive earnings in a current period but no earnings in the next period. Panel B exploits
exact dates of birth to construct monthly-level ages based on an individual's age at the end of the calendar year. Panel
D splits the sample by earnings quartiles based on an average over ages 25-55, and panel E splits the sample by gender.
Panel F plots retirement rates by age for a range of pre-reform and post-reform cohorts.

Notes: These figures plot cumulative distributions for Social Security benefit claiming and labor force participation
by age. Panel A compares a pre-reform cohort (1937 with FRA 65) to a post-reform cohort (1943 with FRA 66).
Panels B and C extend the analysis to encompass a range of cohorts--pre-reform cohorts (1935-1937 with FRA 65),
phase-in cohorts (1938-1942 with increasing FRA at 2-month increments per cohort), and post-reform cohorts (1943-
1945 with FRA 66)--for claiming and labor force participation, respectively.

            C. Earnings at Year Turned 65                          D. Earnings at Year Turned 66




Notes: These figures leverage the 2-month increments in FRA around the January 2 nd birthdate cutoff to study its
effects on Social Security benefit claiming and earnings using a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design. Panels A-B
display claiming outcomes, and panels C-D display labor supply outcomes. Earnings at a given age are reported for
the calendar year at which affected individuals above the cutoff reached that age.

 Notes: These tables display regression estimates based on specification (2) which leverages movers designs across geographical
 locations (panel A) and employers (panel B). The equation's right-hand side variables, indicated in the left-most column, are defined
 per specification and with respect to the studied outcome. For example, when studying the outcome "claiming at age 65" for our
 sample of movers, the variable "destination rate" refers to the rate at which individuals in the destination unit start claiming at age
 65. Baseline "rates" are calculated using pre-reform cohorts, and "change in rates" are calculated using the difference between the
 behavior of post-reform cohorts and pre-reform cohorts. All rates are calculated using non-movers only and are measured in
 percentage points. For each outcome, we run two specifications which correspond to the two respective columns: the first
 specification studies variation in the destination and includes fixed effects for origin; and the second specification replaces these
 fixed effects with continuous measures for origin rates and a constant term. Standard errors clustered at the origin level are reported
 in parentheses. *p<0.1; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01

Note: This figure plots the annuity amount, in terms of percent out of the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA), against
claiming age. It provides the schedule for pre-reform cohorts whose FRA is 65 (those born in 1937 or earlier) and for
the post-reform cohorts whose FRA is 66 (cohorts 1943-1954).

Notes: This table reports the correlation between our workplace-level employee behaviors and an indicator for whether the
employer's benefit plans cover retirees. This indicator is based on Form 5500 called "Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit
Plan (With 100 or more participants)" from the years 1992-1998. The U.S. Department of Labor, Internal Revenue Service, and the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation jointly developed the Form 5500 Series for employee benefit plans to utilize in order to satisfy
annual reporting requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue
Code. ERISA is a federal law that sets minimum standards for most voluntarily established retirement and health plans in private
industry to provide protection for individuals in these plans, and it requires plans to provide participants with plan
information including important information about plan features and funding (see www.dol.gov for more details). Our indicator for
provision of retiree benefits is based on `Box 7b' which documents the number of "Retired or separated participants receiving
benefits." The instructions for filling this box indicate: "7b. Inactive participants receiving benefits are any individuals who are
retired or separated from employment covered by the plan and who are receiving benefits under the plan. This includes former
employees who are receiving group health continuation coverage benefits pursuant to Part 6 of ERISA who are covered by the
employee welfare benefit plan." The table reports the coefficients from regressions that include as controls other plan characteristics
reported on From 5500, specifically, whether the employer offers a defined benefit or defined contribution pension plan, whether
some of those covered by the plan are members of a collective bargaining unit, the number of employees and the number of covered
employees, the plan's average of net assets, average annual amounts of overall contributions to the plan and of employer
contributions to the plan, and whether a plan was terminated. The sample includes all EINs for which there was a match across our
SSA data and the publicly available datasets from Form 5500. *p<0.1; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01
