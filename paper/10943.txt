The information created and disseminated through the litigation process can have social value.

Suppose a long-lived plaintiff is suing a defendant for damages sustained in an accident. The plaintiff

may suffer similar damages in future accidents involving different defendants. Potential injurers

update their beliefs after observing the first case and subsequently fine-tune their precautions to

avoid accidents. The joint incentive of the plaintiff and the first defendant to create public

information through litigation is too small. The optimal liability rule trades off providing future

injurers with incentives to take precautions and providing the plaintiff with incentives to create

information.

The information created and disseminated through the litigation process can have social value.
Suppose a long-lived plaintiff is suing a defendant for damages sustained in an accident. The
plaintiff may suffer similar damages in future accidents involving different defendants.
Potential injurers update their beliefs after observing the first case and subsequently fine-tune
their precautions to avoid accidents. The joint incentive of the plaintiff and the first
defendant to create public information through litigation is too small. The optimal liability
rule trades off providing future injurers with incentives to take precautions and providing the
plaintiff with incentives to create information.



1.    Introduction

        In 1989, the Exxon Valdez ran aground off the coast of Alaska and spilling some 11

million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound. The spill affected approximately

1,500 miles of Alaska's coastline killing billions of salmon, on order of a million seabirds,

thousands of otters, and hundreds of bald eagles.2 Exxon paid about $2.5 billion to cover the

two years of cleanup efforts. After investigations to assess the value of the environmental

damages themselves, Exxon settled in 1991 with the state of Alaska for $1 billion. The

settlement also included a so-called "reopener clause" that allowed the government to seek an

additional $100 million in the future if new damages were discovered within a decade.3

         This paper argues that the accurate determination of damages -- even those that may

become known years later -- provides those engaging in similar risky activities with valuable

information for future decision-making. This point is of course not unique to environmental

damages. Manufacturer liability and litigation for product-related harms does more than

simply provide manufacturers with better incentives to design safer products and disclose

known product risks to consumers. The litigation process is also a mechanism for creating

and disseminating information about these risks. The information that is made public through

litigation puts both product users and other manufacturers in a better position to take

precautions to mitigate their future risks.4

         Formally, this paper considers a simple framework where a single plaintiff faces a

sequence of defendants. 5          The first accident has already occurred, while the accidents

involving future defendants have not. The accidents are similar in the sense that the plaintiff's

damages from the accidents are positively correlated. Litigation is socially valuable in this

setting because pretrial investigations and trials provide information about accident risks to the

future defendants. The future defendants can then fine tune their precautions to avoid future

injuries. We ask several questions. First, is the plaintiff's decision to litigate the first case

socially efficient? Second, how might liability rules be adjusted in light of a divergence?

Finally, does the presence of asymmetric information change these answers?

          We first consider a case where the plaintiff and the defendants are symmetrically

uninformed about the damages from an accident. In the Exxon Valdez case, it was not

  Individuals who have been exposed to asbestos, for example, can reduce the chance of developing severe
asbestos-related illnesses by avoiding cigarettes and dust.
5
  The analogous case of a single defendant facing a sequence of plaintiffs was considered in an earlier version of
this manuscript, HUA AND SPIER [2003].

                                                        2
initially clear how high the environmental damages were. Careful investigations before the

trial allowed the litigants to more accurately pinpoint the damages that arise from oil spills. If

there is no possibility of a similar case arising in the future then the first case will surely settle

-- there is no sense spending money to determine the precise level of damages when a quick

settlement can be obtained at the expected damage level. When similar cases may arise in the

future, however, then settlement negotiations could fail. In particular, the long-lived plaintiff

can benefit from the effect that the information from the first trial has on the future defendants'

precautions. 6       The plaintiff's incentive to generate information is not socially efficient,

however, since the future defendants typically capture some of the social benefit of increased

information.

           The symmetric information case also gives us insights into the design of liability rules.

Taking the plaintiff's decision to settle or litigate the first case as fixed, the efficient liability

rule puts 100% responsibility on the player who needs to be given incentives for care -- the

future defendants in our example. But the plaintiff's settlement decision is endogenous and

hinges on the liability rule. When the plaintiff bears no responsibility for his own damages he

captures none of the information value and will therefore prefer to settle the first case. To put

it somewhat differently, putting 100% responsibility on the defendants will chill the flow of

information. The optimal liability rule will balance the need to provide defendants with

appropriate incentives and the need to create public information and will often feature shared

responsibility for accident harms.




6
  Although our stylized model has the information appearing in the courtroom, much of it is discovered through pretrial
investigations. An open settlement following pretrial discovery potentially reveals information to the public as well.

                                                             3
          These results may change when the plaintiff and the first defendant are

asymmetrically informed about the damages.                   Suppose that the plaintiff has private

information about the damages he has sustained and the first defendant can make a single

take-or-or-leave-it offer before trial.        Bargaining failures arise in equilibrium: when the

plaintiff's damages are sufficiently high the plaintiff will reject the defendant's offer and go to

trial where litigation costs are incurred.7 In short, value is destroyed as the litigants engage in

rent-seeking activities and take tough bargaining stances in an attempt to grab a greater share of

the bargaining surplus. When the plaintiff's long-run value from information disclosure is

small then the equilibrium level of litigation activity is socially excessive.

        These results do not imply that the litigation process is the only way -- or necessarily

the best way -- of disseminating information about harmful activities to the public. First,

responsibility for investigations could be delegated to government agencies or public interest

groups. This is especially relevant for lawsuits involving only short-run litigants who have

no private stake in information disclosure. Second, private parties might prefer to operate

outside of the legal arena, investigating harm and disseminating this information to the public

without filing suit at all. The litigation process may have an advantage over these alternatives,

however, because it serves an "auditing role." The plaintiff in our model would like to inflate

the public's perception of damages in order to induce greater precautions and public interest

groups might exhibit similar tendencies. The adversarial process may mitigate bias and

create better incentives for information gathering (DEWATRIPOINT                    AND    TIROLE [1999]).

Furthermore, the oversight of a judge may help to accurately and credibly link the court award
7
   Although the framework with a take-it-or-leave-it offer, based on BEBCHUK [1984], seems extreme, the results
are actually more general. The bargaining environment features common values and any bargaining game will
lead to negotiation breakdowns with positive probability. See the mechanism-design model of SPIER [1994b].

                                                      4
(or court-approved settlement) with the true economic losses.

        This paper contributes to the large literature on settlement of litigation (see the surveys

of DAUGHETY [1999] and HAY             AND   SPIER [1998]. Although most of the early literature

focused on disputes between a single defendant and a single plaintiff -- often with asymmetric

information -- more recent papers have considered externalities among multiple litigants.8

Externalities can create strong incentives for parties to consolidate their claims (CHE [1996],

[2002] and SPIER [2002]). Public policies, such as precedent, also create externalities and

lead parties to adjust their settlement strategies (CHE            AND   YI [1993]). 9 DAUGHETY          AND


REINGANUM [1999], [2002] argue that confidential settlements are a way for the defendant to

keep information about the lawsuit a secret from future plaintiffs. In contrast, the plaintiff in

our model would like to publicize high damages to encourage greater precautions and avoid

being similarly harmed in the future. None of these papers consider the ex post incentive

effects identified here.

        Second, our paper adds a new twist to the debate over the social value of accuracy in

adjudication (see the survey by KAPLOW [1998]). KAPLOW AND SHAVELL [1996] have argued

that the accurate assessment of damages at trial can be valuable in creating better ex ante

incentives. If an injurer knows ex ante that his actions could lead to higher social losses -- and

that he will be held liable for the higher damages -- then he will take greater care to avoid the

accident. If, on the other hand, if the injurer lacks the knowledge that the social harm will be


8
     Even in the absence of private information, externalities can lead settlement negotiations to fail.
KORNHAUSER AND REVESZ [1994a], [1994b] look at multiple defendant lawsuits under joint and several liability,
focusing on the externalities in settlement decisions. SPIER [2003] looks at externalities between multiple
plaintiffs who are suing a potentially insolvent defendant. SPIER AND SYKES [1998] explore the externalities
between settling plaintiffs and debtholders.
9
  MILLER [1998] presents a survey, highlighting the conflict of interest between the plaintiffs and the (often
self-appointed) attorney.

                                                      5
unusually large (and cannot easily acquire the information) then accuracy has no social value.

Since the accurate determination of damages at trial is very costly, their argument goes, society

would be better served by policies where injurers are held responsible only for the damages that

they could have reasonably anticipated ex ante.10 This paper takes a different perspective:

accuracy in adjudication creates social value by informing future players about the risks

associated with their activities and creating better ex post incentives.

          Finally, this paper adds to the small but growing literature on the divergence between

the private and social incentives to litigate and settle lawsuits. SHAVELL (1997) argues that

the incentives of private parties to use the legal system typically diverge from what is best for

society as a whole. The resources wasted in litigation do not always have a corresponding

social benefit. Costs would be saved -- and the proper ex ante incentives maintained -- if the

parties settled for the "average" judgment instead.11 In contrast to the literature, this paper

takes a forward-looking perspective by arguing that early settlement can compromise the

future incentives of the players.

          The next section presents the general framework. The third section assumes that the

players are symmetrically uninformed about future damages and shows that the private

incentive to settle is stronger than the social incentive. The fourth section presents an

example where the plaintiff is initially privately informed about his damages at date 1, and

shows that the private incentive to settle may be either too weak or too strong. The final

section concludes.

10
    SPIER [1994a] argues that accuracy is valuable when ex ante care levels affect the level of damages, not just the
probability of an accident. KAPLOW AND SHAVELL [1994] consider the value of accuracy when the main issue at
trial is liability, not damages.
11
    Disagreements over liability, on the other hand, can create incentives to settle too often in the sense that
defendants will take too little care in anticipation of a future settlement (SPIER [1997]).

2. The Model

        There are N+1 players: a plaintiff (P) who has suffered harm, h , a current defendant

(D1) who has caused the harm, and a group of N − 1 future defendants (D2, D3, … DN) who

may harm the plaintiff at a future date. All players are risk-neutral. We assume that the

damages caused by the N defendants are perfectly correlated; in the event of an accident the

future defendants cause harm h as well.12 The damages are drawn from distribution f (h )

on [0, ∞) with mean h . We assume that [1 − F (h)] / f (h ) is strictly decreasing in h.13

Although this distribution is common knowledge, the realization of h is not observed. If

the plaintiff pursues litigation against the first defendant, however, then investigations will be

conducted and the true value of h will be accurately verified and publicly disclosed.

        In the event of an accident, the court will force the responsible defendant to pay

fraction    ∈ [0 ,1] of the plaintiff's damages. The parameter α , the "liability rule," is a choice

variable for a social planner who seeks to maximize social welfare. Trials are assumed to be

costly: the plaintiff's litigation cost is k P and the defendant's litigation cost is k D and we let

k represent the total litigation cost. The "American Rule" is in effect: each side bears its own

litigation costs.14

        The future defendants are fully aware of the existence of the first case and take careful

note of its disposition, including the precise value of h if the first case goes to trial. These

defendants also play an active role in preventing future accidents: Each future defendant Di,

12
   This simplifying assumption is not overly restrictive. The basic result would hold if damages were correlated
instead. If the defendants were irrational, however, and overreacted to information then clearly the value of
information would be compromised.
13
   This monotone hazard rate assumption is satisfied by many common distributions.
14
   Our basic results do not hinge on the cost allocation rule.

                                                       7
i=2,….N, makes non-verifiable precautions, xi, to reduce the probability of an accident.15

Formally, the probability that Di will cause an accident is                ( xi ) = 1 − xi and c(xi ) is Di's

associated cost of precautions. We assume that the cost function is strictly increasing and

convex and satisfies the following conditions: c(0 ) = 0 , c' (x ) = 0 , Lim c' (x ) = ∞ , and
                                                                                         x →1


c ′′′(x ) ≤ 0 .16

          The timing of the game is as follows. At date 1, P and D1 attempt to negotiate a

settlement. If negotiations succeed then the first round ends and if negotiations fail the first

case goes to trial where h is verified and publicly disclosed. D1 is forced to pay αh to the

plaintiff and the defendant and plaintiff bear litigation costs kd and kp, respectively. At date 2

the future defendants choose their precautions. Accidents subsequently occur as described

above and the plaintiff and the responsible defendant engage in settlement negotiations. If

negotiations fail the case goes to trial where the defendant pays                    h to the plaintiff and

litigation costs kd and kp are borne. Note that there may be anywhere between 0 and N new

accidents. The assumption that future defendants choose precautions and cause accidents at

exactly the same time is for expository convenience; the results would be unchanged if they

arrived in sequence instead.17

          Note that settlement negotiations always take place under symmetric information.

The plaintiff's share of the bargaining surplus (if a positive surplus exists) is represented by a

parameter           and we make the simplifying assumption that ( 1 − )k p − k d = 0 .                     This


15
   Note that we do not consider the precautions taken by the first defendant. A firm selling automobiles, for
example, could certainly take actions to reduce the possible damage level to buyers. (If these precautions were
observable, however, then firms could internalize these through ex-ante pricing or contracting.)
16
   The last assumption on the third derivative is a weak sufficient condition for later results.
17
   We will see that the plaintiff's incentive to litigate and release information is stronger when there are more
accidents waiting to happen (N is larger). If the defendants arrive in sequence then the plaintiff would, in
equilibrium, either litigate in the first round or not at all.

                                                       8
would be satisfied if, for example, the two litigants had equal litigation costs ( k p = k d ) and

equal bargaining power ( = .5 ) . This assumption implies that the plaintiff would like to

avoid future accidents. If the plaintiff had too much bargaining power, for example, then he

would benefit from future accidents when                  is very large. The plaintiff would want to

stimulate additional accidents for their settlement value rather than prevent them.18 This

assumption also implies that settlement in the second round will be "accurate" -- reflecting the

defendant's expected liability at trial.

          Notice that although early litigation with D1 involves a real costs, k p + k d , it also

provides private and social benefits. In particular, the information that is verified in the

courtroom -- and subsequently made public -- is used by the future defendants when making

real economic decisions. It is also clear that the private and social incentives to litigate

typically diverge. The decision to settle the first case involves only two of the players, P and

D1, while the litigation decision also affects the welfare of the future defendants.




3. Results

          The plaintiff and the first defendant face an important decision at date 1: they can settle

the first case or they can take the first case to trial. The plaintiff's expected payoff at trial is

     h − k p while the defendant's expected payments are                h + kd .    There is an obvious

incentive to settle the first case: settlement avoids the total cost of litigation, k p + k d . On the

other hand, litigation reveals information about future dangers and influences the precautions

chosen by future defendants. We will see that the plaintiff and the first defendant may opt to

18
   Relaxing this assumption would create special cases associated with extreme liability rules. The main
insights of the paper would not be affected, however.

                                                      9
litigate the first case, despite the cost, if the benefit derived from informing the future

defendants' effort choices is sufficiently strong.




3.1 Equilibrium Characterization

           We will proceed by backwards induction. Suppose that first case has settled. If

another accident occurs at date 2 involving defendant Di then the plaintiff and Di will remain

symmetrically uninformed about the true damages, h.                       The most that Di is willing to pay to

settle the case is          h + k d , his expected payment if the case goes to trial. The least the

plaintiff is willing to accept is             h − k p , his expected damage award minus his litigation

costs.19 Given our earlier assumption concerning the bargaining power of the two parties the

case involving Di would settle for S 2 = h .

           When viewed from date 2, a representative defendant Di anticipates paying S 2 = h

in the event of an accident. He therefore chooses his precautions, x, to minimize his expected

future liability plus his precaution costs:

            Min x    ( 1 − x ) h + c( x ) .

The first-order condition is,

           c ′( x ) = h .                                                                               (1)

In other words, the defendant invests to the point where his marginal cost of precautions is

exactly offset by his marginal benefit associated with reducing the probability of an accident.

We can write the representative defendant's precaution, x, as a function of the expected

damages, h , and the liability rule,              :


19
     For simplicity, in this paper, we assume that the threat for going to trial is always credible.

                                                            10
        x = g (h ;α ) .                                                                      (2)

As expected, one can show that the equilibrium precautions are increasing in the expected

harm, h , and the defendant's share of the damages, α . Finally, conditional upon settling at

date 1, the plaintiff's expected loss associated with the representative defendant is:

         LP ( h ; ) = [ 1 − g ( h ; )]( 1 − )h ,                                             (3)

the probability of an accident multiplied by the plaintiff's share of the damages.

        Now suppose instead that the plaintiff and the first defendant take the first case to trial.

The future defendants subsequently learn the true value of h from the investigations that are

made public. When making his date 2 precaution choice, our representative defendant, Di,

anticipates settling for S 2 = h in the future (should an accident arise).            Di's optimal

precaution is now a function of the true damages h rather than the average damages h :

        x = g ( h;α ) .

Conditional upon pursuing a litigation strategy at date 1, the plaintiff's expected loss

associated with the representative defendant is:

                          ∞
        E ( LP ( h ; )) = LP ( h ; ) f ( h )dh
                          0


where LP ( h ; ) is defined above.

       We can now construct the bargaining range at date 1. The plaintiff's expected payoff

conditional upon going to trial is        h − k p − ( N − 1 ) ∗ E( LP ( h; )) , the expected damages

from trial minus his expected losses associated with the future defendants. If he settles for

S1 , on the other hand, his payoff would be S1 − ( N − 1 ) ∗ LP ( h ; ) . Combining these

expressions shows that the least that the plaintiff is willing to accept in settlement, S1 , is:

        S 1 = h − k p + ( N − 1 ) ∗ [ LP ( h ; ) − E( LP ( h ; ))] .                         (4)

                                                    11
This expression reflects the fact that litigation creates and discloses public information that

subsequently affects the precautions of the defendant. The upper bound on the settlement

range, or the most the first defendant is willing to pay, is simply

           S1 = h + k d .                                                                          (5)

Taken together we see that settlement occurs if and only if S 1 ≤ S 1 or:

            k ≥ ( N − 1 ) ∗ [ LP ( h ; ) − E( LP ( h ; ))] .                                       (6)




Proposition 1: Define k̂ = ( N − 1 ) ∗ [ LP ( h ; ) − E( LP ( h ; ))] . If the total litigation costs

are above this cutoff, k ≥ kˆ , then the plaintiff and the first defendant settle out of court at date

1. If the litigation costs are below this cutoff, k < k̂ , then the first case goes to trial.

Furthermore, if

(i) α = 0 then kˆ = 0 ;

(ii)    ∈ ( 0 ,1 ) then kˆ > 0 ;

(iii)    = 1 then k̂ = 0 .




Proof: In order to prove our result we will show that LP ( h ; ) is a strictly concave function

of h for       ∈ ( 0 ,1 ) and is linear when              = 1 and α = 0 . Differentiating LP ( h ; ) with

respect to h twice shows us that:

          LP ' ' (h ;   ) = −( 1 −   )[ 2 g ′( h ; ) + hg ′′( h ; )] .                             (7)

We see right away that LP ' ' (h ;1) = 0 for all h which implies that LP ( h ;1 ) − E( LP ( h ;1 ) = 0 .

Recall that the representative defendant's precaution level, x = g ( h;α ) , is implicitly defined

by c' ( g ( h ; )) = h .         Differentiating this expression gives g ′(h;α ) = α [c ′′( g (h;α ))]−1 ,.


                                                            12
Since c ′′( x ) > 0 we know that this is strictly positive when                         > 0 and zero when α = 0 .

Totally differentiating with respect to h again gives g ′′(h;α ) = −α 2 c ′′′( x) /[c ′′( x)]−3 , which is

again strictly positive when             > 0 and c ′′′(x ) < 0 and zero otherwise. We conclude that the

plaintiff's continuation payoff is linear when α = 0 and is a strictly concave function of h for

all    ∈ ( 0 ,1 ) .

                                                                                                                    Q.E.D.




         These results may be understood intuitively. When α = 0 the plaintiff bears all of

the damages from the accident. Since the defendants bear no responsibility for the accidents

they cause they take no precautions to avoid accidents (x = 0).                         At this extreme, the plaintiff

gains nothing from early litigation and so the first case always settles. At the other extreme,

when α = 1 the defendant bears 100% responsibility for the plaintiff's damages.                                         The

plaintiff again gains nothing from litigating the first case because his continuation losses are

zero: LP ( h ;1 ) = E( LP ( h ;1 ) = 0 . In the intermediate range, α ∈ (0,1) , however, the early

case may go to trial in equilibrium.                   The future defendants respond to information by

fine-tuning investments and the plaintiff captures some social value through his share, 1 − ,

of the damages.20




20
   The result that the plaintiff derives positive value from the future actions does depend, to some extent, on the assumption
that the third derivative of the cost function is non-positive. The upcoming results on the divergence between the private and
social incentives to litigate do not hinge on this assumption, however.

                                                             13
3.2 The Divergence Between the Private and Social Incentive to Settle

        The decision of the plaintiff and the first defendant to litigate or settle at date 1 does

not necessarily correspond to the efficient decision from a social welfare perspective. If the

first cases settles out of court, then the future defendants choose precautions based on the

average damages, h . The representative defendant's expected future losses may be written

as:

         LD ( h ; ) = ( 1 − g ( h ; )) h + c( g ( h ; )) .                                     (8)

If the first case went to trial instead, the future defendants would fine-tune their precautions to

the actual damage level, h. A representative defendant's expected loss would be:

                            ∞
         E( LD ( h ; )) = LD ( h ; ) f ( h )dh .
                            0


The next lemma states that, for all liability regimes where α > 0 (so the defendants bear

some responsibility for the damages), the future defendants benefit from more information

about damage levels. In short, the decision to settle the first case before investigations are

conducted imposes a negative externality on future defendants.




Lemma 1: When α > 0 then LD ( h ; ) > E( LD ( h ; )) ; future defendants strictly benefit

from early litigation. When              = 0 then LD ( h ; ) = E ( LD ( h ; )) = 0 ; future defendants

derive no value from early litigation.




Proof: To show that LD (h ;          )   is concave we take the derivative with respect to h. By

envelope theorem we may ignore the effect of h on precautions and so we have

LD ' ( h ; ) = ( 1 − g ( h ; ))   and LD " ( h ; ) = − g ′( h ; ) . As in the proof of Proposition 1

                                                     14
we have that g ′( h ; ) = [ c ′′( g ( h ; ))] −1 > 0 for all α > 0 .            Therefore LD ( h ; ) < 0 .

When       α =0 ,       however,     the    future    defendants      take    no    precautions     and    so

LD ( h ; ) = E( LD ( h ; )) = 0 .

                                                                                                      Q.E.D.




           The plaintiff and the first defendant, as shown above, will choose to settle the first

case when k ≥ k̂ . The future defendants, on the other hand, benefit from the information

revealed through early litigation. Since the plaintiff and the first defendant do not internalize

the benefit that accrues to the future defendant, there is a divergence in the direction of “too

few trials”.

         The next proposition characterizes the optimal litigation decision from a social welfare

perspective. The social planner would take into account the payoffs of all players, including

the future defendants, when determining whether settlement or litigation is appropriate.




Proposition 2: Define
        ~
        k = ( N − 1 ) ∗ [ LP ( h ; )) − E( LP ( h ; ))] + ( N − 1 ) ∗ [ LD ( h ; )) − E( LD ( h ; ))] .   (9)

       ~
If k ≥ k then social welfare is highest if the first case settles at date 1 and if k < k̂ then

social welfare is highest if the first case goes to trial. Furthermore, if

               ~
(i) α = 0 then k = k̂ = 0 ;
                         ~
(ii)     ∈ ( 0 ,1 ) then k > k̂ > 0 ;

                  ~
(iii)    = 1 then k > k̂ = 0 .




                                                      15
Proof:       Social      welfare      is     higher      with     date      1     settlement       when

( N − 1 ) ∗ [ LP ( h ; ) + LD ( h ; )] ≤ ( N − 1 ) ∗ [ E( LP ( h ; )) + E ( LD ( h ; ))] + k which gives

                   ~
the expression for k in the proposition. The results follow immediately from definition of

k̂ and the previous results.

                                                                                                 Q.E.D.




           In the proposition, ( N − 1 ) ∗ [ LP ( h ; )) − E( LP ( h ; ))] is the plaintiff and the first

defendant’s additional joint private benefit from litigating the first case rather than settling

while ( N − 1 )* [ LD ( h ; )) − E( LD ( h ; ))] is the joint benefit of the future defendants.

When α = 0 there is no benefit from having information revealed, so it is both privately and

                                          ~
socially optimal for all cases to settle: k = k̂ = 0 . When α > 0 , then the later defendants

gain surplus from early litigation, LD ( h ; )) − E( LD ( h ; )) > 0, and so the socially planner

would choose to go to trial more often than arises in the private equilibrium. We have the

following corollary.



                                                        ~
Corollary 1: For litigation costs in the range k ∈ (kˆ, k ) the plaintiff and the first defendant

choose to settle the first case even though it is in the best interest of society for the first case to

go to trial. For litigation costs outside this range the private and social incentives to litigate are

aligned.




3.3 The Optimal Liability Rule

         The preceding analysis took α , the proportion of damages borne by defendants, as


                                                   16
exogenous. What if a social planner could choose the liability rule optimally instead? On

the one hand, setting α = 1 will have a positive effect on the second defendant's incentives

to take precautions. Taking the decision of the defendant to litigate or settle the first case as

given, α = 1 better aligns the incentives of the future defendants with the incentives of

society more broadly.       But the social planner's choice of liability rule also affects the

plaintiff's and the first defendant’s decision to settle the case at date 1. When α = 1 , as

shown in proposition 1, the first case would settle out of court. The information about h

would remain hidden, preventing the future defendants from fine-tuning their precautions.

        Take instead the liability rule where α = 0 , so the plaintiff and the first defendant

strictly prefer to settle rather than litigate the first case. This α cannot be an optimal

liability rule: by increasing α slightly while keeping the private incentive for settlement, the

social planner enhances the future defendants' incentives to take precautions. Similarly,

suppose that the liability rule is α < 1 such that k < kˆ , the plaintiff and the first defendant

strictly prefer to litigate rather than settle the first case. This α cannot be an optimal

liability rule: by increasing α slightly while keeping the incentive for litigation, we could

give the future defendants stronger incentives to invest in precautions. Indeed, the optimal

liability rule   * must have the property that it is either one (so the first case settles) or it is

the largest positive number that makes the plaintiff and the first defendant indifferent between

litigating and settling the first case.




Proposition 3: The optimal liability parameter is either     * = 1 or the largest value of α that




                                                 17
satisfies ( N − 1 ) ∗ [ LP ( h ; ) − E( LP ( h ; )] ≥ k .21 In the former case the first suit settles; no

information is released but the future defendants are optimally deterred. In the latter case the

first suit goes to trial; information is released but the future defendants take too few

precautions.




        This result also suggests circumstances where the private and social incentives to

litigate diverge, even when the liability rule is chosen optimally. For example, if            * = 1 and

    ~
k < k then the plaintiff and the first defendant may choose to settle the first case even though

it is in society's interest for the first case to go to trial. The next example illustrates that this

latter situation can indeed arise for a certain range of parameter values.




3.4 Example

        Suppose that N = 2, so there is exactly one future defendant. Suppose further that

c( x ) = (1 2) x 2 and that f ( h ) is uniformly distributed on the unit interval [0,1] so h = 1 / 2 .

Also for simplicity, suppose θ = 1 so that the plaintiff always requests the settlement offer,

and that k D = 0 and k P = k . D2's precaution choice takes a simple form: x = g ( h;α ) = αh .

P's expected future losses are LP ( h ; ) = ( 1 − )h − ( 1 − )h 2               and P and D2's joint

expected losses are L( h ; ) = LP ( h ; ) + LD ( h ; ) = h − ( 1 − / 2 )h 2 . Note that both are

concave functions of h. It is easily shown that
                                            (1− )
        k̂ = ( E( h 2 ) − h 2 ) ( 1 − ) =         , and
                                             12


21
   When ( N − 1 ) ∗ [ LP ( h ; ) − E ( LP ( h ; )] = k , the plaintiff and the first defendant are actually
indifferent between settlement and litigation. We assume that the defendant will choose litigation in this
knife-edged case.

                                                    18
        ~                                   a( 1 − / 2 )
       k = ( E( h 2 ) − h 2 ) ( 1 − / 2 ) =              .
                                                 12
          ~                                      ~
Note that k > kˆ ≥ 0 for all α ∈ (0,1] and k = kˆ = 0 when α = 0 .

           Now given k , define the optimal liability rule be                   * (k ) . From earlier result on the

optimal liability rule, we must have either                   * (k ) = 1 or the largest value a* that satisfies

( 1 / 12 ) * ( 1 − *) ≥ k     .        The      largest          root      of     this       last     expression     is

 * = ( 1 2 ){ 1 + 1 − 48 k } .

           If k > 1/48 then no root exists and therefore             * (k ) = 1 . The first case settles and the

expected social loss is L( h ;1 ) = 3 / 8 .               If k < 1/48 then this root does exist. If

 * = ( 1 2 ){ 1 + 1 − 48 k } then the first case goes to trial and the associated expected social

loss is       E [ L(h ; * ) + k ] = 1 / 2 − * / 3 + * 2 / 6 + k = 1 / 2 − * / 4 + * 2 / 12                (using the

above equality to replace k with a*).                    If     * = ( 1 2 ){ 1 + 1 − 48 k } ≥ (3 − 3 ) / 2 , (or

equivalently k ≤ ( 2 3 − 3) / 24 ) then the expected social loss from litigation E[ L(h; α *) + k ]

is       smaller     than      3/8     and      therefore            the        optimal       liability     rule     is

     * ( k ) = ( 1 2 ){ 1 + 1 − 48 k } < 1 .        If        a* < ( 3 − 3 ) / 2 ,            or     equivalently    if

k > (2 3 − 3) / 24 , then the expected social loss from litigation is greater than 3/8 and

therefore the optimal liability rule is        * (k ) = 1 .

           Finally, the private and social incentives to settle may diverge even when the liability

rule is chosen optimally.             When k > ( 2 3 − 3) / 24 then                      * (k ) = 1 and using the

                                                                        ~
expressions        above      we     find      kˆ = 0          and      k = 1 / 24       .          Therefore      when

( 2 3 − 3) / 24 < k < 1 / 24 then the plaintiff settles the first case even though it is socially

efficient for the case to go to trial. When k ≤ (2 3 − 3) / 24 then the first case goes to trial

and when k ≥ 1 / 24 the first case settles -- private decisions that are aligned with the interests


                                                          19
of society as a whole.




4. A Simple Example with Asymmetric Information

         The previous section focused on a setting where private parties tend to settle too often.

They choose to settle to avoid their private litigation costs, not internalizing the social benefits

of the information made public through trial. This result may be reversed, however, when

other factors are introduced. In particular, when the early litigants are privately informed

they will engage in rent-seeking activities and take tough bargaining stances in an attempt to

extract a greater share of the bargaining surplus. This will lead to bargaining failures and

costly trials. The rent-seeking motive is purely redistributive and is not aligned with the

motives of a social planner.

         We modify the previous model in several ways to explore the role of asymmetric

information. First, we change the information structure. Suppose that the plaintiff has

private information about his harm level, h, when negotiating with the first defendant at date 1

and the first defendant knows that the plaintiff has this information. At date 2, the N − 1

future defendants update their beliefs based on the disposition of the earlier case and choose

their precautions accordingly. At date 3 we assume that the future defendants observe the

plaintiff's damages should an accident occur so there is symmetric information at date 3.22

We also assume that h is uniformly distributed on the unit interval [0,1], that the defendants'

cost of precautions is quadratic, c( x ) = .5 x 2 , and that the defendants have the power to make

take-it-or-leave-it settlement offers, so            =0 .     In this way, the negotiations at date 2

22
  Our earlier version of this paper, HUA AND SPIER [2003], presents a more general version of this model with
one defendant and two plaintiffs. In that paper, the asymmetric information is assumed to persist until date 3.

                                                       20
resemble the screening model in BEBCHUK [1984]. The property that ( 1 − )k p − k d = 0 is

maintained by assuming that the plaintiff's litigation cost is zero or, alternatively, that the

English Rule for allocating the litigation costs is in effect. In all other respects, however, the

model here is the same as before.




Lemma 2: Suppose that the uninformed defendant, D1, has offered to settle with the privately

informed plaintiff for S 1 . The continuation equilibrium features a cutoff, h1 , implicitly

defined by     h1 + [ ( 1 − )( N − 1 ) / 2 ] h12 = S 1 if S1 < + ( 1 − )( N − 1 ) / 2 and h1 = 1

otherwise.

(i)    If h ≤ h1 then P accepts S 1 at date 1. Each of the N − 1 future defendants take

       precautions ah1 / 2 each and subsequently settle out of court for S 2 = ah .

(ii)   If h > h1 then P rejects S 1 at date 1 and goes to trial. Each of the N − 1 future

       defendants take precautions ah and subsequently settle out of court for S 2 = ah .




Proof: We will begin at date 3 and work backwards. At date 3 the plaintiff and the

defendants become symmetrically informed about damages so the defendants who caused

accidents will settle out of court for S 2 = ah , regardless of the outcome of the earlier case.

The outcome of the earlier case will affect the defendants' precautions at date 2, however. If

the first case went to trial then the representative defendant learns the true damages and sets

c' ( x ) = ah , giving x = ah . If the first case settled then the representative defendant knows

that the plaintiff's damages are in the truncated uniform distribution on [ 0 , h1 ] , so the

expected harm is h1 / 2 . The defendant therefore takes precautions x = ah1 / 2 .


                                               21
         Now let's consider the plaintiff's decision about whether to accept an offer at date 1.

In general, a plaintiff of type h has an expected future loss ( N − 1 )( 1 − x )( 1 − )h , the

number of future defendants multiplied by the probability of an accident multiplied by the

plaintiff's share of the damages. These losses influence the plaintiff's decision to accept a

settlement offer, S 1 . If the plaintiff accepts S 1 he gets S 1 − ( N − 1 )( 1 − ah1 / 2 )( 1 − )h

and if he rejects S 1 and goes to trial he gets            h − ( N − 1 )( 1 − ah )( 1 − )h . Setting these

two expressions equal to each other we find the interior value for h1 as defined in the lemma

(if an interior solution exists); otherwise, h1 = 1 and all types settle out of court.

                                                                                                  Q.E.D.




Lemma 3:         D1's optimal cutoff, ĥ , is the positive root of the following quadratic expression

 ĥ + ( 3 / 2 )( N − 1 ) ( 1 − )ĥ 2 − k = 0 when that root is smaller than 1 and ĥ = 1 otherwise.

                                                            ~
The     social          planner's   optimal      cutoff,    h        ,   is   the   positive    root   of
                              ~                                                ~
( 1 / 4 )( N − 1 ) ( 1 − / 2 )h 2 − k = 0 when that root is smaller than 1 and h = 1           otherwise.




Proof: The first defendant chooses h1 to minimize his expected payments to the plaintiff.

                   h1                                           1
         Min           { ah1 + [ ( 1 − )( N − 1 ) / 2 ] h12 }dh + [ h + k ]dh .
           h1      0                                            h1


The first term captures the settlement payments to the plaintiff types below the cutoff and the

second term are the defendant's payments at trial associated with the plaintiff types above the

cutoff. Differentiating this expression once gives the first-order condition defining ĥ in the

Lemma and it is easy to see that the second-order condition holds. The social planner, on the

other hand, would choose the cutoff h1 to minimize the social losses, which include the

                                                      22
litigation costs at date 1, the precautions at date 2, and the accident losses at date 3:

Differentiating this expression gives the social planner's optimal cutoff, h , as in the lemma.

The second-order condition holds.

         The next two propositions characterize the nature of the divergence between the

private and social incentives to litigate and the optimal liability rule for the interesting case

                   ~
where the cutoffs, h and ĥ , are both interior. In other words, we restrict attention to cases

where there is at least some litigation in equilibrium.



                                                                                   ~
Proposition 4: If a < 10 / 11 then there are too many trials in equilibrium ( ĥ < h ). If

a > 10 / 11 then there exists a finite and positive cutoff, γ * (α ) = 8α ( 2 − α ) /(11α − 10 ) 2 . If

                                                                           ~
( N − 1 )k > * ( )     then there are too few trials in equilibrium ( ĥ > h ) and if

                                                                        ~
( N − 1 )k < * ( ) then there are too many trials in equilibrium ( ĥ < h ).




Proof:     Consider the first order conditions in the previous lemma, and define

ĝ ( h ) = h + ( 3 / 2 )( N − 1 ) ( 1 − )h 2 − k          and     g~( h ) = ( 1 / 4 )( N − 1 ) ( 1 − / 2 )h 2 − k .

                                                                                 ~
These are increasing functions of h and take on the value 0 at the values ĥ and h ,

                                                                         8             1
respectively. They cross at two points, zero and h' =                                        .      If    a < 10 / 11
                                                                        N −1        11a − 10


                                                           23
then h' < 0 and, since ĝ ( 0 ) = g~( 0 ) = − k and ĝ' ( 0 ) > g~' ( 0 ) we know that ĝ ( h ) > g~( h )

                                                     ~
for all h > 0.       We therefore conclude that ĥ < h .            If a > 10 / 11 then h' > 0 and so

ĝ ( h ) > g~( h ) for all 0 < h < h' and ĝ ( h ) < g~( h ) for all h > h' . Using the definition of

~                                                       ~                  ~
h in the lemma we see that when ( N − 1 )k > * ( ) then h > h' and so ĥ > h .                            If

                                             ~                  ~
( N − 1 )k > * ( ) , on the other hand, then h < h' and so ĥ < h .

                                                                                                  Q.E.D.




         The result that there may be either too many or too few trial in equilibrium shouldn't be

too surprising. On one hand, the first defendant tries to seek rent from the privately informed

plaintiff; on the other hand, the early litigants incorporates only a part of the future value of

more accurate information from trial. The former gives the incentive for early litigants to have

too many trials; while the latter offers the incentive to have too few trials. Proposition 4 tells us

that the trade-off depends on the liability rule, the number of litigants, and the litigation costs.

Note that the private and social incentives are aligned only in the knife-edged case where

( N − 1 )k = * ( ) .




Proposition 5: Let hˆ (α ) be D1’s optimal cutoff. The optimal liability rule is either             *=1

or one of the values satisfying:

[(1/ 4)(N −1)α *(1−α * / 2)hˆ(α*)2 − k](∂hˆ ∂α *) + (1/ 3)(N −1)[(α * −1)(1− hˆ(α*) / 4)] = 0 .    (11)

where ∂hˆ ∂α * = −[hˆ + (3 / 2)( N − 1)(1 − 2α *)hˆ 2 ] /[α * +3( N − 1)α * (1 − α *)hˆ] for 0< ĥ <1.




Proof:     The social planner chooses the liability parameter α to minimize the social loss:


                                                       24
                                         ĥ( )
      Min [ 1 − ĥ( )] k + ( N − 1 )             [( 1 − aĥ( ) / 2 )h + ( 1 / 2 )( ĥ( ) / 2 )2 ] dh        (12)
                                          0


                         1
                    +        [( 1 − ah )h + ( 1 / 2 )( h )2 ]dh
                        ĥ( )


Differentiating this expression gives the marginal effect as given in the left hand side of (11)

where ∂ĥ ∂ * for 0< ĥ <1 is found from the expression in Lemma 3. If α * = 0 then ĥ =0

and ∂hˆ ∂α * = 0 . Therefore, the marginal loss in (11) is negative so that α * = 0 cannot be

optimal. α * is either 1 or one of the values satisfying (11).

                                                                                                          Q.E.D.




       When choosing a liability rule, the social planner must consider both the early litigants'

incentives to pursue litigation and the future defendants' incentives to take precautions. This

trade-off gives the optimal rule characterized in (11). The first term of (11) is the indirect

marginal effect on social welfare when changing the liability rule changes the equilibrium

number of trials. The second term is direct marginal effect on welfare when changing the

liability rule changes the future defendants’ precautions. With the optimal liability rule, if there

                                   ~
were no divergence ( ĥ = h < 1 ) then it would be always better to increase the liability

parameter to induce more precautions. Therefore, the private and social desirability for

litigation are not aligned even when the liability rule is chosen optimally.




5. Conclusion

       This paper has explored a new efficiency rationale for litigation.                              The public

information created by legal investigations creates economic value when future actors


                                                              25
fine-tune their decisions in response to the information revealed through litigation activities.

In contrast, when early cases settle before thorough investigations are conducted then a

negative externality is imposed on the future actors. This rationale suggests an important

tradeoff in the design of liability rules. First, imposing liability on long-run players (the

plaintiff in our model) provides those players with greater incentives to litigate early claims.

When held liable for future harms, the long-run players benefits from the improvement in

public information that results from their litigation activities. On the other hand, shifting

liability to the long-run players dampens the incentives of future players (defendants in our

model) to mitigate their risks.

        Our basic framework may be extended in a number of ways.                          First, one could

generalize the liability rule to consider decoupled damages (see POLINSKY AND CHE [1991]).

Assuming that the plaintiff pursues all claims, making the defendants in our model responsible

for 100% of the harm that they cause leads the defendants to invest appropriately in accident

avoidance activities. Awarding the plaintiff less than 100% would create greater incentives

for the plaintiff to litigate. This scheme could, for example, be implemented by taxing the

plaintiffs' award. The framework could also be extended to condition the liability rule on the

order of arrival. In a richer framework, placing less responsibility on the defendant (and

more on the plaintiff) should be more valuable in early cases where the potential for learning is

higher. Our model has also abstracted from accident avoidance activities of the plaintiff --

the plaintiff as well as the defendant may be able to take precautions to reduce the risk of

future accidents.23

23
   The earlier version of this paper, HUA AND SPIER [2003], considered the analogous problem of one defendant
facing a sequence of plaintiffs who take precautions. The defendant's incentives were ignored, however.

                                                     26
            Finally, note that since the future defendants value the information created through

litigation they have a joint incentive to subsidize the first defendant's litigation costs. We

have, of course, ignored this possibility. Free-riding among the possible defendants and the

difficulty of drafting contracts that earmark contributions to accurate investigations may, in

practice, preclude subsidies along these lines. Alternatively, they may be able to overcome the

                                                                                              24
collective action problem through insurance contracts with a common insurer

Never-the-less, these positive externalities suggest that the joining of defendants, present and

future, into a defendant class action could be a more efficient arrangement. These, and other

issues, remain topics for future research.
