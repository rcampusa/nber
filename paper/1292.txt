           Excess Labor and the Business Cycle


                        ABSTRACT



          This paper compares the Nedoff—Fay estimates of labor

hoarding during troughs, which are based on data from manufact-

uring plants, with aggregate estimates of excess labor on hand.

The two sets of estimates seem consistent, which provides a

strong argument in favor of the excess labor hypothesis. This

is one of the few examples in macroeconomics where a hypothesis

has been so strongly confirmed using detailed micro data.

I.   Introduction

     In a remarkable empirical study of 168 U.S. manufacturing plants, Medoff

and Fay (1983) (hereafter MF) have examined the magnitude of labor hoarding

during economic contractions. They found that during its most recent trough

quarter, the typical plant paid for about 8 percent more blue collar hours

than were needed for regular production work. Some of these hours were used

for other worthwhile work, and after taking account of this, 5 percent of

the blue collar hours was estimated to be hoarded for the typical plant.

     The hypothesis that firms may hold "excess labor" during contractions

was explored in Fair (1969) using monthly three—digit industry data. A model

of labor demand was developed in this study that is based on the idea that

firms may at times hold excess labor. This model was originally estimated

using the monthly three-digit industry data, and it was later estimated using

aggregate quarterly data. The aggregate labor demand equations are part of

my U.S. macro model. The latest discussion of the aggregate equations is

in Chapter 4 in Fair (1984). Both the monthly industry estimates and the

quarterly macro estimates support the excess labor hypothesis.

     The purpose of this paper is to see if the quantitative estimates of

MF are consistent with the aggregate estimates. If this is the case, which

the results in this paper show, it provides a strong argument in favor of

the excess labor hypothesis. Essentially the same conclusion has been reached
                                                                            2




using two very different data sets. This is in fact one of the few examples

in macroeconomics where a hypothesis has been so strongly confirmed using

detailed micro data.



II. Review of the Aggregate Labor Demand Equations

     The latest discussion of the theoretical model upon which the labor

demand equations are based is in Chapter 3 in Fair (1984). Only a few fea-

tures of this model will be reviewed here. The technology is assumed to

be putty-clay, where at any one time there are a number of different types

of machines that can be purchased. The machines differ in price, in the

number of workers that must be used with each machine per unit of time, and

in the amount of output that can be produced per machine per unit of time.

The worker-machine ratio is assumed to be fixed for each type of machine.

Adjustment costs are postulated for changes in the size of the work force

and for changes in the size of the capital stock. Firms behave by maximiz-

ing the present discounted value of expected future after-tax cash flow.

The main decision variables of a firm are its price, production, investment,

labor demand,andwagerate. Because of the adjustment costs, it may some-

times be optimal for a firm to operate "off" its production function and

hold excess labor and/or excess capital.

     The transition from a theoretical to an econometric model is always

difficult in macroeconomics, and the present case is no exception. This

transition is discussed in Chapter 4 in Fair (1984), and again only a few

features will be discussed here. For the empirical work the production

function is postulated to be one of fixed proportions:


         Y =   min{X(J.H),   (K.IlK)}
                                                                              3



                                                                    J
where Y is production, J is the number of workers employed, H           is the

number of hours worked per worker, K is the stock of capital, HK is the

number of hours each unit of K is utilized, and A and p are coefficients

that may change over time due to technical progress. The variables Y

J ,   and   K are observed; H and HK are not. This production function

is only an approximation tothe technology of the theoretical model. It does

not allow for the existence of more than one type of machine, and it treats

technical progress in an inappropriate way. Even if there were only one

type of machine in existence, technical progress would take the form of

machines having different A and p coefficients depending on when they

were purchased. In order to account for technical progress in this way,

one would have to keep track of when each machine was purchased and what

the coefficients were for that machine. This kind of detail is not possible

with aggregate data, and one must resort to simpler specifications.

      Given the production function, the next step is to measure the number

of worker hours required to produce the output each period. This was done

as follows. Output per paid for worker hour, Y/(J.H) , was first plotted

for the 1952 I - 1982 III period. (Data on hours paid for, H ,     exist,
whereas data on hours worked, H ,    do not.) The peaks of this series were

assumed to correspond to cases where the number of hours worked equals the

number of hours paid for (i.e., where H = H    ),   which implies that values

of A in equation (1) are observed at the peaks. The values of A other

than those at the peaks were then assumed to lie on straight lines between

the peaks. Given an estimate of A for a particularquarterand given the

production function (1), the estimate of the number of worker hours required

to produce the output of the quarter (denoted JHMIN) is simply Y/A .    The

peaks that were used for the interpolations are 1952 I, 1953 II, 1955 I,
                                                                                     4



1966 I, 1973 I, and 1977 I. The line connecting 1973 I and 1977 I was extra-

polated beyond 1977 I to fill out the series through 1982 III.

       In the theoretical model a firm's price, production, investment, labor de-

mand, and wage rate decisions are made simultaneously in the sense that all

of them are derived from the solution of the firm's maximization problem.

For the empirical work the decisions are assumed to be made sequentially,

where the sequence is price, production, investment, labor demand, and wage

rate. The labor demand equations are thus based on the assumption that the

production decision has already been made. Were it not for the adjustment

costs of changing employment, the optimal level of employment would merely

be the amount needed to produce the output of the period, but because of

these costs, excess labor may be held during certain periods. In the theo-

retical model there was no need to postulate explicitly how employment

deviates from the amount required to produce the output, but this must be

done for the empirical work.

       The estimated demand-for-workers equation is based on the following three

equations:


                                  J
(r2)   i   log   J =

where JHMIN is the number cf worker hours required to produce the output

of the period, H* is the average number of hours per worker that the firm

would like to be worked if there were no adjustment costs, and J is the

number of workers the firm would like to employ if there were no adjustment

costs. The term log(J1/J*1) in equation (2) will be referred to as the

(logarithmic) "nui±er of excess workers" on hand. Equation (2) states that

the change in the demand for workers is a function of the number of excess

workers on hand arid three change —in-output ternis (all changes are changes

in logs). If output has not changed for three periods and if there are no

excess workers on hand, the change in workers employed is zero. The change-

in-output terms are means in part to be proxies for expected future output

changes. Equation (3) defines the desired number of workers, which is simply

equal to the required number of worker hours divided by the desired number of

hours worked per worker. Equation (4) postulates that the desired number of

hours worked is a smoothly trending variable, where H and                                    are constants.

        Combining equations (2)-(4) yields:



()        log J =         log W +   a   log                   +

where D593 and D594 are dummy variables for the 1959 steel strike. The

estimated value of               is -.141, which means that, other things being equal,

14.1 percent of the number of excess workers on hand is eliminated each quar—

ter. The implied value of ITt             is 531.97, which at a weekly rate is 40.92

hours. The implied value of                 is - .00125.       The trend variable t is equal

to 9 for the first quarter of the sample period (1954 I), and so the implied

value of H*1 for 1954 I at a weekly rate is 40.92.exp(-.00l25 x9) = 40.46.

For 1982 III t is equal to 123, and so the implied value for this quarter

is 40.92•exp(-.00125 x123) =            35.09.        In general these numbers seem reasonable.

      The estimated demand-for-hours equation is based on equations (3), (4),

and the following equation:



                           H1                  J1
(7)     log H =   A

                            —1
                                         log   — —1
                                                      +     log Y



The first term on the RHS          of   equation (7) is the (logarithmic) difference

between the actual number of hours paid for per worker in the previous period

and the desired number. The reason for the inclusion of this term in the

demand-for-hours equation but not in the demand-for-workers equation is that,

unlike J ,    H       fluctuates around a slowly trending level of hours. This

restriction is captured by the first term in (7). The other two terms are

the number of excess workers on hand and the current change in output. Both

of these terms have an important effect on the demand-for-workers decision,

and they should also affect the demand-for-hours decision since the two de-

cisions are closely related. Past output changes might also be expected to

affect the demand-for-hours decision, but these were not found to be signifi-

cant and so are not included in (7).

      Combining (3), (4), and (7) yields:
                                                                                                    7

The estimated value of A is -.284, which means that, other things being equal,

actual hours per w.orker are adjusted towards desired hours by 28.4 percent per

quarter. The excess workers variable is significant, with an estimated value

of       of -.0659. The implied value of i                         is   534.60, which is 41.12 hours

at a weekly rate. This compares closely to the value of 40.92 implied by

equation (6). The implied value of ô is -.00115, which compares closely

to the value of -.00125 implied by equation (6). No attempt was made to

impose the restriction that fl                         and      are the same in equations (6) and

(9). Given the closeness of the estimates, it is unlikely that imposing

this restriction would make much difference.

       The significance of the excess workers variable in equations (6) and (9)

provides support for the excess labor hypothesis. It seems unlikely that

a variable like this would be significant if firms never or seldom held

excess labor.

III. Comparison

       The main concern of this paper is whether the above aggregate empirical

results are consistent with the HF micro results. The aggregate variable

that is closest to the HF concept of hoarded hours is      (J.H)/JHIvIIN ,   which

is the ratio of total worker hours paid for to the total number required

to produce the output. Note that this is different from J/J above, which

is the ratio of the actual number of workers to the long-run desired number.2

(J.H)/JHMIN will be called the "percentage of excess hours."

       One thing that can be done to compare the results is simply look at

the actual values of (J.H)/JHMIN over the business cycle. Another is to

see what the model predicts these values to be. This information is presented

in Table 1. The model consists of equations (6) and (9). Y and JHMIN

(   =Y/X)   are exogenous. The predicted values in Table 1 are for a dynamic

simulation for the 1954 I -1982 III period. The results in Table 1 show,

first of all, that the model fits the data well. The predicted values are

based on a dynamic simulation of 115 quarters in length, and the root mean

squared error over the entire period is only .011.

       Consider now the actual values in Table 1. There are two possible

troughs that are relevant for the NF study, the one in mid 1980 and the one

in early 1982. The first survey upon which the MF results are based was

done in August 1981, and the second (larger) survey was done in April 1982.

A followup occurred in December 1982. The plant managers were asked to answer

the questionnaire for the plant's most recent trough. For the last responses

the trough might be in 1982, whereas for the earlier ones the trough is likely

to be In 198Q. Tahle 1 shows that in 1980 the percentage of excess hours

number of hours worked per worker.

reached a high of 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter. In 1982 it reached a

high of 5.5 percent in the first quarter. The percentages in earlier troughs

are: 5.4 in 1958 I, 8.4 in 1960 IV, 5.3 in 1970 I, and 4.5 in 1974 IV.

        Should the trough percentage numbers in Table 1 be compared to the MF

estimate of 8 percent, which does not adjust for worthwhile nonproduction

work, or to the estimate of 5 percent, which does? The 8 percent figure is

probably more appropriate, for the following reason. It may be that the peak

productivity points are not sustainable in the sense that worthwhile main-

tainence is being postposed in order to produce the high levels of output.

This means that JHNIN will be underestimated if it is taken to include

necessary long-run maintainence work. This is not an important problem for

the estimation of equations (6) and (9) above because if JHMIN has been

underestimated by the same percentage amount each period, this error will

merely be absorbed in the estimate of the constant terms in the two equa-

tions. It does mean, however, that the MF     estimate   of 8 percent is more

appropriate for comparison purposes. The 8 percent number, like the peak-

to-peak interpolation work, does not account for necessary long-run maintainence

work.

        The MF estimate of 8 percent is thus compared to the 4.5 and 5.5 per-

cent values in Table 1 for the two most recent trough quarters. These two

sets of results seem consistent. There are at least two reasons for expect-

ing the NF estimate to be somewhat higher. First, the trough in output for

a given plant is on average likely to be deeper than the trough in aggregate

output, since not all troughs are likely to occur in the same quarter across

plants. (The deeper the trough, the larger will be the percentage of excess

hours, and the comparison of the two sets of results has not adjusted for

different size troughs.) Second, the manufacturing sector may on average
                                                                                 11




 face deeper troughs than do other sectors, and the aggregate estimates in

 Table 1 are for the total private sector, not just manufacturing. One

would thus expect the HF estimate to be somewhat higher than the aggregate

estimates, and 8 percent versus a number around 5 percent seems consistent

with this.

     With respect to the predicted values in Table 1, in 1980 the predicted

percentage of excess hours reached a high of 4.4 percent in the second quar-

ter, and in 1982 it reached a high of 4.8 percent in the first quarter.

These values compare fairly closely to the actual values.

     One cannot get from the HF results estimates of the response of excess

hours to output fluctuations. This can be done, however, with the aggre-

gate equations. The results of three experiments are reported in Table 2.

These experiments were performed as follows. First, the estimated residuals

were added to equations (6) and (9) and treated as exogenous. This means

that when the model is solved using the actual values of Y       ,   perfect   fits

are obtained for J and H (and thus J•H ).          Second,    Y was changed and

the model was solved for the new values of Y   .    Third,   the new (predicted)

values   of J.H/JHMIN were compared to the old (actual) values to see the
response of excess hours to the output changes. The simulation period began
in 1978 I. All three simulations were dynamic. For the first experiment
Y was lowered (from its actual value) by 1.0 percent in the first quarter,

2,0 percent in the second, 3.0 percent in the third, and 4.0 percent in the

fourth and fifth. The second experiment was the same as the first except

that the decreases were twice as large. For the third experiment Y was

lowered by 4.0 percent in the first quarter and 8.0 percent in the second,

third, and fourth.

        The results in Table 2 show that for the first experiment excess hours

 reached a high of 1.49 percent in the fourth quarter. For the second experi-

 ment the high was 3.10 percent in the fourth quarter. The values for the

 second experiment are only slightly more than twice as large as the values

 for the first, which means that the excess-hours response to output fluc-

tuatIons is not very nonlinear with respect to the size of the changes. The

response is, however, quite nonlinear with respect to the timing of the changes.

For the third experiment compared to the second experiment, output was 8 per-
cent lower by the second quarter rather than by the fourth quarter. Excess
hours   reached a   high of 4.12 percent for the third experiment compared to a

high of 3.10 percent for the second experiment.



IV. Conclusion

      The Medoff-Fay results seem consistent with the aggregate estimates,

which is further evidence in favor of the excess labor hypothesis. This

hypothesis has important implications for the production function and in-

vestment literature. Much of this literature is based on the assumption

that firms are always 'on" their production functions. If they are not and

if in fact the amount of worker hours hoarded during contractions, even

after adjusting for worthwhile nonproduction work, is as much as 5 percent

of total worker hours, it is not clear that estimates of production param-

eters and investment behavior that are based on the assumption of no hoarding

are trustworthy.
