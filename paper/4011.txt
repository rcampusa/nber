    THE GROWTH AND WELFARE CONSEQUENCES    OF DIFFERENTIAL                                  TARIFFS

           This paper analyzes the impact of differential     tariffs on consumption    and investment in

a specific factors model of a small open economy in which capital is accumulated over time.

Particular attention is devoted to the welfare aspects, highlighting        the cost of the intertemporal

distortions produced by protective trade policies.        Several specific welfare propositions are

obtained.      Fist, tariff protection is shown to create short-run beneftts but long-run costs in

welfare.     Secondly, the second-best policy for the two tariffs is characterized.       Finally, several

propositions     summarizing   the implications    of our analysis for tariff reform are derived.

I.   INTRODUCTION

      Theoretical       work     on        capital accumulation       under protective         trade regimes has produced

a substantial      literature         on    the subject   of “immiserizing        growth.”        Much of the motivation       for

this literature      derives     from the experience              of developing      countries,      since as Jol-umm      (1967.

p.   152) noted, the “possibility                   of income-reducing            growth is relevant to the fact that

countries industrializing                  by means of protectionist           and import-substituting            policies are

frequently      dissatisfied with the results.” Most theoretical                       analyses of immiserizing growth,

including Bhagwati              (1973), Brecher and Diaz-Alejandro                      (1977), and Casas (1985), have

stressed the ambiguous welfare consequences of an ezogenous capital inflow (such as an

unrequited        transfer) in the presence of a tariff.                 In an important           recent article, Neary and

Ruane (1988) have analyzed the full equilibrium                              effects of an endogenous tariff-induced

capital inflow. In so doing, they have provided an important                                 clarification   to the literature

on immiserizing          growth by showing that,                    unlike an exogenous capital              inflow, a tariff-

induced capital inflow will never be welfare improving in a standard convex economy.

      Despite the use of the term “immiserizing                          growth,”      existing studies have conducted

their analyses using a static framework,                       in which all capital accumulation                is assumed to

occur instantaneously.                In this paper we extend the welfare analysis of immiserizing growth

 to a dynamic setting in which capital accumulates gradually                                   over time.     Like Neary and

 Ruane, we are concerned with the full equilibrium                           effects of tariff-induced        capital inflows,

 and we discuss how the welfare consequences of tariff policy can be captured by a welfare

 integral over the time path of discounted instantaneous utility.                                    We are unaware of any

 previous such dynamic welfare analysis of tariff protection.

      The model we have chosen to analyze is the Jones (1971)-Samuelson                                        (1971) specific

 factors model of trade in which the import-competing                                sector uses capital and the export

 sector uses land, both in conjunction                       with intersectorally            mobile labor.     This choice of

 production       structure      orients the analysis toward developing countries and, for a similar

 reason, was the structure                   chosen by Dixit       and Grossman (1982) to model the effect of a

                                                                     1
uniform         tariff     in a model with            multistage         production,           and by Brecher                and Findlay          (1983)

to examine           immiserizing           growth       in the presence               of a tax on foreign               investment.

         The     model       includes        three elements              of the production               technology             that     allow     us to

extend      the welfare           analysis       of tariffs     within      a specific         factors    setting          in several      new direc-

tions.     The first         element       is the specification             of differential         tariffs      on the import-competing

sector      and on the imported                    investment         good.         Although       previous          welfare     analyses        of pro-

tection        have focused         on the case of uniform                  tariffs,     differential         tariffs      on capital      goods and

consumer          goods are the rule, rather                   than the exception,                 in developing             countries.’

          The second          element        of the model’s            technology          is the specification                of an endogenous

labor supply.              Although       trade models typically                    assume      an exogenously-given                   labor supply,

we find that the elasticity                   of labor supply             is an important            determinant               of the welfare        cost

of tariffs.        1Ve also find that              the elasticity         of labor supply            is an important               determinant            of

the initial        employment             effects of a tariff         and that these initial                  effects      may be reversed           over

time as the capital               stock      adjusts.

          The third         element        of the model’s             technology          is an adjustment                 cost function          that     is

increasing         in the rate of capital               accumulation.               The use of such a function                  has been made in

the microeconomics                  literature        beginning          with       the work      of Lucas          (1967),      Treadway          (1969)

and others           in the 196Os, and has been incorporated                                 into trade models                beginning      with        the

work       of Frenkel        and Rodriguez.             (1975).       We show that one determinant                             of the welfare         cost

of protection             is the convexity           of the adjustment               cost function,           since the speed (and, hence,

the welfare              cost) of the economy’s               adjustment            to changes       in tariffs          depends       in part on the

marginal          insta.IIation       costs of new capital.

          We provide           a positive          analysis       of the dynamic               adjustment            of an economy               to tariff

changes and derive several welfare                         results.       Our first result is that, starting                     from free trade, a

uniform         tariff increase         distorts      the time path of instantaneous                          utility,     so that instantaneous

utility     is initially       raised above the free-trade                      level before declining                   to a long-run       level that

is lower        than the initial           free-trade         level. That           is to say, tariff         protection        creates     short-run

                                                                                2
benefits       and long-run         costs in welfare         terms.          Second,        we show that a second-best                    optimal

investment         tariff will exceed the consumption                         tariff,     both because            investment         goods in the

model       are general        equilibrium         substitutes            for the exportable                good and because             the tariff

on the investment              good helps to correct               factor     price distortions              caused by the consumption

tsxiff.

          The next two          results       extend     the literature             on the welfare             gains associated           with    the

concertina         and radial        tariff     reduction          methods          of piecemeal             tariff     reform.      The welfare

calculations         carried     out for these methods                     include,       in addition           to the usual static          gains,

an intertemporal               welfare    term.         Our fifth          result       concerns          the welfare-improving              effects

of a reduction          in the consumption                tariff     in conjunction                with     an increase           in the tariff     on

the investment           good, a method                of piecemeal          tariff      reform      that we label the “two-handed

concertina”         method.        We view this last result as an important                                one, since several well-known

trade      liberalizations        began by raising               tariff     rates       on investment             goods      at the same time

that      tariff   rates on consumption                goods were lowered.’

          The paper      proceeds         as follows.        SectiornII             and III lay out the analytical                     framework.

This framework               is the inflnitely-lived          utility-maximizing                    representative           agent model          that

has been recently              employed         to analyze          a variety           of macroeconomic                disturbances       in open

economies.’          Section IV describes              some of the macroeconomic adjustments to tariff changes,

while Section V conducts the welfare analysis of tariff changes. Both the short-run                                                               and

long-run welfare implications are discussed. Section VI discussessome welfare propositions

relevant to issues pertaining                     to tariff reform.                 Section VII           concludes, while much of the

technical detail is relegated to the Appendix.



II.        THE      ANALYTICAL                     FRAMEWORK


          The economy we consider is inhabited by a single, intlnitely-lived                                              representative agent

who rents out an inelastic quantity                         of land (2’) at its competitive                           rental rate, accumulates

 capital (K)         for rental at its competitively                        determined rental rate, and supplies labor at

                                                                             3
the competitive           wage.4       The agent produces                an import-competing                    good (taken          to be the

numeraire)       using the stock            of capital        and quantity             of labor L”‘,           by means      of a standard

neoclassical      production           function       F(K,     L”).      The agent also produces                   an exportable          good

using the endowment               of land and the quantity                    of labor L”, by means of a second standard

neoclassical      production           function     G(T, L’).          The price of the exportable                   good is normalized

to equal       the price        of the import-competing                       good.       Capital      is therefore        specific      to the

production       of the import-competing                     good and land to the production                        of the export        good.

      The capital         stock    depreciates         at the constant               rate 6. Capital           goods are imported              and

unlike the import-competing                   final good, are not produced                     domestically.           Expenditure         on a

given increase         in the capital         stock     involves        adjustment          costs     which      we incorporate          in the

function




where       the gross investment            of I units of capital              requires     the use of 6(1, If)            units of output.

The function           O(I,K)          is specified      to be a non-negative,                      linearly     homogeneous,            convex

function       of the rate of gross               investment          and capital          stock.s      The homogeneity               property

of the installation             cost     function      ensures         that     the market           value      of the capital         stock     is

invariant      with    respect         to changes in the scale of the economy.6                           For analytical           convenience

we assume         4(6K,K) = O,q5r(bK,K) = 0, so                               that    adjustment         costs are minimized              (zero)

in the neighborhood               of steady-state            equilibrium         (where      I =      6K).'
        The importable             consumption           good is subject               to a tariff       (T’)    levied    by the govern-

ment.        Imports      of the investment              good are subject                 to a separate           tariff   (ri).      Revenues

from both tariffs          are distributed            as lump sum transfers                 (2) by the government                  back to the

representative         agent.

        The agent also accumulates                    net foreign bonds               (b) that pay an exogenously-given                   world

                                                                          4

where      Cm and C’           are the agent’s       consumption            of the importable             and exportable           goods.

Because       of the depreciating         capital    stock,     the agent also faces the standard                       capital     accu-

Finally,      the agent must        allocate    one unit of time between                   leisure    (e), labor in the import-

competing        sector,     and work     in the exportable              sector,     in accordance         with

and the fixed stock            of land T. The instantaneous                   utility     function    is taken      to be additively

separable       in consumptions           and leisure,        the functions             U(*, a), V(e) are increasing              concave

functions       of their respective        arguments,         and the two consumption                      goods     are assumed        to

be.normal        goods.      The agent’s       rate of time preference,                 p, is taken    to be constant.

meraire.      Consequently,        q = q’/X          and w = w’/X                are defined       to be the market          value of

Equations       (6a) and (6b) are the usual intertemporal                           envelope       conditions       that   relate the

marginal      utility    of consumption       of the two goods to the shadow                       value of wealth.        Equations

(6~) and (6d) similarly            relate work         effort        and leisure        to the shadow         value of wealth        and

to the real wage.           Taken jointly,     equations             (6a)-(6d)      define the usual rate of substitution

conditions      in consumption        and work         effort for the representative                 agent.    Equation     (se) links

the marginal        installation     costs of new capital,                 and hence, the rate of capital            accumulation,

to the market           price of capital.

         In addition,      the shadow        value     of wealth            and the market           value    of capital    evolve      in

accordance        with

                                                                       6

Since p and r are both           taken     to be fixed,     the ultimate       attainment        of a steady    state      is

possible   if and only if p = r. Henceforth             we assume this to be the case. This implies                 i = 0

everywhere,      so that X is always       at its steady-state        level x (to be determined           below).

      Finally,   in order to ensure that the intertemporal                budget    constraint       is met we need to

impose     the transversality     conditions



                                     lim       Abe-”    = tlim,     qKe-”      = 0.                                  (6h)

      The description of the macroeconomic equilibrium                         is completed by introducing              the

government budget constraint.              In our analysis the role of the government is a simple one.

In accordance with standard practice in the theory of domestic distortions,                            we assume that

lump-sum subsidies are available to redistribute                    tariff revenue:



                                   .c[Cm - F(K,L”)]               + &,(z,w         = *.                                 (69

This equation taken in conjunction                with the agent’s budget constraint                  (1) implies that

the economy’s current account, which determines the evolution of the stock of net foreign

 assets, may be expressed as



                         h = F(K, L”)        + G(T, L’)      - C” - C’ - +(I,             K) + rb.                      (1’)


 Our treatment       of the agent as a price taker, who therefore ignores the aggregate constraint

 (6i), is standard in the intertemporal            representative        agent framework.          One justification        is

 that being in fact just one of a large number of agents, he is unable to infer his share of the

total   tariff    revenue.       As discussed         by Corden           (1987, p. 87) this raises                 problems       of income

distribution        and our approach              requires        that     the government           use lump-sum                subsidies       to

bring    about the appropriate                after-tax         distribution      of income.’

        The complete            macroeconomic             equilibrium          is thus    described        by the static           equations

(6a) - (6e), with             X = 1, (3), together              with     the dynamic       equations        (l’),       (3) and (6g),       and

the transversality             condition      (6h).       The static        equations      define     the short-run              equilibrium

and may be solved for Cm, C’, !, L”,                        L*, I as the following            functions      of the stock of capital,

 independent          of the dynamic             variables,        it follows      that    the consumption                 of both     goods         is

 constant         through       time,      responding        only        to changes       in 1 or T’.          This          extreme     form        of

                                                                           8
consumption            smoothing        is a consequence           of the separability          of the utility       function       in con-

sumption        and employment               decisions.        Given the assumption            that both goods are normal                      in

consumption,            an increase       in the shadow           value of wealth          leads to a substitution              of savings

for consumption.               The consumption                 of both    goods falls,       the work      effort     in both        sectors

rises, and leisure           time is reduced.              An increase        in the stock      of capital      raises     the marginal

productivity           of labor       in the import-competing                  sector,      thereby     attracting        labor     to that

sector     away       from    the export          sector    and leisure.       An increase        in the market           value of capi-

tal will stimulate           investment.            An increase       in the tariff        on the importable             will reduce         the

consumption            of that good, but may raise or lower consumption                               of the exportable           good, de-

pending        upon how the reduced                  consumption         of the former        impacts      on the marginal            utility

of the latter.”           The protection            yielded     by the tariff     to the import-competing                  industry          will

stimulate        that sector,         attracting       labor away        from the export         sector    and leisure.           Finally,          a

higher      tariff     on the investment             good will     reduce the level of investment                   expenditure.”

         The evolution         of the system           is determined          by substituting          the short-run         equilibrium

(7a) - (7f) into the dynamic                  equations        (2), (6g) and (1’) an d ensuring              that the transversality

conditions           (6h) are met. It is readily              apparent       that in fact the dynamics           can be determined

sequentially.           Specifically       equations          (2) and (6g) (after          substitution)        constitute         a pair of

autonomous             differential      equations         in Q and K and are the core of the dynamics.                                 Note

that since this pair of equations                      is determined          in part      by the steady-state             shadow       value

of wealth,           1, the steady        state      in part     determines       the entire          dynamic    path.       But having

determined            IC and ~7, equation            (1’) then determines           the accumulation            of foreign        assets       b.



III.       DYNAMICS


         We begin by considering                  the dynamic       adjustment           paths of K and q. We first substitute

the solutions          for L”‘(.)      and I(.)      into equations       (6g) and (2) and linearize             around      the steady-

state equilibrium.             This enables the equilibrium                    dynamics      to be expressed          by the following

steady-state         equilibrium       values. i2 The determinant               of the terms            appearing           in (8) can be

value of capital.        4, may jump           instantaneously           in response      to new information.                 The stable

        To determine         the dynamics         of the current          account,      we substitute            for Cm(.),      C’(.),

IV.        ANALYSIS               OF TARIFF                 CHANGES

        With        the forward-looking           behavior       in the model,          the dynamic          adjustment           of the econ-

omy to tariff          changes     is determined            primarily     by changes            in the steady-state          capital     stock

and shadow            value of foreign         bonds.        The characterization                   of the steady-state           equilibrium

conditions           themselves     is presented           in the Appendix.             Any configuration               of the two tariffs

can be decomposed                 analytically          into a uniform        tariff,    in conjunction            with    an investment

                                                                        11

good).        IVe will       find it useful          first        to analyze            a uniform         change      in the two           tariffs     before

examining         the investment             tax component                  of differential            tariffs.



A.        A Uniform           Tariff     Increae


          Evaluating         the differentials          in (-4.8)           one can establish               that starting           from      zero initial

tariffs     (free trade),        the imposition                  of a small uniform              tariff     (dr’     = dr’ = dr > 0) implies

                                                                                                                                                         (14b)



          The expression           (14a) for the change in the capital                            stock       contains      two terms           within        the

brackets.       The first term,             the substitution                effect of the tariff,             indicates      that imposition                  of a

small uniform            tariff increases           the capital            stock        by shifting       labor into the import-competing

sector      and thereby           raising     the margirml                 product         of capital.            The second        term,      the wealth

effect of the tariff             on labor          supply,         while      generally          of opposite          sign to the first               term,      is

nevertheless           dominated          by the latter,             so that overall              the long-run            capital     stock          increases

unambiguously.

          Equation       (14b)         indicates       that,        beginning             from    free trade,          a uniform            tariff     on the

consumption             and investment              goods will lower                    the shadow         value of foreign          bonds (x).           Two

effects are involved.              The first        term within              the braces shows                that,    holding       the capital          stock

constant,        the effect of the tariff               on labor supply                    and consumption               is to improve               the trade

balance,       thereby         relaxing      the foreign             exchange             constraint        and lowering            the shadow           value

of foreign       bonds.

                                                                                   12
         Secondly,          the accumulation               of capital       following     the imposition            of the tariff     further

lowers      the shadow               value of foreign             bonds    by further      relaxing       the foreign      exchange       con-

straint.        In equation           (14b),      the term (-FK&~)/(FKK                         + FKLLz)       measures         the increase

in the capital              stock,    holding        labor        supply   constant,     that     will   accompany        the tariff.      The

term dY/dK              - r - 6 measures               the excess of the economywide                     marginal     product       of capital

relative        to the opportunity                cost of those funds. In general, this expression can be written

in terms of underlying                   preferences and technology as follows:

                                                                                                         + +)Fu    + Gu]’
                                                                                                                                           (15)


         Under free trade (se = ri = 0), equation (15) will be greater than or equal to zero, with

equality holding only in the limit as labor supply becomes perfectly inelastic (V”                                                -+ -co).13

With       a finitely        elastic labor supply, the tariff raises the agent’s supply of labor and causes

the accompanying                     accumulation            of capital to relax the foreign exchange constraint                             by

the amount dY/dK                      - r - 6 for each unit of capital that is purchased.                                In the presence

of a preexisting                 uniform          tariff     (r    > 0), the marginal product                 of capital dY/dK             will

exceed the equilibrium                    cost of capital r + 6 if and only if the labor supply is sufficiently

elastic.14 The last two terms in parentheses in the second term of equation (14b) therefore

measure the total amount of foreign exchange generated by the accumulation of capital in

response to the tariff.                 The term ~1 /(pi - r) converts the gain in foreign exchange from the

accumulation                of capital into present value terms by taking into account the adjustment

speed of the capital stock.



 Transitional           Dynamics

         The stable dynamic adjustment paths followed by Q and IL’ rue described by (9a, 9b)

and are a negatively-sloped                        saddlepath illustrated              by XX      in Figure 1. As long as no future

shock is anticipated,                 the system must lie on the stable locus XX.                          An unanticipated           increase

                                                                            13

This is represented                  by an upward                shift     of XX       to X’X’.             If initially,          the economy          is in

steady state at the point A lying on XX,                                    the new steady             state corresponding                  to the higher

uniform       tariff      is at B on X’X’                 with      a higher        capital       stock      and a higher            market        price of

capital    (although           FK = r + 6 at both points                        A and B).

      The instantaneous                  increase         in q given by (16) is represented                        by the jump               from A to C

on the new stable locus X’X’.                         Since the rate of capital                       accumulation            is proportional           to q,

capital    begins to accumulate                   with      the increase            in the uniform            tariff.     Along the saddlepath,

the rate of capital                 accumulation          declines          as the economy             approaches            the new steady            state

at point      B. As capital              accumulates,              the economy’s              stock     of net foreign             assets     declines,      as

established         in (12), reflecting              a deficit           in the current         account        of the balance               of payments.

      Besides           inducing        the agent to alter                  investment           expenditure,            the higher           tariff   alters

the agent’s            total    supply      of labor,            as well as the allocation                    of labor        supply         between       the

two   sectors          of the economy.                The initial             response         of labor        supply         (L     = 1 - f) to the

higher     tariff       can be decomposed                   into         a direct     substitution            effect,       aL/ar,          and a wealth

effect (aL/8x)(aI/&).                      As capital             accumulates,           the rise in the real wage over time pro-

duces an additional                   substitution          effect         on labor       supply,         whose     cumulative              magnitude            is

(aL/aI?)(aI?/&).                      Equations        (17a) - (17~)             divide        the long-run             responses           of total   labor

supply     and the sectoral               allocations            into the initial            substitution         and wealth          effects      and into

the substitution               effect that accompanies                      the accumulation                of capital:

As seen in (17a),             while      the substitution                  effect of the higher                tariff    increases        labor supply,

the wealth       effect associated                with        the loosening               of the foreign          exchange       constraint      has the

opposite       effect,     so that       the initial            employment                 effects     of the tariff         are ambiguous.           Over

time, as capital          accumulates,              employment               will unambiguously                   increase     relative    to its initial

response       to the higher           tariff.

         In terms        of the sectoral              allocation           of labor,          labor      supply       to the import-competing

sector     follows       the same pattern                   as overall       labor supply;              the initial     wealth     and substitution

effects     are offsetting,         but the additional                     substitution              effect created      by the rising         real wage

(as capital          accumulates)           increases              labor         supply      over time.            In the export           sector,    both

wealth       and substitution             effects initially                lower      labor      supply.       As the economy              accumulates

capital,      labor      supply       continues             to decline           in that       sector,     so that      the long-run          decline    in

employment            in the export              sector       is even greater.



B.        Increase       in the Tariff           on the Investment                    Good

          Given an initial         uniform           tariff,       an increase            in the tariff on the investment                   good repre-

sents a tax on the purchase                       price of investment                     goods that will lower               the steady-state          size

of the capital           stock,    as shown            in equation               (Isa):


                                                              dk           -(r      + @a22 < 0.
                                                              p=                     J


Note that equation                (18a) is similar             to the expression                for the change in the capital                 stock   from

an increase           in the uniform              tariff,      equation           (14a),      except      that the wealth            and substitution

                                                                                   15
effects      found     in the former                expression       are replaced           by -(r            + 6), which          represents         the

increased       steady-state         cost of a higher               purchase         price of capital.

      Starting        from an initial               positive     uniform      tariff,    an increase            in the tariff          on the invest-

ment good will have an ambiguous                                effect on the shadow                value of foreign           bonds,       as shown

by equation          (ISb):




Yote that equation               (1Sb) is similar               to the expression            for the change in the shadow                          value

of foreign       bonds        following        an increase          in the uniform               tariff,     equation        (14b),      except      that

the direct       substitution         effect on labor                supply       and consumption                     is absent        and the term

that captures          the change in the capital                    stock     tram the uniform                 tariff,     (-FKLL~)/(FKK                +

FI(LLE),        is replaced        by (r + ~)/(FKK                  + FKLLE).

      The ambiguity              in sign of equation                (Mb)      ’ d ue to the term dY/dK
                                                                              IS                                               - P - 6. Starting

from a positive          uniform          tariff,     equation       (15) shows         that the sign of dY/dK                    -r     - 6 depends

on the elasticity             of labor       supply.           If labor     supply      is very elastic,              dY/dK       - r - 6 will be

positive,      so that        an increase            in the tariff        on the investment                 good will        tighten      the foreign

exchange        constraint        and raise the shadow                      value of foreign               bonds.        If labor supply          is very

inelastic,      dY/dK         - r - 6 will be negative,                     and an increase                in the tariff      on the investment

good will        relax        the foreign           exchange        constraint,         thereby            lowering        the shadow        value      of

foreign      bonds.



 Transitional         Dynamics


          The dynamic           adjustment             followed      by Q and K following                      an increase        in the tariff        on

the investment            good is illustrated                  in Figure      2. Starting             from      the initial       market      price of

capital,      Q = 1 + ri, the increase                   in the investment              tariff     shifts      the I? = 0 locus upward                  by

the amount           of the tariff        increase.        The price of capital             initially        jumps        from point A to point

                                                                             16
C on the new stable locus X’X’.                     Since the initial     increase in Q is less than the increase

in the tariff, n/(1 + T’) declines end the capital                     stock begins to decrease. Eventually,               the

economy       reaches the new steady state at i3, having a lower capital                           stock and an increase

in the market       price of capital       by the amount       of the additional         tariff.   During the transition,

the economy’s         stock of net foreign assets increases.

      The initial      labor supply response of the agent to the tariff is driven entirely                          by wealth

effects.      If labor supply is elastic enough (so that dY/dK                         - r - 6 > 0), the higher tariff

will raise total labor supply and employment                        in each of the two sectors. If labor supply is

relatively     inelastic    (so that dY/dK         - r - 6 < 0), the higher investment              tariff will lower total

labor supply and employment                 in each of the two sectors. Regardless                 of the initial    response

of labor supply,           as capital    decreases the total          supply   of labor        and the supply         of labor

to the import-competing                 sector will decline         as the real wage falls.          On the other hand,

employment          in the export        sector     will increase as the capital            stock declines.         Equations

(19s) - (19c) divide the overall response of total labor supply and labor supply in the two

sectors into the wealth effect and the substitution                     effect that accompany           the decumulation

of capital:

V.      WELFARE               EFFECTS             OF TARIFFS

       Much of the focus of the immiserizing                  growth literature         has been on the welfare effects

of ezogenow flows of investment                    in the presence of a tariff.           As Neary and Ruane (1988)

                                                                17
have demonstrated,               an equally      important          analytical          focus involves            the computation          of the

welfare     effects of endogenour             flows      of investment               in response         to the imposition         of a tariff.

With      regard     to these endogenous               investment        flows,       Neary          and Ruane considered           two polar

cases of complete              mobility    or immobility             of capital,         so that in either            case the economy’s

response      to a tariff        change is instantaneous.                     By contrast,            the slow     adjustment       of capital

in our model          requires      an analysis         of the welfare           effects        of tariff   protection       over the entire

time path of instantaneous                  utility     of a representative                agent.

       We define the agent’s               instantaneous            utility      at time t, Z(t))           as

 ital stock        being      accumulated        in accordance                with     (9a).         We do this by linearizing              (20a)

 about its steady-state              level and then substituting                      the linearized         expression      into (20b),      and

 integrating,        to yield an approximate                  measure          of the welfare           of the representative            agent.

          We have already            remarked          that      the two        consumption              levels    C”,C’        always     adjust

 instantaneously              to their    respective          steady-state            levels         in response      to an unanticipated

 permanent          change in the tariff.             Leisure,      being a function                 of K, follows     a transitional        path,

 which      may be linearly           approximated             by

 Accordingly,          Z(t)     and W may be approximated                            linearly        by the expressions

                                                                          18

The fist    term in (22b) represents              the agent’s welfare if the steady state were attained

instantaneously.      The second term reflects the adjustment                     to this due to the fact that the
steady state is reached only gradually               along the transitional         path.


A.    Increase     in the Uniform        Tariff

     The effect of a higher uniform               tariff on the level of instantaneous            welfare Z(t)   is given

of a uniform       tariff        has the following        effects          on the short-run          and steady-state             levels of

The total   change in welfare                from the introduction                of the uniform           tariff    can then be calcu-

lated as follows




Equations       (25a),      (25b),      and (26) allow      us to establish                the following       proposition:



     Proposition              1.        Starting   from    free trade,           the imposition          of a uniform         tariff   raises

     instantaneous            utility      in the short    run while           lowering       it in the long run.

     In common            with     the usual static       welfare          analysis    of tariff changes            in the neighborhood

of free trade, our analysis               finds that a smalI uniform                  tariff leaves total welfare          (as measured

                                                                      20
by the discounted                value of instantaneous                   utility)         unchanged,              but it does so in a way

that     involves      an intertemporal              tradeoff        in utility.            Figure         3 illustrates            the behavior              of

instantaneous          utility     over time, where the shaded areas are the same in discounted                                                         value

terms.

       The general           expression         for the change in welfare resulting                                  from increasing                  a pre-

existing    uniform        tariff is given by equation                    (27):



       dW   1
                         z(FLL;”           - Cr)       - FLL:
       dr = F’                                                        I
                                               [GL(LyL’h’        -     L”,L;)          +   (L;CLf      -     (I+      T)L~C;)]~                   5     0.

                                                                                                                                                          (27)

The first term in this expression                      is the welfare cost of the change in the uniform                                                 tariff,

holding     the capital           stock fixed.       The second term is the welfare                                 cost associated              with        the

worsening       of the initial          distortion      as capital              accumulates.               The latter             welfare cost is in-

fluenced     by the speed of adjustment                     of the capital                 stock, with a more rapid adjustment

causing a greater deterioration                    in welfare.r5

         When adjustment              costs are linear (+IJ = 0), adjustment                                is instantaneous             (~1 + -00)

and the term            c(r/(pr      - r) equals one.                In the other               limiting           case, as adjustment                   costs

become infinitely            convex ($11 -+ oo), the term rr/(/~i                               - r) approaches               zero. In this latter

case, adjustment             of the economy             to a higher               tariff    becomes infinitely                    slow, so that              the

discounted          value of the increase in foreign exchange                                   from the tariff becomes negligible.

These two polar cases of adjustment                         costs correspond                     to the distinction                  made by Neary

and Ruane           (1988) between perfect capital                        mobility          and perfect capital                    immobility.            Like

Nesry and Ruane, we find that welfare is unambiguously                                              lower for an economy with mobile

capital     relative      to the economy             with immobile                   capital,       since the accumulation                   of capital

worsens the initial               distortion      produced           by the tariff.              In addition,            it can be shown that
 the adjustment            speed of the economy                 to a higher tariff varies inversely                               with the elasticity

                                                                            21

of production         to the higher tariff           is borne either by the supply                         of labor,       or by the stock        of

capital.     rcspectively.‘6



B.       Increase     in the Tariff      on the Investment                Good

        The welfare       analysis      of an increase          in the tariff              on the imported              investment      good is

analogous         to an increase        in the uniform              tariff,      but is somewhat                simpler       because       of the

absence      of the direct        effect on the consumption-leisure                              choice.     Parallel      to (24) and (24’)

will    be positive      if labor supply            is sufficiently           elastic          and will    be negative        otherwise.”             If

labor      supply     is elastic,      the increase          in the tariff              will     cause a decrease            in consumption

instantaneous                  utility.        Over time, labor supply                       will decrease         below    its initial     level, causing

a rise over time in instantaneous                                   utility.

         If labor supply                  is inelastic,           the increase           in the tariff       on the investment             good will pro-

duce an increase                   in consumption                  (since dY/dK              - r - 6 < 0 implies            a relaxing      of the foreign

exchange            constraint                as capital          decumulates)            and a decline            in the work       effort.         Instanta-

neous utility             will initially               jump       upward         and will continue              to rise in response          to increasing

leisure as the capital                        stock      decreases.            Figure    4 shows      the response           of instantaneous            utility

for the cues              of elastic            and inelastic           labor supply.

         Starting             from an initial                  non-negative         uniform        tariff,      the total    change in welfare             from

the change in the tariff                         on the investment                  good can be shown                   to be the following

Equation            (30) is sufficient                  to demonstrate              the following:



         Proposition                     2.     (Second           Best Tariff       Policy).      Starting        from an initial         positive      level of

         a   uniforms          tariff,        an increase          in the tariff on the investment                      good will always         be welfare

         improving.                Therefore,              if the tariff         on the consumption                 good cannot           be lowered,         the

         second best optimal                          tariff     policy will set the tariff             on the investment            good higher than

         the tariff            on the consumption                      good.

         Proposition               2 embodies                  two general         principles.         First,      if all three goods (importable

consumption,                   exportable,              and investment)                 were general         equilibrium       substitutes,          the tariff

on the investment                    good would                 be set lower than the tariff on the consumption                             good; see e.g.,

Lipsey         and Lancaster                   (1956).          In our model,            the imported           capital     good and the exportable

good are general                     equilibrium                complements             in the long-run            equilibrium       of the model:                 an

                                                                                        23
increase in the tariff on the investment                         good reduces imports       of the investment          good and

induces a reallocation            of labor towards the exportable                   sector, thus increasing            output        of

the exportable       good. Consequently,                standard      theory of second best trade policies (see e.g.,

Bertrand     and Vanek (1971), Lloyd (1974)) implies                         that the direct welfare loss from raising

the tariff on the investment                good (and thus reducing              its imports)         is more than offset by

the indirect       welfare gains as demand                  spills over from both the exportable                 good and the

investment      good onto the importable                    consumption        good, causing          a large welfare-raising

increase in consumption                good imports.

      The second general                principle      embodied       in Proposition       2 is a result of Findlay                and

Wellisz     (1976) that factor taxes may raise welfare by correcting                             the factor market             distor-

tions created       by the consumption                 tariff.     In our model,       the investment          tariff offsets the
distorted      rental rate on capital               produced       by a consumption        tariff,    by acting like a factor

tax on capital       that raises the cost of capital                  goods and the steady-state               required        rate of

return on capital.


VI.       TARIFF           REFORM

      Many economies             are characterized           by tariff structures      in which the tariffs on consump

tion goods exceed those on investment                      goods. Discussions of trade policy in such economies
often focus on issues pertaining                     to tariff reform.       An extensive        theoretical      literature       has

shown that in a static context,                 two simple methods            exist to ensure that piecemeal               (incom-

plete) tariff reforms will be welfare improving.                          The concetlino        method proposes lowering

the highest      tariff,     see Bertrand           and Vanek (1971),          Corden     (1974);       the method        of radial

reduction      advocates       reducing       tariffs by the same proportion;              see Foster and Sonnenschein

(1970), Bruno (1972).

      Propositions         3 and 4 (proofs of whch are provided                  in the Appendix)          yield results which

integrate    the piecemeal            tariff reform literature’s          concern regarding          the welfare consequences

of tariff-induced          relative     price changes with the immiserizing                 growth literature’s           concerns

                                                                     24
regarding               the welfare            consequences           of tariff-induced              changes        in the capital             stock.



         Proposition                 3.         (Concertina           Method).           Starting         from initial          tariff levels         T’,       TV,     with

         7’    <     7’,    a reduction              in the tariff        on the consumption                  good is welfare               improving.

4s shown             by equation               (A.23),        there are two components                      to the welfare         gains in Proposition

3.       The       tirst     is the static              gain.      holding      the capital           stock      constant.            The second                      is the

intertemporal                gain created                by the welfare-improving                     decline in the capital                   stock.



         Proposition                 4.           (Method          of Radial           Reductions).            Starting          from       initial         tariff       lev-

         els     T’,T~,       with        7’     <     TV,    a radial       reduction           in the two          tariffs,     related          by dri/si                 =

         pdF/+,              (p > 0), will be welfare                      improving,            as long as p <           I=(    1+     T~)/T~(~            +    7’).       In

         particular,           the case /J = 1 corresponds                         to a proportionate                 reduction          in the two tariffs

         and clearly            satisfies         the criterion            for the tariff         reduction         to be welfare             improving.

          As shown            in the Appendix,                  a radial      tariff reduction             will result in a static              and intertem-

poral welfare                gain from lowering                   the consumption                tariff     that will be partially                 of&t               by the

inter-temporal               welfare           loss caused by the reduction                       in the investment               tariff.      As long as the

tariff        reduction        is proportionate,                   however,       the welfare             gain from the former                     will outweigh

the loss from                the latter.

         The concertina                method            and method            of radial reductions              provide         good theoretical                       guid-

ance for piecemeal                    tariff         reforms,      especially          if such reforms          are part of a longer-run                                move

towards            free trade.            However,              whether       for revenue           or for other           domestic           policy            reasons,

there are few, if any, developing                                 countries       that adopt              free trade as a goal of tariff                         reform.

Rather,            tariff    reform            generally        attempts        to lower         the average           tariff     rate and to establish

greater          uniformity           of tariff          levels,     without       eliminating              them.       The twin            goals of a lower

average rate and greater                             uniformity           of tariffs      frequently         imply      that      the lowest                tariffs       are

raised,         at the same time                       that      the highest           tariffs    are lowered,            thereby           sandwiching                   the

other         tariffs       in between.              For example,            in Korea        between          1966 and 1968 the average                                 tariff

                                                                                   25
on nondurable              consumer             goods was lowered                   from 74.2 percent              to 43.2 percent,             while     at the

same time           the average tariffs                  on transport              equipment          and on machinery                 were raised from

12.8 percent            to 19.8 percent                  and from               25.5 percent         to 47.0 percent               respectively         (Frank,

Kim,       and Westphal                (1975, p. 61)).                 As another            example,         Chile’s     tariff     reform       of January

16, 1975 lowered               most       tariff rates           but raised           tariff    rates on capital           good imports               that had

previously         been subject                 to low tariff rates                (de la Cuadra            and Hachette             (1991)).

        Because         the existing             piecemeal             tariff     reform       literature       takes     factor      supplies        BS given,

that literature           cannot         offer much guidance                      with     respect        to the intertemporal             welfare       effects

associated         with       tariff     reforms             that resemble            the Korean            or Chilean        programs.           Under      our

assumption           that      investment               goods are general                  equilibrium          complements             with      exportable

goods (as discussed                in connection                with      Proposition           2), we are able to establish                   the following

result:



          Proposition             5.       (The Two-Handed                        C oncertina        Method).           Starting       from initial        tariff

          levels T’, rC, with              7’     <    7c,     an increase           in the tariff           on the investment                good,     in con-

        junction        with      a reduction                in the tariff on the consumption                       good, is welfare              improving.



VII.         CONCLUSION


          The preceding                sections        have laid out a model                       that      describes      the reaction           of a com-

petitive      economy             to tariff           protection.               As in standard              analyses      of tariff      protection,         our

representative             agent alters               consumption                decisions      and the allocation                 of labor       among pro-

ductive       activities        in response              to a tariff            on the consumption               good.       As in the literature                 on

immiserizing            growth,          the agent accumulates                       capital      in response           to a tariff on the consump-

tion good.

          Our model           contributes             to the welfare               analysis      of protection           by adding         an endogenous

labor      supply       choice, incorporating                      costs         of adjustment              to the installation           of capital,        and

analysis       of protection              in a direction      that highlights           the cost of the intertemporal                        distortions

produced         by protective               trade policies.

          The analysis            has led, in the context                 of a specific         factors      model       of production,               to an

integration           of the immiserizing                  growth      literature’s         concern         for the welfare           consequences

of factor        adjustment               to tariffs       at fixed       relative     prices      with      the piecemeal                tariff     reform

literature’s          concern        for the welfare          consequences            of tariff-induced             relative     price changes             at

fixed factor           endowments.              Among        our welfare          propositions            on piecemeal           tariff      reform,       we

believe that Proposition                     5, regarding        the “two-handed                concertina”          method        of tariff reform,

is of practical            importance           for the evaluation              of tariff      reforms      which       raise tariffs         on capital

goods as part of a move toward                             a relatively        uniform,        but non-zero,            tariff   level.

          Implicit       throughout            the paper’s          welfare      analysis       is the importance                of the time path

of instantaneous                utility      in response       to the imposition               of tariffs     or to various           types of tariff

reform.         Increases         in the consumption                  tariff     and decreases            in the investment                 tariff     cause

instantaneous              utility        to be higher        in the short            run than in the long run.                      Consequently,

our results           suggest        that empirical          evaluation         of any given protectionist                  policy        or piecemeal

tariff reform            effort should          not rely solely on short-run                    welfare      results,      since the sign of the

welfare        integral         measuring        the discounted              change in the entire              time path of instantaneous

utility      for any given change in tariff                         policy     may be opposite               to the sign of the change in

short-run            utility.

          Future       work      on the intertemporal                 welfare        consequences           of tariff     policy      could usefully

employ         a more general specification                    of the production               technology        in order to generalize                  this

paper’s        results.         However,         the essential         welfare       results     of this paper           will    probably            remain

unchanged             as long as investment                  goods are general equilibrium                      substitutes          for exportable

goods, a condition                   that appears          to characterize           most import-substituting                      trade regimes              in

developing            countries.

Given that +1(6K,           K) = 1, (6e) implies a steady-state            shadow value of capital

Furthermore,          using (A&),         (A.6b)   and noting from footnote      7 that $K(~K,         K) = 0, (6g) implies

Consider     the second and third rows of equation              (A.8), namely




Recalling     R = 1121- ~1, and eliminating          d6, yields


                                                                                                                               (A.11)

Noting      the expression    for 1~ (see (A.5)),         we see that when tariffs are initially        zero, that CL&    = FLCX =

       The overall welfare loss described               by (27) in the general case arises because of the distortions                caused by

the pre-existing       tariff. This reduces to 0. when T = 0.

     These propositions           are based on the assumption               that 9 < 7’.

     Proposition       3 can be established          as follows. Starting         from 9 > 0, (A.lO)        can be expressed as


                             d-w
                             -   =                                                                                                      (A.10’)
                              dsc

Combining        this equation      with (A.ll)      and (A.15),     which hold for arbitrary           ri, rca and using the definition       of

                                             =                       (r+6)+r-an-rCFLL;                                                    (A.22)


we obtain

From (A.8) we can show dI?/drC                   > 0, while a sufficient condition            for the coefficient of this term in (A.23)          to

be negative is that ri < 7’. The remaining                    term in (A.23) can also be shown to be negative,                 implying      that
dW/d+       < 0, hs stated in Proposition             3.

     To obtain       Propositions         4 and 5, we first derive the analogous                welfare effects for ri.    Equations    (A.17),

(A.18),     and (A.21)       all hold for arbitrary         predetermined             values of the tariff rates ri, rc.    Combining       these

relationships,      one can establish


                                                                                                                                          (A.24)


and noting (A.22), enables (A.24)                 to be written      89




 From (A.8) we can readily show dI?/dr’                    < 0, while as before a sufficient condition          for the term in parentheses

in (A.25) to be negative is that r’ < 7’. These results together                             imply dW/dr’    > 0.
      To establish       Proposition       4, first write
                                                             w = W(rC.7’)

the differential       of which is



                                                       dW = $$dr”         + $dr’.


Observe that (A.23)          and (A.25)      are of the form


                                                            dW ,&
                                                            dTi    dr’
                                                            dW    odI?

where 7 < 0, and for r’ c +, 0 < 0. Thus



                                                 dW = 9 gdrc
                                                       I-
                                                                     + sdr’
                                                                           -1         + ydrc.


Consider      now a radial reduction          in T’ and ri specified by di/         ri = pdrc/rc.    The net effect on wealth      is



                                                                                                                                 (A.26)

The reduction          in the capital      stock from the lower tu        on consumption        goods is welfare improving,       while

the higher capital         stock resulting     from the higher taw on investment            is welKare deteriorating.     Using (A.8),

equation      (A.26) becomes




It is easy to show that a sufficient condition              for the term in parentheses         to be positive is that     p < rC(l +
r’)/s’(l+      r’).    If this condition     is met, a radial reduction    in tariffs is welfare improving,       thereby establishing
Proposition       4.

       Proposition       5 follows immediately        by combining    the results of (A.23)         and (A.25),    namely dW/dF          <
0,dWfdi        > 0.

not emphasize        differentA      tariffs (see their footnote             4). Our specification          of differential      tariffs on consumer

and investment            goods was motivated,           in part, by Krueger’s            (1983) survey of protective              trade policies.        III
that survey, Krueger            (p. 8) noted that the “emphasis                 on import       substitution        led to...implicit     subsidiratlon

of capital     goods imports.        Although      one might think              that import      substitution        policies would be across the
board in their application,               almost all countries         with overvalued           exchange       rates were reluctant            to impose
surcharges and high duties on machinery                    and equipment            imports      for fear of discouraging          investment.”

changes in either of the two tariff rates, since changed in either rate will alter the shadow value of wealth, the

market price of capital, and cause the capital stock to change over time. These overall eRecta are discusned

        “There       is no general       agreement               on the magnitude        of the compensated          supply      elasticity     of labor in
developing         countries.      Many early models, such an Lewis (1954) and Rani                               and Fei (1961) emphasized               the

existence of surplw             labor in a non utility-maximizing                    framework.    Sen (1966) first showed that the existence
of surplus labor in a utility-maximizing                           model impliu        that the compensated        (i.e., X constant)         labor supply

elasticity       be infinite.     Consequently,                our model treats labor supply elasticities             that are bounded            below by
the standard          trade model assumption                     of a zero supply elasticity       and above by the infinitely-elastic              supply

assumption          of a surplus labor economy.

        ISWhen + is sufficiently              large, it is possible for a further             increase to lead to an immediate                reduction     in
instantaneous          welfare (and continuous                   losses thereafter).     This may occur if dI/d+ > 0.
