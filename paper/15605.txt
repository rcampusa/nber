The Enduring Impact of the American Dust Bowl: Short and Long-run Adjustments to Environmental
Catastrophe

                                             ABSTRACT

The 1930's American Dust Bowl was an environmental catastrophe that greatly eroded sections of
the Plains. Analyzing new data collected to identify low-, medium-, and high-erosion counties, the
Dust Bowl is estimated to have immediately, substantially, and persistently reduced agricultural land
values and revenues. During the Depression and through at least the 1950's, there was limited reallocation
of farmland from activities that became relatively less productive. Agricultural adjustments, such
as reallocating land from crops to livestock, recovered only 14% to 28% of the initial agricultural cost.
The economy adjusted predominately through migration, rather than through capital inflows and increased
industry.

A recurrent theme in economics is that “short-run” impacts are mitigated in the “long-run”
by economic agents’ adjustments. The idea is central to the impact of global climate change
(Mendelsohn et al. 1994; Deschenes and Greenstone 2007; Dell et al. 2009; Fisher et al. 2009;
Guiteras 2009; Schlenker and Roberts 2009). Even small gradual changes in climate may trig-
ger large and permanent local environmental collapse (Scheﬀer et al. 2001; Diamond 2005).
   Theoretical diﬀerences between short-run and long-run eﬀects are well-known, but empiri-
cal evidence is needed to gauge the speed and magnitude of long-run adjustment in diﬀerent
contexts (see, e.g., Blanchard and Katz 1992; Bresnahan and Ramey 1993; Foster and Rosen-
zweig 1995; Duﬂo 2004; Chetty et al. 2009). Historical settings provide a unique opportunity
to identify adjustments that may occur over long periods of time (Carrington 1996; Margo
1997; Davis and Weinstein 2002; Miguel and Roland 2006; Collins and Margo 2007; Redding
and Sturm 2008).
   This paper analyzes the aftermath of large and permanent soil erosion during the 1930’s
that became widely known as the “American Dust Bowl.” The Dust Bowl substantially
reduced lands’ potential for agricultural production, and erosion varied across counties even
within a state. Detailed data allow for an examination of adjustment from 1940 to the
present. The analysis here focuses on the speed and magnitude of adjustment in the agri-
cultural sector, the resulting diﬀerence in short-run and long-run agricultural costs, and the
geographic reallocation of labor and capital.
   The 1930’s Dust Bowl period was one of extreme soil erosion on the American Plains,
unexpectedly brought about by the combination of severe drought and intensive land-use.
Strong winds swept topsoil from the land in large dust storms, and occasional heavy rains
carved deep gullies in the land. By the 1940’s, many Plains areas had cumulatively lost more
than 75% of their original topsoil.
   The eﬀects of the Dust Bowl are interpreted here within a model of agricultural production,
in which land allocations are ﬁxed in the short-run. Immediately following the Dust Bowl,
the true cost is capitalized into land values. In the long-run, proﬁts partly recover as land
is reallocated toward activities less aﬀected by erosion. Proﬁts decrease by more than land
values in the short-run, as land values anticipate the partial recovery in proﬁts. Further, in
a simple general equilibrium framework, adjustment may also occur through out-migration
and an expansion of local industry.
   Crucial for the empirical analysis is the existence of local variation in erosion following
the Dust Bowl. In particular, the analysis is based on a comparison of areas that became
severely, moderately, or lightly eroded. Erosion levels are combined with census data to form
a balanced panel of counties from 1910 to the 1990’s. The regressions compare changes in
land values and other outcomes in more-eroded and less-eroded counties within the same


                                              1
state, after adjusting for diﬀerences in pre-Dust Bowl characteristics.
   The Dust Bowl is estimated to have imposed substantial long-run costs on Plains agricul-
ture. From 1930 to 1940, more-eroded counties experienced large and permanent declines
in agricultural land values. The per-acre value of farmland declined by 28% in high-erosion
counties and 17% in medium-erosion counties, relative to changes in low-erosion counties. If
low-erosion counties were not aﬀected, either negatively by erosion or positively by general
equilibrium spillovers, the land value declines indicate a total capitalized agricultural loss
from the Dust Bowl of $153 million in 1930 dollars ($1.9 billion in 2007 dollars). Given aver-
age land values in 1930, the loss is represented by the value of farmland the size of Oklahoma.
   Agricultural costs from the Dust Bowl appear to have been mostly persistent. More-
eroded counties experienced substantial immediate declines in agricultural revenues per-acre
of farmland, and lower revenues largely persisted. Two calculations, based on the persis-
tence of lower revenues and a comparison between revenues and land values, imply that
long-run adjustments recovered only 14% to 28% of the initial agricultural cost. Because the
Dust Bowl permanently reduced the productive potential of a ﬁxed factor, it might not be
surprising that full recovery was not experienced in eroded areas.
   Observed adjustments in agricultural land-use were limited and slow, consistent with the
estimated persistent short-run cost. Total farmland remained similar, reﬂecting an inelas-
tic demand for land in non-agricultural sectors. Within the agricultural sector, there were
potentially productive adjustments: the relative productivity of land decreased for crops
(compared to animals) and for wheat (compared to hay). Through the Great Depression
and at least the 1950’s, however, there was little adjustment of land from crops to pasture
or from wheat to hay.1
   The Great Depression itself may have partly accounted for limited agricultural adjustment
and persistence in costs. In particular, credit constraints may have been important: more-
eroded areas experienced more bank failures during the 1930’s, and there was greater land-use
adjustment in more-eroded areas that had more banks prior to the 1930’s. In contrast, there
is little evidence that tenant farming slowed land-use adjustment. New Deal government pro-
grams do not appear to explain the lack of adjustment, at least not in more-eroded counties
relative to less-eroded counties, as payments were not targeted toward more-eroded counties.
   Migration was the main margin of short-run and long-run economic adjustment. Pop-
ulation declined substantially from 1930 to 1940 in more-eroded counties relative to less-
eroded counties, along with out-migration from the entire region. The Depression may have
   1
    Overall technological innovation may have responded to the Dust Bowl, e.g., hybrid corn (Griliches
1957; Sutch 2008), but the within-region analysis is unable to identify aggregate shifts in the technological
frontier. Aggregate technological change does not appear to have been substantially erosion-biased.



                                                     2
limited outside employment opportunities and, by 1940, labor adjustment remained incom-
plete: unemployment was higher, a proxy for wages was lower, and the labor-capital ratio
in agriculture was higher. Equilibrium was reestablished by 1960 through further declines
in population rather than through capital inﬂows and an increase in local industry.
   Overall, the Dust Bowl is estimated to have imposed substantial and persistent costs
on Plains agriculture. Adjustment took place mainly through decreased land values and
population, while agricultural and industrial adjustments were limited and slow. The analysis
helps in understanding a major episode in American economic history. The experience of the
American Dust Bowl highlights that agricultural costs from environmental destruction need
not be mostly mitigated by agricultural adjustments and that mass out-migration may result.
   The paper is organized as follows. Section I provides historical background on the Dust
Bowl. Section II presents a model of agricultural production in the short-run and long-run,
and discusses in a simple general equilibrium framework how population, industry, and non-
eroded locations may also adjust to the Dust Bowl erosion. Section III describes the measure-
ment of erosion levels and presents baseline summary statistics by erosion level. Section IV
outlines the empirical methodology, Section V presents the results, and Section VI concludes.
I       Historical Background
In the late nineteenth century, agricultural production began to expand substantially on
the American Plains. World War I temporarily increased demand for American agricul-
tural goods, and the Plains’ native grasslands became increasingly plowed up for crops.
Drought conditions during the 1930’s, and especially severe Plains droughts in 1934 and
1936, led to widespread crop failure. The loss of ground cover made farmland susceptible to
self-perpetuating dust storms (wind erosion) and substantial runoﬀ during occasional heavy
rains (water erosion).
   Dust storms blew enormous quantities of topsoil oﬀ Plains farmland. On “Black Sunday”
in 1935, one such storm blanketed East Coast cities in a haze. Due to repeated blowing soil on
the Plains, some residents were aﬄicted with dust pneumonia.2 The Dust Bowl period contin-
ued through 1938 and ended with the return of wetter weather and increased ground cover.3
   The Dust Bowl was caused by a combination of prolonged severe drought and intensive
land-use. Unsustainable exploitation of land is emphasized by most historical accounts (SCS
    2
     Cutler et al. 2007 do not detect late-life health eﬀects among cohorts from regions more exposed in
utero to the Dust Bowl and drought (measured by crop yields).

     Worster (1979, p.30) reports a substantial wind erosion area in 1940, which Geoﬀ Cunfer (since
publishing) discovered to be erroneous: based on a 1940 USDA document, which cites a December 8, 1939
Washington Evening Star newspaper article, which in turn cites information provided by SCS technicians.
The displayed 1940 wind erosion region was projected in 1939, and the 1940 USDA document states that
the projections proved incorrect and that there turned out to be little blowing.

1938).4 Some feared that the region would become the once-imagined “American Desert” if
private land-use practices were allowed to continue (Science 1934; News-week 1936). Hansen
and Libecap (2004) present evidence that externalities contributed to the Dust Bowl: while
farmers could discourage wind erosion by fallowing land or converting cropland to grasslands
and pasture, much of the beneﬁt would be captured by neighboring farms.
   New Deal government programs attempted to restrict agricultural production, though the
initial motivation was to raise prices, increase farm incomes, and stimulate the economy.
The 1933 Agricultural Adjustment Act paid farmers to reduce planted acreages, and the
government also purchased and destroyed livestock (Leuchtenburg 1963; Saloutos 1982).
   When the Supreme Court declared aspects of New Deal policies unconstitutional, agri-
cultural policy shifted toward “conservation” (Rasmussen and Baker 1979; Phillips 2007).
Eﬀorts to increase prices were combined with erosion control in the 1935 and 1936 Soil Con-
servation and Domestic Allotment Acts and the 1938 Agricultural Adjustment Act. The Soil
Conservation Service (SCS) was established to run soil erosion control projects that were
aimed at demonstrating the eﬀectiveness of recommended soil conservation techniques (SCS
1937). The adjustments included converting cropland to grassland, planting alternate strips
of cash crops and drought-resistant crops, and fallowing land with productive cover.5 Soil
conservation districts and increased farm sizes may have lowered coordination problems and
helped prevent the Dust Bowl’s reoccurrence (Hansen and Libecap 2004).6
   Figure 1 presents aggregate changes in agriculture and population on the Plains over
the twentieth century.7 Average farmland per-acre became less valuable from 1910 to 1940
(Panels A and B), partly due to an increase in total farmland (Panel C). Total farmland
stopped increasing in the 1940’s, and average land values and revenues began to rise.8 Dur-
ing the 1930’s, cropland per-acre of farmland decreased and fallow land per-acre of cropland
increased (Panels D and E). Farm sizes increased steadily after 1930 (Panel F). Total popula-

remained similar on the Plains, though the data may obscure important adjustments in fallowing and
cropland management (Hansen 2005).

     Two additional techniques were retaining crop residues to provide ground cover and plowing along
contour lines. The SCS also took responsibility over the administration of some Civilian Conservation
Corps work camps, which employed workers on public projects to reduce unemployment. Some of the work
focused on preventing erosion: terracing land, rehabilitating gullies, and planting trees as wind breaks.

     Historical accounts of government programs imply a substantial impact on land-use (e.g., Hurt 1985).

     Aggregate numbers are calculated by summing over the same 769 Plains counties in every reported
period. The exception is Panel E: following Hansen and Libecap (2004), the sample is restricted to 587
counties for which comparable fallow data is available from 1925 to 1964.

     The value of farmland is divided by the CPI, as land is an asset whose value will change with the price
of consumption. The value of revenue is divided by the PPI for all farm products, to focus on changes in
productivity rather than output prices.

tion grew at a roughly constant rate from 1910 to 2000, with slower growth from 1930 to 1950
(Panel G), and the fraction of people in rural areas declined (Panel H). From 1930 to 1940,
total population declined between 3% and 7% in the ﬁve central Plains states (Oklahoma,
Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota).
   The Dust Bowl was unexpected and likely increased farmers’ expectations of future drought
and erosion in all areas of the Plains, or at least created substantial uncertainty. All farmers
may have had incentives to adjust to the Dust Bowl, regardless of whether their land was
eroded. Conservation incentives may have contributed to aggregate decreases in cropland
and increases in fallowing.
   By contrast, it was observable which particular lands were eroded after the Dust Bowl. The
subsequent analysis focuses on relative changes among diﬀerentially eroded counties, con-
trolling for state-wide changes that capture changing expectations about future drought or
erosion and other aggregate shocks (e.g., Great Depression, World War II, technology, prices).
   Relative adjustments to the Dust Bowl should reﬂect the substantial decrease in produc-
tivity due to soil erosion. If crop production is sensitive to soil quality, then farmers may shift
more-eroded land into animal pasture. Similarly, farmers may shift land from soil-sensitive
crops (wheat) to erosion-resistant crops (hay). The Dust Bowl is also associated with sub-
stantial out-migration, famously described in Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath. There is
little empirical evidence, however, that separates Dust Bowl migration and agricultural ad-
justment from aggregate changes in Plains’ population and agricultural production.9
II       Theoretical Framework
II.A       Agricultural Production: Short-run vs. Long-run
Agricultural production may be slow to adjust following the Dust Bowl, delaying the partial
recovery of proﬁts. Decreased land values capitalize the true agricultural cost of the Dust
Bowl, anticipating the partial recovery of proﬁts. In such a model, land values initially de-
crease by less than proﬁts only to the extent that agricultural adjustments will mitigate the
initial cost (in present discounted value).10
   In characterizing relative adjustment to the Dust Bowl, assume that a farmer chooses pro-
duction decisions in every period to maximize the present discounted value of proﬁts. The
farmer produces one good in a competitive market and allocates a share 𝜃 of land between
two production technologies, F1 (𝜃, 𝑉1 ) and F2 (1 − 𝜃, 𝑉2 ). Variable inputs 𝑉 can be adjusted
     9
     All migrants from the region may have been inappropriately (and derogatorily) lumped together as
“Okies” ﬂeeing the Dust Bowl. Worster (1979, p51) describes interviews with migrants registering at
Federal Emergency Relief oﬃces around the country: only 12% of families from Oklahoma attributed their
migration to farm failure, 17% of families from Kansas, and 16% of families from Colorado.
  10
     Future periods are discounted, so long-run mitigation is more eﬀective when it occurs sooner. The true
agricultural cost includes both “short-run” and “long-run” costs, weighted appropriately.


                                                    5
quickly and are purchased in each period at a constant price (e.g., labor). The production
technologies reﬂect methods or ﬁxed inputs that can only be adjusted slowly (e.g., cropland
vs. pasture or wheat vs. hay).
   (i) Initial Equilibrium. For a given land allocation 𝜃, the farmer chooses variable in-
puts to obtain the maximal proﬁt in technology 1 (Π1 (𝜃)) and technology 2 (Π2 (1 − 𝜃)). The
                                                           ′        ′
farmer chooses an optimal land allocation 𝜃 such that Π1 (𝜃) = Π2 (1 − 𝜃).11 The farmer ob-
tains an initial proﬁt 𝜋 𝐼 = Π1 (𝜃)+Π2 (1−𝜃). The value of land equals the present discounted
                   𝜋𝐼
value of proﬁts, 1−𝛽  , where 𝛽 is a constant discount factor.12
   (ii) Permanent Shock to Relative Proﬁtability. At 𝑡 = 0, the unexpected Dust
Bowl permanently decreases the relative proﬁtability of the ﬁrst technology: Π1 (𝜃) decreases
to 𝛿Π1 (𝜃), where 𝛿 ∈ (0, 1). In the “short-run,” when 𝑡 < 𝑇 , variable inputs can ad-
just but the land allocation is constrained at its previous level (𝜃 = 𝜃). The land allo-
                                      ′        ′
cation constraint binds because 𝛿Π1 (𝜃) < Π2 (1 − 𝜃). The farmer earns a short-run proﬁt
𝜋 𝑆𝑅 = 𝛿Π1 (𝜃) + Π2 (1 − 𝜃).
   In the “long-run,” when 𝑡 = 𝑇 , assume (for now) that the land allocation can adjust
                                                       ′
costlessly. A new optimal 𝜃ˆ is chosen such that 𝛿Π1 (𝜃) ˆ = Π′ (1 − 𝜃).
                                                                       ˆ The farmer earns a
                                                                 2
long-run proﬁt 𝜋 𝐿𝑅 = 𝛿Π1 (𝜃)ˆ + Π (1 − 𝜃).
                                    2
                                          ˆ

   (iii) Long-run Changes in Proﬁts. When the binding land allocation constraint is
lifted in the long-run, land is shifted from the ﬁrst technology (𝜃ˆ < 𝜃) and proﬁts increase
                                                              ′            ′
(𝜋 𝑆𝑅 < 𝜋 𝐿𝑅 < 𝜋 𝐼 ). In particular, proﬁt increases by 𝜃ˆ𝜃 Π2 (1 − 𝑥) − 𝛿Π1 (𝑥)𝑑𝑥; intuitively,
                                                         ∫

the diﬀerence in marginal proﬁt is regained for each land unit adjusted. Taking a ﬁrst-
order Taylor expansion of each marginal proﬁt function around 𝜃, the term simpliﬁes to
1                  ′
2
  (𝜃 − 𝜃)(1
        ˆ   − 𝛿)Π1 (𝜃). The value of this “adjustment triangle” corresponds to one-half the
change in land allocation multiplied by the initial decrease in marginal return.13 Proﬁts fall
in the short-run and partially recover in the long-run as the land allocation adjusts.14
   (iv) Changes in Land Values. Land values in each period are the net present value
of proﬁts, given a proﬁt stream of 𝜋 𝑆𝑅 until period 𝑇 and 𝜋 𝐿𝑅 thereafter. In each period
  11
     The condition assumes that the proﬁt functions are diﬀerentiable and concave, focusing on interior
solutions and technological adjustment. If the initial equilibrium were a corner solution, later adoption of
the other technology could be interpreted as technological change.
  12
     The necessary assumptions are competition and free entry in land markets, with the marginal land
buyer having access to credit at a ﬁxed interest rate. If the latter assumption were relaxed and the Dust
Bowl temporarily lowered the discount factor, then land values would decline more in the short-run and
increase more in the long-run.
                                     ′                ′
  13
     The approximation is exact if Π2 (1 − 𝜃) and Π1 (𝜃) are linear.
  14
     Rearranging terms from the Taylor expansion, the change in land allocation (𝜃ˆ − 𝜃) equals the initial
                                        ′
decrease in marginal return ((1 − 𝛿)Π1 (𝜃)), divided by the summed slopes of the two technologies’ marginal
                                      ′′           ′′
returns at the initial equilibrium (Π2 (1 − 𝜃) + Π1 (𝜃)). The land allocation changes more when there is a
larger decrease in marginal return, and when marginal returns are less sensitive to changes in land allocation.

   The equations generate three main implications that are explored in the data. First, land
values initially fall by a smaller percentage than proﬁts, due to the expected partial recovery
in proﬁts.15 Second, land values increase if proﬁts increase, though by a smaller percentage.16
Third, the value of land at 𝑡 = 0 capitalizes the true PDV agricultural cost of the Dust Bowl.17
   (v) Adjustment Costs. The sharp distinction between “short-run” and “long-run” is
of analytical convenience and can be interpreted as a simpliﬁed case of an unconstrained
model with convex or declining adjustment costs. Adjustment costs may be convex if capital
or other adjustment inputs have an upward sloping supply curve in each period. Adjust-
ment costs may decline over time due to learning-by-doing or other positive spillovers in
technological adoption (Griliches 1957, Foster and Rosenzweig 1995).18
   The theoretical predictions are similar if land adjustment is costly: the land allocation is
adjusted less, leading to less long-run recovery in proﬁts.19 Of particular empirical interest is
whether the adjustment cost is recoverable; if not, then land values increase when the sunk
cost is paid.20 Thus, observed changes in land values indicate whether adjustment takes
place on margins that require ﬁxed or mobile investments.21
II.B     General Equilibrium Eﬀects of the Dust Bowl
The Dust Bowl was a major economic event and may have had general equilibrium eﬀects
on non-agricultural sectors and non-Dust Bowl areas. Applying a Roback (1982) model to a
rural setting, this section outlines predicted long-run changes in population and production

     Rearranging terms, the value of land at 𝑡 = 0 is 1−𝛽      + (𝜋 𝐿𝑅 − 𝜋 𝑆𝑅 ) 𝑖=𝑇 𝛽 𝑖 . Land value is greater
than the PDV of short-run proﬁts (the ﬁrst term) when the long-run increase in proﬁts is larger and the
long-run is achieved sooner.

     Rearranging terms, the value of land in each period 0 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑇 − 1 is 𝜋1−𝛽 − (𝜋 𝐿𝑅 − 𝜋 𝑆𝑅 ) 𝑖=𝑡 𝛽 𝑖 . Land
values increase as periods of short-run proﬁts are past and periods of long-run proﬁts become more immediate.

  17
     Rearranging terms, the value of land at 𝑡 = 0 is 𝛽 𝜋 +(1−𝛽1−𝛽          . Intuitively, land value is a weighted
average of long-run proﬁts and short-run proﬁts, where the weights are the relative value of each.
  18
     Even with costless adjustment, the potential for learning to resolve uncertainty about optimal adjust-
ments can delay investment (Dixit and Pindyck 1994; Bloom et al. 2007). Past crop-speciﬁc investments
may also depreciate over time, discouraging early adjustment (Chari and Hopenhayn 1991).
  19
     In a stark example, assume shifting land 𝐿 from technology 1 to 2 requires a one-time non-
recoverable cost 𝐶12 (𝐿) to be paid in period 𝑇 . If some land adjustment remains optimal, it satisﬁes:
          ′
            ˆ = Π′ (1 − 𝜃)
(1 − 𝛿)Π1 (𝜃)             ˆ − (1 − 𝛽)𝐶 ′ (𝜃 − 𝜃).ˆ Note that the ﬁrst order condition assumes the farmer
                    2                    12
has perfect access to credit, so eﬀectively (1 − 𝛽) of the adjustment cost is paid in each period. Capital
constraints would make full initial adjustment more costly.
  20
     When considering the evolution of land values over time, there is a less-interesting additional term
that reﬂects the anticipated payment of the adjustment cost. For example, if a non-recoverable adjustment
cost is only 𝜖 less than the PDV long-run recovery in proﬁts: the value of land decreases at 𝑡 = 0, remains
constant, and then partially recovers at 𝑡 = 𝑇 when it increases by the full amount of the adjustment cost.
  21
     Note, however, that the model assumes perfect foresight. Any systematic errors about the future costs
of erosion, potential government subsidies, or other factors will also inﬂuence the evolution of land values.



                                                        7
in the agricultural and industrial sectors.
   In the model, there are two locations (Dust Bowl and non-Dust Bowl).22 Two sectors
(agriculture and industry) produce freely tradeable goods using two homogeneous factors
(land and labor). The supply of land is ﬁxed in each location. Labor is supplied by work-
ers who pay a cost to change location or sector. Workers must supply labor in the same
location that they live. Workers consume land (housing), agricultural goods, and industrial
goods. Assuming perfectly competitive markets, all prices (land values, wages, and prices
for agricultural and industrial goods) are set such that each market clears.
   In the context of the model, assume that agricultural productivity declines in the Dust
Bowl area. The demand for agricultural land decreases. If the supply of land for agriculture
is inelastic, adjustment in the land market mainly occurs through decreased prices with little
change in total farmland.23
   Further, assume that the productivity of agricultural labor declines in the Dust Bowl area.
Workers have an incentive to move to the non-Dust Bowl area and/or switch to the industrial
sector. Equilibrium wages remain relatively lower in the Dust Bowl area (agricultural sector)
to the extent that there are costs to moving (switching sectors). Note that workers consume
land that is now cheaper, so paid wages fall by more than local price-adjusted wages.
   In the Dust Bowl area, lower wages encourage labor-intensive production in the agricultural
sector. Labor-capital ratios could increase and/or land allocations shift toward activities that
use more labor (and happen also to be less erosion resistant, such as crops vs. animals or
wheat vs. hay). Lower wages and land prices encourage the industrial sector to expand.24
   Wages decrease in response to an in-migration of workers in the non-Dust Bowl area. Be-
cause the Dust Bowl area is less productive in agriculture, agricultural output prices increase
and the agricultural sector expands in the non-Dust Bowl area. In general, disadvantaged
production activities in the Dust Bowl area become advantaged in the non-Dust Bowl area,
so relative comparisons in production decisions (and population) will overstate adjustments
made in the Dust Bowl area. Land prices increase in the non-Dust Bowl area, so relative
comparisons with the Dust Bowl area will overstate the total cost of the Dust Bowl. Note,
however, if the Dust Bowl is small or the economy is open, spillovers to the non-Dust Bowl
area become negligible.
  22
     The locations could be a more-eroded and less-eroded county within Oklahoma, or an eroded county in
Oklahoma and a non-eroded county in California.
  23
     Supply is inelastic when workers and industrial ﬁrms (current or entering) have little use for additional
marginal lands.
  24
     If outputs were not traded freely, then the industrial sector could contract if it was supplied inputs by
(or sold outputs to) the local agricultural sector.

III    Data Construction and Baseline Characteristics by Erosion Level
County-level data on agriculture, population, and industry are drawn from the US census
(Gutmann 2005; Haines 2005). Variables of interest include the value and quantity of agricul-
tural land, agricultural revenue and capital, total cropland and pasture, revenue from crops
or animals, production and acreage for speciﬁc crops, number of farms, population, rural
population, farm population, retail sales, manufacturing workers and value added, and un-
employment (see Data Appendix). Other data sources include banking data from the FDIC;
New Deal expenditures from the Oﬃce of Government Reports (Fishback et al. 2005); and
drought data from the National Climatic Data Center (Boustan et al. 2008).
  Core results focus on a balanced panel of 769 Plains counties from 1910 to 1997, for which
data on key variables are available in every period of analysis (see Data Appendix).25 To
account for county border changes, census data are adjusted in later periods to maintain the
1910 county deﬁnitions (Hornbeck 2009).
  Figure 2 displays the 769 sample counties, overlaid with a map of cumulative erosion dam-
age after the Dust Bowl. The white area is low erosion (less than 25% of topsoil lost), light
gray is medium erosion (25% to 75% of topsoil lost), dark gray is high erosion (more than
75% of topsoil lost), and crossed out areas are not in the sample (mainly due to unavailable
data in 1910 and 1925). The map, prepared by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS), was
obtained from the National Archives and traced using GIS software.26
  The main limitation of the erosion measure is that it does not just reﬂect erosion that oc-
curred during the Dust Bowl.27 Large-scale detailed erosion surveys only began in the 1930’s,
and were based on soil measurements by specialists sent to each county (SCS 1935).28 Thus,
  25
      Data from 1935 are omitted due to ongoing erosion and severe drought; production data corresponding
to 1934 was often not collected.
   26
      Documentation is sparse, but the map is recorded as “based on the 1934 Reconnaissance Erosion Survey
and other surveys.” The National Archives have three copies of this same map with publishing dates in
1948, 1951, and 1954 – prior to the next substantial period of erosion in the mid-1950’s. There are no other
erosion maps from December 1937 until the 1948 map.
   27
      An additional type of published map indicates periods when wind erosion occurred on the Plains:
showing broad areas of blowing from 1935 to 1936 and in 1938, which correspond closely to areas with
the highest wind speeds (Chepil et al. 1962). The broad wind erosion region has less detailed variation,
however, and it is not clear how the exact area was determined. There was substantial wind erosion in other
places and at other times during the Dust Bowl, as well as water erosion, and the maps give little sense of
the cumulative eﬀect on the soil.
   28
      The Soil Erosion Service (SES) was established in 1933 (replaced in 1935 by the SCS) and published
the very detailed 1934 Reconnaissance Erosion Survey. In August 1936, the SCS published a map of which
general areas had been aﬀected to diﬀerent degrees and a second more-detailed map in December 1937. The
erosion maps indicate whether areas experienced wind erosion or sheet (water) erosion, whether the erosion
type was slight, moderate, or severe, and whether there were many gullies (water erosion). A limitation
is that there is no natural way to compare erosion across types to generate a single index for how much
an area was aﬀected. Also, the maps do not directly measure erosion that occurred during the Dust Bowl,
there is no baseline data, and the erosion categories vary over time. Hansen and Libecap (2004) assign


                                                     9
there is no baseline data on erosion and topsoil levels prior to the Dust Bowl. The empir-
ical analysis does not require a literal interpretation of the erosion measure (percentage of
original topsoil lost); rather, the categories are interpreted as proxies for diﬀerential erosion.
To focus on the change in erosion over the 1930’s, the empirical analysis controls for county
characteristics in 1930, 1925, 1920, and 1910 that might predict baseline erosion levels.
   The Dust Bowl occurred only on the Plains, so the main sample is restricted to the 12
Plains states in Figure 2: Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New
Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. The erosion map
was prepared for the entire country and many areas in non-Plains states were also classiﬁed
as moderately or severely eroded; presumably, based mainly on erosion in earlier periods.
More-eroded counties experienced a substantial relative drop in land values in Plains states
(and not in non-Plains states), which suggests that mapped erosion levels are an eﬀective
proxy for the Dust Bowl erosion on the Plains in the 1930’s (see Results Appendix).
   Table 1 presents baseline diﬀerences among sample counties in 1930, based on assigned
post-Dust Bowl erosion levels.29 Column 1 presents means for all counties in 1930. Columns
2 and 3 report coeﬃcients from a single regression of each outcome variable on the fraction
of a county in medium-erosion and high-erosion, controlling for state ﬁxed eﬀects.30
   Counties with more erosion after the Dust Bowl tended to have previously: higher land
values, denser population, more but smaller farms, a larger fraction of cropland in corn or
cotton (as opposed to wheat and hay), and more animals. Column 4 reports the average
diﬀerence between a high-erosion county and a medium-erosion county. High-erosion and
medium-erosion counties were more similar, though high-erosion counties had more cropland
allocated to corn.
   Measured erosion levels are correlated with county characteristics for two reasons. First,
part of the erosion occurred prior to the Dust Bowl and could be caused by, reﬂected in, or
otherwise jointly determined with pre-Dust Bowl county characteristics. Second, the Dust
Bowl’s intensity was partly determined by the intensity of cultivation and other county land-
use practices. The main empirical challenge is that counties with diﬀerent characteristics
may have changed diﬀerently after the 1930’s, even if the Dust Bowl had not occurred. For
example, an increase in the relative price of corn would diﬀerentially increase revenues in
areas growing more corn.
erosion categories based on the 1936 map, as they are focused speciﬁcally on causes of wind erosion.
  29
     Given the construction of the sample, there are no missing values for panels A, B, and C. For panels D
and E, missing values are assumed to be zero (generally in areas where the products are not produced).
  30
     The means and regressions are weighted by county farmland levels, as the empirical analysis is focused
on changes for an average acre of farmland. The variables will be included as controls in later weighted
regressions, so their weighted diﬀerence is more relevant to interpreting their importance as control variables.



                                                      10
   The empirical analysis focuses on speciﬁcations that control for diﬀerential changes over
time that are correlated with the reported county characteristics in 1930 and lagged values
of the characteristics. The empirical analysis does not control for county characteristics after
1930, which are potential outcomes of the Dust Bowl. Measured erosion levels continue to
predict large decreases in land values when instrumenting for erosion with drought intensity
during the 1930’s (see Results Appendix).
IV     Empirical Framework
The empirical analysis is based on comparing changes in outcomes for counties that were
diﬀerentially eroded after the Dust Bowl. Outcome 𝑌𝑐𝑡 in county 𝑐 and year 𝑡 is diﬀerenced
from its value in 1930, so each coeﬃcient is interpreted as the relative change since 1930.31
The diﬀerence is regressed on the fraction of the county in medium-erosion (𝑀𝑐 ) and high-
erosion (𝐻𝑐 ) areas, a state-by-year ﬁxed eﬀect (𝛼𝑠𝑡 ), pre-Dust Bowl county characteristics
(𝑋𝑐 ), and an error term (𝜖𝑐𝑡 ):

(1)                       𝑌𝑐𝑡 − 𝑌𝑐1930 = 𝛽1𝑡 𝑀𝑐 + 𝛽2𝑡 𝐻𝑐 + 𝛼𝑠𝑡 + 𝜃𝑡 𝑋𝑐 + 𝜖𝑐𝑡 .

Note that the eﬀects of erosion and each county characteristic are allowed to vary in each
year. The sample is balanced in each regression, i.e., every county included has data in every
analyzed period.
   Among the included county characteristics are the variables in panels B, C, D, and E
of Table 1, and their values for all available pre-1930 periods (see Data Appendix). Each
regression also includes as a county characteristic the outcome variable for 1930 and all avail-
able pre-Dust Bowl periods. Counties with diﬀerent pre-1930’s outcome levels are thereby
allowed to experience systematically diﬀerent changes after the 1930’s.32
   To interpret the estimated changes as the relative eﬀect of the Dust Bowl, the identiﬁca-
tion assumption is that counties with diﬀerent erosion levels would have changed the same
if not for the Dust Bowl. In practice, the assumption must hold after controlling for dif-
ferential changes over each period that are correlated with included pre-Dust Bowl county
  31
     The speciﬁed regression is a special case, in which the sample is balanced and the regressors are fully
interacted with each time period. Diﬀerencing the data does not change the diﬀerence between estimated
𝛽’s across time periods; rather, it normalizes the 𝛽’s relative to zero in 1930. Further, estimation of the
regression is completely separable across year pairs, so diﬀerencing the data and including county ﬁxed
eﬀects yield identical coeﬃcients (as in the case of two time periods). Both methods improve the precision
of the estimates by absorbing ﬁxed county characteristics, and the two methods produce slightly diﬀerent
standard errors based on the degree of persistence in the error term. Diﬀerencing was done throughout the
analysis for ease of interpretation and computational speed.
  32
     Alternative models could assume that pre-1930 trends would have continued predictably. Such models
appear theoretically inappropriate for asset prices, such as land values, and empirically questionable for
other outcomes due to the Depression and subsequent economic changes.


                                                    11
characteristics.
   Three other estimation details are worth noting. First, to condense the reported results,
the speciﬁcations often pool the erosion variables for some combination of later time periods.
Pooled estimates amount to averaging the estimated 𝛽’s for the pooled years, as the control
variable eﬀects are allowed to vary in each year.
   Second, regressions for agricultural outcomes are weighted by county farmland in 1930 (or
an analogous land measure) to estimate the average eﬀect for an acre of farmland. Regres-
sions for labor outcomes are weighted by county population in 1930 to estimate the average
eﬀect for a person.
   Third, standard errors are clustered at the county level to adjust for heteroskedasticity and
within-county correlation over time. To check for spatial correlation among counties, Conley
standard errors were also estimated for changes in land values from 1930 to 1940 (Conley
1999). The Conley standard errors are similar to standard errors clustered at the county
level, indicating that the impact on lands’ production potential was not highly spatially
correlated.33
V      Results
V.A      Agricultural Land Value and Revenue
Agricultural Land Value. The primary eﬀect of Dust Bowl erosion was to decrease lands’
potential for agricultural production, so a natural starting point is an analysis of changes
in the per-acre value of farmland. Figure 3 graphs estimated 𝛽’s from versions of equation
(1). Panel A graphs a simpliﬁed version of equation (1), including state-by-year ﬁxed eﬀects
and no controls for county characteristics. State-by-year ﬁxed eﬀects control for regional
diﬀerences in agricultural development (e.g., Oklahoma’s late statehood) and public policy
(e.g., state-wide relief eﬀorts).
   Prior to the Dust Bowl, high and medium-erosion counties had higher average per-acre land
values than low-erosion counties in the same state. Land values were trending similarly for
all county types, particularly from 1920 to 1930. After the Dust Bowl, land values decreased
in high- and medium-erosion counties relative to low-erosion counties. Comparing the two
lines, land values also decreased in high-erosion counties relative to medium-erosion counties.
   Panel B graphs the estimated changes in land values, when also controlling for the eﬀect of
  33
    The Conley method allows for outcomes to be correlated among nearby counties, with the degree of
correlation declining linearly until some cutoﬀ distance. Relative to county-clustered standard errors, the
percent increase in Conley standard errors for changes in high-erosion vs. low-erosion counties is: 0% (50
mile cutoﬀ), 5% (100 mile), 16% (300 mile), 30% (500 mile), 29% (700 mile), 23% (900 mile). For changes
in medium-erosion vs. low-erosion counties, the Conley standard errors decline by 0% to 17%. The Conley
speciﬁcations are diﬃcult to weight by county farmland levels, so the comparison is relative to unweighted
county-clustered standard errors.

counties’ 1930 characteristics in each time period (variables in Panels B through E of Table
1). The control variables capture diﬀerences in the intensity of agricultural development
(Panel B), population and density of settlement (Panel C), and original suitability of land
for diﬀerent crops (Panel D) or animals (Panel E). Counties that diﬀer along each dimension
might be aﬀected diﬀerently by subsequent changes in relative prices and technology.
   Panel C graphs the estimated changes when also controlling for the above county char-
acteristics in 1925, 1920, and 1910 (when reported, see Data Appendix). The variables
capture diﬀerential pre-trends in key variables; for example, lagged acres of land in farms
(per county acre) reﬂect when counties were originally settled. Conditional on all covariates,
diﬀerentially-eroded counties have similar land value levels and trends from 1920 to 1930.
   The preferred speciﬁcation is graphed in Panel D, which controls also for counties’ land
value in 1930, 1925, 1920, and 1910.34 By construction, there are no residual pre-Dust Bowl
diﬀerences by erosion level. After the Dust Bowl, high-erosion counties experienced an imme-
diate, substantial, and persistent relative decrease in land values. Medium-erosion counties
experienced a smaller but substantial relative decrease. Comparing the two lines, high-
erosion counties also experienced a persistent decrease relative to medium-erosion counties.
   Table 2 (column 1) reports numerical results from estimating equation (1), which corre-
spond to the graphed estimates in Panel D of Figure 3. Panel A reports that, from 1930
to 1940, land values fell by 27.8% in high-erosion counties and 16.7% in medium-erosion
counties, relative to low-erosion counties. If low-erosion counties were not aﬀected by the
Dust Bowl, the total capitalized cost can be approximated by multiplying the percent de-
cline in land values by the original land value. Estimates imply that the Dust Bowl erosion
imposed an agricultural cost of $153 million in 1930 dollars ($1.9 billion in 2007 dollars).35
If low-erosion counties were also damaged by the Dust Bowl, the estimate would understate
the total cost. If the Dust Bowl made less-aﬀected land in the same state more valuable,
e.g., through higher output prices, the estimate would overstate the total cost.36 The $153
million cost represents 0.44% of the decline in GDP from 1930 to 1933 (Historical Statistics
  34
      The land value regression also controls for agricultural revenues per-acre in 1930, 1925, 1920, and 1910,
as the later analysis combines the land value and revenue speciﬁcations in a seemingly unrelated regression
framework.
   35
      Multiplying 1930 county farmland levels by the share of area in each erosion category, there were ap-
proximately 51 million farm acres in high-erosion areas and 170 million farm acres in medium-erosion areas.
The per-acre value of farmland was $3.60 in high-erosion counties and $3.62 in medium-erosion counties,
weighting by farmland. The total cost is found by multiplying the acres aﬀected, the value of the acres, and
the percent decline in land values: $51 million from high-erosion and $102 million from medium erosion.
   36
      There is no obvious indication of higher prices from national trends in the ppi for farm products and
the cpi for urban consumers: farm output prices were lower from 1938 to 1940 than in the 1920’s – both
absolutely and relative to the urban cpi. All prices declined in the 1930’s and increased during World War
II, while farm output prices increased during the severe droughts from 1934 to 1936.

2006); a relatively small number due to low 1930 land values, as $153 million also represents
the complete loss of an area of farmland the size of Oklahoma.
   Panel B reports the estimated change in land values from 1930 to 1945. Column 2 ex-
presses the change as a fraction of the change in land values from 1930 to 1940. The estimated
ratios reﬂect the amount of decrease from 1930 to 1940 that persisted into 1945: 84% for
high-erosion and 61% for medium-erosion. For changes in high-erosion counties relative to
medium-erosion counties, the persistence was 119% (land values declined further). There is
no clear a priori reason for one of the three relative comparisons to reﬂect a more or less
persistent shock. Taking the eﬃcient weighted average of the three parameters, the average
persistence is 76.5%.37
   Panels C, D, and E report later changes in land values, pooling the estimates over 2, 3, and
4 census periods to summarize the results. There is little indication of a systematic recovery
in land values. Persistent land value declines suggest that the overall percent recovery in
proﬁts is not large, and that adjustment did not take place through ﬁxed improvements in
land that would be capitalized in its value.
   Agricultural Revenue. It would be useful to compare changes in land values and agri-
cultural proﬁts, but data are only available for agricultural revenue and equipment capital
inputs. Rosenzweig and Wolpin (2000) illustrate how unobserved inputs, particularly family
labor, can bias estimates of the eﬀect of environmental shocks on proﬁts (revenues minus
observed input costs).
   As an alternative, the analysis focuses on agricultural revenue. For a Cobb-Douglas agri-
cultural production function, a productivity decline leads to proportional decreases in prof-
its, revenue, and all inputs. Percent changes in revenues then proxy for percent changes in
proﬁts. There are no general theoretical predictions about changes in revenue and inputs
because such changes depend on the functional form of the production function, but analyz-
ing changes in inputs will inform the relationship between revenue and proﬁts and provide
useful bounds.
   Table 2 (column 3) reports changes after 1930 in the per-acre value of agricultural revenue
from estimating equation (1). Panel A reports that revenue declined relatively from 1930 to
1940 by 31.6% in high-erosion counties and 20.2% in medium-erosion counties. Panels B to
E report the changes in later periods, and column 4 expresses each change as a fraction of the
decrease from 1930 to 1940. From 1940 to 1945, more-eroded counties experienced a substan-
tial recovery in revenues, though averaged levels were lower than in 1930. Over later periods,
  37
    The variance-covariance matrix for the three estimates is known, so the eﬃcient average is estimated
through GLS (regressing the three values on a constant, weighting by the square root of the inverse of
the variance-covariance matrix). Intuitively, the procedure gives more weight to more-precisely estimated
coeﬃcients, and less weight to coeﬃcients that are more correlated with another.

only medium-erosion counties experienced a substantial recovery in revenues. On average,
approximately 70% of the initial decline in revenues persisted between 1950 and the 1990’s.
   Persistence of Short-run Costs. Assume, for now, that the percent changes in revenue
reﬂect percent changes in proﬁts. From the perspective of a farmer in 1940, it is possible to
calculate the realized true economic loss as a fraction of the loss if there had been no recovery
after 1940. For the realized true economic loss, take the present discounted value of all lost
revenue after 1940.38 For the no-recovery loss, take the PDV of all lost revenue assuming no
recovery after 1940. The ratio of the two losses (and standard error) is: 0.762 (0.132) for high-
erosion relative to low-erosion, 0.687 (0.152) for medium-erosion relative to low-erosion, and
0.896 (0.351) for high-erosion relative to medium-erosion.39 In theory, the numbers should
be similar to the immediate decrease in land price (expected true economic loss) as a fraction
of the immediate decrease in land rent or proﬁt (initial per-period economic loss).
   The ratio can also be estimated directly by taking the percent decrease in land value from
1930 to 1940 as a fraction of the percent decrease in land revenue from 1930 to 1940. In
theory, the percent decrease in land value reﬂects the true economic loss from the Dust Bowl,
anticipating and appropriately discounting the future recovery. Table 2 (column 5) reports
the estimated ratio for each relative comparison between erosion levels.40 Given the theoret-
ical assumptions on land markets and revenue vs. proﬁt, the ratios have a clear structural
interpretation: for every 1% lost in the short-run (1940), the true economic loss is between
0.82% and 0.98%, with a weighted average of 0.86%. Theoretically, the ratio should be weakly
less than one, though the estimated parameters need not be. Because none is statistically less
than one, the estimates fail to reject the hypothesis that long-run adjustments did not miti-
gate the short-run cost. The coeﬃcients are all statistically greater than zero, which rejects
the hypothesis that the short-run cost was associated with no signiﬁcant PDV cost. If the the-
oretical assumptions fail to hold, the numbers still have an appealing reduced-form interpre-
tation: the true economic loss (land value) is scaled by the magnitude of the shock (revenue).
   The main limitation in interpreting the estimated ratios (from both methods) is the strong
assumption that percent changes in revenue approximate percent changes in proﬁts. Percent
changes in observed inputs are informative about the diﬀerence between revenues and proﬁts,
and are obtained by estimating equation (1) for the value of capital machinery and equip-
ment. From 1930 to 1940, capital inputs fell substantially but somewhat less than revenue:
  38
      The calculation assumes an interest rate of 5%, linearly interpolates annual values between each census
period, and assumes that revenue is constant after 1992.
   39
      To calculate the ratio, annual coeﬃcients for column 4 are linearly interpolated. Given an interest rate
                                                           1                                            (1+𝑟)
𝑟, the estimated persistence in year 𝑡 is multiplied by (1+𝑟) 𝑡 . The values are summed and divided by    𝑟 .
   40
      To obtain the standard error of the ratio, both coeﬃcients are estimated through seemingly unrelated
regression, where the same control variables are included in each regression.



                                                     15
22.5% (5.5%) in high vs. low, 12.1% (3.7%) in medium vs. low, and 10.4% (4.8%) in high
vs. medium. If all inputs fell by less than revenue from 1930 to 1940, then proﬁts fell by
more than revenue and the estimated ratios in column 5 (Table 2) overstate the persistence
in costs. By contrast, capital inputs recovered after 1940, so proﬁts recovered by less than
revenue and the ratios of revenue PDVs understate the persistence in costs.41
   Thus, the diﬀerences between percent changes in revenue and proﬁt appear to bias the
two estimated ratios in opposite directions. On average, the implied ratio of true economic
loss to initial economic loss is between 72% and 86%.42 Framed diﬀerently, the estimates
imply that long-run adjustments recovered 14% to 28% of the initial cost (or the true cost
if there had been no adjustment).
V.B     Adjustment in Agricultural Production
Consistent with persistent agricultural costs, this section presents estimates that suggest
adjustment of agricultural production was costly and slow. It appears that some productive
adjustments were possible, but adjustments only occurred over long periods of time. Table
3 reports results from estimating equation (1) for several agricultural production decisions.
   Total Farmland. Table 3 (column 1) reports estimated changes in the fraction of county
land in farms. The extensive margin of farming was fairly stable: immediately after the
Dust Bowl, there were no substantial or statistically signiﬁcant relative changes in farmland.
Thus, previous estimates of changing land values, revenue, and capital inputs do not reﬂect
large changes in the underlying composition of farmland.
   High-erosion counties later experienced a gradual small decline in farming, which by the
1950’s was lower by a statistically signiﬁcant 3%. The declines in farming were then largely
reversed, however, and medium-erosion counties were relatively unchanged.43
   Little adjustment in total farmland is consistent with an inelastic supply of land, i.e., an
inelastic demand for land in other sectors. The decline in demand for agricultural land would
then be reﬂected mainly in lower land values, rather than decreased farmland.
   Growing Crops vs. Raising Animals. Within the agricultural sector, farmers may
have reallocated land toward production activities that were less sensitive to soil quality.
Higher quality land generally has a comparative advantage in growing crops, as opposed
  41
      For high-erosion vs. low-erosion counties, capital inputs decreased from 1930 by 11.8% (4.8%) in 1945,
16.0% (6.0%) in 1969, and 18.7% (6.8%) in 1992. For medium vs. low, capital inputs decreased by 4.1% (3.4%)
in 1945, 2.7% (4.1%) in 1969, and 2.0% (4.8%) in 1992. For high vs. medium, capital inputs decreased by 7.6%
(4.8%) in 1945, 13.3% (5.1%) in 1969, and 16.7% (5.7%) in 1992; somewhat larger declines in later periods.
   42
      The range of estimates from the two approaches is: 76.2% to 88.1% for high-erosion vs. low-erosion,
68.7% to 82.4% for medium-erosion vs. low-erosion, and 89.6% to 98.1% for high-erosion vs. medium-erosion.
   43
      The estimates do not reﬂect an increase in abandoned farmland, proxied by the diﬀerence between total
farmland and cropland or land in pasture. Relative changes in the measure were never greater than 1% of
the total land in farms, in either direction.


                                                    16
to raising animals. If erosion reduces the proﬁtability of land for crops by more than for
animals, farmland might be converted from cropland to pasture. Such land conversion was
expected by contemporaries and was a major goal of government policy, advocated as both
good for the farmer and good for society.44
   The available data on changes in average productivity are consistent with the expecta-
tion that proﬁtability of land for crops declined by more than for animals. Note, however,
that changes in productivity need not imply changes in proﬁtability.45 Further, average
productivity changes may diﬀer from changes for the marginal unit of land that could be
reallocated. Finally, if land allocations adjust, changes in land composition are confounded
with productivity changes.
   Crop productivity is deﬁned as the total value of crops sold, divided by acres of cropland.
Animal productivity is deﬁned as the total value of animals sold and animal products sold,
divided by acres of pasture. The measures would overstate the relative decline in crop pro-
ductivity if farmers in more-eroded counties became more prone to use cropland to feed their
own animals.
   Table 3, columns 2 and 3, report changes in crop and animal productivity.46 For high-
erosion and medium-erosion counties, crop productivity declined more than animal produc-
tivity from 1930 to 1940. The relative decrease only persisted for medium-erosion counties.47
   However, farmers did not begin systematically shifting cropland to pasture until the 1950’s
(Table 3, column 4). The estimates are consistent with adjustment costs declining in the
long-run. Even when high- and medium-erosion counties shifted land allocations, the magni-
tudes are small and on the margin of statistical signiﬁcance. Somewhat larger shifts occurred
in high-erosion counties despite weaker evidence of relative productivity diﬀerences in later
periods, which may reﬂect poor quality cropland being shifted to pasture.
   Growing Wheat vs. Growing Hay. Within cropland allocations, a similar empirical
exercise compares changes in the allocation of land to wheat and hay. Wheat and hay are
the two widely grown crops for which comparable data are available over a long time period.
In contemporaneous and later writings, it was generally recommended that farmers shift
land from wheat to hay (or to native grasslands and pasture). Wheat production is more
  44
     The SCS in 1955 was still strongly advocating conversion of land from cropland to grassland (Allred
and Nixon 1955).
  45
     Indeed, later analysis of labor costs suggests that relative proﬁtability did not initially change by as
much as relative productivity.
  46
     The crop and animal productivity regressions are weighted by 1930 levels of county cropland and pasture,
respectively. The estimates can then be interpreted as the percent change for an average unit of that land.
  47
     Note that there was no relative change in productivity for high-erosion counties relative to medium-
erosion counties. The result is consistent with earlier results on land values and revenue in which the high
vs. medium shock had more persistent costs, i.e., there may be fewer opportunities to adjust production.



                                                     17
sensitive to soil quality and more likely to cause erosion, while hay is cultivated grass (and
an input in the production of animals).
   Productivity for each crop is deﬁned as the total quantity produced divided by the total
acreage harvested. Data are unavailable in each period for acreage planted, so crop failure
would cause the analysis to understate declines in productivity.48 The same caveats apply
as for the analysis of crops vs. animals.
   Table 3, columns 5 and 6, report changes after 1930 in wheat and hay productivity.49
From 1930 to 1940, wheat productivity decreased substantially. In 1950, when hay pro-
ductivity data are again available, wheat productivity was lower than hay productivity.50
Wheat productivity recovered substantially after 1964, but it remained relatively lower than
hay productivity.
   Table 3, column 7, reports that farmers did not begin systematically shifting land from
wheat to hay until the 1960’s. After 1964, there were substantial and statistically signiﬁcant
declines in the fraction of wheat and hay land allocated to wheat. Note that the reallocation
occurs after data becomes unavailable for comparing cropland and pasture, so it is diﬃcult
to compare the degree of adjustment along each land-use margin.51
   Average Farm Size and Land Fallowing. Land allocation adjustment may require
the consolidation of farms, particularly if erosion-resistant activities (pasture, hay) are more
land-intensive. In addition, larger farms may internalize land protection externalities and
lead to increased land fallowing (Hansen and Libecap 2004).
   Table 3, column 8, reports that average farm sizes increased by 6% to 10% after 1930.
However, farm size increases did not translate into higher land fallowing among more-eroded
counties (column 9).52 There is some evidence that land fallowing declined in more-eroded
counties from 1940 to 1945.53
  48
     Crop failure was particularly extreme in 1934 and 1936, while acres harvested vs. planted are more
similar and constant in other periods. For unknown reasons, many counties do not report wheat data for
1940. Restricting the analysis to a balanced panel reduces the sample size by roughly half.
  49
     The wheat and hay productivity regressions are weighted by 1930 acres of land devoted to that crop. The
other crop and animal variables are omitted as controls, as they directly change along with wheat and hay.
  50
     As in the case for crop and animal productivity, there was less relative change between high- and
medium-erosion counties.
  51
     Fertilizer use is another potential margin of adjustment, but comparable data are unavailable before
and after the Dust Bowl. The land value and revenue calculations should capture the partial recovery of
short-run costs due to both observed and unobserved margins of adjustment.
  52
     The result is not inconsistent with ﬁndings by Hansen and Libecap (2004), which relate more to
aggregate increases in land fallowing (Figure 1).
  53
     Similar to the previously estimated increases in capital inputs, the increase in cultivation intensity
further suggests that the observed percent recovery in agricultural revenues may overstate the percent
recovery in proﬁts after 1940.

V.C    Potential Explanations for Limited Agricultural Adjustment
This section explores three explanations for the observed slow and limited reallocation of
land from crops (to animals) and from wheat (to hay): credit constraints, tenant incentives,
and government payments. Among the remaining untested explanations are: prohibitive ad-
justment costs, convex or declining adjustment costs (e.g., technology spillovers or learning-
by-doing), uncertainty about optimal adjustments, and depreciating vintage capital.
   Credit Constraints. The Great Depression restricted access to credit. In particu-
lar, more-eroded counties lost substantial land value, so land-owning farmers lost potential
collateral. Poorly performing local mortgages may have restricted banks’ ability to lend.
Estimating a modiﬁed version of equation (1), high-erosion counties experienced more bank
failures during the 1930’s than low- or medium-erosion counties (Results Appendix Figure
2A). Bank weakness and bank failures can lead to persistent decreases in the supply of credit,
especially during the 1930’s (Bernanke 1983, Calomiris and Mason 2003, Ashcraft 2005).
   Restricted access to credit may have constrained farmers’ adjustments in agricultural pro-
duction. Raising animals requires substantial upfront investment in livestock, and shifting
crops may require diﬀerent machinery. To explore the possibility, a regression is estimated
that reports whether counties similarly aﬀected by the Dust Bowl adjusted more if they had
more banks prior to the 1930’s.54 The regression modiﬁes equation (1) by adding interaction
terms between the log number of banks (𝐵) at the end of 1928 and the fraction of a county
in high- and medium-erosion areas:

(2)                 𝑌𝑐𝑡 − 𝑌𝑐1930 = 𝛽1𝑡 𝑀𝑐 + 𝛽2𝑡 𝐻𝑐 + 𝛽3𝑡 𝐵𝑐
                                  + 𝛽4𝑡 𝐵𝑐 × 𝑀𝑐 + 𝛽5𝑡 𝐵𝑐 × 𝐻𝑐
                                  + 𝛼𝑠𝑡 + 𝜃𝑡 𝑋𝑐 + 𝛾1𝑡 𝐿𝑐 + 𝛾2𝑡 𝐵𝑐 × 𝐿𝑐 + 𝜖𝑐𝑡 .

The coeﬃcients of interest are 𝛽4𝑡 and 𝛽5𝑡 , which indicate whether counties with more banks
adjusted diﬀerently than counties with fewer banks. For ease of interpretation, 𝐵 is nor-
malized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The speciﬁcation also
controls for the main eﬀect of banks, and an interaction between banks and each pre-Dust
Bowl outcome level.
  The main identiﬁcation assumption is that counties with more original banks had bet-
ter access to credit during and after the Dust Bowl, but would otherwise have adjusted
agricultural land-use similarly. Pre-Dust Bowl banking levels may be correlated with other
county characteristics (credit demand, education, ﬁnancial development), so it is a strong
  54
   Subsequent banking appears to be aﬀected by the Dust Bowl. The results are similar when using the
amount of deposits prior to the Dust Bowl.


                                                19
assumption that other omitted characteristics do not predict diﬀerential responses to erosion.
   Table 4 (column 1) reports that more-eroded counties with more banks immediately shifted
toward greater pasture. By contrast, there was no relative shift from wheat to hay (column
2). Livestock may require greater upfront capital expenditure than the diﬀerence between
hay and wheat machinery. However, the results must be interpreted cautiously given the po-
tential correlation between banking levels and other characteristics that predict adjustment
to erosion.
   Tenant Incentives. Land tenants may have ineﬃciently low incentives to make per-
manent investments in land, or otherwise adjust production to improve lands’ future value.
Contemporaries emphasized that tenants’ focus was on their crop rather than the land (Mc-
Donald 1938). Thus, relatively high land tenancy rates may explain the lack of adjustment.55
   To explore the possibility, equation (3) is estimated, replacing the number of banks with
the share of farmland managed by tenants in 1930 (normalized to have a mean of zero and
a standard deviation of negative one, to be comparable to the banking results). Table 4,
columns 3 and 4, report the results. There is little evidence of tenant farming predicting
immediate land adjustment, though perhaps evidence for counties with less tenant farming
shifting more land from wheat in later periods.
   In 1930, 1940, and 1950, there is data on tenants’ and non-tenants’ land value, cropland,
and equipment. Estimating equation (1) for tenants and non-tenants separately, there is little
evidence of diﬀerential responses to erosion for the per-acre value of farmland, cropland share
of farmland, and per-acre equipment. However, farmland became increasingly allocated away
from tenants after the 1940’s (Results Appendix Figure 2B). The shift away from tenancy,
along with the move toward larger farm sizes, may indicate that long-run adjustment in land-
use partly required the reorganization of land ownership. Overall, however, there is little
evidence that tenant farming accounts for the limited amount of agricultural adjustment.
   Government Payments. Government payment programs increased substantially during
the 1930’s, and many were targeted toward the agricultural sector. Payments encouraged
the continuation of farming, but also some of the analyzed production adjustments.56 Such
policies may have had aggregate eﬀects on the agricultural sector, but they seem unlikely
to explain relative adjustments by erosion levels: payments from various observed programs
were not targeted toward more-eroded counties, after controlling for state ﬁxed eﬀects and
the usual county characteristics (Results Appendix Table 2).
  55
     Tenant farmers may also be more credit constrained, but perhaps not if land owners lost substantial
capital from lower land values and tenants’ assets were more liquid.
  56
     Traditional acreage restrictions were not imposed on pasture and hay, though some conservation
payments restricted harvesting of hay. Wheat quotas may limit general equilibrium eﬀects by restraining
non-eroded counties from increasing wheat production.



                                                  20
   Farmers may have expected future payments. Some New Deal programs were temporary,
but others were extended or shifted into new forms of payments. Panel B of Appendix Table
2 reports that higher erosion counties did not receive more payments in 1969, but began to
in 1974. Higher erosion counties received substantially less in 1987, while total payments
were much higher. The estimates likely reﬂect the 1985 introduction of the Conservation
Reserve Program (CRP), which paid farmers to take low-quality and erosion-prone land out
of production (and precluded other farm payments). In 1992, more-eroded counties were re-
ceiving greater CRP payments, suggesting that counties eroded during the Dust Bowl were
still farming worse lands (conditional on pre-1930’s characteristics).
V.D     Adjustment in Population, Income, and Industry
This section presents estimated changes in population, a proxy for income, and measures of
local manufacturing activity. Immediate out-migration was the main margin of adjustment.
Equilibrium was reestablished through further population declines, rather than increased
industry. Temporarily lower wages and surplus labor may partly account for the observed
slow agricultural adjustment.
   Population. From 1930 to 1940, population declined relatively by 8.1% in high-erosion
counties and 6.5% in medium-erosion counties (Table 5, column 1). Much of the relative de-
crease reﬂects aggregate out-migration; by comparison, state-wide populations decreased 3%
to 4% in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska from 1930 to 1940. Estimated relative population
declines continued through the 1950’s.
   Columns 2 and 3 report changes in the fraction of population in rural areas (fewer than
2,500 inhabitants) and living on farms. The overall decline in population did not occur
disproportionally from rural or on-farm groups. The widespread population decrease is sug-
gestive of overall economic decline, rather than within-county shifts to industry.57
   Income Proxy. Direct data on income or wages is unavailable, but per-capita retail sales
may serve as a proxy (Fishback et al. 2005). Changes in retail sales diﬀer from changes in
income if net savings change, and diﬀer from wage changes if labor supply changes.
   Per-capita retail sales declined from 1930 to 1940 by 9.8% and 6.3% in high- and medium-
erosion counties (Table 5, column 4), and partly recovered from 1940 to 1958. Notably, the
estimated magnitude of recovery in wages is roughly predicted by the population declines
from 1940 to 1960. Estimated labor demand elasticities (Borjas 2003) imply that a 10% de-
crease in population would increase wages by 3% to 4%, or increase income by 6.4% once indi-
  57
     In contrast to the standard Roback model outlined above, there may be important spillover eﬀects
between agricultural and industry through locally supplied inputs or services. Farmers may also be relatively
resistant to migrate. Based on a survey of 1930’s migrants to California, Janow and McEntire (1940) report
that migrants from most regions were less likely to be from the agricultural sector than those originally in
the sending region. Oklahoma migrants were slightly more likely to be from the agricultural sector.


                                                     21
viduals’ labor supply adjusts. In high-erosion counties, the population decrease from 1940 to
1960 implies a 2% to 2.7% increase in wages and a 4.3% increase in income – compared to an
observed 4% recovery in per-capita retail sales from 1940 to 1958. In medium-erosion coun-
ties, the population decrease implies a 3.2% to 4.2% increase in wages and a 6.7% increase in
income – compared to a 6.8% recovery in per-capita retail sales.58 Thus, the observed recov-
ery in per-capita retail sales could be explained by supply-side adjustment (out-migration),
and need not reﬂect increased labor demand (increased local manufacturing).
   Unemployment and Manufacturing. From 1930 to 1940, the unemployment rate in-
creased by 0.71 percentage points in high-erosion counties (Table 5, column 5). The increase
was gone by 1950, however, and medium-erosion counties had no increase in unemployment
after 1940. Declining populations may have prevented further unemployment, because there
is little evidence of an increase in manufacturing.
   Table 6 reports estimated changes in the manufacturing sector, for smaller samples of
counties with available data. Column 1 (column 2) reports small increases in the fraction
of the labor force (population) employed in manufacturing in high-erosion counties.59 Esti-
mates represent large percent increases in manufacturing employment (11% and 15%), but
account for little overall movement of labor because manufacturing was a small sector of the
economy. In medium-erosion counties, there was no immediate shift in labor, but perhaps
later increases. Payroll per-worker declined (column 3), which could reﬂect declining wages
and/or changes in the composition of the labor force.
   Columns 4 and 5 report that total manufacturing establishments and value added did not
increase following the Dust Bowl, though the coeﬃcients are imprecisely estimated. Perhaps
due to the Depression, manufacturing may have been too slow to expand and attract workers
before they left the county. Even after the Depression, there was no increase in manufac-
turing and the reallocation of labor continued through population declines. The pattern of
results is similar to estimates by Blanchard and Katz (1992) for state-level responses to labor
demand shocks in the second half of the twentieth century.
   Interactions with Agriculture. Previous estimates indicated that surplus agricultural
labor had not entirely left more-eroded counties by 1940, or switched to other sectors. If over-
all wages were lower, then agricultural wages would be especially lower if switching sectors
was costly. Temporary surplus labor and lower wages may have inﬂuenced agriculture.
   Indeed, estimates indicate that the agricultural labor-capital ratio increased temporarily.
  58
     Wages or incomes need not recover fully in equilibrium, as lower land prices partly compensate workers.
The budget share for land is approximated by dividing 7% of the value of one agricultural acre by average
per-capita retail sales. The estimated decreases in land values compensate workers for lower income of
2.78% and 1.67% in high- and medium-erosion counties.
  59
     The labor force is deﬁned as all workers employed, laidoﬀ, or unemployed and searching.



                                                    22
The ratio is approximated by the number of people living on farms divided by the value
of equipment and machinery on farms. Changes in the log of the ratio are estimated by
equation (1). In high-erosion counties, the ratio increased after 1930: 14% (4.8%) by 1940,
2% (4.8%) by 1945, and 9% (5.5%) by 1969. In medium-erosion counties the ratio increased
temporarily after 1930: 13% (4.1%) by 1940, 4.5% (4.1%) by 1945, and 2.4% (4.3%) by 1969.
The estimates may reﬂect farmers delaying adoption of machinery improvements.
   Further, surplus labor and lower wages in the agricultural sector may have delayed ad-
justment of land from cropland to pasture or from wheat to hay, which can use less labor.
It was only in the 1950’s, after surplus labor had left and population declines ceased, that
agricultural adjustment began to appear along such margins.
VI   Conclusion
The 1930’s American Dust Bowl imposed substantial costs on Plains agriculture. Adjust-
ment in agricultural land-use was slow and limited, despite evidence of potentially productive
adjustments. Estimated changes in land values and revenues imply that the true agricultural
cost was 72% to 86% of the initial cost; alternatively, that long-run adjustments recovered
only 14% to 28% of the initial cost.
   The Dust Bowl provides a detailed context in which to examine economic adjustment to
a permanent change in environmental conditions. In this historical context, overlapping the
Great Depression, adjustment may have been slowed by limited access to capital. Historical
US labor markets are also known for high geographic labor mobility, relative to internal mo-
bility in other countries and cross-country mobility. The experience of the American Dust
Bowl highlights that agricultural costs from environmental destruction need not be mostly
mitigated by agricultural adjustments, and that mass migration may result. Further research
on historical shocks may help understand what conditions facilitate long-run adjustment.

Notes: Each panel graphs the estimated coefficients (β) from versions of equation (1) in the text. For each year, the
solid circles report differences in the log per-acre value of farmland for high erosion counties, relative to low erosion
counties. The hollow squares report differences for medium erosion counties, relative to low erosion counties. In
Panel A, these coefficients are estimated by regressing the per-acre value of farmland on the fraction of a county in a
high erosion area (solid circle) and the fraction of a county in a medium erosion area (hollow square), controlling for
state-by-year fixed effects. Panel B also includes as controls the interaction between each year and each county
characteristic in panels B – E of Table 1. Panel C also includes as controls the interaction between each year and the
available lagged values of each county characteristic in panels B – E of Table 1 (see Data Appendix). Panel D also
includes as controls the interaction between each year and the outcome variable for each lagged year.

Notes: Column 1 reports average values for the 769 main sample counties, where counties are weighted by the acres
of farmland in 1930 (counties based on 1910 borders; with at least 1000 acres of farmland in every period; and with
data on each variable in Figure 1 for each period shown). The standard deviation is reported in brackets.
          Columns 2 and 3 report coefficients from a single regression that regresses the indicated county
characteristic in 1930 on the fraction of the county in a medium erosion area and in a high erosion area (low erosion
is the omitted category), conditional on state fixed effects and weighted by acres of farmland in 1930. Column 4
reports the difference between the coefficients in columns 2 and 3. Robust standard errors are reported in
parentheses. ** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, * at the 5% level.

Notes: For the indicated outcome variable, each column reports estimates from equation
(2) in the text. For columns 1 and 2, the reported coefficients are from the interaction term:
adjustment to erosion in areas with more banks in 1928, relative to the adjustment in areas
with fewer banks. Columns 3 and 4 report the analogous coefficients, but for the tenant
share of farmland in 1930 (instead of banks). The log number of banks is normalized to
have mean zero and standard deviation one, the tenant share of farmland is normalized to
have mean zero and standard deviation (negative) one. Reported in parentheses are robust
standard errors clustered by county. ** statistical significance at the 1% level, * at 5%.

Data Appendix
The sample is restricted to Plains counties that have data on: land values, revenue, and
farmland from 1910 to 1992; cropland from 1925 to 1974; population and rural population
from 1910 to 1969. A small number of counties are excluded that have less than 1000 acres of
farmland and extreme infeasible outcome values that reﬂect measurement error. The main
reasons counties are dropped from the sample are: insuﬃciently settled by 1910 for reported
data; unavailable Gutmann data for 1925; agricultural revenue unavailable from 1920-1930;
and border adjustments left data unavailable for any piece of a county that covered more
than 1% of the county’s original area. Variable Deﬁnitions and Available Years of Data:
County Acres. Acres in each county, held ﬁxed at 1910 borders.
Farmland. Acres of land in farms, including: cropland, pasture, woodland not used for pas-
ture, and “other.” 1910, 1920, 1925, 1930, 1940, 1945, 1950, 1954, 1959, 1964, 1969, 1974,
1978, 1982, 1987, 1992.
Cropland. Acres of cropland: cropland harvested, failed cropland, fallow land (does not
include pasture that could be used for crops without improvement). 1925-1974.
Fallow Land. Land in cultivated fallow, not harvested (Hansen & Libecap 2004). 1925-1964.
Pasture. Acres of pasture, including land used for pasture that could be used for crops
without further improvement. 1925-1964.
Wheat Land. Harvested acres of wheat, prior year. 1910-1997 (restricted sample).
Hay Land. Harvested acres of hay, prior year. 1910-1997, except 1945 (restricted sample).
Other Crops. Harvested acres of other types of crops, included separately as controls for
1925 and 1930 (Missing values are treated as zeros; total cropland only available back to
1925). Land harvested twice is counted twice, and reﬂects the prior year.
Cattle, Swine, Chickens. Numbers of each in 1910-1930, or 1920-1930 (Chickens).
Land Value. The value of farmland, including buildings and improvements attached to the
land (excluding implements and machinery). 1910-1992, except 1974. Data include the av-
erage value of a farm and the average value of a farm acre (the two begin to diﬀer slightly
after 1950, when the census began to sample farms). Total values are calculated from each
measure, and the average of the two is used (oversampling large farms will tend to bias the
averages in opposite directions). Results are not sensitive to using either measure. The value
of land only (not buildings) is available in 1910, 1920, 1930, 1940.
Revenue. Crop revenue and animal revenue (double-counts intermediate products, i.e., it is
not value added). 1910-1992, except 1974.
Crop Revenue. Value of all crops sold, prior year. 1910-1964.
Animal Revenue. Value of all animal products and animals sold, prior year. 1910-1964. From
1920 to 1930, revenue is not directly reported; only the total value of animals is reported.

                                             36
The ratio of animal revenue to total value of animals (stock) is calculated for each county
in 1910 and 1940 and used to impute animal revenue from 1920 to 1930. Results are not
sensitive to using the revenue/stock ratio in 1910 or 1940. Reported estimates use a weighted
average (1910 ratio weighted two-thirds in 1920, one-half in 1925, one-third in 1930).
Wheat Output. Bushels of wheat harvested, prior year. 1910-1997.
Hay Output. Tons of hay harvested, prior year. 1910-1997, except 1940-1945.
Capital. Market value of machinery and equipment used on the farm, regardless of owner.
1910-1945, 1969, 1992.
Population. Total population. 1910, 1920, 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1990, 2000.
Rural Population. Population living in areas with fewer than 2500 inhabitants. 1910-1970.
Farm Population. Population living on farms. 1930, 1940, 1945, 1950, 1970, 1990.
Number of Farms. Number of farms, 1910-1992.
Retail Sales per-capita. Sales in the retail sector. 1930, 1940, 1958, 1967, 1987.
Labor Force. Workers employed, laid-oﬀ without pay (excluding sick or idle), or unemployed
and searching for a job. 1930, 1940, 1950.
Unemployed. Workers unemployed or laid-oﬀ. 1930, 1940, 1950.
Manufacturing Workers, per capita. 1920, 1930, 1940, 1958, 1967, 1987.
Mfg Outcomes. Payroll per-worker, establishments, value added. 1920-1992, except 1950.
Number of Banks. Number of active banks at year end. 1920-1936, annually.
Tenant Farmland. Farmland share operated by tenants. 1910-1992, except 1954 and 1960.
Results Appendix
Estimated changes in land values provide opportunities to explore the validity of the erosion
measure. Some of the measured erosion damage occurred prior to the 1930’s; if counties with
diﬀerent baseline erosion levels would have changed diﬀerently, the diﬀerential changes would
be confounded with the estimated impact of the Dust Bowl. Appendix Figure 1 compares
estimated relative changes in land values for more more-eroded counties in Plains and non-
Plains states.60 Panel A (panel B) graphs the estimated diﬀerence in land values between
high- (medium-) and low-erosion counties, controlling for state-by-time ﬁxed eﬀects.61
  Before 1930, more-eroded Plains counties had relatively higher land values than in non-
Plains states; as expected because Plains counties had yet to experience much of their mea-
sured erosion. After the Dust Bowl, more-eroded counties’ land values fall sharply only in
the Plains. The estimates imply that measured erosion captures Dust Bowl erosion on the
  60
     The nationwide map of cumulative erosion indicates many severely eroded areas outside the Plains,
where the Dust Bowl did not cause additional erosion.
  61
     Control variables are unavailable for all non-Plains counties. The sample includes Plains and non-Plains
counties with available land value data in each period: 867 Plains and 1840 non-Plains counties.



                                                     37
Plains, while counties with baseline erosion diﬀerences changed similarly in other regions.
   A related concern is that observed erosion levels partly reﬂect counties’ land-use, both
prior to 1930 and during the Dust Bowl. Estimated declines in land values would be neg-
atively biased if farmers in counties otherwise becoming less valuable did not protect land
from Dust Bowl erosion. Estimates would be positively biased if counties otherwise becoming
more valuable were farmed more intensely, causing greater Dust Bowl erosion. Measurement
error in erosion levels could also attenuate the estimated eﬀects.
   Some portion of the Dust Bowl erosion was due to severe drought during the 1930’s (the
worst recorded Plains drought). Appendix Table 1 presents estimates when instrumenting
for erosion levels using the number of months during the 1930’s that a county was in extreme
drought, severe drought, moderate drought, average drought levels and annual temperature
in the 1930’s, and the standard deviation of temperatures in the 1930’s.62 The speciﬁcations
control for the drought and temperature variables from 1895 to 1929.
   The identifying assumption is that 1930’s weather was not correlated with changes in land
values, aside from its impact through erosion. The instruments are sometimes correlated with
pre-1930’s county characteristics, so speciﬁcations continue to control for the characteristics
and state-by-year ﬁxed eﬀects. Temporary weather shocks should have limited eﬀects on
land values, though the exclusion restriction would likely fail for other county outcomes.
   Appendix Table 1, columns 1 and 2, report ﬁrst-stage results. Column 1 reports estimates
from regressing the fraction of a county in high-erosion on the instruments and controls:
erosion is greater in counties with more months of extreme drought, and a weaker eﬀect in
counties with more severe drought. Medium-erosion is predicted more by moderate drought
(column 2). The instruments are jointly signiﬁcant, but the explanatory power is not high.63
   Column 3 reports estimated relative changes in land values from 1930 to 1940, instru-
menting for erosion levels with the 1930’s weather variables. Column 4 presents OLS results
for the same sample and controls. When instrumenting, higher erosion counties experienced
a larger relative decline in land values (70% instead of 27%) and medium-erosion counties
experienced a similar relative decline (19% vs. 17%). Any 2SLS bias may be blown up by
weak instruments, but the ﬁrst-stage and implied reduced-form results are clearer: 1930’s
weather predicts both erosion and declining land values from 1930 to 1940. The results are
consistent with measured erosion levels proxying for Dust Bowl erosion.

     Drought is measured by the Palmer Drought Index, which varies with the arrival of rainfall and loss of
moisture. Extreme, severe, and moderate reﬂect conventional Index cutoﬀs. High and extreme temperatures
contribute to drought and crop failure. Data were collected at weather stations, and the PDI is reported by
district (10 districts to a state), see ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/
  63
     Direct measures of soil characteristics and susceptibility to erosion are only available in the modern era,
and may be an outcome of Dust Bowl erosion.
