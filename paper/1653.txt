                             Employment Respond to
                              Economic Conditions?


                                    ABSTRACT


          This paper examines the changes over time in public sector wages and
employment relative to private sector wages and employment using   data from sur-
veys of establishments and individuals. The paper finds that:
          (1) The pay of public sector workers relative to private sector
workers varies greatly over time. Contrary to the view that public sector pay
is inflexible, variations in relative pay are due as much to fluctuations in
public pay as to fluctuations in private pay.

          (2) The relatively high paid public sector worker of the early 1970s
has within the span of a decade lost much of his or her advantage over
otherwise comparable private sector workers, seriously denting if not destroying
the picture of the 'overpaid' public employee which developed in the early
1970s.   The group of public sector workers who tend to be most highly paid in
the U.S. relative to private sector workers are blacks and women, suggesting
that the public sector discriminates less than does the private sector.
          (3) Differentials in public and private sector pay vary greatly
depending on the nature of comparisons, with for example Current Populations
Survey comparisons of individuals with similar broad human capital showing
federal employees to be higher paid than private employees and Bureau of Labor
Statistics surveys of wage rates in particular occupations showing federal
workers to be lower paid.

          (4) Public sector employment follows a very different pattern of
change than pri vate sector employment. It has srnal ler annual variation, and
moves countercyclically rather than cyclically. In terms of demographic com-
position the public sector employs relatively more blacks and women than the
private sector.

          Nearly one in five full—time equivalent employees in the U.S. works

for some branch of government; one—fifth of compensation of employees is paid by

governments. In many labor markets, such as for school teachers, protective

service workers, health sector workers, and white collar workers, in general,

government plays an even larger, sometimes, predominant rDle on the demand side

of markets.

          How do governments act as employers of labor? Are public sector wages

and employment unresponsive to changing economic conditions, as is often held?

Are government workers generally paid a premium over comparable private sector

workers or do public/private pay differentials varj with economic conditions?

What economic forces influence public pay and employment?

          In spite of wide recognition of the importance of the public sector as

an employer of labor, these questions pertaining to the responsiveness of the

wage and employment of government workers have been rarely addressed. The

purpose of this paper is to set out the basic "facts" about public sector wage

and employment patterns in the U.S. and to develop a relatively simple

empirical model of public sector wage and employment setting which answers the

questions of concern.

         The principle findings of the paper are:

         (1) The pay of public sector workers relative to private sector

workers varies greatly over time. Contrary to the view that public sector pay

is inflexible, variations in relative pay are due as rruch to fluctuations in

public pay as to fluctuations in private pay.

            (2)   The relatively high paid public sector worker of the early l9TOs

has within the span of a decade lost much of his or her advantage over

otherwise comparable private sector workers, seriously denting if not destroying

the picture of the 'overpaid' public employee which developed in the early

l9TOs.     The group of public sector workers who tend to be most highly paid in

the U.S. relative to private sector workers are blacks and women, suggesting

that the public sector has a better equal employment/affirmative action record

than does the private sector.

            (3)   Differentials   in public and private sector pay vary greatly

depending   on the nature   of comparisons, with for example Current Populations

Survey comparisons    of individuals with similar broad   human   capital showing
federal employees to be higher paid than private employees and Bureau of Labor
Statistics surveys of wage rates in particular occupations showing federal
workers to be lower paid.
          (1) Public sector employment follows a very different pattern of
change than private sector employment. There is less annual variation in public
sector than in private sector employment. The rate of growth of state and local
employment tends to be countercyclical rather than cyclical while federal
employment growth tends to be less procyclic or countercyclical than private
employment growth. In terms of demographic composition the public sector
employs   relatively more   blacks and women than the private sector, reinforcing

the   belief that the government offers their workers better Job opportunities
than the private sector.

            (5)   Budgets are, not surprisingly, a major determinant of state and

local public sector wage and employment. At the state and local level an

increase in the ratio of budgets to GNP raises relative employment by much more

than it raises relative wages. Because of differences in the response of the

public sector and private sector to broad economic developments, public sector

emplment rises relatively in recessions and falls relatively in booms while

relatIve   wages ve In   the opposite direction. Relative state and local public
sector employment tends, moreover, to fall in periods of rapid inflation. By

contrast, federal wage and employment, which constitute only a small proportion

of budgets and which can be financed by deficit financing, do not exhibit a

well—defined relationship to various measures of budget size.

Changing Patterns of Pay

            The principal phenomenon of concern to this study — changes in the

relative pay of public sector workers —               is   depicted graphically in Figure 1.

This figure shows that the ratio of total compensation of public sector workers

relative to private sector workers in the National Income and Product Accounts

(NIPA) has varied greatly in recent decades and in the Depression and World War

II. During the Depression nominal public pay reiiined roughly constant while

private nominal pay fell, producing a substantial public pay advantage. During

World War II, private pay rose rapidly, lowering the piblic:private differen-

tial. From roughly the mid—1950s to the 1960s, public sector pay rose relative

to private sector pay, while beginning in the mid l9TOs relative public sector

pay fell.

            The changes     in relative pay   shown in the figure could have resulted

largely   from   movements in private pay or largely from movements in public pay or

from roughly equal movements in the two series. The notion that public pay is

"inflexible" relative to private pay implies that it is rvements of the latter
that underly the changes in the figure.
         To test this notion I have decomposed the relative pay measures in
several ways     using   variants of the basic variance decomposition formula:
                           w
                             g
                                   = a                        — 2o
            (1    a Iln(
                           w           lflWg +        a lnw          (lnwglnwp)
                            p
where Wg = wage in government sector

      w =   wage in private sector

              The variants of the decomposition formula that I use are:       (i)

decomposition of the ratio of real wages; (2) decomposition of the level of real

wages after removing a linear trend term; (3) decomposition of              changes in

money wages; (14) decomposition after an auto—regressive adjustment of' the

underlying series.

              The results of the exercise (summarized in Appendix Table A) show that

public sector pay varies over time imre or less as much as private sector pay,

so that the notion of relatively inflexible public sector pay does not stand up

to    scrutiny. The changes in the ratio of public to private sector pay in Figure
1    are due roughly as much to variations in the former as to variations in the

latter.
The Seventies Decline in Relative Public Pay
              The view that public sector workers are "overpaid" gained support as
the result        of   a set of studies of public sector wages in the early 1970s. As

Figure    1 shows, the ratio of public to private pay was especially high then and

declined      thereafter.      Because the drop in the relative public pay in the 1970s

calls    into question the "overpaid public employee" those wages are insulated
from the econonr, I examine a wide variety of data pertaining to relative
public sector wages, including          the payroll data of federal, state, and local

governments, the Bureau of Labor Statistics comparability surveys, US Civil
                                               7




 Service   Commission Reports, and March and May Current Population Surveys of
 individuals. As nr concern is more with changes than with levels of relative
 pay, I   do not address the issue of whom should be compared to whom for the

 purpose of deciding whether public workers are "overpaid" nor do I deal                with
 issues   of job security, fringe benefits, turnover rates and the like which must

also enter an evaluation of relative public sector compensation.

NIPA and    Pay roll   Data

             Table 1 presents information on the ratio          of public to private sector
pay for    all workers in the sectors from         1970 to 1983 as reported in the National
Income and Product Accounts. Column 1 records the ratio of "wages and                  salaries
per full—time equivalent enloyees" for federal civilian employees relative to

those in private industry. The drop of 15 points from the peak 1973 year to

1983   is sizeable, although it      must be put into perspective  by noting that rela-
tive pay increased by rre          than 15 points over the previous decade. Column 2
records    coiarable ratios for state and local government workers, including

those in education. Here the drop is iruch less severe, with a partial recovery

for relative piblic sector pay from 1982 to 1983, when the econonr entered its

worst recession since the 1930s; at the same time, the increase In relative

in   earlier decades is also less imirked.

            How did relative public sector pay         stand   in 1983 compared to earlier

years? In 1983 federal civilian pay was 33% above the private sector average;

from 1950 to 1983, it averaged 32%        above.     In 1983 state and   local   pay   stood at
3% below the private      sector   average; from 1950 to 1983, it averaged             below.

Hence, by 1983 relative government pay seemed roughly to be at its post—1950
average.
            The figures in columns 3 and 14 treat government enterprises. In the
federal government this includes the Post Office, Tennessee Valley Authority,
and   related organizations. For the state and local governments, it includes

public utilities and the like. A different pattern emerges in these data: a

rise in the ratio of federal enterprise to private sector pay contrasted with a

decline in the ratio of state and local enterprise to private sector pay.

Finally, column 5   treats   education, where we find a decline of 10 points from

1910 to 1982 followed by an increase of .03 from 1982 to 1983.

           The disparate patterns suggest the value of re disaggregate look at

various publicly employed groups distinguished by function, level of government

and occupation, to which we turn next.

           Table 2 records data from the government employment and payroll survey

of the Bureau of the Census. It shows a sharp decline in the pay of federal

workers under the general schedule (GS) system (which covers federal white

collar woiters) which is roughly consistent with the NIPA figures, but a

somewhat more complex pattern of change for workers paid under the WS system

(blue collar) and for postal (Ps) employees. In these cases relative wages turn

down in the late 1970s rather than earlier and fall much less       dramatically. For
state   and local government employees, the payroll   data   show a moderate decline

in public/private pay differentials. Decomposed into education and other

government functions, the figures for municipalities show a much greater con—

 centration of the decline in the education sector than found in Table 1, and
also a partial recovery for both education and other municipal workers in the
1980s.
             Because   federal GS employee pay increases are legislated by the

Congress, it is possible to compare the observed changes in GS pay to the

changes    that would result if   legislated increases were the sole cause of change.

In the period 19T2—1982     legislated federal increases amounted to 814% of   1972

salary   compared to an actual change of 77%    of 1972 salary.   Increases in the

average GS level of federal employees explain the change in salary above the

legislated   amount. As Appendix Table B shows these increases were concentrated
in the latter part of the seventies and rly       1980s. From 1977    to 1982 grade
increases (plus a minor "step creep", defined as increases in pay due to changes

in the "steps" of workers within a GS—level) raised pay by 9.0% compared to an

increase   in pay due to grade increases of 3.14% from 1912 to 1977. Had the
federal government not upgraded the GS—level of its work force — which could
represent a "true" increase in skill level, or a "creep" up in response to
market conditions —— the 1982 ratio of federal GS pay     to   private sector pay in
column 1 would have been 1.19. This implies that federal GS—pay        fell by 25 per-

centage points relative to private sector pay, grade held constant.

Rates of Pay for Comparable Workers

           The comparisons of public and private pay thus far are crude, in that

they do not compare workers in the same occupation or with the same skills.

There are two basic ways to xr.ke such more refined calculations:       (1) to use
                                            12




occupational   wage rates on the pay in detailed occupations; (2) to use mdlvi-
dual level data on the pay of workers with similar personal characteristics.
The former method contrasts wage rates actually used in wage—setting; the latter
method contrasts earnings     with those   of workers having    comparable age, educa-
tion, and the like •     Which is "better" depends on the quality of data and pur-

pose of the comparison.

            Table 3 uses federal professional, administrative, technical and

clerical (PATC) Survey Data to make such comparisons for white collar workers

The PATC survey provides information on average annual wages for occupations in

the private sector comparable to those in the public sector for each grade of

the general schedule (white collar workers) of the civil service. According to

the principle of federal pay in the Federal Pay Comparability Act of l9TO

adjustments in general schedule salaries are supposed to ensure that October

federal wages are   equal   to comparable private sector wages of the previous

March.   When recommending actual wage increases to Congress, however, the
President can suggest wage    changes not based on the PATC and of course Congress

can enact higher or lower pay increases. Each year          since 1977 the   President

has recommended lower increases.

            The figures in Table 3   report      (unweighted) average ratios of federal

to comparable private sector pay within GS—classes. To assure comparability of

data over time the averages are limited to occupations which report pay in each

year from 1972 to 1983. While the data can be summarized in other ways (weighted

averages;   inclusion   of occupations contained in one year's survey but not in

Note: For comparability over time the figures report unweighted averages of
occupational ratios only for occupations reporting in 1972 and in all later
years. The pattern for other occupations included in later surveys is con-
sistent with that in the table. I have left out GS—3 because there were no
occupations in 1972 and GS—6 because only one occupation reported in 1972.

another year's survey) the    pattern   is sufficiently   clear as to require no more

detailed computations. The effect of Presidential recommendations of lower than

comparable pay increases and of resultant Congressional action in the l9TOs has

been to reduce relative federal pay     falls sharply     in all GS—levels, with an

unweighted average decline of 23 percentage points!

            Table 4 records the results of similar comparisons for clerical and

skilled    maintenance workers for the federal governint; for clerical and skilled
maintenance workers in nunicipal                              firefighters,
                                    government employment; and of

police and teachers. At the federal level, we see the drop in relative pay for
clerical workers but not for skilled maintenance workers. At the municipal
level    we see sharp drops for all occupations, with police and firefighters

experiencing surprisingly large declines nearly as great as those for teachers.

            All told, these comparisons of workers      in given occupations suggests
that the drop in public/private pay indicated in Tables 1 and 2 may underesti-
mate the fall in public sector pay, particularly for employees of local govern-
ments.
Current Population Survey
            An alternative widely used way to compare workers with similar attri-
butes is to use data on individuals from the Current Population Survey tapes.
These tapes provide detailed information on personal characteristics of workers
but less adequate information on occupation and, in        some   cases, on   type   of
employer. The CPS tapes contain two questions on public sector employment: a
class of worker question which divides workers between private employment, self

employment,       and governmental employment and the "industry" of employment
question,     which includes public administration by level of government. As the

claim that government workers are "overpaid" received its strongest support in

Sharon Smith's analysis of CF'S tapes in the mid 1970s, it is important to see

how    public—private     pay differentials have changed in the CPS.

             Table 5      presents    the results of   an analysis of usual hourly pay      from
tile   May UF'5   tapes   for 1913,    1918, and 19i3,   and of   annual earnings from    the
March CPS tapes      for 1968,    1977 and 1982. While there are some inconsistencies
between the two CF'S       surveys and    between them and the earlier data sources the

general    picture of declining public sector differentials in            the seventies holds

for most government branches. In particular, both the May                and   March   CF'S files
show declines in the relative pay           of   all government employees in the l9TOs,

thou the magnitude of the drop differs with the survey, group, and years
covered.     The coefficients on federal         public administration in the May tape
indicate    a sizeable 7     point drop and an 11 point drop in        the March   tape. The
pay    of teachers drops more sharply in         the March CPS,    and both tapes show drops
for    nonpublic administration, and rises, 8          points   for postal workers. The prin-

cipal aberrant result is the rise in pay            in local    public administration found in

both   CPS tapes, which         with virtually all other data on local pay
                             contrasts

rates. It may be due to the change in classification between the 1982 and 1983
surveys due to implementation of 1980 census definition as described in
Appendix C.

differentials and to the magnitude of changes in differentials, the difference

between CPS—based data and the other data sets examined in this study becorno:

striking, indeed. In general, the CPS—based data show sms.ller relative declines

in public sector pay than do the payroll (NIPA) and occupation—based data and

higher public to private ratios of relative pay, whereas the levels of relative

pay   also    differ significantly in some cases. In particular, in the PATC and

other detaIled Job surveys we found federal GS workers paid          less   than other

workers, in the CPS we find workers in federal public administration earning

more   than   the typical private sector worker in the same occupation, with

the sane personal characteristics.

              There   are two basic reasons for this inconsistency. First, in
contrast to the CPS      which gathers data on all workers, the    PATC survey    is

limited to workers in relatively large firms, whose pay         traditionally    exceeds
that of workers in smaller firms.         Whether   this makes the CPS   or PATC corn—

parisons "better" is a matter of Judgernent. Some (Wachter and Perloff) have
interpreted comparability as calling for comparisons of federal employees with
all workers. Others argue that it        is wrong to compare employees of     the largest
single enterprise In the U.S. to workers from Joe's corner store (Hartman),
making the PATC comparison a more accurate picture of 'where        the federal
government stands in labor markets. Second is the difference betieen
comparisons of wages      in   well—defined jobs and of wages of persons with simihtr

demographic characteristics. Here, the PATC data has a clear advantage, a it

refers   to specific occupations (computer programmer, accountant) for which the
                                            19




 federal government hires persons rather than of broadly defined groups
(professionals, with college education, of a given age) nrst of whom may lack
the skill for the particular job.
            Finally,   it   is important to recognize that part of the observed pre-

mium to   federal piblic administration shown in Table 5 reflects      different public

than private pay   policies    toward minorities and women. Table 6 documents this

point for usual hourly      earnings in M&y 1983   and for annual earnings, adjusted

for hours   and weeks worked in    1977 and 1982. In all    periods and surveys,   public

employees tend to have smaller differences in        pay by sex and by race than

private   employees, though there is some indication that the differential between

sectors narrowed In the late 1970s *      early   1980s. As Asher and Popkin have

stressed, to the   extent that government pay is relatively good because of more
equal treatment of minorities and women, interpretation of Current Population

Survey differentials in terms of "over paid" government workers requires

reconsideration   by analysts.

Changing Patterns of Employment

              It is veil known that in the post—World War II period public sector

employment has risen relative to private sector employment. In 1950 15.6% of

full—tine equivalent workers were governnnt employees; In 1983 19.0% of full—

time equivalent workers were government employees.

              In this section I examine the pattern of change in this employment

over the cycle,         by level of government and type of workers. The evidence

shows public sector employment not only to be less variable over time than pri-

vate sector employment but also to exhibit a strikingly different pattern of

change over the business cycle. In addition the puhlic sector employs relati-

vely more blacks and women than the private sector, which in conjunction with

relatively higher pay shown in Table 6,     suggests greater   public sector demand

for those workers.

              Figure 2 depicts the ratios of federal civilian to private employment

and of state and local to private employment from 1950 to 1983, as given in the

NIPA data set. With respect to state and local employment, the data show a

marked rise until the mid—1970s, followed by a relatively sharp decline.

Indeed, from 1981 to 1983 state and local employment actually fell, partly an a

result   of   reductions in CETA employment, and partly as a result of declines in

education due to changes in the size of the school age population. At the

federal level, the employment share follows a very different pattern: from the

early l950s to the late l960s it is roughly constant at 3.8      —

cultural   employment. Thereafter it   drops   sharply to less than 3.0%    of    nonari—

 cultural   employment. The result is a striking change in the composition of

 public employment. In 1950 one in three           public   employees was a federal worker;

 in 1983   one in six was     a federal worker.
             What   about   the cyclical and short term variation in public employment?

             To determine how public sector employment varies in the short         run, I
have   performed    a   two—part analysis. First I calculated the standard deviation

of log changes in employment annually for the public and private sectors; over

the period 1955 — 1982 (leaving out the Korean War episode). Such a calculation

confirms the widely held belief that public sector employment is less variable

over time    than   private sector employment, with the following calculated standard

deviations: private non agricultural employment (.026); federal civilian

employment (.020) state and local employment (.0i7). Second I examined changes

in employment over NBER business cycles. As Table 7 shows, there is a striking

difference in cyclical changes in employment between sectors, particularly

between    state and local    and private employment,       in   6   of
                                                         cyclical swings post
                                                                          7

1953, state and local employment moves countercyclically. The growth of federal
employment nDved countercyclically in the 1970s but varied with the cycle
earlier. Even then, however, it          showed   smaller cyclic variation than private
                                                                                      *

employment. In conjunction with our analysis of changes over time in
public/private pay               these calculations indicate that public sector
                         differentials

payrolls vary differently over time than private sector payrolls do, and thus
must be responding to unique public sector factors mther than to broad swings
in the overall state of the economy.

 Sex and Race

            Our earlier   analysis found that pay differentials by sex and race were

smaller in public than in private employment. What about patterns of

employment?     Table 8 records the race and sex distribution of private and public
employment in 1978 and     1983.   It shows that governments tend to hire
proportionally xre blacks and women      than     does the private sector, though with
noticeable variation among levels of growth. In the 1978—1983 period, the
proportion of blacks in government relative to the proportion of blacks in the
private sector rose while the proportion of women in government increased above
the 50% rate.
Budgets and Macro Determinants of Public Sector Wage and Employment Changes
            Preceding   sections have shown that far from being inflexible or

rigid, public sector wages have changed substantially relative to private sec-

tor wages   over time, and that the growth of public sector employment varies over
time.
            Can we identifr   the factors that affect the ratio of public to pri-
vate   pay, and that  affect the variability of public sector employment?
            In this section I examine the hypothesis that the public sector,      like

other   "industries" alters employment and wages in response the changes in the
economic conditions and    incentives facing it.      What distinguishes public from
private sectors is that the principal economic force on the public side is not
the   competitive economic market but budgets determined in political 'rsrkets.

In   Dunlop's words, "the public sector responds to the discipline of the budget

 rather than     to the discipline of the market." I shall take as given budgets or

tax rates, although In a complete model they are certainly endogenous, and exa-

mine how short—term variations in these factors influence relative public sector

wages and employment in the same 'way that one might examine how short-term

variations in industry output and prices (value added, productivity, profits)

affect private wages and employment.       Because of the very different way in

which their decisions are likely to be affected t,r budgets, such an analysis

must distinguish between federal and state or local governments. State and

local    governments   face, in general, hard budget constraints, whereas the federal

government can run continual deficits to fund its outlays. There is a serious

budget constraint in the one case, but not in the other, which we expect to

produce    differential employment and wage responses to b.idgetaiy changes.
            To begin, Table 9 presents readily available figures on payrolls and
budgets in the l9TOs, designed to provide a crude indication of the extent to
which governments faced budget "crunches" in the period.
            At the federal level outlays as a share of GNP rose sharply in the
period   covered, without a compensating increase in taxes, producing a sizeable

deficit. Despite increases in outlays, however, the ratio of federal compen-

sation to GNP fell, indicative of a sizeable decline in the payroll share of

budgets. As lines 2a — d in Table 9 show, the only budget figures against which

payroll shares    have not dropped drastically are "controllable   outlays".

            At   the state and local level, receipts have risen more rapidly than
outlays,   producing surpluses, and payrolls has risen   relative to GNP (and to

private sector payrolls). However, the share of payroll in budgets has been
relatively fixed over time, Here, the problem with a simple "budget crunch"
story of employment and pay changes are the surpluses run. Payrolls could have
been increased by nearly 15% had the 1983 surplus been spent on pay rolls and by
14% had the payroll share of receipts been constant at its 19T0 level.
            What the figures in Table 9   suggest   is that crude budget pressures on
public sector payrolls are not enough to explain the observed patterns of change
in public sector payrolls and thus in compensation and employment. The budget
"constraint" is not hard enough to be the sole factor at work.
A Small Regression Model: State and Local Governments
            As a final step in evaluating the pattern of change over time In
public   sector wages and employment I have estimated the effect of budgets and

selected macro—economic variables on     relative public sector   wages and

employment. More specifically, I have regressed the ratio of compensation       and
employment in various parts of the public sector on the ratio of the relevant
budget to GNP, the rate of inflation in the GNP deflator, and the level of

unemployment.

            The budget/GNP ratio is expected to be the key determinant of' relative

employment and wages, with the relative magnitude of      the coefficients of
interest.    Inflation is expected to reduce relative public sector pay due' to the

likely slower response of public 'wages to inflation while unemployment is

expected to raise   relative   state and local employment due to the observed eounter—

cyclical ivement of public sector employment.

            Table 10 presents the results for state and local governments and           for
noneducation activities of these governments. Panel A treats the public sector

varLables relative      to   private sector variables. The importance of public

budgets   in   determination    of   employment   and wage is   clear in the results, with a

10% increase in budgets/GNP being divided between employment and wages in a

ratio   of roughly 2    to 1. The macro—economic factors affect relative pay and

employment     in the expected manner, suggesting that the drop in public sector pay
relative to private sector pay in the l9TOs was at least facilitated by infla-
tion and that the weak macro—labor market of the period marked an even greater
slowdown in relative public sector employment than is indicated in Figure 2.
Somewhat surprisingly the figures also show some effect of unemployment on
wages, with the level and ratio of public to private pay falling with high
unemployment. Less the results in Panel A be misinterpreted as resulting from
"inflexible" public sector factors relative to flexible private sector factors,
I report In Panel B calculations focused on the level of the public sector
variables themselves. As can be seen, these calculations shov the variability
and responsiveness of public sector employment           and wages and also inflation with

respect   to budgets.
           Several studies of public sector employment have taken wages as exoge-
nous and payrolls as exogenous or "pre—determined" by other equations
(Ehrenberg, Heiney, Ashenfelter and Ehrenberg, for example) and examined the
elasticity of the employment response to wages. While the process of public sector
wage,   enployment, and budget determination is         mre complex than can be repre-

sented   by such a demand    determined          ndei, it is useful to note that the aggre-

gate   time series data show such demand type relations for the state and local

sectors. Regressing in employment on in wages, budget,                   and   macroeconomic

variables yields the following for all state and local workers:

             These   results confirm the findings of demand—type behavior and a
marked tradeoff between employment and wages for state and local governments.
             While the evidence in Table 10 reveals "reasonable" time series pat-
terns at the    state and   local level, the         calculations should be viewed

cautiously.    With nearly half of state and local government employees covered by

collective bargaining, and        the      division of a budget a matter for both collective

bargaining and public policy-, of concern to taxpayers whose willingness to

finance any   given budget will certainly depend on its division between
employment (services) and     cost,         it   is clear   that a nre   complex analysis is
                                             33




required    to determine the underlying behavior. The development of an
appropriate simultaneous employment, wage and budget idel. lies, however, beyond
the purview of this paper. For our purposes, it suffices to note that fluc-
tuations in pay and employment are related to broader macro—economic factors and
to   budgets in   a reasonable way over time.
            In   addition to the   estimates given in Table 10, I   performed comparable

calculations      for federal government wages and employment. These calculations
give quite different results, with coefficients on budgets unstable depending on
years selected and precise model specification. This is roughly consistent with
the Table 9 evidence that federal payrolls are too small a proportion of budgets
to run into significant constraints, that the payroll share of federal budgets
has been falling, and with the fact that the federal government can and does use
deficit financing ——     all of which suggest no clear stable budget "constraint" on
payrolls.

-   Conclusion

                The principal result of this paper is that public sector relative
    wages and employment changes substantially in both the short and long run,
    apparently   in response to changes in broad         economic factors and to the financial
    status of the various governments. The seventies were a period of relative

    decline in public pay, of significant magnitudes at the level of specific occu—

    has   highlighted the divergent picture one gets of the magnitude of public sector

    pay   relative   to private sector pay dependent on whether one controls for broad

    human capital or for specific occupations, but            also   finds that nearly all data

    show the same pattern of change over time. It has documented the counter-

    cyclical pattern of public sector employment and shown that variation over time

    at the state and local level follows reasonable patterns with respect to budgets

    and macro—economic variables. While the paper leaves open the appropriate model

    with which we should address these response patterns, it has provided a clear

    answer to the question posed. Yes, public sector wages and employment re$pond

    to economic conditions.

vate pay      in   lines 2 and 3 but is less than that in private pay in lines 1 and 4•

Since the results depend on the particular                       computation, we conclude that public
sector pay Is not noticeably less variable than private sector pay. Changes in

the private sector denominator do no drive changes in relative public sector

pay.

Appendix      B: Calculation of Relative Contributions of Scheduled Increases,
Increases due to "Grade Creep" and to "Step Creep" in the GS—pay Schedule
         There are eighteen grades and ten steps in the GS schedule. Grades are
for promotion, steps are for longevity and merit pay increases. In addition,
longevity increases above step ten are possible. (These additional increases
cause some additional calculations below.)

follows:
Scheduled Increases

         A. The average annual      salary   for the initial year    was calculated by
taking actual salaries [avsail.
         B.    The increase attributable to changes in the pay        schedule   was calcu-

lated by first     year   employment by- grade and sex to calculate a weighted average

of the final year pay       structure.   Since   the number of workers above step 10
changes between years, this calculation required adjustment of the final year
wage schedule to reflect the number of persons above step ten in the first year

1acin.

         C. Increase in average wage attributable to step and pay          increases,    was

calculated by taking first year employment by grade to calculate a weighted

average of final year average wage by grade. This reflects both the increase in

average step and the increase/decrease in the number of         persons above step 10
iavslstepl.
        D. Increase in average      wage attributable to step, pay, and grade
increase was calculated by taking the average wge [avsall in the final year.

Thus:

          pay increase =   B — A

          step increase    C — B

          grade increase = D — C

        Appendix C: Note on Sources for Public Sector Pay and Employment

Time series on relative wages were calculated from:
            1) Average salary        for   full—time equivalent employees is found in       the

National   Income and Products accounts produced by the Bureau of Labor

Statistics.

             2)    Average Salary for full—time federal employees (General Schedule,
Wage System, Postal and other pay          systems)     employedon March 31st   of each year is

found   in the Pay Structure of the Federal Civil             Service published by the Office

of   Personnel    Management.

            3)     Relative pey of general schedule employees for comparable occupa-
tions are    calculated      in the National Survey     of   Professional Administration,
Technical and Clerical employees (PATC surveys) piblished by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
             )     Average   salaries and employment based on October peyroll are           found

in the Bureau of the Census Series (Public Employment (Series GE—i).
             5)    Current   Population Survey     paper: Relative py differentials
controlling       for geographic personnel and hun.n         capital characteristics were
calculated from the March and May          tapes   for 1973, 1978, and 1983. The March
tapes survey      annual   earnings for the previous year, only those workers for whom
industry and occupation did not change were              included.   1980 Industry and
Occupation    codes were implemented in 1983. This led to some exageration of the
increase in the coefficient on local public administration employees compared to
similar regressions using the 1970 classifications on the 1982 data.
