                                            ABSTRACT

This paper explores the potential impacts on both China and other major countries of possible mega
trade deals. These include the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Regional Comprehensive Economic
Partnership (RCEP), and various blocked deals. We use a numerical 13-country global general equilibrium
model with trade costs to investigate both tariff and non-tariff effects, and include inside money to
endogenously determine imports on the trade imbalance. Trade costs are calculated using a method
based on gravity equations. Simulation results reveal that all FTA participation countries will gain
but all FTA non-participation countries will lose. If non-tariff barriers are reduced more, the impacts
will be larger. All effects to China on welfare, trade, export and import are positive. Comparatively
China-TPP and RCEP will yield the highest welfare outcomes for the US in our model, China-Japan-Korea
FTA will generate the second highest welfare outcome, and China-US FTA will generate the third
highest welfare outcome. For the US, China-TPP FTA will generate the highest welfare outcome.
For the EU, all China involved mega deals have negative impacts except China-US FTA. For Japan,
RCEP will generate the highest welfare outcome. For both Korea and India, RCEP will generate the
highest welfare outcome.

1. Introduction


     The term “mega deal” has been widely used in relation to large prospective trade deals

between the US and Europe (the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP) and

in Asia and the Pacific (Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP) (see Felbermayr et al (2013),

Plummer (2013), Stoler (2013), and Hengel (2013)). Here we argue that the phenomenon of

mega deal is much broader than just these two (TPP and TTIP). Big countries, like the US,

the EU, China, Japan and India, engaged regional trade agreement (RTA) or bilateral free

trade agreement (FTA) may all be able to conclude deals in the mega category. As the second

largest country and the biggest export country in the world, China’s involved mega deals may

have influential impacts both on herself and the world. Until now, China has been excluded

from the TPP and TTIP negotiation, but China is active in both negotiating and trying to

initiate new mega deals like Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and

China-Japan-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (CJK FTA). Meanwhile, some other big

mega deals may be negotiated in the future like China-TPP FTA and China-US FTA. This

paper aims to explore the potential impacts on China of possible mega trade deals with

computational general equlibirum methods.


     The impacts of mega trade deals, stressed by traditional trade theory, include both the

benefits of improved and more secure access to export markets abroad, and the benefits to

both consumers and producers at home of increased specialization and improved variety and

quality of products imported, reduced in price by the reductions in tariffs toward bilateral

trading partners. There is a variety of theoretical research in the literature, including Viner


                                               3
(1950), Michaely (1965), Baldwin and Venables (1995), Pomfret (1997), Schiff and Winters

(2003). Two survey papers, Adams et al (2003) and Lloyd and Maclaren (2004) summarize

these researches. Given the ambiguities that still remain in the predictions of general

equilibrium theory, the use of CGE models is a natural vehicle to explore the economic

effects of RTAs. These models can be used to evaluate the effects of changes in trade policy

resulting on production, employment, consumption, trade, prices and welfare. Related

literatures include Brown et al (1992), Hertel et al (2001), Scollay and Gilbert (2001), Hertel

et al (2003), Baldwin (2008), Lee et al (2009), Patricio (2011), Itakura and Lee (2012), and

so on.


     Among regional trade agreement literatures, some literatures pay attention to China

related mega deals, but are largely analytical. For example, Shabir and Kazmi (2007)

analytically analyze the economic effects of Pakistan-China FTA. Song and Yuan (2012)

analyze China’s free trade agreement strategies. Choi (2013) study the expected effects and

future directions of a China-Korea FTA. Fukunaga and Isono (2013) paid attention to how to

take ASEAN+1 FTAs towards the RCEP. Li, Wang and Whalley (2014) have

comprehensively discussed China involved mega trade deals. Only a few papers have used

computational general equilibrium models to empirically simulate potential effects of China’s

FTAs. Mai (2005) and Siriwardana and Yang (2007) both studied the economic effects of

Australia-China FTA with the GTAP model. Jin et al (2006) explore the effects of the FTA

among China, Japan and South Korea. Tan and Cai (2009) use the GTAP model to

quantitively analyze the impacts of a China-New Zealand FTA on both sides. Petri et al (2011)

used a CGE model to study the effects of TPP and Asia-Pacific Integration and have paid


                                               4
attention to the impacts to China. Li and Whalley (2014) used an 11-country numerical

general equilibrium model to explore the effects of TPP to China. Until now, none of

researches have focused on the combined influence of China’s possible mega deals.


     We use numerical general equilibrium simulation methods to explore possible mega

trade deal impacts on both China and other main big countries in this paper. The analytical

novelty of the paper relative to present literature lies in two directions. The first is we divide

trade costs into tariff and non-tariff barriers and calculate trade costs between countries

empirically with gravity model methodology. This can comprehensively explore the FTA

effects from both tariff and non-tariff reduction. The second is to use an inside money

structure to form an endogenous trade imbalance model which is more consistent with reality

given China’s large imbalances in trade.


    We use a 13-country Armington type global general equilibrium model. Each country

produces two-goods (Tradable goods and Non-tradable goods) and has two-factors (capital

and labor). The model captures trade costs and uses a monetary structure of inside money

both so as to also endogenously determine trade imbalance effects from the trade initiative

and also allow calibration to a base case capturing China’s large trade surplus. We use a trade

cost calculation method that recognizes limitations of data by using an estimation treatment

that follows Wong (2012) and Novy (2008). We capture endogenously determined trade

imbalances by incorporating both current consumption and expected future incremental

consumption from saving into the model using an analytical structure attributed to Patinkin

(1956), also adopted in Archibald and Lipsey (1960), and used more recently in Whalley et al

(2011) and Li and Whalley (2012, 2014). We calibrate the model to 2011 data and use

                                                5
counterfactual simulations to explore the effects.


    Our simulation results show that almost all mega deal member countries will gain and

nearly all mega deal non-member countries will lose. The more that non-tariff barriers are

eliminated by each mega deal, the more significant impacts the mega deal have on all

countries. All mega deals will benefit China in terms of welfare, trade, export and import.

Comparatively, RCEP and China-TPP will generate the highest welfare outcome in our model,

the next highest is China-Japan-Korea FTA, and then China-US FTA. For the US, China-TPP

will generate the highest welfare outcome, the next highest is China-US FTA. For the EU, all

China involved mega deals will generate negative welfare outcome except China-US FTA.

For Japan, RCEP will generate the highest welfare outcome and the next highest is

China-TPP. For Korea, RCEP will generate the highest welfare outcome and the next highest

is China-Japan-Korea FTA. For India, RCEP will generate the highest welfare outcome and

the next is China-India FTA.


    We use a monetary endogenous trade imbalance model structure and do sensitivity

analysis, and change elasticities and upper bound inside money parameters. All of these

results suggest that our simulation results are reasonably robust.


    The remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows: Part 2 introduces China’s

possible mega deals; Part 3 is the global general equilibrium model specification; Part 4

presents data and reports parameters from calibration; Part 5 reports simulation results for

different scenarios. The last part offers conclusions and policy implications.

2. China’s Possible Mega Deals


     Table 1 lists existing and prospective mega deals for China, the US and the EU. The

description of a trade deal as “mega” refers both to regional trade agreements (RTAs)

between large countries or groups of countries and the barrier coverage of such deals. The

commitment to multilateral WTO negotiation, now weakened by experience in the Doha

Round, has so far largely precluded large-large bilateral or regional negotiations. Combined

with a focus of restoring growth in the OECD, this picture is changed by the TPP negotiations,

the EU-US TTIP, China’s emerging mega trade deals (including RCEP), and deals under

discussion of others including Japan and ASEAN.

     We can simply label all deals between countries above a certain size as a mega deal, but

in reality, there are the ‘large’ mega deals both directly involving the EU, the US, China, and

ASEAN, and deals involving the midsize economies (Japan, Canada, Brazil, Turkey, for

example). As large economies, China, the US and the EU involved regional trade agreements

(RTAs) are the most noticeable. For China there are ongoing negotiations with India, and

Japan/Korea, and ASEAN+6 on a RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership),

as well as possible future involvement in the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiation and

                                                      7
even a possible US-China deal. For the US, there are the TPP negotiations and negotiations

with the EU on a TTIP for which China is not a party. For the EU there are negotiations under

way with the US on TTIP, an India negotiation, and an ASEAN negotiation.


     In this paper we focus on the impacts of China’s possible mega deals. We firstly need to

explore China’s RTAs in place to have a general idea about the situation. Table 2 lists the

regional agreements in place for China which could also provide part of the precedent

working background for prospective mega deals with other partners. Nearly all the

agreements listed in each case are with smaller entities, and the China-ASEAN agreement is

the only one that qualifies as being labeled a “mega” deal. Among these existing RTAs, only

the agreement with New Zealand is a developed country agreement and this has a different

structure from other Chinese developing country agreements.

     (1) The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a proposed Free

Trade Agreement (FTA) between the 10 ASEAN Member countries and its FTA Partners

(Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea and New Zealand). RCEP aims to be a significant step

in the evolution of trade policy frameworks in East Asia. RCEP started as a study group for

an FTA between ASEAN, China, Japan, and Korea (known as ASEAN+3), with a parallel

study process for an ASEAN+6 FTA, which included the ASEAN+3 partners plus Australia,

India, and New Zealand. It has now formalized itself as a 16 country negotiation. RCEP

negotiations were formally launched in November 2012 at the ASEAN Summit in Cambodia;

it has already initiated several rounds of negotiations. RCEP negotiations are scheduled to

conclude by end-2015.

     RCEP will cover trade in goods, trade in services, investment, economic and technical

cooperation, intellectual property, competition, dispute settlement and other issues. The

agreement will encompass trade in goods and services, economic and technical issues,

intellectual property and investments, and dispute settlement mechanisms. The RCEP will

have broader and deeper engagement with significant improvements over the existing

ASEAN+1 FTAs, while recognizing the individual and diverse circumstances of the

participating countries.


     (2) The China-Japan-South Korea Free Trade Agreement is a proposed trilateral free

trade agreement between China, Japan and South Korea. Negotiations on the agreement were

started in 2012. Three rounds of talks were held in 2013. The pace of the negotiations has

been slowed by the island disputes between China-Japan and Japan-Korea.


     In the first two rounds, the three sides discussed key issues such as ways to lower tariffs

and the scope of future negotiations based on terms of reference adopted at the first round of

talks. The second round of negotiation included working-group meetings on goods, services

and competition along with expert dialogue on intellectual property rights and e-commerce.

The three Asian countries talked about the trilateral FTA’s modality, such as how to draft

liberalization for goods at the third round of negotiation. Working group meetings were held

to discuss a wide range of topics such as indications of origin, customs, trade remedy,

sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) and technical barriers to trade (TBT) along with services,

investment, competition, general rules and intellectual property rights. Discussions among

experts were on e-commerce, environment, government procurement and food sectors.

     (3) Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is one of the most important FTA arrangements

under negotiation in the Asia Pacific region; and it has received global attention in recent

years. China is, for now, not involved in the TPP negotiation, but some Chinese researchers

have proposed that China should take part in the TPP negotiation (Song and Yuan, 2012).

There is substantial secrecy about the possible content of TPP, with as yet no official

documents released.


     The objective of the TPP negotiations remains to develop an FTA agreement which will

be able to adapt and incorporate current issues, concerns and interests of members. Since the

initiation of TPP in 2010, 18 formal rounds of negotiation have been held. Working groups

have been established in areas of market access, technical barriers to trade, sanitary and

phytosanitary measures, rules of origin, customs cooperation, investment, services, financial

services, telecommunications, e-commerce, business mobility, government procurement,

competition policy, intellectual property, labor, environment, capacity building, trade

remedies, and legal and institutional issues. A unique departure from other FTAs is the

group’s additional focus on cross-cutting “horizontal issues” such as regional integration,

regulatory coherence, competitiveness, development and small and medium enterprises

(SMEs).


     There are many debates about whether China should join the TPP negotiations and they

are quite lively. Not only Chinese media but also some commentators from the US and

Europe have expressed interest in this topic. A China-TPP trade deal is under consideration

and discussion by researchers, and maybe in the future, China will take part in the TPP.




                                              11
      (4) There are as yet no official statements concerning or discussions of a China-US free

trade agreement, but at a research level, a China-US free trade agreement has been discussed.

Although there will be a lot of difficulties, as the two biggest countries in the world it may be

possible to initiate a free trade agreement negotiation in the future. Trade and investment

between the US and China have continued to grow at a substantial rate. As with any

relationship between major powers, there is friction and concern on both sides about how the

trade relationship is conducted. US negotiating concerns would likely focus beyond tariff

with such issues as alleged currency manipulation and its effects on the trade surplus, and

state owned enterprises and their trade impacts. Chinese objectives could potentially focus on

security of access to US markets, and restrictions on foreign ownership and investment. A

China-US bilateral investment treaty (BIT) negotiation is in process and it could lay a

foundation for possible FTA negotiation.


      (5) China and India have conducted a Joint Study Group which finalized a report on the

feasibility of a China-India Regional Trading Arrangement (RTA) in October 2007. The

report supports the position that a China-India RTA would benefit each other and both sides

agreed to explore the possibility of commencing discussions on a RTA but no further formal

agreement to proceed further has been achieved.


     In the meanwhile, economic relations between China and India have developed quickly.

As two main emerging countries, China and India can gain from an RTA, and they are near

each other in geography (Antkiewicz and Whalley, 2005). These factors might suggest that

China and India may take further a regional trade agreement negotiation in the reasonably

near future, but with higher tariffs in India, Indian manufacturing interests are cautious.

3. Model Structure


     In order to capture the potential effects of China’s involvement in possible Mega deals,

we use a 13-country Armington type global general equilibrium model. These 13 countries

are China, the US, the EU, Japan, Korea, Canada, Mexico, India, AN (Australia plus New

Zealand), CP (Chile plus Peru), BMSV (Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore plus Vietnam),

CILMPT (Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippine plus Thailand) and the rest of the

world (ROW). Each country produces two-goods (Tradable goods and Non-tradeable goods),

and has two-factors (capital and labor) which are intersectorally mobile but internationally

immobile.

     3.1 Endogenous Trade Imbalance General Equilibrium Model with Inside Money

     In our global general equilibrium model, we add a monetary structure using inside

money following Whalley et al (2011) and Li and Whalley (2014) to endogenously determine

the trade imbalance, which is offset through inter-temporal trade across countries in money

and also allows for a calibration to a base case where China has a large trade surplus.


     This monetary structure builds on Azariadis (1993) where there is extensive discussion

of simple overlapping generation models with inside money. Here, in addition, interactions

between monetary structure and commodity trade are needed, and hence motivates models

with simultaneous inter-temporal and inter-commodity structure.


     In our general equilibrium model with monetary structure, we allow inter-commodity

trade to co-exist within the period along with trade in debt in the form of inside money. We

use a single period model where either claims on future consumption (money holding) or


                                               13
future consumption liabilities (money insuance) enter the utility function as incremental

future consumption from current period savings. This is the formulation of inside money used

by Patinkin (1947, 1971) and Archibald and Lipsey (1960). This can also be used in a

multi-country model structure with trade in both goods and inside money.


     On the production side of the model, we assume CES technology for production of each

good in each country (Figure 1)

                           σ il −1                         σ il −1 σ il

                                             i       i           ]         ,             i = country, l = goods                                (1)


where Qil is the output of the lth industry (including both tradable and non-tradable goods)

in country i , Lli and Kil are the labor and capital inputs in sector l , φil are the scale

parameters, δ il are the distribution parameters and σ il is the elasticity of factor substitution.

First order conditions imply the factor input demand equations.


     On the consumption side, we use the Armington assumption of product heterogeneity

across countries, and assume claims on future consumption enter preferences and are traded

between countries. Each country can thus either issue or buy claims on future consumption

using current period income. We use a nested CES utility function to capture consumption

                                        1         σ i −1          1                      σ i −1        1          σ i −1 σ i

                                                                                     )            + α i 3 (Yi )        ]        ，i = country   (2)


Where X iNT denotes the consumption of non-tradable goods in country i , X iT denotes the

consumption of composite Armington tradable goods in country i , and Yi denotes the

inside money for country i . Additionally αi1 , α i 2 and α i 3 are share parameters and σ i is

the top level elasticity of substitution in consumption.

                                                                                 14

     The composite of tradable goods is defined by another nesting level reflecting the

country from which goods come. We assume that this level 2 composite consumption is of

CES form and represented as,

                        1     σ i ' −1 σ i '
                       σ i ' T σ i ' σ i ' −1
     X = [∑ βij xij
       T
       i                             ]          ,     j = country
                 j
                                                                                                                       (3)


Where xijT is the consumption of tradable goods from country j in country i . If i = j

this denotes that this country consumes its domestically produced tradable goods. βij is the

share parameter for country j ' s tradable goods consumed in country i . σ i ' is the

elasticity of substitution in level 2 preferences in country i .


    We assume a representative consumer in country i with income as I i . The budget

constraint for this consumer’s consumption is


     Pi T X iT + pciNT X iNT + pciY Yi = I i                                                                           (4)


     Here, Yi represents both inside money (debt) held by country i , and also country i ' s

trade imbalance. Yi > 0 implies a trade surplus (or positive claims on future consumption);

Yi < 0 implies a trade deficit or future consumption liabilities (effectively money issuance),

                                                                     15
and Yi = 0 implies trade balance.


    For trade deficit countries, utility will decrease in inside money since they are issuers. In

order to capture this given that Yi < 0 for these countries, we use an upper bound Y 0 in the

utility function in a term [ Y 0 + Yi ] following Whalley et al (2011) and assume that Y 0 is

large enough to ensure that Y 0 + Yi > 0 . We use the transformation yi = Y 0 + Yi to solve the

optimization problem, and the utility function and budget constraint become

    We introduce trade costs for trade between countries. Trade costs include not only import

tariffs but also other non-tariff barriers such as transportation costs, language barriers, and

institutional barriers. We divide trade costs into two parts in our model; import tariff and

non-tariff trade costs. We denote the import tariff in country i as ti , and non-tariff trade

costs as N ij (ad volume tariff-equivalent non-tariff trade costs for country i imported from

country j ). This yields the following relation of consumption prices and production prices



                                                                  17

     pcijT = (1 + ti + Nij ) pTj                                                         (15)


    Import tariffs will generate revenues Ri , which are given by

     Ri =   ∑p
            j ,i ≠ j
                           T

For non-tariff trade costs, they are different from the import tariff: They cannot collect

revenue, and importers need to use actual resources to cover the costs involved. In the

numerical model, we assume that the resource costs involved in overcoming all other

non-tariff barriers are denominated in terms of domestic non-tradable goods. We incorporate

this resource using feature through use of non-tradable goods equal in value terms to the cost

of the barrier. We thus assume reduced non-tariff trade costs (including transportation cost)

will thus occur under trade liberalization as an increase in non-tradable goods consumption

NRi by the representative consumer in importing countries. The representative consumer’s

income in country i is thus given by


    wiK Ki + wiL Li + Ri = I i                                                           (17)

     A possible mega-FTA will thus reduce both import tariffs and non-tariff trade costs

between member countries which will influence the whole world. Using the general

equilibrium model above, we can calibrate it to a base case data set and then simulate the

potential effects.

     3.2 Trade Cost Calculation

     We report our calculations of trade costs in this part which provides trade cost estimates

for use in our general equilibrium model. The methodology we use is from Novy (2008) and

Wong (2012). We calculate and report ad valorem tariff-equivalent trade costs between

countries in 2011.


     A broad definition of trade costs includes policy barriers (Tariffs and Non-tariff barriers),

transportation costs (freight and time costs) as well as communication and other information

costs, enforcement costs, foreign exchange costs, legal and regulatory costs and local

distribution costs. Figure 2 reports the structure of representative trade costs used by

Anderson and Wincoop (2004) to illustrate conceptually what is involved.

                                                                 19
     Trade costs have large welfare implications. Current policy related costs are often more

than 10% of national income (Anderson and Wincoop, 2002). Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000)

commented that all the major puzzles of international macroeconomics hinge on trade costs.

Other studies estimate that for each 1% reduction of trade transaction costs world income

could increase by 30 to 40 billion USD (APEC, 2002; OECD, 2003; De, 2006).


     Here, we have calculated trade costs following the approaches in Novy (2008) and

Wong (2012). Their method is to take the ratio of bilateral trade flows over local trade, scaled

to some parameter values, and then use a measure that capture all barriers. Some papers have

argued that this measure is consistent with the gravity equation and robust across a variety of

trade models. According to both literatures, we get a measure of the average bilateral trade

barrier between country i and r :

                         1              1            1   1   1
              X ii X rr 2γ                             (    − )
    tir = (             ) = (τ irτ ri ) 2 ( Fri Fir ) 2 σ −1 γ                            (20)
              X ir X ri


    Data for this equation is relatively easy to obtain, and so we have a comprehensive

measure of trade barriers, and the ad valorem tariff-equivalent bilateral average trade cost

between country i and r can be written as

                                    1
                      X X
    t ir = tir − 1 = ( ii rr ) 2γ − 1                                                     (21)
                      X ir X ri


     Using the trade costs equation above, we can calculate actual trade costs between

countries in our general equilibrium model, which are needed in building a benchmark data

set for use in calibration and simulation.


     We need to calculate trade costs between each country pair for China, the US, the EU,

                                                                  20
Japan, Korea, Canada, Mexico, India, AN (Australia plus New Zealand), CP (Chile plus Peru),

BMSV (Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore plus Vietnam), CILMPT (Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,

Malaysia, Philippine plus Thailand) and the rest of the world (ROW). For the ROW, we use

world total minus all countries in our model to yield the data we use in calculations.


    For trade costs, in equation (26), X ir and X ri are separately exports and imports

between countries i and r . This trade data is from the UN comtrade database, and total

world trade data is from WTO International Trade Statistics 2011. Due to market clearing,

intranational trade X ii or X rr can be rewritten as total income minus total exports (see

equation (8) in Anderson and Wincoop(2003)),


     X ii = yi − X i                                                                      (22)


where X i is the total exports, defined as the sum of all exports from country i , which is

     Xi ≡   ∑X
            r ,i ≠ r
                       ir                                                                 (23)



This data is from the UN Comtrade database also. For yi , GDP data are not suitable because

they are based on value added, whereas the trade data are reported as gross shipments. In

addition, GDP data include services that are not covered by the trade data (Novy, 2008). It is

hard to get this income data according to such a definition, so here we use GDP data minus

total service value added. We get GDP data from World Bank database, and the service share

of GDP data from World Development Indicators (WDI) of World Bank database, we then

calculate results for GDP minus services. We take the value of γ to be 8.3 as in Eaton and

Kortum (2002). We only use trade cost data for 2011 in our numerical general equilibrium

model, calculation results are shown in Table 4.

     3.3 Endogenous Monetary Trade Imbalance General Equilibrium Model


     In order to comprehensively explore the impacts of possible mega deals, we use a

different general equlibirum model structure to do simulation for sensitivity analysis with

common endogenously determined trade imbalance model is the monetary structure.


     To accommodate a trade surplus or deficit as an endogenous variable in the model

structure, we use a monetized extension of this structure incorporating a fixed exchange rate

and non-accommodative monetary policy following Whalley and Wang (2010), and Li and

Whalley (2014). If we only consider the transactions demand for money in each country and

for simplicity assume unitary velocity, the money demand will equal all transaction values in

one country. In our model, it equals all consumption values of tradable goods and

non-tradable goods.


     In traditional models, money is neutral in the sense that once domestic money supplies

are specified, an equilibrium exchange rate is determined independently of the real side and a

fixed exchange rate regime and trade imbalance does not occur. And if the exchange rate is

fixed, then the relative domestic money stocks need to accommodate so as to support it as an

equilibrium exchange rate. In the structure we use, the monetary regime is

non-accommodative to the fixed exchange rate; and in this case the trade surplus or deficit

will be endogenously determined by the equation


    Si = I i − M i
                                                                                         (24)


     Where Si is trade surplus for country i , I i is the total income of country i , M i is

the money supply in country i . Once money supply in country i has been fixed, then the

                                              23
trade imbalance for country i will be endogenously determined. Global trade clearance

determines that all of countries’ trade should be balanced, which is

    ∑S   i   =0
     i                                                                         (25)

     We added these conditions in the global general equilibrium model yielding an

endogenous monetary trade imbalance general equilibrium model structure.

4. Data and Parameters Calibration


     We use 2011 as our base year in building a benchmark general equilibrium dataset for

use in calibration and simulation following the methods set out in Shoven and Whalley

(1992). There are 13 countries in our model, AN denotes Australia and New Zealand, CP

denotes Chile and Peru, BMSV denotes Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam, CILMPT

denotes Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippine and Thailand. We add countries

together to generate AN, CP, BMSV values. We use world values minus all individual

countries to generate ROW values. For the two goods, we assume secondary industry

(manufacturing) reflects tradable goods, and primary and tertiary industries (agriculture,

extractive industries, and services) yield non-tradable goods. For the two factor inputs, capital

and labor, we use total labor income (wage) to denote labor values for inputs by sector. All

data are in billion US dollars. We adjust some of the data values for mutual consistency for

calibration purposes.


     EU data is from EU statistics, and the currency unit is Euro, we use annual average

exchange rate to change them into US dollar; Other countries’ data are all calculated from

WDI of World Bank database. We use agriculture and service share of GDP data and GDP

data to yield production data of tradable goods and non-tradable goods, and use capital/GDP

ratio to yield capital and labor input in production. We set the upper bound in our monetary

            0
structure, Y , to equal 1000 in all countries; and change this value in later sensitivity

analysis to check its influence on simulation results. These data are listed in Table 5.


     Trade data between each pair of countries are from the UN Comtrade database. We use


                                                25
individual country total export and import values to indirectly yield exports to and imports

from the ROW. Using production and trade data, we can then calculate each country’s

consumption values. All trade data are listed in Table 6.

      Note: (1) Units for production, capital, labor, inside money and endowments are all billion US$, and labor here denotes factor income (wage). (2)
AN denotes Australia+New Zealand, CP denotes Chile+Peru, BMSV denotes Brunei+Malaysia+Singapore+Vietnam, CILMPT denotes
Cambodia+Indonesia+Laos+Malaysia+Philippine+Thailand. (3) T-G denotes tradable goods production; NT-G denotes non-tradable goods
production. (4) We add countries together to generate AN, CP, BMSV values. (5) We use world values minus all individual countries to generate
ROW values.
      Sources: EU data from EU statistics, and the currency unit is Euro, we use annual average exchange rate to change them into US dollar currency
unit; Other countries’ data are all calculated from WDI of World Bank database.


       We divide trade costs into two parts, import tariffs and all other non-tariff barriers. We

obtain each country’s import tariff data from WTO Statistics Database. For ROW, we cannot

obtain its import tariff directly, and so we use European Union’s tariff rate to denote these

values. We calculate all other non-tariff barriers by using trade costs (in Table 1) minus

import tariffs. All import tariffs and other non-tariff barrier values are listed in Table 7 and

Table 8.


       There are no available estimates of elasticities for individual countries on the demand

and production sides of the model. Many of the estimates of domestic and import goods


                                                                           26
substitution elasticity are around 2 (Betina et al, 2006), so we set all these elasticities in our

model to 2 (Whalley and Wang, 2010). We change these elasticities later in sensitivity

analysis to check their influence on simulation results.

       With these data, we calibrate the model parameters and report parameter values in Table

7. When used in model solution these will regenerate the benchmark data as an equilibrium

for the model. Then, using these parameters we can simulate the effects of TPP changes under

different scenarios.

5. Simulation of the Effects from Possible Mega Deals


     We use numerical global general equilibrium model to simulate the impacts on China

involved possible mega deals in this part. We mainly pay attention to the impacts on welfare,

trade, export and import. For the welfare, we use a widely used Hicks equivalent variation

(EV) as a percent share of GDP to show the effects. For the trade, export and import, we use

percent change to base model to denote the effects. Our model structure has 13-country, so

we can get the effects to all these 13 countries. In order to save paper space and make the

results easier to show, we just give the effects to six big countries, they are China, US, EU,

Japan, Korea and India. We do sensitivity analysis with different model structure and with

changing elasticities and upper bound inside money value.


     For the possible China involved mega deals, we explore seven different feasible

situations. The first is China-India FTA (we denote it as “C-India” later). The second is

China-Japan-Korea FTA (we denote it as “CJK” later). The third is China-TPP (we denote it

as “C-TPP” later). The fourth is Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

The fifth is China-US FTA. The sixth is a mixed situation that China-India FTA, CJK, RCEP

and China-US FTA exist at the same time (we denote this as “1+2+4+5” situation). The

seventh is also a mixed situation that China-Indian FTA, CJK, China-TPP, RCEP and

China-US FTA exist at the same time (we denote this as “1-5” situation). Among these

different situations, the former five ones are single FTAs; the latter two ones are mixed FTAs.


     For the trade cost reduction level by FTAs, we separate three different situations in

simulation. The first is the effects restricted to tariffs. The second is the effect of assuming


                                               30
FTAs eliminate tariff and 25% of non-tariff barriers. The third is the effects of assuming

FTAs eliminate tariff and 50% of non-tariff barriers. We use these three different assumptions

because China is involved possible mega deals which will definitely reduce both tariffs and

non-tariffs among members, so if we just take account of tariff reduction effects as traditional

literatures will underestimate the potential effects. But we do not know how much of

non-tariff barriers can mega deals eliminate, therefore we use two different assumptions that

FTAs eliminate 50% and 25% non-tariff barriers to show and compare these different

influences.

     5.1 Impacts of Mega Deals on Welfare

     We separately analyze the effects restricted to tariffs, effects incorporated by trade cost,

and effects with using compensation variation (CV) to comprehensively explore mega deals

effects on welfare.


     On the welfare effects restricted to tariff, all free trade agreement participation countries

will gain except China in China-India FTA and China-US FTA. All FTA non-participation

countries will lose. The main reason is that FTA participation countries will gain on trade,

production and consumption and then increase their welfare, but the FTA non-participation

countries’ trade, production and consumption will decrease and lose welfare (See Table 9).


     For China, under only tariff elimination situation, almost all FTA arrangement can

benefit China’s welfare except China-India FTA and China-US FTA. The reason for negative

welfare effects on China is that China’s tariff level is comparatively high, meanwhile India

and US are both big countries, so when China construct a FTA arrangement, tariff reduction

effects and terms of trade effects jointly hurt China. Comparing all the effects of possible

                                               31
mega deals, China-TPP will generate the highest welfare outcome in our model for China, the

next highest is RCEP, and then is China-Japan-Korea FTA. For the mixed mega deals

situation, FTAs of China-India, China-Japan-Korea, RCEP and China-US exist at the same

time will generate the highest welfare outcome for China in our model (see Figure 1).

        For some other main countries, FTA participation countries all gain from potential mega

deals but FTA non-participation countries all lose. For the separate countries, the US will

                                                                       32
generate the highest welfare outcome in our model with China-US FTA and the next highest

welfare with China-TPP FTA. The EU will generate the highest welfare outcome in our

model with China-US FTA and will lose with all other mega deals for she is not a mega deal

participation country. Japan will generate the highest welfare outcome in our model with

China-Japan-Korea FTA and the next highest welfare with China-TPP FTA. Korea will

generate the highest welfare outcome with RCEP and the next highest welfare with CJK.

India will generate the highest welfare outcome with RCEP and the next highest welfare

outcome with China-India FTA (See Table 9).


    We then analyze the welfare impacts incorporating trade cost variation. Actually present

FTAs negotiations mainly focus on non-tariff reduction; therefore it is important to take

account of the non-tariff barriers. We explore the welfare impacts by assume two situations:

the first is FTAs eliminate tariff and 25% of non-tariff, the second is FTAs eliminate tariff

plus 50% of non-tariff.


    Under the trade cost elimination welfare effects, all FTA participation countries will gain

from China’s potential mega deals including China, and all FTA non-participation countries

will lose by China’s potential mega deals. For the welfare effects to specific countries, two

characteristics are prominent. The first is all FTA participating countries’ welfare gain will

increase as trade cost elimination increases, but all FTA non-participation countries’ welfare

loss will also increase as trade cost removes more. The second is China’s welfare effects will

change to positive under trade cost elimination situation (See Table 10).


    For China, China-TPP will generate the highest welfare outcome on our model, the next



                                              33
highest is RCEP, and then CJK. But as non-tariff barriers eliminate more (under 50%

situation), RCEP will generate the highest welfare outcome and the next highest is China-TPP.

In general, China-TPP and RCEP are both good choices in the perspective of welfare

outcome generated by our model (See Table 10).


     For other main countries, China-TPP will generate the highest welfare outcome for the

US and the next highest is China-US FTA. China-US FTA will generate the highest welfare

outcome for the EU. RCEP will generate the highest welfare for Japan and the next highest is

China-TPP. CJK will generate the highest welfare outcome for Korea and the next highest is

RCEP. RCEP will generate the highest welfare outcome for India and the next highest is

China-India FTA (See Table 10).

    In order to check the robustness and reliability of the above simulation results with

     5.2 Impacts of Mega Deals on Total Trade

    On the trade aspect, nearly all FTA participating countries’ trade are positively impacted,

but almost all FTA non-participation countries’ trade are hurt. FTAs participation countries’

trade will increase more as trade costs eliminates more, but FTAs non-participation countries’

trade will decrease more (see Table 12).


    For China, all mega deals together will generate the highest trade benefit in our model.

RCEP will generate the highest trade benefit among single FTAs under only tariff elimination

situation, and China-TPP will generate the highest trade benefit among single FTAs under

trade cost elimination situation. Comparing trade effects of these different possible mega

deals, positive impacts of China-TPP is the most significant one in the model simulation

results; RCEP is the next most one, and then are sequentially China-Japan-Korea FTA,

China-US FTA and China-India FTA (see Figure 2).

    For other main countries, China-TPP will generate the highest trade benefit for the US in

lowest negative trade influence, RCEP will benefit Japan, Korea and India the most on trade

side under the view of model simulation results. China-Japan-Korea FTA and China-US FTA

will generate negative trade impact for India in our model. In general, FTAs participation

countries will gain but non-participating countries will lose on trade.

     5.3 Impacts of Mega Deals on Export

    On the export aspect, simulation results are nearly the same as the total trade situation.

All FTA participation countries can benefit from potential mega deals, but non-participating

countries will lose. Meanwhile, as non-tariff barriers eliminate more, export effects will

become more severe (see Table 13).


    For China, China-TPP and RCEP have generated the most significant positive export

effects in our model, the next most significant one is China-US FTA, and then is

China-Japan-Korea FTA. China-India FTA will generate the lowest export benefit.

Meanwhile, mixed mega deals will generate more export influence than single FTAs (see

Figure 3).

    For other main countries, China-TPP will generate the highest export benefit for the US,

and China-US FTA also has prominent positive export effects for the US. The EU will

China-India FTA will generate the lowest negative export impact. For Japan, RCEP and TPP

has more effects on Japan’s export than other FTAs, China-Japan-Korea FTA will benefit her

significantly as well. For Korea, RCEP and China-Japan-Korea both will generate significant

positive export influence. For India, China-India FTA will generate the highest export benefit

in our model; other mega deals including China-US FTA and China-Japan-Korea FTA have

negative effects on India’s export.

     5.4 Impacts of Mega Deals on Import

    On the import aspect, simulation results are almost the same as export impacts. Almost

all FTA participation countries can gain from potential mega deals, and nearly all FTA

non-participation countries will loss. As non-tariff barriers eliminate more, export impacts

become more significant (see Table 14).


    For China, all mega deals have positive effects. China-TPP and RCEP will generate the

highest positive import influence for China in our model, the next highest is China-US FTA,

and then is CJK. China-India FTA will generate the lowest positive import impact for China.

These results mean that from the perspective of increased import, China-TPP will gain China

the most, RCEP lists the next.

and China-Japan-Korea FTA all have significant positive influence to Japan’s import.

China-TPP has negative effects to Korea’s import, but RCEP has significant positive effects

to Korea’s import. China-Japan-Korea FTA and China-US FTA have negative effects to

India’s import, and RCEP has the most prominent positive effects to India’s import.

     5.5 Sensitivity Analysis with Endogenous Monetary Trade Imbalance Model

    We use the endogenous monetary trade imbalance model to recalculate the potential

impacts of China involved mega deals. It is helpful for checking the reliability of our

simulation results with the inside money trade imbalance model.


    Table 15 shows all the influence results on welfare, trade, export and import by

comparing two different model structures. We find that almost all results show the same

influence direction (positive or negative). Differences mainly exist in influence level with

different impact numbers, these difference are not huge.


    We take China as an example; compare different effects with their absolute value gap

between two different model structures. Table 16 shows these gaps. We find that these

differences are not huge. Comparatively in general, impacts of monetary structure model are

more significant than inside money structure to China.

     The sensitivity analysis with endogenous trade imbalance model structure suggests that

our simulation results are reliable and impact directions are nearly all the same.

     5.6 Sensitivity Analysis to Elasticities and Upper Bound Inside Money

    Elasticities in our general equilibrium model all equal to 2 according to some literatures.

We change the elasticities value to separately equal 1.6 and 2.4 to check the sensitivity of the

results. Meanwhile, upper bound inside money value in our model is choose to equal 1000,

we change this value to separately equal 2000 and 3000 to check the sensitivity of the results.

Table 17 reports all these sensitivity analysis results.


    According to the elasticities sensitivity analysis results, all the impact directions (positive

or negative) are the same. Comparatively, big elasticity value will generate more severe and

significant influence. According to the upper bound inside money sensitivity analysis results,

all the impact directions (positive or negative) are the same either. Comparatively, big upper

bound inside money value will generate more severe and significant influence too.


    Sensitivity analysis to elasticities and upper bound inside money prove that all

simulation results in our paper are reliable.

    Mega trade deals have grown very fast in recent years after the global financial crisis,

and with them China will play an important role as a big trade country. This paper uses a

numerical global general equilibrium model with added monetary structure using inside

money to endogenously determine the trade imbalance which are offset through

inter-temporal trade across countries in money. We have added the trade cost into the model

which is important and suitable for exploring FTAs effects. Then we simulate the potential

impacts of China involved possible mega deals with this numerical general equilibrium

model.


    We investigate seven different mega deal scenarios including China-India FTA,

China-Japan-Korea FTA, China-TPP, RCEP, China-US FTA, and other two mixed FTAs

cases. We divide trade cost reduction level into three different situations, which are

elimination of tariffs only, eliminating tariff and 25% non-tariff, eliminating tariff and 50%

non-tariff to separately study the influences. We pay attention to the effects on welfare, export

and import for six big countries of China, the US, the EU, Japan, Korea and India. We do

sensitivity analysis with different model structure and variable elasticities and upper bound

inside money.


    Our simulation results show that almost all FTA participation countries will gain from

possible mega deals, but nearly all FTA non-participation countries will lose from these mega

deals. In the meanwhile, as non-tariff barrier eliminates more, the impacts will be more

severe and more significant.

    All effects to China on welfare, trade, export and import are positive which means that

China will gain from these possible mega deals. Comparatively China-TPP and RCEP will

generate the highest welfare outcome in our model for China, the next highest is

China-Japan-Korea FTA, and then China-US FTA.


    For the US, China-TPP will generate the highest welfare outcome in our model and the

next highest is China-US FTA. For the EU, all China involved mega deals have negative

welfare outcomes except China-US FTA. For Japan, RCEP will generate the highest welfare

outcome and the next highest is China-TPP. For Korea, RCEP will generate the highest

welfare outcome and the next highest is China-Japan-Korea FTA. For India, RCEP will

generate the highest welfare outcome and the next highest is China-India FTA.
