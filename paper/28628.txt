                                         ABSTRACT

We empirically assess the potential financial impact of future gene therapies on the US economy.
After identifying 109 late-stage gene therapy clinical trials currently underway, we estimate the
number of new and existing patients with corresponding diseases to be treated by these gene
therapies, developing and applying novel mathematical models to estimate the increase in quality-
adjusted life years for each approved gene therapy. We then simulate the launch prices and the
expected spending for these therapies over a 15-year time horizon. Under conservative
assumptions, the results of our simulation suggest that an expected total of 1.09 million patients
will be treated by gene therapy from January 2020 to December 2034. The expected peak annual
spending on these therapies is $25.3 billion, and the expected total spending from January 2020 to
December 2034 is $306 billion. Assuming a linear pace of future gene therapy development fitted
to past experience, our spending estimate increases by only 15.7% under conservative
assumptions. As a proxy for the impact of expected spending on different public and private
payers, we decompose the estimated annual spending by treated age group. Since experience
suggests that insurers with annual budget constraints may restrict access to therapies with
expected benefit to the patient, we consider various methods of payment to ensure access to these
therapies even among those insured by the most budget-constrained payers.

1    Introduction
Gene therapy is a new class of medical treatment that alters part of a patient's genome
through the replacement, deletion, or insertion of genetic material to treat a disease. While
still in its infancy, gene therapy has demonstrated immense potential to treat and even
cure previously intractable diseases. The introduction of voretigene neparvovec (marketed
as Luxturna® ) for inherited retinal disease and onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (marketed
as Zolgensma® ) for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in the U.S. have improved the lives
of treated patients [110, 112]. Nevertheless, the price per treatment of $425,000 per eye
for Luxturna, and $2.1 million per patient for Zolgensma, have raised concerns regarding
affordability among budget-constrained payers and patients alike.
     Stakeholders have expressed concern that gene therapy will be too expensive for individual
patients to afford, especially if it continues to be priced at more than 30 times the median
household income of $61,937 [97], (or equivalently, at several multiples of the average U.S.
home mortgage of $354,400 [125]). In addition, insurance coverage for gene therapy varies by
type. Insurance policies may impose restrictive access policies to limit the number of patients
who might be treated with these new therapies despite their potential benefits [75, 155].
Widespread uninsurance [115] and underinsurance [77], where payers require substantial
out-of-pocket costs in the form of deductibles and coinsurance payments, may place gene
therapy out of reach for patients in the U.S. who might benefit from treatment. Many
health plans, especially those facing fixed annual budgets, have already warned they may
not be able or willing to absorb the additional spending should a greater number of people
become eligible for an expensive gene therapy once it reaches the market [158]. It is unknown
how much spending on novel gene therapies would be paid for by Medicare, the relatively
generous taxpayer-supported health insurance for Americans over the age of 65, or by more
cash-constrained types of insurance .
     In this paper, we estimate the potential fiscal impact of gene therapy on the U.S. market.
To do so, we create a new model to estimate the future number of gene therapy approvals,
the size of their potential patient populations, and the prices of these future treatments. We
begin by surveying the clinical trial databases for late-stage gene therapy trials, defined here
as phase 2/3 or phase 3, and compile the prevalence and incidence of the diseases targeted in
these trials from a meta-analysis of published sources. We develop a novel method to estimate
the price of each gene therapy under consideration by calculating the expected quality-
adjusted life years gained for each therapy in the relevant patient population. Combining
these results and previously published probabilities of technical success by therapeutic area,
we simulate the probability that a disease will have an approved gene therapy over the


                                               1
next fifteen years, the expected number of treated patients, and the expected spending from
January 2020 to December 2034. Throughout this paper, the expected number of treated
patients refers to the pool of eligible patients that remains after accounting for market
penetration and the treatment schedule.
    Our results, under conservative assumptions, suggest that an estimated total of 1.09
million patients will be treated with gene therapy by the end of December 2034. The number
of patients receiving gene therapies annually will peak at 94,696 patients in 2025 before
declining to 65,612 at the end of our time period. The annual spending across all expected
products and patients is expected to reach $25.3 billion in 2026. The cumulative spending
for treating these patients in the 15-year period is estimated to be $306 billion, or $241
billion when discounted by 3% per annum to 2020 dollars. This cumulative spending does
not account for future inflation.
    This estimate is conservative along a number of dimensions. As mentioned, it does not
account for inflation. It only applies to drugs already in the development pipeline at the
time of writing. If we assume that new drug development in this space follows the roughly
linear trend of the recent past, our estimated expected spending over the next fifteen years
increases by 15.7% to $354B. Given development lags and uncertainties, new developments
are unlikely to have a major impact on costs over our fifteen-year window, although the
longer run effects could be much larger.
    We additionally decompose the expected spending by patient age group as a proxy for
insurance type. We find that the estimated annual spending for the age group ineligible
for Medicare or Medicaid is predicted to reach $12.2 billion. For those therapies that are
not covered by these programs, we consider several alternate ways of financing, including
outcome-based payments and a specialized national or international reinsurance vehicle, to
meet this demand.


2    Methods and Data
A critical element in our simulation analysis is the number of gene therapies that will receive
regulatory approval over the next few years. A brief summary of the drug development
process is provided in Section A1 in the Supplementary Information (S.I.). To estimate the
financial impact of gene therapies on the U.S. healthcare system, we first identify all existing
late-stage clinical trials of gene therapies, then simulate their successes or failures from
phase 2/3 or 3 to approval, then estimate the spending on the successful ones by summing
the product of their expected prices and number of patients, as outlined in Figure 1. By
using simulation analysis rather than purely deterministic methods, we are able to capture

Figure 1: A flowchart showing the performance of the simulation. After extracting the
information on each disease from the clinical trial databases, we simulate whether the disease
will obtain an approval. If it fails to do so, the simulation will end for this disease in
this iteration. Otherwise, we will estimate the expected number of patients to be treated,
compute the corresponding cost of treatment, and store the results. At each step of the
computation, we source data from literature and impute missing information.

the inherent uncertainty in costs, revenues, and other parameters of this new therapeutic
class.
    We organize the simulation into the following five distinct modules, and describe each of
these in some detail: (1) identifying the number of gene therapies currently in clinical trials;
(2) estimating the probabilities of success of these trials; (3) estimating the time to approval;
(4) simulating the expected number of patients treated by these therapies if approved; and (5)
estimating the expected market prices of the approved therapies. We describe the first four
modules in Sections 2.1­2.4. Given the importance and potential controversies surrounding
the pricing of gene therapies, we devote a standalone section to this issue in Section 3.
    Throughout the article, we define a `child' to be a patient below the age of 18 and an
`elderly' patient to be one who is older than 62 years old. The remainder of the patients are
labeled as `adults'. When breaking down the spending by funding source, we assume that
all elderly people are covered by Medicare. We also assume that two in five children and
one in seven adults in the U.S. are covered by Medicaid, as estimated by the Kaiser Family
Foundation [118]. The remainder of the spending is expected to come from private sources,
such as employer-provided or private insurance.
    All the equations presented in the article are discretized from their continuous form in
our calculations. When solving integrals using the trapezoidal rule to obtain the QALY


                                               3
(see., we use strip widths of 1 year for an age range from 0 to 110 years old, the resolution
offered by the life tables. When simulating the number of patients and the cost over time,
we use time intervals of 1 month. Our code is implemented on Python 3.6 backed by Numpy,
and executed on a single 2.2GHz CPU core. Pseudo-code and further details of computation
can be found in Section A2 in the Supplementary Materials.
    We perform 1,000,000 iterations of the simulation to compute the mean number of pa-
tients and the total spending. At this number of iterations, one can expect the computed
mean to be within 1.89% of the true mean 95% of the time (see Section A3 in the Supple-
mentary Materials). We also report the 5th and 95th percentiles of the computed values as
our upper and lower bounds respectively.


2.1     Clinical Trial Data
We use clinical trial metadata from the Citeline TrialTrove database and the U.S. National
Library of Medicine's ClinicalTrials.gov database to determine the number of gene therapies
currently under development and their potential number of patients.
    We download data from the Citeline database, isolating trials tagged with `gene therapy'
under the `therapeutic class' field. We supplement this information by searching for trials
on the clinicaltrials.gov main page using the key words `gene therapy', then reading the trial
description to determine if the trial is in fact related to a gene therapy. All database queries
were made before May 31, 2019. Clinical trials from both sources are merged before filtering
for clinical trials that are in either phase 2/3 or phase 3 of the development process and
are not known to be compassionate uses of the treatment.1 The outcomes of compassionate
use are rarely used as data points in the clinical development process. Even though adverse
events from compassionate use are reported to the FDA, and in rare cases may be used to
characterize the risk and benefits of a therapy, the FDA is cognizant that these uses often
occur outside of clinical trial settings, and has almost never given an unfavorable decision
to a product labeling because of an adverse outcome of compassionate use [86, 114]. We
include clinical trials without U.S. trial site in our dataset because it is currently possible
for the FDA, as empowered by Federal administrative law 21 CFR Part 312.120, to grant
marketing approval using evidence from foreign clinical trials [65].
    Our filtering criteria are intended to remove trial entries unrelated to the clinical develop-
ment process, and to isolate gene therapies that are most likely to seek regulatory approval
in the U.S. in the near future.
   1
    Compassionate use, also known as `expanded access', refers to the administration of investigational
treatments outside of the clinical trial to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases,
or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options.

    We remove repeated entries, and identify the diseases and therapeutic areas targeted by
each gene therapy. Each clinical trial entry in our dataset contains a brief title of the trial,
its clinical phase, the disease being targeted, the start and end dates of the clinical trial, the
therapy name, and the companies involved in the clinical trial.
    This process yields 109 trials investigating 57 distinct diseases, listed in Table A1 in
Supplementary Materials. We classify the diseases into three categories: cancer (oncology),2
rare disease, and general disease. The distribution of disease and the clinical trials by
category and therapeutic area are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. The majority of trials and
diseases are in the area of oncology, followed by rare diseases. These two therapeutic areas
are notoriously risky. Only 3.1% and 6.2% of the drug development programs in oncology
and rare diseases go from phase 1 to approval, respectively, compared to the baseline of
13.8% across all drugs and indications [166].

2.2    Probability of Success Estimates
We define a gene therapy development program as the set of clinical trials conducted by
a sponsor testing a therapeutic for a disease. We consider whether a gene therapy will be
developed for a disease by simulating correlated `coin flips' for each gene therapy program,
and observing if there is at least one approval.
    Our computational method assumes that clinical trials are always perfectly correlated
within the same development program.
    It can be argued that different gene therapy treatments for a disease are highly correlated,
since they operate on similar platforms (e.g. CAR-T or in-vivo gene delivery using adeno-
associated virus vectors), even though different gene sequences may be targeted. To reflect
this, we consider a correlation of 90% between development programs in our simulations.
Our sensitivity analysis, however, demonstrates that these computations are insensitive to
this parameter (see Section 4.3).
    The phase 3 to approval probability of success (PoS3A ) for each disease is informed by
prior studies on the probabilities of success of drug development programs by therapeutic area
from the MIT Laboratory of Financial Engineering's Project ALPHA website [132]. These
estimates for the probabilities of success are derived from over 55,000 drug development
programs between January 2000 and January 2020, and computed using the path-by-path
methods as introduced in Wong et al. [166]. The PoS3A values used in our simulations are
given in Table 3 and the mapping of diseases to therapeutic areas is shown in Table A2.


2.3    Time to Approval
We also require an estimate of the time to approval for gene therapy treatments in order to
assess the patient impact and cost over time. Typically, companies submit their Biologics


                                               6
License Application (BLA) to the FDA some time after the end of the clinical trial period.
We assume that the time between the end of the last clinical trial for the disease and the
submission of the BLA is a variable drawn from a triangular distribution between 0 and 365
days, with a median of 182.5 days. This is informed by the practical knowledge that it takes
an average of 6 months to prepare the documents for the BLA submission [166].
    In addition, there will be a lag time between the submission of the BLA and the decision
of the FDA. The FDA has 60 days to decide if it will follow up on a BLA filing [89], and it
can take another 10 months to deliver its decision [88]. This implies the maximum possible
time between BLA submission and FDA approval will be 12 months. We thus assume that
the time between the BLA submission and the FDA decision is drawn from a triangular
distribution between 0 and 365 days, with a median of 182.5 days. Our assumptions are also
valid for therapies that use the priority review pathways.
    We also assume that the BLA will be filed only after the last clinical trial for a disease
has ended. Trials with missing declared end dates will have their end dates imputed by
adding random durations to the trial start date, drawn from a gamma distribution fitted to
clinical trials with complete date information in our data (see Figure 2).

    Diseases with a prior approved therapy will automatically be considered to be approved
as of January 1st, 2020. Diseases whose last clinical trial ended before January 2017 will be
treated as though they have failed.

2.4    Number of Patients
The second module simulates the number of new and existing patients that will be treated
over time, conditioned on the disease receiving an approved gene therapy.
    We consider only the superset of the patient segments listed in the clinical trials for each
disease. For example, if there are two clinical trials, one targeting `patients above the age
of 40' and the other targeting `patients above the age of 18', we only consider the latter
when estimating the patient population for the disease. If insufficient information about the
sub-population is given, we assume that all the patients with that disease are eligible. The
proportion of patients who are eligible for treatment and are willing to do so will be taken
into account later in the analysis, as we explain in Section 2.4.

Incidence and Prevalence

For the number of currently affected patients and the number of new patients per year
for each indication, we source medical journals and online data repositories, such as the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) website and cancer.net. If we are able
to find an estimated patient population, we cite it directly. Otherwise, we multiply the
prevalence and incidence rates by the population of the U.S., which we take to be 327.7
million [160]. When necessary, we also make the assumption that the female to male ratio
is 1:1.
    In cases in which we are able to find estimates for the disease incidence but not the
prevalence, we combine the incidence of the disease (i.e., i new patients a year) and the
disease survival rate (i.e., p% of the people with a disease will be alive after k years) to
obtain the steady-state estimate of the prevalence (j ) using Equation Equation 1. The
incidence can also be estimate from the prevalence by rearranging Equation Equation 1 to
yield Equation 2.
                                                        ki
                                   Prevalence (j ) =                                        (1)
                                                       1-p

                                                     j (1 - p)
                                   Incidence (i) =                                          (2)
                                                         k

   The equations can be derived by assuming that the number of patients will be constant
through the years at a level j . Since ki new patients are added over k years and j (1 - p)
patients that will die over the same period, ki = j (1 - p) for the number of patients to be
constant over time. Rearranging this equation will yield Equation 1 and Equation 2. The
number of patients for each disease are presented in Table A3 in the appendix. We adjust


                                               8
these estimates to avoid double-counting in cases of overlapping patient populations, e.g., the
number of patients for `Spinal Muscular Atrophy' is the difference between `Spinal Muscular
Atrophy' and `Spinal Muscular Atrophy I' (a sub-category of the former).

Treatment of Patients over Time

In our simulation, we assume that newly diagnosed patients are treated immediately upon
diagnosis. We further assume that the proportion of existing patients who seek treatment
do so in such a way that the existing stock of patient declines exponentially, with a half-life
of . Mathematically, the proportion of existing patients that seek treatment between time
t and t +  after approval is given by E (t, , ), where:
                                              t ln 2          (t+ ) ln 2
                             E (t, , ) = e-            - e-                ,t  0            (3)

    In the face of limited information, we assume that 25% of the existing stock of patients
will seek treatment in the first year of our simulation. This requires that the half-life be set
to 28.91 months, which in turn implies that 95% of all patients who are diagnosed prior to
the approval of the gene therapy want treatments within 10.5 years. We perform a sensitivity
analysis to determine this assumption's impact on our results in Section 4.3.

Patient Penetration

It is unlikely that all the patients under consideration will receive gene therapy treatments.
This may be due to ineligibility, lack of awareness of the treatment, among many other
reasons. We term the percentage of the patients that receive gene therapy treatments the
`patient penetration rate', and model it using a ramp function, (t, max , Tmax ):
                                             
                                              t · max , 0  t  Tmax
                                             
                          (t, max , Tmax ) =     Tmax                                      (4)

    max and Tmax are assumed to follow Gaussian distributions N (µ ,          ) and N (µT , T ),
respectively. The parameter settings are listed in Tables 4 and 5. When setting µ and µT ,
we need to take into the account the nature of the diseases. At one extreme, we have rare
diseases, which are often life-threatening, and affect a relatively small number of people.
Faced with these prospects of survival, more patients are willing to enroll in new treatments
quickly after they are approved. In addition, since the number of patients is relatively small,

manufacturers are more able to cope with a larger proportion of patients. Given these, we
assign a high value of 40% for µ , and a low value of 6 months for µT .
    On the other hand, patients of general diseases often have access to an acceptable stan-
dard of care and may be less inclined to use new treatments due to fear of the unfamiliar.
We thus assume that the maximum penetration rate will be 1%, and the ramp-up period, 5
years.
    As an intermediate case, cancers have characteristics that fall between these two extremes,
but in general, they are more similar to rare diseases. We therefore assign values of 10% and
12 months to the maximum penetration rate and ramp-up period, respectively. All variances
are set to 10% of the means to model moderate uncertainty in our numbers. They do not
affect our mean estimates of the number of impacted patients or spending on gene therapy.

is only one approval per disease, and a fraction of the eligible patients will receive that
treatment.


3     Pricing
The cost to the healthcare system of providing the gene therapy for a disease for all patients
being treated at time t after approval is given by C (t), where

                        C (t) = Patientst × Price of gene therapy                               (6)

     The price of each treatment is crucial to computing the expected total spending, and
a source of considerable controversy because of the high price of gene therapies relative to
many conventional therapeutics. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER)--
an independent nonprofit organization that aims to evaluate the clinical and economic value
of healthcare innovation--has advocated pricing drugs and gene therapies by the relative
risk and benefit to the patient. This is typically done by comparing the quality-adjusted
life years (QALY) with and without the treatment, then multiplying the change in QALY
(QALY) by a constant, typically set between $50,000 and $150,000 per QALY [135].
                                                      Price
                       Price of gene therapy =              × QALY                              (7)
                                                      QALY

    ICER has published reports containing its estimates of QALY gained by patients with
vision loss associated with biallelic RPE65-mediated retinal disease following treatment with
Luxturna® [110], and with SMA Type I following treatment with Zolgensma® [111]. These
reports compute QALY using the results of clinical trials to make informed estimates about
the potential improvements in the quality of life and life expectancy of the patients.
    While ICER's methods are considered by some stakeholders to be the gold standard for
this type of calculation, replicating its methods for all the clinical trials under consideration is
not feasible in this paper, given the fact pricing decisions are made when the trials conclude.

                                                11
As an alternative, we develop a mathematical model to estimate the expected increase in
QALY for each disease in our sample.


3.1    Estimating QALY
We consider a representative patient who is expected to live to the age of x with a probability
of l(x). The function l(x) is also known as the survival curve of the population. The patient
enjoys a quality of life, f (s, x), that is dependent on his age, x, and his state of health, s.
The expected QALY of a typical person in the baseline state of s0 (the `healthy' state) can
be computed by integrating l(x)f (s0 , x) over x.
                                                                               
                        Expected QALY (healthy) =                                 l(x)f (s0 , x)dx                    (8)
                                                                           0


    Suppose that the patient is afflicted with a disease at time a, which changes his survival
curve after time a from l(x) to l(x). Likewise, his quality of life after diagnosis changes from
f (s0 , x) to f (sd , x). This patient will then have an expected QALY of:
                                                                a                              
          Expected QALY (unhealthy) =                               l(x)f (s0 , x)dx +            l(x)f (sd , x)dx    (9)
                                                            0                              a


The change in the expected QALY due to the disease can then be expressed as:

          QALY = Expected QALY (unhealthy) - Expected QALY (healthy)                                                 (10)
                            a                                                                  
                    =           l(x)f (s0 , x)dx +                  l(x)f (sd , x)dx -            l(x)f (s0 , x)dx   (11)
                        0                                   a                              0
                            
                    =           l(x)f (sd , x) - l(x)f (s0 , x)dx                                                    (12)

   It is customary in the literature to incorporate time preferences into the model. This is
done by multiplying the integrand by the discount factor, r(x - a). There is a normalization
term l(a) to reflect conditional survival to age x.
                                            
                                               r(x - a)
                  QALY =                                l(x)f (sd , x) - l(x)f (s0 , x) dx                           (14)
                                        a        l(a)

   If the distribution of age when the patient population contracts the disease is given by
A(a), then the expected decrease in QALY over the patient population is given by:
                                                     
                                                        r(x - a)
          E(QALY) =                     A(a)                     l(x)f (sd , x) - l(x)f (s0 , x) dxda                (15)
                                 0               a        l(a)

                                                                12
   Equation 15 is a general formula that accounts for the expected value of the changes in
QALY between two states of health using only three variables: the time of disease onset,
and the utility of the two health states. By making the relevant substitutions, we can also
apply this formula to compute the expected changes in QALY given a gene therapy (gt) and
an alternative treatment (alt).
                                        
                                            r(x - a)
      E(QALY) =              A(a)                    lgt (x)f (sgt , x) - lalt (x)f (salt , x) dxda   (16)
                      0             a         l(a)

    While death and patient statistics can be collected to determine l(x) and A(a) empirically,
determining f (s, x) and l(x) is challenging. Therefore, we use simple functions to modify
these variables. In particular, we assume that being afflicted with a severe disease will modify
the survival curve by a multiplicative factor, D(t). That is, the survival curve of a patient
after he is diagnosed at age a is given by:

                                            l(x) = l(x) · D(x - a)                                    (17)

    This functional form assumes that the disease is age-agnostic, and affects the survival
curve only through the time elapsed since the patient has been diagnosed. For example, if
the disease does not affect mortality (e.g. blindness), then D(x - a) = 1 for all x - a > 0.
On the other hand, if the condition causes death immediately, then D(x - a) = 0 for all
x - a > 0.
    For the utility function, f (s, x), we assume that it can be decomposed into two multi-
plicative factors, one dependent only on age, fa (x), and the other dependent only on the
state of health, fh (s):
                                      f (s, x) = fa (x) · fh (s)                        (18)

   Assuming that Equations 17 and 18 hold, Equation 16 can be simplified to:
                                                          
                                                             l(x)
                 E(QALY) =                     A(a)               fa (x)r(x - a)K (x, a)dxda          (19)
                                        0             a      l(a)

   where K (x, a) is the change in the quality-adjusted life years:

                      K (x, a) = Dgt (x - a)fh (sgt ) - Dsalt (x - a)fh (salt )                       (20)


3.2    Calibration of QALY
For each of these variables, we attempt to obtain empirical values from the literature as
much as possible. When necessary, we interpolate values, briefly explaining our assumptions

and the data collection methods for the inputs to the model.
   For the age-dependent QoL, fa (x), we extract the general population utility values from
Institute for Clinical and Economic Review [112] and fit a linear model across the data. The
QoL values and the fitted model are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Age-dependent QoL, fa (x). The values extracted from ICER's SMA final report
[112] are replicated in the table on the left and are presented as crosses in the figure on the
right. A linear function, with its intercept set to 1, is fitted to the data points.


    Since we are unable to know the patient outcomes for these potential gene therapies
ahead of their approval, we assume that the gene therapy treatments will restore a person's
survivability to that of a normal individual. This implies that Dgt (x - a) = 1. To estimate
the impact of a disease on patient survivability, we model its survival curve, Dalt (x - a),
using the exponential survival curve shown in Equation 21. In the equation,  is the force of
mortality, and µ is the normalization factor. We estimate  and µ by matching the function
to T -year survival rates, which are the proportions of the patients (k ) who will be alive after
T years, from data. The parameter values and their sources are listed in Table A4 in the
Supplementary Material.

    Dalt (x - a) = Dalt (t) = e-(t-µ) , where µ =            ln &  = -      & t=x-a                         (21)
                                                                        T

    The health-related quality of life variables, fh (sgt ) & fh (salt ), are treated separately,
depending on the disease classification. For cancer indications, we assume that the quality
of life of the patients is not affected by the disease, which implies an upper bound for the
computed QALY. For non-cancer indications, we source the medical literature for the
available quality of life (QoL) estimates. We use the QoL for the typical disease condition
to approximate the `before treatment' QoL, fh (salt ), and use the best possible outcome for
each condition as the `post-treatment' QoL, fh (sgt ). We interpolate the missing values using

                                                    14
linear regressions of the sourced QoLs against disease severity. To do this, we first give scores,
 , ranging from one to five for each disease, based on our perception of disease severity. We
then fit a line of fh (salt ) against  in order to estimate the missing `before treatment' QoL
values, fh (salt ) (see Figure 5). We define QoL = fh (sgt ) - fh (salt ). Separately, we regress
QoL against  to interpolate the change in QoL (see Figure 6). Given QoL and fh (salt ),
we can then estimate the missing values of fh (sgt ). Our estimated values are reported in
Table A5 in the Supplementary Material.

  We are able to extract the distribution of the age of cancer onset from the National
Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program website.

                                                     15
However, empirical age distributions are practically nonexistent for non-cancer diseases. To
overcome this, we search the literature for the average age of diagnosis of each disease, and
fit a triangle distribution for each disease using the optimization program shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7: An optimization program to obtain the triangle distribution given the average age
of diagnosis, µage . xmin and xmax are coordinates of the base of the triangle. c and z are the
mode and height of triangle.


    This program maximizes the domain's interval (Equation 22) while imposing the require-
ment that the distribution's mode, c, has to be in the domain (Equation 23). In addition,
the area under the curve has to be equal to 1 (Equation 24), and the mean of the distribution
has to be equal to the average age (Equation 25).
    We have experimented with an impulse function and an uniform distribution to model
the age distribution, but these functions created unrealistic scenarios. Modeling the age
distribution with the impulse function, while simple, will force Equation 15 to collapse into
a single point, and lose any nuance in the QALY gained by patients of different ages. On
the other hand, estimating a uniform distribution from the average age creates distributions
with narrow support. The distributions from our optimization program have a wider base
of support and avoid sharp changes in density. We illustrate this with some examples in
Figure A2 in the Supplementary Materials.
    We assume a 3% per annum discount rate, as suggested by ICER for high-impact single
or short-term therapy (SST) [113].


3.3    Price per QALY
To estimate a realistic market price of gene therapy, we calibrate our assumed price per
QALY with the 4 data points currently available: Zolgensma, priced at $2.1 million per


                                              16
patient [131], Luxturna, priced at $0.425 million per eye treated [156], Kymriah, priced at
$0.475 million for a one-time dose [64], and Yescarta, priced at $0.373 million for a one-
time dose [64]. Separately, Zynteglo, sold at a cost of 1.6 million Euros (approximately $1.8
million), has been approved in the European Union. The data points are listed in Table 6.

Table 6: Diseases under consideration, approved gene therapy treatments used as proxy,
prices of approved treatments, countries/areas in which treatments have been approved, and
computed expected change in QALY.
 Disease                                           Approved treatment   Country approved   List price   E(QALY)

 Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1                        Zolgensma              U.S.          2.125M        20.56


    We calibrate the price per QALY by minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE) between
the estimated price given the expected change in QALY and the actual price. We report
the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the estimated price and the actual
price in addition to the MSE. We note that Zolgensma, Zynteglo, and Luxturna are gene
replacement therapies for rare diseases, while Kymriah and Yescarta are chimeric antigen
receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies indicated for cancers. As such, we perform two separate
calibrations, one for rare diseases and the other for cancer indications. We assume that the
price per QALY for general diseases is identical to that for cancer.
    Considering only the therapies approved in the United States, we estimate a price per
E(QALY) of $101,663 (MSE: 2.18×109 , MAPE: 11.2%) for rare diseases and $40,797 (MSE:
1.77×101 0, MAPE: 44.2%) for other diseases. Using all the data points, the price per
E(QALY) for rare diseases increases to $114,781 (MSE: 1.70×1012 , MAPE: 108%). In
this paper, we use the former for our calculations since it has a smaller mean-squared error
and better reflects prices in the U.S., our focus. This value will give us estimates of $2.09M
per patient for Zolgensma and $0.470M per eye for Luxturna.
    Our calibrated price per E(QALY) for cancer indications is just slightly below ICER's
$50,000 to $100,000 range for `intermediate care value'. The higher price per E(QALY) for
rare diseases also reaffirms the general belief that developers of treatments for rare diseases
should be compensated more for their elevated R&D risk and the low financial prospects
of serving a small population of patients. It is assumed that the clinical cost of delivering
the gene therapy is a negligible fraction of the overall cost of development (though they are
considerably higher than the delivery cost of conventional therapeutics). It is also highly
likely that the outside option cost will be similar.
    The expected increases in QALY computed by our model are close to those provided by

                                                     17
the ICER reports for the treatments [110, 112]. For example, we estimate that treatments
for Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 and Leber Congenital Amaurosis due to RPE65 Muta-
tions provide 20.56 and 4.63 incremental QALYs, whereas ICER estimates Zolgensma and
Luxturna to provide 12.23 to 26.58 and 1.3 to 2.7 incremental QALYs3 , respectively. We
have deliberately applied the same methods and assumptions used for the all other diseases
to estimate the expected changes in QALY for Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 and Leber
Congenital Amaurosis due to RPE65 Mutations even though we could have obtained these
numbers directly from ICER reports. By doing so, our price per QALY calibration will
correct for potential biases in our data, and our price estimates will be more realistic.
    Our estimated change in QALY, the price per unit change in QALY, and the estimated
price of therapy for each disease are shown in Table A6 in the Supplementary Materials.


4       Results
4.1     Expected Number of Approvals and Patients
Our simulations, based on the conservative assumptions detailed in the previous section,
indicate that the expected number of gene therapies approved between January 2020 and
January 2034 is 18.3, with a 90% confidence interval of [14.0, 23.0] (see Figure 8).
    Table 7 shows the annual number of treated patients over time by age groups. Our
simulations expect the number of patients treated to grow from 16,244 in 2020 to 94,696
in 2025 before declining to 65,612 in 2034. The decline can be attributed to the declining
stock of existing patients as they are treated, and the fact that we do not consider new
development programs launched in the future. The proportions of patients who are children,
adults and elderly are 17.9%, 35.4%, and 46.7% respectively.
    We show the number of patients treated by month in Figure 9a. We can see that our
simulations expect the number of patients treated to peak at around 7911 (CI: [3978, 12477])
per month in Jul 2025 before declining to 5424 (CI: [2778, 8350]) by December 2034. The
monthly number of existing patients treated exceeds the monthly number of newly-diagnosed
patients treated until Sep 2024, when this trend is expected to reverse (see Figure 9b). Only
7% of all patients treated in December 2034 are preexisting patients. Cancer patients are
expected to form the biggest group of patients receiving gene therapy treatments, simply due
to the number of cancer indications being targeted. We expect the relative proportions of
cancer, general disease, and rare disease patients to be 48.0%, 30.0%, and 22.0%, respectively,
    3
    ICER provides a range of QALY estimates corresponding to different age groups. We have considered
the distribution of ages to produce a weighted average estimate.

in December 2034. The cumulative number of patients to be treated is expected to be 1.09
million (CI: [0.595M, 1.66M]) by the end of December 2034 (see Figure 9c).


4.2            Expected Spending
We expect an increase in spending up to $2.11 billion per month (CI: [1.01B, 3.88B]) in Apr
2026, before decreasing slowly to a steady-state rate of $1.62 billion (CI: [0.624B, 2.9B])
per month (see Figure 10a). We emphasize that the total spending eventually declines
because our simulations analyze a fixed stock of innovations, and do not account for new
development programs that may be launched in the future. Treating existing cancer patients
initially consumes over 45.6% of the total monthly expenditure, but declines to only 0.99%
by December 2034. In contrast, the proportion of spending on new patients in the `general
disease' and `rare disease' groups will increase from 0.0% and 4.26%, respectively, in Feb
2020 to 21.2% and 46.2% by December 2034. The monthly spending on treating existing
patients is expected to exceed the monthly spending on treating newly diagnosed patients
in Nov 2023. The cumulative discounted spending on treating patients with approved gene
therapy products is expected to reach $241 billion (CI: [123B, 402B]) by December 2034, 15
years after the start of our simulation.
    In terms of annual spending on approved gene therapies, we expect that $5.15 billion will
be spent in 2020, increasing to $25.3B in 2026 before declining to $21.0B in 2034 (see Table 8).
Children, adults and the elderly will consume 43.2%, 26.0%, and 30.9%, respectively, of the
total spending.
    The expected annual spending by Medicare, Medicaid 4 and private sources respectively
may reach $8.1, $5.44, and $12.2 billion (see Table 9). We discuss the implications of these
   4
    The spending estimates for Medicaid do not take into account the 23.1% drug rebate that it is expected
to receive [74].

estimates in Section 5.
    The total expected increase in QALY over these 15 years is 5.59 million (see Figure 11),
which translates to an average increase of 5.12 years of QALY per patient. This comes at
an average 2020 present value cost of $43,110 per unit change in QALY.

4.3     Sensitivity Analysis
To test the sensitivity of our results to initial conditions, we simulate ±20% changes in the
following variables, analyzing their impact on our results.

  1.   The   maximum penetration rate in the ramp function, max
  2.   The   time to maximum penetration rate in the ramp function, Tmax
  3.   The   amount of QALY gained in each disease
  4.   The   price per QALY
  5.   The   phase-3-to-approval probability of success (PoS3A )
  6.   The   number of new patients of each disease
  7.   The   number of existing patients of each disease
  8.   The   time from phase 3 to BLA
  9.   The   time from BLA to approval

    For each of these factors, we consider its impact on the the peak monthly spending and
the cumulative spending from January 2020 to December 2034 of patient treatment. We
also look at how the variables change the timing of the peak monthly spending.
    As can be seen from Figure 12, the percentage change in the discounted cumulative
spending and the maximum monthly spending on treating all patients with gene therapy
scale linearly with the percentage change in several variables: the maximum penetration rate
(max ), the QALY gained (QALY), and the price per QALY. Increasing or decreasing
the transition probability from phase 3 to approval, or the number of new or existing patients
only leads to sublinear increases or decreases in the discounted cumulative spending and the
maximum monthly spending. However, changing the time variables, such as the number of
days from phase 3 to BLA, from BLA to approval, or the ramp-up period (Tmax ), induce a
small change in the opposite direction.
    Introducing perturbations of 20% in the probability of success, the number of new pa-
tients, the number of days from Phase 3 to BLA or from BLA to approval, or the time to
maximum penetration rate in the ramp function (Tmax ) will change the date of the peak
monthly spending in the same direction as the perturbation, by up to 10 months. Increasing
or decreasing the number of existing patients, on the other hand, will cause a shift of up to
4 months in the date of peak spending in the opposite direction. Perturbing the maximum
penetration rate (max ), the QALY gained (QALY), and the price per QALY will not
change the date of peak spending.
    We also study the effect of changing the correlation between development programs.
Changing the correlation from our assumed value of 0.9 to 0 (i.e., perfectly uncorrelated)

increases the mean discounted cumulative spending by 3.4%, from $241 billion to $245 bil-
lion. Increasing the correlation to 1.0 instead will decrease the mean discounted cumulative
spending by 0.4% to $236 billion.
    In addition, we vary the proportion of existing patients seeking treatment in the first
year--which determines the  parameter in Equation 3--and observe that mean discounted
cumulative spending changes by between -32% and +0.08% (see Figure 13). We can expect
the results to differ by less than 5% from the baseline if the proportion of existing patients
seeking treatments in the first year is between 8% and 45%.

4.4                           Effect of additional gene therapy programs
In order to prevent boundary conditions from affecting our results, we simulate additional
gene therapy programs that may enter the pipeline in the future, and compare the results
against our baseline.
    In order to do so, we fit a linear function of the number of gene therapy programs initiated
in a given year against the date (see Figure 14). We extrapolate the fitted line to obtain
the expected number of new gene therapy programs entering the pipeline between 2020 and
2035.

are expected in a year, the time between consecutive events (t > 0) has a probability density
of e-t . For every event, we randomly assign its disease classification before simulating
the success of the program, and if successful, its time of approval, the number of patients
treated, and spending on the therapy over time. The means of the variables for each disease
classification used in our simulations are summarized in Table 10.

    As can be seen from Figure 15, while introducing new gene therapies into the pipeline
increases the cumulative number of approvals by 25.1% from 18.3 to 23.0, the cumulative
number of patients increases by only 15.3% from 1.09M to 1.26M. Similarly, the cumulative
spending increases by 15.7% from $306B to $354B.


4.5    Comparison to prior work
Our study is independent of the results by Quinn et al. [141], who estimated that 341,775
patients will have been treated with gene therapy by December 2030, increasing by approx-
imately 50,000 per year in the steady state. In contrast, our simulation expects that about
820,425 patients will be treated by the end of December 2030, with a steady-state increase
of around 61,170 per year in the long run.
    The differences between our estimates and this other report are due to differences in
sample inclusion criteria and the use of different data for patient prevalence and incidence of
disease. For example, Quinn et al. [141] considers "durable" gene therapies under all phases
of clinical investigation whereas we consider any therapy with late-stage clinical trial(s). Fur-
thermore, they assume that the `potentially treatable pool in oncology is entirely incident--
there is no prevalence'. Another difference arises from our decision to start with the broadest
range of patients, and then deflate these numbers through the penetration rate, rather than
attempting to estimate the prevalence and incidence for each patient segment. If we removed
existing oncology patients from our simulation, the cumulative number of patients treated

penetration rates by 48.8%, which will lower our estimated cumulative spending on gene
therapy between January 2020 and December 2034 to $149 billion.


5    Discussion
We estimate that 1.09 million patients will be treated with gene therapy by the end of De-
cember 2034, spending up to $25.3B annually. These estimates are likely to be lower bounds,
since our simulation employs conservative assumptions about the speed and volume of gene
therapy development. Specifically, we consider only late-stage gene therapy development
programs, defined as those already in phase 2/3 or phase 3, and do not account for the
possibility that a program in phase 1 or phase 2 may be fast-tracked or granted accelerated
approval. As shown in Section 4.4, extrapolating past trends in the number of new devel-
opment programs affects our mean estimated cost and number of patients by less than 16%,
although the long-run effects could be much larger.
    A potential criticism of our approach is that estimating the cost of gene therapies solely
based on the change in QALY will overestimate the aggregate spending in the U.S. For
example, we do not take into account the potential cost savings to gene therapies due to
avoiding multiple costly therapeutic sessions over time based on the current standard of care,
or to the recovery of the opportunity cost of caregivers. While there are cases where gene
therapy is predicted to provide net cost-savings in treatment after accounting for the direct
medical cost (e.g., valoctocogene roxaparvovec for the management of hemophilia A [79]),
there is not yet evidence to show that gene therapy will result in net long-term cost savings.
In addition, research has shown that new medical technologies generally raise health costs,
and that cost-increasing changes in treatments outweigh cost-saving changes the majority of
the time [95]. We also do not consider any markup that happens under the prevalent `buy-
and-bill' process in the U.S. For these reasons, our estimates are likely to be lower bounds
for realized costs over the next 15 years. Nonetheless, we have taken care to calibrate our
price per QALY using actual prices for approved therapeutics and estimating QALYs for
those diseases, thereby allowing us to produce price estimates that closely track past data.
    Another potential criticism is that we fail to consider the possibility that having multiple
gene therapies for the same disease may lower the prices of the therapies. However, there
is no analogous evidence that the presence of multiple brand-name drugs in the same class
lowers the list prices of the drugs [148].
    Based on our assumptions, the annual spending on gene therapy will average $20.4 billion,
and may reach $25.3 billion in 2026. The cumulative spending on all future gene therapies
from from January 2020 to January 2034 will be approximately $306 billion, or $241 billion

                                              31
when discounted at a cost of capital of 3% per annum over the next 15 years. We estimate
the cost of gene therapy to average $43,110 per unit QALY, several times the average annual
expenditure of $16,346 for American cancer patients between 2010 and 2014 [137].
    However, when viewed from the broader perspective of aggregate U.S. spending, these
figures seem less daunting. In 2018, the U.S. tax revenue was $3.33 trillion, of which indi-
vidual income tax and payroll tax revenues were $1.68 and $1.17 trillion, respectively [78].
Fully funding the average spending of $20.4 billion through income and payroll taxes will
require an increase of 0.612%.
    Since all elderly patients are covered by Medicare, we estimate that the program would
need to increase its annual budget by up to $7.89 billion, or 1.1% of its 2018 spending of
$750.2 billion [73]. Funding this increase would require either an increase in payroll taxes or
a reduction in other expenditures.
    We estimate that annual gene therapy spending by Medicaid may reach $5.44 billion.
This is approximately 0.9% of its 2018 spending of $597.4 billion [73]. Since Medicaid must
be provided to all eligible Americans without any preset cap, managing this increase will
require either raising funds from state and federal governments to pay for these additional
costs, or cutting benefits.
    Annual spending by children and adults who are ineligible for Medicare or Medicaid--and
therefore must rely on private insurers--is predicted to reach $12.2 billion. This spending
poses a significant challenge for insurers and companies, who face annual budgets and com-
peting priorities. In order to manage spending, many insurance policies might choose not to
cover spending on gene therapy, or impose restrictive policies to limit the number of potential
patients who might be treated [155]. Many private insurers are already warning they may
not be able or willing to absorb the additional spending should a greater number of people
become eligible for expensive gene therapy treatments once new ones reach the market [158].
    Many novel methods to finance gene therapy treatments through the existing healthcare
infrastructure have been proposed, such as outcome-based payments, whereby the manu-
facturers would be paid only if the patients achieve predefined outcomes after treatment
[68]. We note that both Zolgensma and Luxturna have offered outcome-based payment
methods to payers. There have also been proposals to allow mortgage-like payments, and
performance-based annuity payments, as ways to finance gene therapy treatments [133]. In
September 2019, Cigna, one of the largest U.S. health insurance companies, announced a pro-
gram called Embarc Benefit Protection in which employers, health plans, and unions pay a
monthly per-member premium that provides members with access to the two FDA-approved
gene therapies, Luxturna and Zolgensma, with no out-of-pocket costs if their physicians au-
thorize treatment. At the time of writing, however, Luxturna is not provided under Embarc


                                              32
Benefit Protection, and it is unclear if the program is still in effect. Cigna hopes to keep
the monthly cost of the program to below $1 per member [164], but if our simulations are
accurate, this will be financially infeasible.
     A more ambitious proposal involves creating a national and possibly international gene
therapy reinsurance company that performs a similar function to Embarc, but which serves
a large number of primary health insurance providers. By allowing multiple primary insurers
to cede the specific risk of gene therapy patients to the reinsurer, these risks could be diver-
sified over a much larger pool members, lowering the cost of capital. The capital required
for such a reinsurer could be raised through securitization techniques as described in [133],
who simulated such a structure, and concluded that the returns to investors would be quite
attractive under a broad range of assumptions. However, their simulations were not specifi-
cally calibrated for gene therapy, hence our framework may provide a useful complement to
their analysis.
     Also, it may be more cost-effective for the reinsurer to assume the responsibility of de-
livering the gene therapies it reinsures through nationally distributed Centers of Excellence
(CoEs). This may seem too far afield for a reinsurance company, but the ability to have
direct control over the quality of delivery, and to be able to collect data on the performance
of these therapies over time, are two compelling reasons for the reinsurer to take this on.
The data collected from these centers will be critical, not only for assessing the actuarial
risk of reinsurance, but also for implementing performance-related contractual agreements,
e.g., if a gene therapy ceases to be effective, then any remaining payments for the therapy
will be cancelled.
     An additional benefit of a single reinsurer to manage the risk and responsibility of deliv-
ering gene therapy is the ability of that reinsurer to avoid the adverse selection problem that
often plagues individual insurers [67]. This problem arises when some insurers are willing
to pay for gene therapy treatments while others are not, leading patients who require gene
therapies to enroll en masse with those insurers providing coverage. Since these policies
will likely have higher premiums to cover the high cost of gene therapy, patients have an
incentive to leave the policy after receiving the treatment, leaving the insurers to pay the
remaining cost without being able to recover the expenses. If a single reinsurer can aggregate
this risk across a large pool of gene therapy patients and coordinate payouts across all the
insurers, this adverse selection problem can be greatly mitigated, or altogether avoided. The
viability of such a reinsurance vehicle would depend critically on the various parameters of
the modules in our simulation, as well as the ability to engage with the largest health insurer
of all, the U.S. government.
     In this paper, we make multiple assumptions to the best of our knowledge in order to


                                              33
simplify data collection and make the computations required by our simulation framework
tractable. We emphasize that our model requires many different inputs, some of which are
based on scarce or extrapolated data. We also acknowledge that some of the development
programs that we considered to be `in-progress' at the time of analysis have subsequently
failed. However, we believe that our simulation framework can accept new data and incor-
porate new assumptions as the amount of available information improves.


6    Conclusion
In this paper, we estimate the number of patients who will be treated by gene therapy
between January 2020 and December 2034 using various data sources. We also develop a
mathematical model to estimate the cost of these gene therapies, and calibrated the model
to yield realistic cost estimates. It is our hope that this study, and our estimates of the
potential financial impact of gene therapy in the U.S., will clarify some of the unknowns
surrounding the impact of this new class of treatment, and allow policymakers, healthcare
providers, insurance companies and patients alike to make more informed financial decisions
about the future of this important therapeutic class.

A1      The Drug Development Process
Since the passing of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938, pharmaceuticals developed
by companies have to be reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for safety
and efficacy before they can be marketed in the U.S. The application for marketing ap-
proval differs slightly by the type of therapy: New Drug Applications (NDAs) are for small
molecules, and Biologics License Applications (BLAs) are for biologics. Gene therapy is
considered a biologic product, hence the BLA designation applies.
    Clinical investigations in human subjects typically take place in three phases--phases 1,
2 and 3--before marketing approvals are sought. Phase 1 trials are designed to investigate
the dosage and safety of the treatment, while phase 2 trials attempt to detect early signs
of efficacy and possible side effects in a relatively small sample of patients. Phase 3 trials
are intended to demonstrate a statistically significant treatment effect when compared to
the best standard of care in a broader population of patients. Some clinical trials combine
multiple phases into a single design, with the phase numbers separated by a slash. For
example, a phase 2/3 trial combines elements of phase 2 and phase 3 investigations into a
single trial design in order to reduce the overall development time and cost, and maximize
the participation of subjects with orphan disease willing to participate in trials. The clinical
development of therapeutics is a tedious and costly process that may span decades and cost
billions of dollars, with the bulk of the cost and time spent conducting phase 3 clinical trials
[60, 82]. The process is also very risky, with only 13.8% of therapeutic development programs
entering phase 1 reaching approval [166].

A2      Pseudo-Code and Implementation Details
Pseudo-code
We perform a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the total number of patients undergoing
gene therapy and the cost of these gene therapies at specific points in time. The sequence
of computations for each iteration of the simulation is detailed in Algorithm 1.

   Input : D: A list of diseases
   Output: Arrays of [1 × T ], where T is the number of time steps.
            P: Number of patients over time
            C: Total cost over time
   P  1 × T array of zeros
   C  1 × T array of zeros
   for d in D do
      p  getPoS(d) // Get probability of success
      if random.uniform(0,1)  p then
          // If the disease gets an approval...
          existing  getExistingPatients(d) ; // Get existing patients (1 ×
           T)
          new  getNewPatients(d) // Get new patients (1 × T)
            getRampFunction(d) // Get penetration ramp (1 × T)
          price  getPrice(d) // Get price of GT (scalar)
          P+ = (existing + new) // Store number of patients
          C+ = P× price // Store cost of treatment
      end
   end
   return P, C
            Algorithm 1: Pseudocode for one iteration of the simulation.



Implementation
All the equations are discretized for computation from their continuous forms. When solving
the integrals using the trapezoidal rule to obtain QALY, we use strip widths of 1 year across
a range from 0 to 110 years old, the resolution offered by the life tables. When simulating
the number of patients and the cost over time, we use steps of 1 month.
    Our codes are implemented on Python 3.6 backed by Numpy. Our vectorized imple-
mentation averages 6.120ms per iteration over 1,000,000 runs on a single thread of an Intel
Xeon Gold 5120, clocked at 2.20GHz with 20GB of RAM. We attempted to use PyTorch
to speed up the computations using a GPU, but it ran more slowly than a single-threaded
CPU. We determined this took place for two reasons. First, generating random numbers
must be sequential, since PyTorch delegates it solely to the CPU, which limits the amount
of parallelization that can be achieved, as dictated by Amdahl's law. Second, because our
computations require a large amount of data from different sources, they must be batched

                                             50
due to the GPU's limited RAM. The constant movement of data through the PCIe bridge,
however, turns out to be a massive bottleneck to the overall speed.




                                        51
A3       Simulation Convergence Criteria
Let Xk be the results of the k -th simulation. Xk has a true mean of µ and variance  2 . Let
                                                                  1   n
the mean of the Monte Carlo simulations over n runs be µ    ^n = n    k Xk . Then, by Linde-
berg­L´
      evy's Central Limit Theorem, µ   ^n converges in distribution to a normal distribution
with mean µ and variance of n 2 . The 95 percent confidence interval for µ is given by:

                                             1.96sn
                                         ^n ± 
                                         µ                                                (27)
                                                n

where sn is the sample variance of {X1 , · · · , Xn }.
   Since we are using 1-by-T vectors, we investigated the error in our simulation by dividing
the half-range of the confidence interval in each time-step by µ
                                                               ^n before taking the maximum
across the time series. As can be seen from Figure A1, we should expect the simulated mean
to be within 1.89% of the true mean 95% of the time with 1,000,000 iterations.

A6      Patient Population Estimation
We source the patient prevalence and incidence of the diseases from different sources. When
necessary, we compute the prevalence from the incidence using Equation 1, or vice versa,
using Equation 2. Our results are shown in Table A3. These numbers do not reflect the
adjustments we make to NSC lung cancer, prostrate cancer and spinal muscular atrophy in
order to minimize overlapping patient groups.

Table A3: Number of current patients and annual new patients for each disease. An asterisk
() indicates that either the prevalence is computed from the incidence using Equation 1, or
vice versa, using Equation 2.

A8      Calibration of Age Distribution A(x)
As mentioned in the main paper, our optimization program produces triangular age distri-
butions that conforms to data, have wider support compared to fitting uniform distributions
and, avoids sharp changes in the probability density. We illustrate some examples that
compare triangle distributions with the uniform distributions with the same average age.

the solutions obtained by our optimization program, while the blue rectangles represent the
solutions given by an uniform distribution. The distributions from the optimization program
have a wider base of support and avoid sharp changes in density.

The results of our literature search and estimation for the change in QoL for each disease is
shown in the table below.

   h (salt ), after treatment fh (sgt ), and the change in quality of life (QoL). Asterisks ()
 indicate that the values are interpolated. Cancers are not included, as we assume that the
 gains in survival dominate the gains in QoL.
