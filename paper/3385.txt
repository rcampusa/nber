                               WAITING FOR WORK


                                   ABSTRACT



     This paper explains upward job mobility and observed patterns of
unemployment by skill as an economy recovers from a recession. Skilled
unemployment is due to rational waiting by workers looking for long-term jobs
when there is a "lock-in" effect. Lock-in occurs if the conditions in the
labor market when a worker first accepts a job have a persistent effect on
wages. Using longitudinal data, we provide empirical evidence of the cyclical
pattern of wages predicted by the theory and also of lock-in.

I. Introduction

    This   paper models cyclical upgrading and downgrading in the labor market.'

It shows that wait unemployment can arise as an equilibrium response to time

varying opportunities: workers who are laid off in a downturn rationally wait

to accept jobs until business conditions improve. Workers voluntarily remain

unemployed during recessions if they gain through waiting for permanently

higher wages which are available in the new jobs which appear during

expansions. Our empirical work provides new evidence of procyclic variation in

real wages of job takers. It also tests and strongly confirms the key

assumption of the model: workers hired in booms "lock-in' persistently high

wages and workers hired in busts suffer low wages for significant periods.

     This paper is motivated in part by the observation that labor is not the

only factor of production which experiences periods of idleness. Office

buildings sometimes stand unoccupied for extended periods of time and oil

reserves sit idly underground. In the case of oil (and other exhaustible

natural resources), a well developed theory (Hotelling 1931) explains why the

owners wait to extract their resource. In the equilibrium of the Hotelling

model, the owners of oil reserves are compensated for waiting by an increase in

the price of oil at the rate of interest.

     In contrast to oil, the use of office buildings in one period does not

preclude their use in other periods. In this respect, workers more closely

resemble office buildings than oil. Yet, in places like Houston, Texas and

Walnut Creek, California completed office buildings have been sitting vacant

for long periods. The Hotelling model can be adapted to explain the existence

of vacant office buildings provided that a significant fixed Cost must be borne

when office space is occupied or vacated. If such Costs are sufficiently

large, there is a "lock-in" effect: a building owner who rents his office space
today to one tenant forgoes the possibility of renting the same space in later

periods to other tenants. If long term rental rates increase more rapidly than

the rate of interest, it pays the owner of an unoccupied building to leave the

apace vacant and wait until conditions improve to rent out apace2. This is

true even if there are tenants willing to pay to occupy the space now. In

contrast, if the rental rates on long term leases increase at less than the

rate of interest, the building owner maximizes the present value of his income

by renting all available apace now, since the reward to waiting in the form of

higher rents in the future, does not make up for the loss in rentals today. In

analogy to the market for oil, in equilibrium, long term rental rates will rise

at precisely the rate of interest with the stock of excess office space being

gradually eliminated over time.

       This paper develops and tests a theory of wait unemployment which is

exactly analogous to Hotelling's model as it would be applied to vacant office

space. Those workers seeking long term jobs experience cyclical unemployment

just as those office buildings whose owners seek long term tenants sometimes

have vacancies. The "labor supply" function in this model is perfectly elastic

and thus the model can rationalize the finding that large variations in

employment are accompanied by small procyclic variations in wages. Our model,

like that of Hansen (1985) and Rogerson (1988), accounts for large aggregate

fluctuations in employment without empirically implausible elasticities of

substitution betweem leisure in different time periods. Our model offers an

alternative rationale for a high elasticity of labor supply with respect to

transitory wage movements. If the wage were rising more rapidly than the rate

of time preference, a rational worker seeking long term work would optimally

wait for work, rather than coinit to the best job currently available. This
                                        3

behavior occurs even if workers place no value at all on leisure.3

Analogously, the supply elasticity with respect to transitory changes in long-

term rental rates is infinite in the Hotelling office-space model, even though

owners place no value on vacancies per Se.

     The market for office buildings has two    important   features: in period.s of

glut, higher quality buildings typically have lower vacancy rates than lower

quality buildings; but lower quality buildings rent Out some space before

vacancies are completely eliminated in higher quality buildings. A model of

the market for office buildings should explain these correlations between

vacancies and quality type.   Our model explains the analogous correlations

observed between unemployment and skill: in recessions, more highly skilled

workers experience less unemployment than less skilled workers; but more highly

skilled workers do not fully bump less skilled workers in competitions for the

new jobs that become available as the economy emerges from recession, so that

skilled workers experience some unemployment.

     In Section II we present the model. In Section III, we analyze how the

amount of wait unemployment and the path of wages vary across individuals as

the economy emerges from an exogenously-caused recession. The incidence of

wait unemployment (both its distribution across skill groups and its aggregate

amount) as well as the paths of wages over time by skill are endogenously

determined in our model in much the same way that the path of extraction of oil

over time and the length of time that must elapse before the oil is fully

depleted and a backstop technology comes into use is endogenously determined in

the Hotelling model. The ultimate causes of cyclical variations in labor

demand are not addressed in this paper and could result either from shocks to

aggregate demand or from shocks to productivity.
                                        4

     The model implies that the real wages of new job holders move

procyclically. In Section IV we present empirical results based on the

National Longitudinal Survey of Youth which strongly reinforce existing

evidence of this behavior. According to the key assumption of the model,

individuals who commit to low wage jobs in recessions do not realize rapid

market based wage adjustments when business conditions improve and the wages of

new entrants rises. Section V tests for such lock-in effects and finds strong

evidence of their existence. Section VI provides a summary.


II. Description of the Model

     Our model of the labor market focuses on the determination of wages and

employment in the "spot market where newly created jobs are filled. The

number of new jobs created at each date and the wage distribution of these new

positions are exogenously determined. Workers vary in skill and employers fill

new jobs with the best workers available at the offered wage. Workers maximize

the present value of lifetime income. Wait unemployment occurs when an

individual who could obtain work today decides to hold out for better

opportunities in the future.

     We use the model to characterize the equilibrium paths of wages and wait

unemployment by skill type as the economy emerges from a recession. Thus we

study how the labor market responds to a shock which initially destroys a

fraction of existing jobs leaving their occupants unemployed; we derive the

time paths describing the reabsorption of these workers into employment and the

wages they obtain as this occurs.

     Our model is characterized by the following assumptions.
                                           S

A. Assumptions Concerning Labor Supply
      1.   At time 0, a shock occurs which leaves 8 people unemployed.

      2. These people differ in skill. Skill is indexed by x, with x

uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.

      3. Each unemployed person has an intertemporal utility function which

depends only on the present discounted value of lifetime income, with

discounting of future income at rate 6.

      4. Workers' willingness to accept or reject jobs is determined by the

maximization of the present discounted value of lifetime income.

      5. There is no uncertainty in the model and workers have perfect

foresight.

      6. During a short period of time, dt, new workers arrive into the

unemployment pool at the rate    dt. This is a consequence of job destruction,

quits and new entry into the labor force. The skill of new entrants into the

unemployment pool is also uniformly distributed between 0 and I.

      7. Workers who are unemployed receive a benefit which is a proportion, b,

of their 'steady state wage' w1, the wage that workers of that skill type earn

in a long run equilibrium with full employment.

B.   Assumptions Concerning Labor Demand
      8.   Firms hire workers into jobs. Only one worker can fill one job.

      9. New jobs arrive at the rate A dt.

     10. Jobs are characterized by the wages they pay. A job of type w pays

the worker in that job a wage of w.

     11. The distribution of wages of the A dt jobs which are created

between time t and t+dt is uniform between 0 and i. Accordingly, there is

a uniform distribution (of density A dt/) of jobs paying a wage w between 0
                                        6


and .

     12. A firm wishing to fill a vacancy selects the best worker willing to

accept its job offer at the time the vacancy appears.

     13. Once the worker has accepted a job, he cannot leave it.

     14. The wage paid on a job is constant forever (at its initial level).

C. Discussion of the Assumptions.

    Three   points concerning labor supply merit discussion.

     (1). The model lets workers choose between accepting a long-term job now,

or waiting until later to accept employment. There is no job quitting. This

assumption, which is so obviously extreme, enables the model to highlight the

implications of lock-in for the wait unemployment of long term job seekers.

Because workers are looking for long term jobs in the model, it is an important

empirical fact for us that much employment is in jobs of long duration. In

1978 male employees in manufacturing held jobs whose predicted average expected

tenure at completion was 18.6 years (Akerlof and Main 1981). The comparable

statistic for all employees for the same year was 12.5 years.

     (2). In reality, many workers have low job switching costs, high rates of

time preference or severe liquidity constraints and are therefore willing to

accept short duration jobs. We could easily amend the model to include such

workers. In our model, these workers would experience unemployment only when

their respective "spot" wage falls below the value of their leisure and

unemployment benefits. The presence of such workers in our model would add to

the unemployment of long term job seekers.

     (3). The workers in our model who are unemployed are well informed and

reject current jobs only in order to obtain better alternatives in the future.
                                       7

Unemployed workers in our model are simply waiting, and not searching for jobs

since there is no stochastic element to the offers workers receive.

     Four points concerning labor demand also merit discussion.

     (1). The flow of new jobs occurs at an exogenous rate which is determined

outside the model. The defining characteristic of a job is the wage it pays.

The jobs which appear in any period pay a distribution of wages. We do not

address what determines the characteristics of new jobs created.5 The

determinants could be purely technological; alternatively, job creation could

be driven by fluctuations in aggregate demand.

     (2). While wages are set exogenously, firms do not select job applicants

randomly. Instead job applicants are ranked according to ability, and firms

with job openings hire the most able workers willing to accept those jobs.

Thus the wage structure of jobs is fixed outside the model, but the wage for

workers of given ability is determined endogenously. Jobs which pay higher

wages obtain better workers. Competition among workers for jobs results in

"clearance" of the 'spot' labor market, at least for skilled workers. These

workers can always obtain some job by bumping less skilled workers in the

competition for newly created jobs.6

     This assumption is contrary to the implication of most efficiency wage

models, that "overskilled" workers should be rejected by firms because they

receive insufficient rents to exert optimal effort.7 As a consequence, in most

efficiency wage models, skilled workers would experience job rationing. Our

assumption, however, closely corresponds to the two-stage institutional wage

setting commonly practiced in large organizations (see, for example, Henderson

(1982)). In the first stage, personnel managers establish "wage relativities",

using various evaluation schemes to decide on the appropriate relative rates of
                                            8

 pay of different jobs. In the second stage, firms use wage surveys to discover

 the rates of pay offered by other employers in the area and decide on their

 appropriate compensation level in comparison with other firms. Finally,

 individual vacancies are filled by selection of the best available candidates

 at these predetermined compensation levels. An expense preference theory of

 managerial behavior which can be derived from principal-agent theory with

 constraints on liability8, could theoretically rationalize such behavior. Katz

 and Summers (1989), for example, have argued that such "rent-sharing" models

 explain a wide range of empirical regularities concerning interindustry and

 occupational wage differentials. This characterization of the labor market is

 also in agreement with, for example, Reder (1955) and Okun (1973).

      (3). In the model, firms pay newly hired workers quality-adjusted
                                                                            wages
which may differ from those paid to workers hired previously.9 In booms, firms

discriminate against workers with high mobility Costs by failing to raise their

wage to the current market clearing level. Such discrimination may partly

explain why quits in the U.S. economy are procyclic (see Akerlof, Rose and

Yellen 1988). In booms, mobile workers leave 'bad' jobs which they      acquired in

recessions; the less mobile workers, whose behavior we model, remain stuck in

these 'bad' jobs.

     (4). Our model assumes that the mean quality of newly created jobs

remains constant over time. Aggregate wages are virtually acyclic.° However

quality-adjusted wages vary procyclically as the average skill of new hires

into given quality jobs falls in booms. With the more realistic assumption

(See, for example, Okun   (1973)   or Barsky and Solon (1989)) that the average

quality of new jobs rises in booms, both quality adjusted and aggregate wages

would be significantly procyclic.

 111.    Solution   of   the Model

        A solution to this model consists of a description of the equilibrium

paths both for the wage rate of each skill type and the unemployment rate of

each skill type at each date during the transition to the steady state as the

stock of initially unemployed workers, along with the flow of new entrants, is

matched with the flow of new jobs.'1 We viii denote these w(x,t) and u(x,t).

We will first describe the steady state of this model, in which there is no

unemployment, and then the approach to the steady state.

A. The Steady State

        In the steady State unemployment disappears and the flow of new entrants

into the labor market is matched with the flow of new jobs.      New entrants and

new jobs flow into the labor market at the rates a dt and A dt respectively.

We will assume that a < A. Under this assumption, the flow of new jobs is more

than sufficient to provide employment to all new entrants into the labor force.

At each time, new entrants queue by skill and "slot" themselves in order of

quality into the flow of new jobs becoming available. In a steady state, the

wage received by skill type x, denoted w3(x), is determined by the equilibrium

condition that the number of new jobs paying at least v1(x) should just match

the number of incoming workers at least as skilled as x, leading to the

following equation


            rrw    A     1
(1)                         —
            [J w(x) / Wdwjdt a(l-x)dt


The left hand side of (1) is the number of new jobs paying a wage at least as

great as w1(x). The right hand side of (1) is the number of workers at least
                                           10

as skilled as x who are entering the unemployment pool. Solution of (1)

yields a specific formula for the steady-state wage w5(x)



(2)       w(x) —   (l   -
                            'A   (l-x)).



In the steady state with a < A, some newly created jobs are never filled. If,

contrary to our assumption, a > A, workers of skill type less than 1 -   A/a are

permanently unemployed.

B. Wages and   Unemployment Along the Path to the Steady State
      Along an equilibrium path to the steady state, all jobs accepted by
workers of the same skill type must yield the same intertemporal utility. This

follows from the fact that individuals who maximize intertemporal utility will

never accept a job at any date t' if they can get higher utility by accepting a

job at another date, t". As a result, an initially unemployed worker of type x

receives utility U(x) dependent only on his skill type and not on the date of

job acceptance. Since firms give preference to more qualified job candidates,

workers of higher skill index x will receive jobs with a higher utility.

      In order to solve for the path of wages received by a given skill type x

along the path to the steady state it is necessary to determine T, which is

the first date at which workers of type x receive the steady state wage and

also the last date at which they have any unemployment. The methodology is

similar to that used in a natural resource problem. In a natural resources

problem, the price path of a resource is computed conditional on the date of

first use of the backstop technology. Then the date of first use of the

backstop technology is determined by the condition that the demand for the

resource up to that date exactly exhausts the supply of the resource. T is
                                                    11

analogous to the date of use of the backstop technology. As in the natural

resource problem, the equilibrium wage path is computed conditional on TX.

Then T is determined by the condition that the demand for labor of type x

along the equilibrium wage path between 0 and T1 must match the supply of labor

of type x over the same period.

      The Wage Path Conditional on T. The wage paid to skill type x at the

date T is the steady state wage, w1(x), given by formula (2). Knowing that

w(x, T1) —   w5(x), it is possible to find the wages for type x workers at all
preceding dates conditional on T1, since the present discounted valueof the

income stream of a worker accepting a job at t < T and at T must be the same.

      A job accepted at T5 yields intertemporal utility TJ(x) which is the

sum of two components: the present discounted value of the income bw1(x)

received from unemployment insurance between 0 and T plus the present

discounted value of the steady state wage, which is received beyond T. This

utility is

(3)          U(x) —    bw(x)                    + —;—— e


The "reservation wage" of type x labor at time t, w(x,t), is then just that

wage which yields the same total utility U(x) for an initially unemployed

worker who instead accepts a job at date t < T. The utility from accepting a

job paying w(x,t) at t is


                               1 -St            w(x,t)eSt

                                              12

 Equating (4) and (3) yields w(x,t).

       Computation of TX. To solve for T1 we equate the number of jobs created

between 0 and T which yield utility at least as great as U(x) with the

number of initially unemployed workers and new entrants to the labor force

between 0 and T with skills at least as great as x. In our example it is

possible to show that if type x labor has no unemployment at Tr then no higher

grade of labor will be unemployed. In consequence the number of new jobs taken

by labor with skill at least as great as x is the sum of two parts: the first

component is the stock of workers with skill at least as great as x who were

initially unemployed (at T they are all employed); the second component is

the flow between 0 and T1 of workers who entered the labor force with skill    at

least as great as x. (All of these workers will also be employed at T in jobs

which are at least as good as those taken by labor of type x.) There are

(l-x)8 workers who are initially unemployed, with skill at least as great as x

who become re-employed by date T1; and there are a(l-x)T workers who enter

the labor pool with skill at least as high as x. Consequently (l-x)9 +

(l-x)mT5 jobs are taken between 0 and T5 which are at least as good as the

jobs taken by workers of skill level x.

       How many jobs preferable to those taken by group x are created between 0

and Tr? At time t the rate of such "superior" job creation is

where w(x,t) is the "reservation wage" of labor of type x. Any job paying a

higher wage than the reservation wage of type x labor is superior to that

paying w(x,t). Between 0 and T1 the total number of such jobs created is

To solve for T1, we equate the number of jobs created between 0 and T offering

utility at least as great as U(x), given by (7), with the number of initially

unemployed workers and new entrants to the labor force between 0 and T with

skills at least as great as x. This results in the equation

      Substitution of the formula for the wage, given by (5), into (8) yields an

implicit equation for T:

      The Unemployment Path by Skill. The unemployment rate of type x labor at

time t, u(x,t), defined as the fraction of the initially unemployed workers of

this skill type who are still Out of a job at time t, can now be easily

obtained. At time T there is no unemployment of type x workers or workers

with greater skill. Therefore, for any t <             T,   the number of unemployed

workers at least as skilled as x plus the number of workers who will enter the

labor force between t and T with skill at least as great as x must equal the
                                                   14

 number of new jobs which will be created between t and T5 with wages at least

 The first term on the left hand side of (10) is the total number of
                                                                                       unemployed
 workers with skill at least as great as x; the second term is the number of

 new entrants to the labor market with skill at least as great as x between t

 and T1. The right hand side of (10) is the total number of jobs yielding at

 least as much utility as U(x) which are created between t and                     T. The
 unemployment rate of workers of type x at time t, u(x,t), is obtained by total

 differentiation of (10) with respect to x. Use of (2) and (5) to substitute

 for w(x,t) and use of (9) to compute dTddx yields the following simple formula

for the unemployment rate:


                                           -6 (T -      t)

Differentiating (11) with respect to x and making use of the fact that T is

higher for lower x, it is easy to verify that, at each date, unemployment rates

are inversely related to skill; less skilled workers experience higher

unemployment throughout the transition to the full employment steady state.

The more skilled experience a more rapid decline in unemployment than the less
                                         15

 skilled, who linger longer in the unemployment pool as the economy emerges from

 recession. Our theory thus rationalizes observed relations between

unemployment and skill.2 Higher skilled workers have lower unemployment rates

but unemployment is not confined solely to the lowest skilled workers in

recession. Although more skilled workers can always bump less skilled workers

for jobs, and thus there is no "involuntary" unemployment, there are

 (endogenous) limits to the bumping that occurs. The rate at which skilled

workers currently take jobs determines the current wage gradient with respect

to skill. Too great a current skill/wage gradient makes it rational for

workers to wait rather than to take the jobs which are currently available to

them. Unemployment results so that the current skill/wage gradient is not too

steep.

     As should be intuitive, an increase in    or decrease in A serves to

lengthen the amount of time it takes for the unemployment of any group to be

absorbed. The unemployment rate of each group at each date is also greater the

higher the unemployment benefit, b. These benefits raise an individual's

reservation wage path by providing positive income in periods in which waiting

occurs. As a consequence, individuals become more patient, in the sense that

their wages need to rise at a slower rate to make waiting worthwhile. In the

absence of unemployment benefits, wages must rise at the rate 6 in order to

compensate a worker for waiting. With unemployment benefits, the required race

of increase is approximately 8(1-b). Interestingly, although not shown in

equation 11, the taxation of the marginal unemployment benefits of workers of

greater skill will increase the unemployment of lower skill workers because it

will induce the higher skill workers to take up the jobs that would otherwise

be available to lover skilled workers.

C.    Shzazlstions
       Figures   1 and 2 illustrate the key properties of this model for sample

parameter values. The parameters which need to be chosen are 8, the percent of

the labor force initially unemployed, a, the rate of flow into the labor pool

as a fraction of the labor force, A, the rate at which new jobs are created,

b, the fraction of income replaced by unemployment insurance, and 8, the rate

of discount. We chose 8 — 5 percent; in other words, we supposed that a

recession started with 5 percent excess unemployment. The model does not

represent the unemployment of persons who are in the secondary labor market or

who are on temporary layoff waiting to be recalled. Nor does it reflect the

unemployment of those who are at the margin between being in and out of the

labor force. For this reason we chose a the flow into the unemployment pooi

to be quite low relative to total turnover. Total turnover in manufacturing is

60 percent per year. We chose a to be 5 percent per year. Further, we chose

b —   .5, and S — .1.    The major reason for choosing such a high rate of

discount is to mitigate the assumption in the model that jobs last forever.

Workers' leaving their jobs with a constant probability is similar to an

addition to the rate of discount in our model. The final parameter chosen was

A, the rate of job creation; A was chosen so that the length of the recovery

would be 36 months, the typical length of recoveries in the United States.

That is we chose, T0, the length of time for the lowest index labor to lose

all its unemployment to be three years. A was then chosen so that with the

values of a, b, 8 and 6 already selected, T0 would be three years

(according to formula (9) for T0). Figures 1 and 2 show simulated paths of

unemployment and wages with these benchmark parameters. It is worth noting how

modest the fluctuations in real wages are over this cycle.

IV.   Tasting for Cyclicality     In   the Wages of New Job folders
      The next two sections of the paper present empirical tests of two key

features of our model. In this section, we demonstrate the validity of an

important implication of our model, namely that wages for individuals beginning

new jobs ("movers") are procyclic. We estimate that an exogenous one-point

increase in aggregate unemployment lowers real wages for movers by

approximately 3%. In the next section, we test an important assumption of our

model, namely, that wages of individuals who remain in jobs ("stayers") differ

significantly from those of movers. In particular, we test and reject the

hypothesis that the wages of stayers are as cyclic as those of movers.

Instead, we find that the wages of stayers persistently reflect the cyclic

conditions which prevailed when the job was first taken, so that individuals

who are hired during expansions "lock-in" persistently high wages.

      We test our hypotheses using data drawn from the National Longitudinal

Survey of Youth (NLSY).       The NLSY   is   a nationally representative panel of 6111

youth who were between the ages of 14 and 2113 in 1979. Detailed interviews

were conducted annually with the participants from 1979 through 1986. The NLSY

has suffered extremely low attrition; 92% of the original cohort answered the

1986 survey.

      We use the NLSY   for   a number of reasons. This data set has not been

previously exploited by researchers, and it is interesting to compare our

results with those derived both from other NLS cohorts (e.g., the NLS cohort of

young men used by both Bils (1985) and Keane, Moffitt and Runkle (1988),

(hereafter "K"]), and from other micro-panels (e.g., the PSID used by Barsky

and Solon (1989), Blank (1987) and Mincer (1987)). Many young people have low

costs of job switching and change jobs frequently. Our          model   does not   explain
                                                20

the unemployment    of    individuals who are willing to take short jobs at low

wages. Nevertheless, irrespective of the length of stay of the incumbents, the

wages obtained by young people in the spot market accurately reflects the

cyclical behavior of opportunities in the general labor market. The sample

period is of interest both because of its immediacy, and because it includes a

natural macroeconomic experiment, the deep recession of 1982.14

        The assumptions of the theoretical model presented in Section II imply the

following structural wage equation for individuals acquiring new jobs:


(12)                 —   f(u,     HKi, X)
where: Wit        is the (logarithm of the) real wage that individual i receives

at time t for job j that began at time s, s                  t; u is a measure of the

business cycle (which may be individual-specific) at time t;                     is a vector

of human capital variables for i at time t; X is a vector of other relevant

variables facing i at time t.

        We assume that f(.) is a static stochastic linear function, and estimate:


(13)        wttj(t) —    a +   flu1   +   ZykHXkjt   +               +
                                          k              I


where        is an iid individual-specific productivity shock which is

unobservable to the econometrician, but orthogonal to the regressors. Under

these conditions, (13) can be estimated efficiently with ordinary least squares

(OLS); we discuss potential estimation problems below.

       The primary parameter of interest is fi.              If the unemployment rate is used
for u, then fi     is    the unemployment semi-elasticity of real wages. Our model

implies that      is expected to be negative in sign, with a coefficient which is
                                       21

approximately equal to -6(l-b)T0/8. If 6 —   .1,   b—.5, T0 — 3 and 8 —   5   percent,

as in our benchmark simulations, then the implied unemployment semi-elasticity,

fi, is -   .03.

     The theoretical model presented above indicates that equation (13) is

relevant only for job movers, that is individuals who are in new jobs at time

t. In our empirical work, the universe of (13) consists of individuals who

started their current job (with a new employer) after the date of the last NLS

interview. We restrict our attention to individuals who are full-time workers

at least 16 years old. High school and full-time college students, as well as

the self-employed, are excluded from the sample.'5 The data is pooled across

years, so that some individuals account for multiple observations; for

instance, a person who moved before both the 1983 and 1986 interviews (and

satisfied all the other requirements) would account for two observations.

     We attempt to take advantage of the rich array of data available in the

NLSY. The vector HK contains the following variables: a) age; b) sex dummy; c)

poor health dummy; d) number of dependents; e) a dummy for individuals who are

married with spouse present); f) five race dummies; g) three religion dummies;

h) dummies for individuals with non-native mother and non-native father; i)

experience (measured as the number of 2000-hour work-years) and its square; j)

dummies for high-school and college graduation; k) years of education; and 1)

ten scores from a battery of vocational aptitude tests.'6'7 The X vector

contains dummies for residency in: the South; a non-SMSA area; and a rural

area. The regressand is the natural logarithm of the hourly wage rate (in

cents) deflated by the aggregate GNP deflator (1982—1.). We use the

unemployment rate for all workers as a percentage of the labor force including

resident Armed Forces; this rate peaked at 9.5% in 1982-1983.
                                            22

        OLS estimation of (13) produces the results in the first two columns of

Table 1 below. Standard errors are reported in parentheses; sample averages of

the regressors are tabulated in the column on the extreme right of the table.

Coefficients which are significantly different from zero at the .01 (.05)

confidence level are marked with two (one) asterisks. The equations fit the

data well; the adjusted R2 of .22 compares favorably with other results

(e.g. the OLS wage equation of KMR has an adjusted R2 of .05). RMSE" denotes

the root mean squared-error of the residual.

        The unemployment rate enters (13) with a coefficient of -   .028, indicating
that an exogenous increase in the unemployment rate of one point (from say 7%

to 8%) is associated with a 2.8% decline in the real wage. The coefficient is

estimated with great precision; the associated t-statistic is 5.2. By

comparison, Bils (1985) finds that a one point increase in the unemployment

rate is associated with a fall of between 3.5% and 4% in the real wage for job

changers. Bils finds a semi-elasticity of between - .015 and - .02 for all

individuals (including job stayers); KMR estimate a much smaller response

(between -.005 and -     .01).   Mincer (1986) estimates a semi-elasticity of between
-   .012 and - .029.   The estimate of 2.8% accords closely with the theoretical

prediction of the model for reasonable parameter values.

        Our estimate of (13) implies wage cyclicality which is both statistically

significant and close in magnitude to the prediction of the theory. However,

other aspects of (13) are also of intrinsic interest. The results in Table 1

are, for the most part, quite consistent with much of the received wisdom in

labor economics. Worthy of note are: 1) the large but declining return to

experience; 2) the significant positive effects of both college graduation18

and additional years of education; 3) lower average wages for females but

 (strikingly) insignificantly different wages for a variety of religious and

racial groups; 4) an insignificant effect of Southern residency; 5) a positive

effect of urban residency; and 6) mostly positive and sometimes significant

effects of higher scores on the ten aptitude tests. The exception to the

latter is the significantly negative impact of higjter scores on paragraph

comprehension.

     OLS   estimation   of (13) ignores the potentially important effects of sample

selection bias. Such issues have been recently stressed by KMR (see also Bus

(1985)). At least two distinct types of sample selection bias are potentially

important. First, (13) is only estimated for movers. However, at least some

movers are individuals who quit their old jobs in order to take advantage of

idiosyncratically higher wages. As quits are known to be procyclic, ignoring

such self selection may lead the econonietrician incorrectly to estimate a

countercyclically biased semi-elasticity. More importantly, an individual must

be currently employed to enter the universe of (13). The theoretical model

above argues that high quality workers constitute a disproportionate number of

new job movers during recessions. As a consequence, in our model, wages

adjusted for 'true' quality tend to fall during recessions, although

"aggregate wages are acyclic. If labor quality is imperfectly observable, the

econometrjcian who ignores sample    selection   bias will estimate an unemployment

rate coefficient which is counter-cyclically biased.

     We have checked the robustness of our results to both types of potential

sample selection biases by using the popular two-step "Heckit" estimator;

Heclanan (1979) provides the classic analysis. Heckit analysis proceeds in two

steps.   First a probit equation is used to estimate the sample selection rule;

then a function of the probit residuals which corrects the sample selection
                                        25

bias is added to the equation of interest (in our case, (13)). As we are

concerned with two potential types of sample aelection biaa, we estimate two

types of probit equations.'9 The more important compares movers to the

remainder of the sample (e.g., including unemployed workers); the second

compares movers only to employed stayers. We then include the sample selection

correction in (13) and re-estimate our equations for movers. Results which

include a sample-selection correction (for movers vs all others) are included

in Table 1 in the third and fourth columns. Consistent with the results of

Bils (1985) (but not KMR), the results do not indicate significant sample

selection bias; this is true of both types of potential sample selection bias.

     An interesting alternative way to avoid sample selection of the

mover/stayer variety, is to examine the wages of individuals leaving school and

entering full-time employment for the first time. The wages of school-leavers

are highly procyclic: if (13) is estimated for the universe of school-leavers,

the coefficient on the unemployment rate is - .039 with a standard error of

.009. This estimate is similar to that derived from (13) above. Nevertheless,

there is clearly an element of choice in the timing of the decision to finish

school and enter the labor force. While we suspect that such considerations

are not very important, they lead to a countercyclic bias in the unemployment

coefficient (insofar as individuals avoid entering the labor force and taking

low-wage jobs during recessions).

     We have also checked our results for robustness with respect to a number

of other perturbations of our basic methodology. We have added lags of the

wage rate to the right-hand side of (13). We have used CI..S, weighting

observations by national sampling weights. Alternatively, we have used

standard errors which are immune to arbitrary forms of heteroskedasticity. We
                                          26

have used different definitions of two of the key variables in (13): 1) the CPI

has been substituted for the CNP deflator; 2) three alternative neasures of the

business cycle have been used in place of the aggregate unemployment rate: (a)

the employment/population ratio; b) the aggregate unemployment rate for youth;

and c) the (individual-specific) local area unemployment rate, both with and

without year effects. Finally, we have restricted the sample in five different

ways: 1) excluding earlier years of the sample; 2) eliminating outliers; 3)

restricting the sample to non-unionized workers; 4) estimating

(13) on an industry by industry basis; and 5) estimating (13) separately for

each of eleven occupation groups. However, none of these exercises removes or

substantially weakens our finding of substantially procyclic wages.

       We note in passing that adding industry or occupation controls to (13)

only slightly (and insignificantly) reduces the degree of wage cyclicality,

indicating that wage cyclicality does not exist solely because individuals

receive the opportunity to move to high-wage sectors or occupations during

expansions (as proposed by Okun (1973)).

"fixed effect" intercepts is:20

grounds. As in the estimate of (13), these results are also robust. For

instance, if year effects are added, they are insignificant, and

(insignificantly) change the coefficient on the unemployment rate to -       .031.
Alternatively, if the (change in the) local area unemployment rate is used

instead, the point estimate is quite similar (-.022), with a t-statistic of

721

       To summarize, evidence from the NLSY panel is quite consistent with the

hypothesis that the real wage for movers is significantly procyclic in both the

economic and statistical senses. We now proceed to the second of our

objectives, namely testing for real wage "lock-in".


V. Testing for "Lock-In"

       The objective of this section is to test for a "lock-in" effect on real

wages. "Lock-in" occurs if individuals who stay in jobs have wages which are

significantly less cyclic than wages of comparable individuals who move into

new jobs. In the extreme case used in the theoretical model, real wages of

movers are procyclic, but the wage of an individual who is hired at time c for

wage w remains fixed at w for as long as the individual remains in the job.

       One way to test for lock-in is to estimate an analogue to (13) for stayers

as well as movers. We use the following trivial generalization of (13):


(15)        witic.) — a +   flu1 +            ÷ Six          +
                                     k         1

If s—t, then (15) is precisely (13); however, if             the individual is a
stayer.    In the absence of any lock-in effect, fi   is   identical for movers and

stayers; in contrast, in our theoretical model lock-in is complete so that fi         is
zero for stayers. To test for lock-in, we estimate (15) separately for movers
                                          29

 and stayers and test the hypothesis that the       of stayers is significantly
 lover than the coefficient for movers.

        Estimates of (15) for movers and stayers are tabulated in Table 322

While the coefficients in the movers and stayers equations resemble each other

 closely in many respects, the wages of movers are much more cyclic. In

particular, the coefficient on the unemployment rate for stayers is one-quarter

of the comparable coefficient for movers; further, the hypothesis that the

wages of stayers are acyclic cannot be rejected at conventional significance

levels.23 The conclusion that the wages of movers and stayers have differing

cyclicality is not unique to this study; Bus (1985) has reached similar



       An alternative test for lock-in uses the following equation:


(16)            tj(s)
                        —        + T2Wj,j(,)) +       for st
where   Witj(t) is the wage which individual i    would hypothetically receive at
time   t if   he were to start a new job and p is an iid disturbance term assumed
to   be orthogonal to the regressors which represents match-specific productivity

effects.

       To understand this equation, consider the wage of a man who began his job

in the recession year 1982 and remained in the same job through 1986. The wage

of this worker would exhibit lock-in if his 1986 wage was still (adversely)

affected by his initially low 1982 wage. Alternatively, if the man's wage

moved one for one with the wages of active participants in the spot labor

market, then there would be no persistent effect of the low initial wage and

thus no evidence of lock-in. Absence of lock-in can be conveniently

parameterized as r1—l, r2—O; partial lock-in can be expressed as r1<1, r2>O;

complete lock-in (as assumed in the theoretical model) implies r1—O, r—l.

       Equation (16) cannot be estimated without generating data for

Conceptually, this is the wage that, a woman who stayed in a job through say

the 1984 interview would have gotten if she had actually moved during 1984;

alternatively, it can be viewed as the wage that movers with observable

characteristics identical to those of the woman actually get. We generate

Wit.(t) by estimating (13) for movers, and using the fitted coefficients (along

with the regressors of stayers) to generate jtJ(t)    for   stayers.25 Traditional

standard errors may not be correct insofar as i,t,j(t) is a generated regressor;

consequently, we estimate standard errors through a parametric bootstrap, using

1000 replications •26

       Actual estimates of (16), with and without a constant term, are,

respectively:

       The results indicate that the wages of stayers are substantially affected

by both their initial wage and the contemporaneous wage of movers. There is

strong evidence of partial lock-in; both the extreme hypotheses of complete and

of no lock-in can be easily rejected at all conventional significance levels.

Note that the initial wage is not adjusted for tenure or experience in any

       Equation (16) may be criticized insofar as no dynamics are included;

alternatively, (16) can be viewed as a steady state target. Accordingly, we

have estimated a series of dynamic models, including the following partial-

adjustment models:

       The significance of the initial wage in (20) indicates that the wages of

stayers do not converge asymptotically to the spot market wages attained by

movers. Thus, (20) provides evidence of significant "hysteresis" in wage

determination of stayers. Even if the possibility of hysteresis is ignored, as

in (19), the speed of adjustment of the wages of stayers to the wages of movers

is not very high; the mean lag is over two and a half years. We conclude that

accounting for dynamics, at least in this simple way, does not reverse our

finding of partial lock-in.

       For yet another test of lock-in, we mechanically first-difference (13)

across time obtaining potentially different equations for "stayers", "single

movers", defined at those in a new job at time t       but    not t-l, and "double

movers", defined as those in new jobs both at t        and   t-l.

       Estimates of equations (21) -          (23) are presented in Table 4. Under the
null hypothesis of (13)            should be significantly negative; partial lock-in

implies that fisT and fi5,   should be closer to zero.
       A rigorous test of the hypothesis that the unemployment rate coefficients

are equal for stayers and movers can be computed by pooling observations. The

test indicates that stayers and double movers (but not stayers and single

movers) have different cyclic wage patterns. Using the aggregate unemployment

rate, the t-test is 2.4 for stayers vs double movers (with a marginal

significance level of 1.9%); for stayers vs single movers, the t-statistic is

.8 (with a marginal significance level of 45%). Thus double movers, but not

single movers, appear to have wages which are significantly more cyclic than

those of stayers at traditional significance levels.

     The results indicate that less than one-fifth of the wage growth of movers

is reflected in the wage growth of comparable stayers. Incorporating a variety

of dynamics does not change this conclusion.



VI. Siary
     This paper has presented a theory of unemployment and wages by skill for

an economy emerging from a recession. It has provided an equilibrium theory of

upward mobility in a higit pressure economy as observed by Okun (1973). In

booms, workers of all qualities who are in the job market get better jobs than

they can get in recession. Workers are sufficiently dissatisfied with the jobs

available to them in recessions that some of them choose to wait rather than to

work. Those who choose to wait are unemployed; the number of them is

endogenously determined so that the reward to waiting due to the procyclic

movement in real wages compensates for the lost income from current

unemployment. We have shown that wages in the spot market, for workers

currently taking jobs, improves significantly as the unemployment rate

declines. Also, workers who take jobs in recessions experience lock-in: the

wages received in those jobs do not rise to match the improvement in the spot

market.

                                      POOTNOTES



1. This phenomenon has been previously explored by Reder (1955), Okun (1973),
Bus (1985), and Barsky and Solon (1989).     This paper provides a theoretical
rationale for their findings and additional evidence.

2.  This abstracts from the existence of variable costs incurred from renting
space and assumes that tenancies last forever.

3. Hansen (1985) and Rogerson    (1988) have explained the significant variation in
employment which occurs over     the business cycle in a model in which unemployed
workers have a contract which    provides insurance when they are not working. With
optimal contracts, consumption   is unaffected by employment status and labor supply
is more elastic than it would be in the absence of such insurance because
unemployed workers experience no consumption decline. Hansen and Rogerson assume
either that individuals' preferences or the technology exhibits a nonconvexity
with respect to labor supply so that individuals either work full time or not at
all, with the outcome determined by a lottery in each period.

4. The presence of such workers at the beginning of a recession typically leads
to greater depression of quality-adjusted wages and thus increases the incentive
to wait for workers with high switching costs or low rates of time preference.

S. In the model constructed, firms do not substitute teams of low paid, low
skilled workers to perform the jobs of individual high skilled workers. This
differs from the usual representation of production with labor of different skills
in which different workers embody different efficiency units of labor and output
is a function of the total labor input, in efficiency units, and capital. In such
a model output is the same with one skilled laborer embodying one labor efficiency
unit or two unskilled laborers each embodying one half labor efficiency unit. In
contrast, in our model, the good laborer would not be a perfect substitute for the
two poor laborers. Production is organized into jobs and only one laborer can
fill one job.   The empirical validity of this assumption is affirmed by an
interview study by Michael Piore (1968), who found that job descriptions were not
responsive in the short-run to relative prices.

6. Davis and Haltiwanger (1989) and Leonard (1987) have shown that the labor
market is characterized by large gross flows of job creation and job destruction
so that A is large. In such an environment, it seems highly implausible that
skilled workers would be unable to bump less skilled workers for jobs if they
wanted them.

7. In the models of Shapiro and Stiglitz (1985) and Salop (1979), for example,
workers who are overskilled would have insufficient incentive to work rather than
shirk, or to remain on the job rather than quit.

8. In the usual principal agent model, a principal designs a compensation scheme
to control a manager who cares not only about her compensation but also about her
own effort. If a manager hires outside labor and can obtain labor which is easier
to manage by paying a higher wage, the theory is formally identical with "wages
                                        39

to those managed" substituted for "effort' in the standard principal/agent model.
If first-best contracts are obtained, then expense preference will not occur. But
first-best contracts can only be obtained under conditions which are impractical
in most labor contracts.    Sappington (1983) has shown that the imposition of
limits to the extraction of payments from managers to firms results in contracts
considerably different from first best. Such contracts are likely to result in
suboptimal effort of managers, in the usual principal agent model, or an excess
of expense preference in a model where managers are hiring other inputs.

9. The existence of "two-tier" pay structures in the airline industry provides
an example of how wages paid to new workers may be lower than the wages paid to
workers with seniority. In academia, it is commonly alleged that new hires are
paid more than equally qualified workers who are locked in. Our empirical work
in Section IV shows that wage adjustments of existing workers to the current
"spot wage" occurs slowly.       Our model makes the extreme assumption, for
simplicity, that no such adjustment occurs.

10. Aggregate wages in our model are slightly procyclic because not all newly
created jobs are taken. As recovery occurs, the wage cut off of newly taken jobs
rises.

11. Lucas (1974) emphasized that both wages and unemployment should be jointly
determined in a full equilibrium model. Our model provides an alternatire to
that exposited by Lucas.

12.      For example, when the unemployment rates of sex-education groups are
regressed on the aggregate unemployment rate, the coefficients for both men and
women decline with increasing education. Further, in the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth, the incidence of unemployment is negatively correlated with a
variety of measures of labor quality.

13. Actually 22.

14.   Nevertheless, the NLSY does have some potentially important drawbacks.
First, the temporal span of the data is shorter than that of other tapes; we
focus on the seven years of data from 1980 through 1986. Also, the NLSY does
not have data on some variables of potential interest. For instance, there are
no measures of overtime pay, which is the subject of considerable interest (Bils
(1985), KMR).

15.   We have also considered both more and less restrictive universes.         In
particular, we have restricted our universe to individuals who left their previous
job for a reason other than: being laid off; fired; or becoming pregnant. We have
also enlarged our sample to include school leavers (with no previous employer).
Our results are typically insensitive to our exact choice of universe.

16. Our thirty-two controls exclude the labor force size variable used by Bils
because t is unavailable in the NLSY.    Otherwise, our controls encompass the
complete list of previously used controls. Both Bils and KMR use a total of four
HK controls.
                                        40

17. The vocational aptitude tests measure knowledge and skill in the following
areas: 1) general science; 2) arithmetic reasoning; 3) word knowledge; 4)
paragraph comprehension; 5) numerical operations; 6) coding speed; 7) auto and
shop information; 8) mathematics knowledge; 9) mechanical comprehension; and 10)
electronics information. These tests are used by the armed services to determine
eligibility and assignment qualifications for specific military jobs for new
enlistees; the scores are also used as measures of trainability, and as primary
criteria of enlistment eligibility for the armed forces. The NLSY members were
paid $50 each to take the battery of tests.

18. High-school graduation is associated with a wage decline, but this result
is of marginal statistical significance and is quite sensitive to the exact
specification of (13).

19. The regressors in the probit equations are identical to those in (13).

20. Note that the differencing is taken over jobs, rather than over time.

21. The local area unemployment rate provided by the NLS is categorical, so that
the semi-elasticity discussed in the text is an implied semi-elasticity.

22. Of course, the estimates for movers are identical to those of Table 1.

23. If the other regressor coefficients are equated for both movers and stayers,
the hypothesis that the unemployment coefficient is equal for the pooled sample
of both movers and stayers can be easily rejected; the t-statistic is over 12.

24. In contrast, Barsky and Solon (1989), using the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics, find only small and statistically insignificant greater cyclicality of
wages for classes of workers with many stayers in comparison with classes of
workers with many movers. However as Rarsky and Solon discuss, stayers and movers
cannot be classified precisely in the PSID because of its lack of precision in
labor force histories.

25. Results adjusted for sample selection bias are not significantly different;
this is not surprising, as we have not found significant evidence of sample
selection bias.

26. The generated regressor problem does not easily fit into the framework of
Pagan.

27. Adding in tenure in a variety of ways (such as an independent regressor, or
as an interaction with the initial wage) only strengthens evidence of lock-in.
