                               ABSTRACT




      This paper investigates the impacts of macroeconomic activity and
policy on the poverty population. It is shown that both the poverty
count and the income share of the lowest quintile of income recipients
move significantly with the business cycle. The differential impact of
inflation versus unemployment on low income groups is analyzed at
length.  The evidence indicates that unemployment has very large and
negative effects on the poor, while inflation appears to have few
effects at all. In addition, changes in tax policy since 1950 have led
to decreasing progressivity in the overall tax structure.      Special
attention is given to changes in the poverty rate over the past decade
and to prospective changes in the remainder of the 1980s.

I. INTRODUCTION


     The plight of the poor is often invoked in discussions of
national economic policy. Those who take a hard line against
inflation frequently claim that inflation, "the cruelest tax,"
victimizes the poor more than other groups, so that an
anti—inflation policy can be construed as beneficial to. the poor.

Similarly, those who are more concerned about unemployment assert
that the poor bear a disproportionate share of the burden when
high unemployment is used to wring inflation out of the system.

It is unlikely that both groups can be right.
     This paper summarizes the existing evidence on how
macroeconomic activity affects the poor, adds new evidence where

appropriate, and examines some of the. channels through which

these effects work.
     Section II is a brief overview of the issue and a selective

survey of the literature. Sections III and IV comprise the heart
of the paper. In Section III, we study how unemployment and
inflation affect the income distribution and poverty, starting at
a rather aggregate level and proceeding down to more detailed
mechanisms linking macroeconomic events to the incomes of

specific demographic groups. Section IV looks at how changes in

tax policy since 1950 have affected the poor. Section V uses some
equations estimated in Section III to analyze the macroeconomic

factors responsible for changes in income distribution and
poverty over the last decade, and Section VI uses these same
equations (in conjunction with macroeconomic forecasts) to
project income shares and poverty rates to 1989. Section VII is a

brief summary of our principal conclusions.

    II.    THE BUSINESS CYCLE AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME

A. MACROECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND POVERTY



          In this paper we present a variety of evidence to support the

contention that cyclical fluctuations have a profound effect on poverty.

But before burying our noses in econometric results, it may be useful to

begin with a naive look at the historical .data. After all, a strong

empirical regularity ought not to require sophisticated statistical

methods to ferret it out. In fact, nothing more than a quick perusal of

the official poverty data is needed to see that the poverty rate falls

in good times and rises in bad.

          Figure 1 shows how the poverty rate among individuals has changed

over the last two and a half decades and also indicates periods of

recession. During the long expansion of the l960s, the percentage of

people living below the poverty line fell rapidly and continuously --

from about 22% in 1961 to about 12% in 1969.          Poverty declined

particularly rapidly during the boomyears of 1965,1966 and 1968

(which, of course, were also the years in which the Great Society

programs were getting started.) Then the poverty count rose slightly

when the economy experienced a mild recession in 1969-1970. When

expansion resumed in 1971-1973 the poverty rate ratcheted down another

notch --     to   11.1%, its historic low. But then the deep recession of

1973-1975 pushed poverty back to 12.3%. The 1976-1978 expansion trimmed

the poverty rate once again. But then back-to-back recessions in 1980

and 1981-1982 raised poverty from 11.7% in 1979 to 15% in 1982. In 1982

and 1983 real GNP fell and then rose. The average unemployment rate was

the same in both years, and the poverty count crept upward to 15.2%.

      All in all, there seems to be a consistently negative correlation

between real economic growth and poverty. In fact, Murray (1983) has

noted that between 1950 and 1980 the simple correlation between changes

in real GNP per household and changes in the percentage of the

population below the poverty line was -.69.     Events since 1980 seem to

reinforce this correlation.

      However, the poor are not a homogeneous population. Poverty rates

differ significantly by race and sex and age of household head.

Focussing on the change in aggregate poverty numbers over the business

cycle may disguise quite different cyclical experiences among various

demographic subgroups.

      A number of researchers have attempted to measure the extent to

which poverty rates among different groups respond to changes in overall

economic growth. (Anderson (1964); Perl and Solnick (1971); Thornton,

Agnello and Link' (1978); Hirsch (1980).) -Much of this workhas involved

simple regressions of changes in annual poverty rates by demographic

group against changes in GNP, in government'transfers, and in a few

additional cyclical indicators (such as unemployment rates). These

articles uniformly show that certain households are less affected by

economic cycles than others.      In particular, households headed by

el4erly people and by women seem largely unaffected by accelerations and

decelerations in economic growth. The results for other types of

households appear quite sensitive to the equation specification.1 Only

among white male-headed households do clear effects emerge in every

study.

         However, these studies provide only a very aggregate answer to the
question "How do business fluctuations affect poverty?" Economic growth

raises mean income and decreases the percentage of people below any

absolute poverty line.2 But changes in the shape of the distribution may

also influence the poverty count in ways that mean income does not

capture. For instance, if the distribution of income spreads out during

boom times, there might be as many or more peéple below the poverty line

even though the poverty line falls to a lower point in the distribution.

      Recognizing these complications, Gottschalk and Danziger (1984)

have recently implemented a more sophisticated approach to relating

poverty to general macroeconomic conditions. They estimate the extent

to which aggregate changes in poverty are due to .changes in government

transfer benefits, changes in mean real income, and a catchall "all

other factors" affecting the shape rather than the position of the

income distribution. The net change in poverty depends on the relative

strength of these three effects, which vary by time periods and among

demographic groups.

      Their findings are potentially disturbing for proponents of

"trickle down." They find that changes in mean transfers have

consistently had negative effects on the poverty percentage since 1967

(although the effect diminishes in recent years). As expected,

increases in mean income have on average pulle4 more people above the

poverty line - -   an   effect which reverses in years when real incomes

fall. But they find that changes in the shape of the distribution have

largely served to increase the number of poor people. Between 1967 and

1982, Gottschalk and Danziger calculate that widening of the

distribution, holding transfers and mean incomes constant, increased the

poverty rate by 2.9 percentage points. Only the growth of the mean of

the distribution, combined with the growth of transfer programs aimed at

the lower-income households, offset this change in hape and led to

generally lower poverty rates.




B. MACROECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION



       While the focus of this conference is on poverty, it is well known

that   any official poverty line is arbitrary. There is really little

economic difference between a family with an annual income $100 below

the poverty line and another with income $100 above. In addition, the

percentage of people below the poverty line in any given year depends

heavily on how the poverty line is defined.

       Part of the negative relationship between GNP growth and poverty

follows arithmetically from the way in which poverty is defined in this

country. The poverty line was set in 1965., based on a calculation of

need levels among various types of families. Since that time, it has

been automatically increased each year by the percent change in the

Consumer Price Index. If the shape of the distribution of income

remains unchanged and no real growth in income occurs, the percentage of

the population defined as "below the poverty line" will remain constant

from year to year. However, if real incomes grow, shifting the

distribution of income to the right without changing its shape, the

percentage of people below the poverty line must shrink. Figure 2 shows

 the ratio of the poverty line for a family of four to mean family income

 over the last 24 years. Because of increases in real incomes in the

 late 1960s and early 1970s, the poverty line fell from 50% to 33% of

 mean income from 1959 to 1973. However, the slowdown in economic growth

in the last decade has kept the line around 34% of mean income since

1973.


        Because an absolute poverty line produces a falling poverty count

in times of economic growth,3 many social scientists eschew the narrow

focus on poverty and look more broadly at the problem of income

inequality. Even if one is interested only in poverty, a case can be

made that the share of income received by the lowest 20% of families (or

some similar measure) is at least as good an index of progress against

poverty as the official poverty rate.     (Blinder (1980, pp.455-456).)

For this reason, we turn now to evidence on the effects of macroeconomic

activity on income inequality rather than on poverty rates.

        A series of articles published in the late l960s and early 1970s

examined the way in which the shape of the income distribution in the

U.S. changed with economic cycles. Though their methods differed

significantly, these -studies came •to similar qualitative conclusions.

Metcalf (1969) described the income distribution as a displaced

lognormal and found that low-income households gained ground on other

groups when the economy improved. Groups less attached to the labor

force (in particular, female-headed households) showed smaller

responses. Thurow (1970) fit a beta distribution and found weaker but

similar effects. Mirer (1973) estimated a model based on disaggregating

income by source. He found that the working poor and the very rich

suffer most when the economy turns down. Beach (1977) estimated the

cyclical responsiveness of income decile shares in order to calculate

Gini coefficients and found that the Gini increased in downturns.

        In short, this research indicated that the income distribution

widens when the economy shrinks and narrows when it grows, implying that
                                                                       8.


the poor gain relative to the rich during cyclical upturns.

Investigating this effect at a more disaggregate level, Blank (1984) has

recently compared the cyclicality of different components of household

income among various income and demographic groups.     Her research

indicates that there are large differences in the cyclicality of various

income components. The primary channel by which low income households

"catch up" in periods of growth is through very large procyclical

movements in the labor income of the household head. This occurs

because real wages, hours of work, and labor force participation all

increase among the poor during an expansion. The.effect is so strong

that it overcomes the fact that labor income is a relatively low

percentage of total income (35.3%) for poor households.'

      The general conclusion of all this research is that the bottom

part of the income distribution loses in relative terms in a recession

and gains in an upswing.     Our concern is to investigate this

relationship between the macroeconomy and the income distribution more

closely. The next section will look in more detail at the various

economic changes that take place during business cycles. We focus on

fluctuations, rather than on general economic growth, for two simple

reasons. The first follows from the policy-oriented nature of this

conference: while a permanent increase in the growth rate of per capita

income would be welcome, and would probably do wonderful things for the

poor, no one has any idea how to achieve this. In contrast, at least

some economists (including us) believe that policy makers have

substantial influence over, the business cycle. The second reason is

historical/statistical: since the long-run growth rate of per capita

GNP has been remarkably constant in the United States for as long as we
                                                                      9.

have data, statistical analysis can tell us little about the

distributional effects of a permanent acceleration of growth. On the

other hand, cyclical variations in the growth rate are frequent and

sizable.


            III.   INFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE POOR

A. WHICH IS THE 'CRUELEST TAX'?



      The postwar history of economic fluctuations in the United States

can be succinctly summarized by looking at the behavior of two

variables: the rate of inflation and the rate of unemployment. Despite

many denunciations of inflation as "the cruelest tax," there is little

doubt that unemployment, not inflation, actually bears most heavily on

the poor.

      We have already.seen' that the' poverty rate increases 'in economic

downturns. This means that there is a strong positive relationship

between unemployment and poverty. Furthermore, there is a common sense

story behind this correlation: when times are bad, less productive

workers with lower skills are likely to be laid off first and to bear

the brunt of unemployment.

      But what about inflation and poverty? The poverty rate fell

during the low-inflation years 1961-1965, but fell even faster from 1965

to 1969 as inflation accelerated. Inflation declined from 1970 to 1972

(assisted by price controls),, and poverty fell again. But poverty also

declined'as inflation accelerated in.1973. The two most inflationary

years of the postwar record were 1974 and 1979. In each of these years,

the poverty rate crept upward. But during the disinflation of the 1980s

poverty increased even faster.
                                                                     10.

      Despite unending incantations about. how inflation weighs most

heavily on the poor, there is no evident correlation between poverty and

inflation. Of course, we will never settle the issue by looking at one

variable at a time. Unemployment and inflation are correlated in the

data, there are time lags, and inflation displays a strong upward trend

in the postwar United States.   It is possible that, once time and

unemployment are statistically controlled for in a multiple regression,

a meaningful relationship between inflation and poverty would emerge.

But we shall see below that statistical analysis confirms the apparent

simple relationships: unemployment, not inflation, has the strongest

bearing on the well-being of the poor.

      We present this evidence next. Following that, we discuss in more

detail the specific ways, in which unemployment bears upon the poor, and

then end this section with a detailed analysis of the channels by which

inflation might differentially affect household incomes.




B. NEW ECONOMETRIC EVIDENCE



      A simple framework for investigating the relative effects of

inflation versus unemployment on the income distribution was introduced

by Blinder and Esaki (1978). In this section we develop and' extend that

work. We find that adding nine new years of data and some new wrinkles

to their specification does not overturn their basic conclusion that

high unemployment is strongly and systematically regressive whereas high

inflation has weak, if any, effects on the distribution of income.

      The specification estimated by Blinder and Esaki was


(1)   S.a+bt+cU+dI+e,                      ..
                                                                     11.

where t is time,     is the income share of the ith quintile at time t,

   is the national civilian unemployment rate, and      is the inflation

rate (based on the GNP deflator).5 Their primary results, based on the

income distribution time series published by the Census Bureau from 1947

to 1974, are summarized in the first part of Table 1.

      According to these results, the lower quintiles sytematically lose

from unemployment and gain (relatively) from inflation. Specifically, a

1 percentage point rise in unemployment decreases the income share of

the lowest quintile by .13 of a percentage point while a 1 point rise in

the inflation rate increases their share by a scant .03 of a percentage

point. Both effects are significant at the 5%level.

      Perusing the results for other quintiles reveals a fairly

consistent pattern: unemployment is a regressive tax while inflation is

a progressive one. More specifically, high unemployment redistributes

income away from the bottom two quintiles and toward the top quintile.

Inflation redistributes away from the fourth quintile toward the lowest

quintile. These findings are broadly consistent with the literature

reviewed in the preceding section, which showed that the income

distribution widened in economic downturns..

      Recently, Asher (1983) updated Blinder and Esaki's regression for

the lowest fifth and made two useful amendments. First, he estimated

the equations with a correction for first-order autocorrelation.

Second, he hypothesized (and found) that the relationship between the

share of the lowest fifth and unemployment was •nonlinear. His resulting

coefficients are reported at the bottom of Table 1..

      Evaluated at the sample mean, the effect of unemployment is close

to that estimated by Blinder and Esaki, but Asher's quadratic

specification makes the effect of unemployment diminish (in absolute

value) as U rises. He interprets this as evidence of "last hired, first

fired."6 (No results are reported for other quintiles.)

      We have estimated a new set of regressions, adopting Asher's

quadratic specification for U, but differing in three additional

respects:

      (1) The economic literature on the redistributive effects of

inflation points to unanticipated inflation as the primary (perhaps the

only) source of income redistribution. So we separated inflation into

anticipated and unanticipated components, using a simple autoregressive

model to generate expectations.'

      (2) We use the prime-age male unemployment rate., U, rather than

the overall unemployment rate, U, as a better indicator of labor market

conditions since it is insensitive to the substantial demographic

changes that have taken place over this pEriod.

      (3) One possible explanation for Asher's finding of high positive

autocorrelation is that income shares adjust to macroeconomic conditions

only with a lag. While a general distributed lag model would have been

preferable, the scarcity of degrees of freedom persuaded us to adopt a

simple geometric distributed lag,

where S* is the equilibrium share of group i. This requires that we

include a lagged dependent variable in the regression. The resulting

specification is statistically very close (but not identical) to Asher's

first-order autocorrelation correction.

      After all these alterations, our final specification is:
                                                                      13.

where 1a is anticipated and I is unanticipated inflation. Estimation
was by ordinary least squares and the sample period was 1948- 1983.'

Results are presented at the top of Table 2. From the estimated

coefficients, it is easy to unscramble the equilibrium effects of

inflation and unemployment (evaluated at the sample mean) on income

shares. These are also shown in Table 2.

     The results are about as expected.       High unemployment has

significant and systematically regressive effects on the distribution of

income: the poorer the group, the worse it fares when unemployment

rises. Despite the larger unemployment coefficient, the estimated

effect of unemployment on the share of the lowest quintile is similar to

that estimated by Blinder and Esaki because these regressions use U*

rather than U,, and U moves less than U over the cycle. In only one of

the five quintiles does unemployment show the nonlinear effect discussed

by Asher.   In general, the additional nine years of data lead to

estimates that are strikingly similar to those of Blinder and Esaki.

(Compare Tables 1 and 2.)

      For inflation, few significant effects were found. First, we

tested the hypothesis that the coefficients of anticipated and

unanticipated inflation were equal.        Contrary to theoretical

expectations, this hypothesis could never be rejected. So we simply

combined the two variables into actual inflation, which proved to be

significant only for the second (from the bottom) quintile. Although

mostly insignificant, the point estimates suggest that inflation is a

somewhat progressive tax.

      The lagged dependent variable was highly signilicant, except for

the middle quintile. Estimated adjustment speeds for the other four

quintiles ranged between 69% and 54% per year. The Durbin h-statistics

gave no indication of serial correlation.

      Given our interest in the poor, we might want to see if the

poverty rate varies in the same way as the share of the bottom quintile.

The same specification would not be appropriate for the official poverty

rate because, unlike the shares data, the poverty data display a

pronounced time pattern. (See Figure 1.) So, instead of just including

a linear time trend, we include two economic variables that are meant to

explain why this time pattern exists. The first is a measure of

government transfers. The rapid expansion in transfer programs since

the mid l960s has been shown to have a significant effect on the poverty

rate. (Gottschalk and Danziger (1984).) To measure this effect, we

include the, ratio of total government transfers to persons, divided by

GNP.9 The second is a measure of where the poverty line is drawn in the

income distribution. As noted above, the poverty line is defined so

that it falls relative to mean income in times of real growth, an effect

that almost by definition will decrease poverty rates. The variable we

use to measure this effect is the poverty line for a family of four,

divided by mean household income. (This is the same variable we plotted

in Figure 2 above.)

      The bottom of Table 2 shows the resulting estimated equations,

explaining poverty rates among all persons and among all families. The

period of estimation starts in 1959, since that is when official poverty

data begin. The inclusion of the additional variables in these

regressions provides a very close fit.      (The R-squared statistics
                                                                        15.

indicate we are able to fit the poverty rate equations far better than

the quintile share equations.) When a time trend is added to these

regressions, it is insignificant. Because the results are so similar

for both regressions, we discuss only the equation for all persons.

         According to these estimates, a 1 point rise in prime-age male

unemployment raises the poverty rate by 0.7 points in the same year. If

the rise in unemployment were sustained, the final net effect would be a

1.1 point rise in the poverty rate.'°

         Here, in contrast to the results for the share of the lowest

quintile, inflation is found to hurt the poor. But the effect of a 1

point rise in inflation is only one-seventh as large as that of a I

point rise in unemployment. Our contention that unemployment, not

inflation, is the "cruelest tax" is supported.

         As expected, increases in transfer programs decrease the poverty

count,    although.   the coefficient on this variab1e is not significant.

According to the regression, decreases in the ratio of the poverty line

to mean income have been a significant factor in redicing the
                                                                   poverty
count.

         The results of this analysis indicate 'that low-income households

should be more concerned with rising rates of unemployment than with

rising rates of inflation, while for high income households the opposite

is true. This conclusion is subject to at least one qualification,

however. High unemployment is, presumably, a transitory phenomenon

whereas the reduction of inflation that it "buys" is presumably

permanent. Hence the poor should balance the large, but temporary,

losses from high unemployment against the small, but permanent, gains

from lower inflation. Clearly, with a low enough discount rate, even
                                                                    16.

the poor will favor using unemployment to fight inflation. However, the

economic behavior of poor people strongly suggests that the discount

rates they use are extremely high.

      If the poor have reason to be more averse to unemployment and less

averse to inflation than the rich, this promises clear conflicts among

various groups in the struggle to determine national macroeconomic

policy. In fact, a recent study by Gramlich and Laren (1984) does find

that low income individuals are more likely to cite unemployment than

inflation as the primary economic problem. This finding echoes the

earlier results of Hibbs (1976), but contradicts Fischer and Huizinga

(1982).




C. FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UNEMPLOYMENT     AND

POVERTY




      Sensible. explanations for the observed relationship between

unemployment and poverty are not hard to find.       This section

investigates various aspects of that relationship in more detail.

First, when the national unemployment rate rises, the unemployment rates

of disadvantaged groups may rise even more. A series of simple

regressions is used to estimate the differential sensitivity of the

unemployment rates of different demographic groups to the business

cycle. Second, many of the poor may not have access to government or

private unemployment insurance arrangements which are designed to offset

losses due to unemployment. We will see to what extent the poor are

included in these programs. Third, some of those who retain their jobs
                                                                      17.

may still suffer lower real wages in times of high Unemployment. We

therefore estimate the behavior of relative wages among demographic

groups over the business cycle.


1. DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSES TO A GENERAL INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT



      We look first at the response of various labor market groups to

changes in the aggregate unemployment rate, We have estimated a variety

of simple regressions of the form:



(4) U =   a   + bt + c1lat + c2I° + dlUt + d2U2 +

                            +        + e,


where as before 1a and 1u denote anticipated and unanticipated
inflation,1' t represents time, U. is the monthly unemployment rate of

group i in time t, U* is •the unemploymen.t rate of prime-age white males

(which we will refer to as "base-level" unemployment),            is the

ratio of the population of group i to the total population, and U_1 is

the lagged dependent variable. This regression is estimated using

monthly data from January 1955 to May 1984.12

      This regression provides a simple way to summarize the sensitivity

of unemployment for each group to base-level unemployment.'3 It also

shows the extent to which nonlinear responses to unemployment occur

(coefficient d2), indicates if inflation affects group-specific

unemployment rates (coefficients c1 and c2), and accounts for general

population shifts between age, race and sex groups (coefficient f)."

      Equation (4) was estimated for every race, sex, and age group.

35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+) and four race/sex catejories (white males,

white females, nonwhite males and nonwhite females), this results in 32

regressions. A full set of regression results is available on request

from the authors, but, in order to avoid inundating the reader with

regression coefficients, we report here only the unemployment and

inflation effects.

      Table 3 shows the sensitivity of each group's unemployment rate to

a one-point rise in base-level unemployment.15 Look first at the

patterns by age. The "all" column (column 1) shows that the sensitivity

of group-specific unemployment rates to the base-level unemployment rate

decreases monotonically as age rises. Unemployment rates aniong teens

rise almost twice as fast as the base rate, while for the elderly

unemployment rates rise slightly more than half as fast. There is quite

a sharp drop in sensitivity after age 65, which probably indicates that

many of these workers simply drop out of the labor force when

unemployment rises, rather than continuing to seek jobs.

      Looking at the patterns by race and sex, there are some striking

differences in the response to general unemployment. Nonwhite males are

clearly the hardest hit. Unemployment rates for 20-24 year old nonwhite

males rise over 3 times faster than base-level unemployment rates. The

 lowest sensitivity among nonwhite males (among 55-64 year old workers)

 is still close to 2. In contrast, white female unemployment is affected

 the least by changes in the general unemployment rate. This almost

 surely reflects the "discouraged worker" effect among women -- a high

 propensity to dropout of the labor market in response to increases in

 unemployment. White males have higher sensitivities than white females,

 but are quite a bit less sensitive than nonwhite males.     Nonwhite

females present a mixed picture. Among teens and older workers,

nonwhite females tend to be less sensitive than men of either race.

Among middle-age groups they are more sensitive than white men but quite

a bit less sensitive than nonwhite men.

       The patterns in these regression coefficients confirm that the

burden of unemployment is distributed unequally across labor market

groups defined by age, race, and sex. To the extent that these

demographic characteristics are consistently correlated with wage levels
--
     younger and older workers earn less, as do nonwhites and females --
these regressions show that certain low income groups are more likely to

experience greater increases in unemployment during recessions.           In

particular, nonwhite workers and young workers are severely affected by

weak labor markets. On the other hand, female workers and older workers

(especially those over 65) -- who are also typically low wage workers --

are not as sensitive to changes in general unemployment levels. This

probably reflects the availability of other income sources for these
workers - -   either   transfers or earnings of other family members --   that
make job search less mandatory, allowing them to drop out of the labor

market more easily in times of high unemployment. In addition, it might

also, reflect the comparative cyclicality of the occupations and

industries in which women tend to work, relative to men.

       These results are quite similar to those of Gramlich and Laren's

(1984) recent research, which studies the burden of unemployment losses

both across and within income classes. They demonstrate that the

probability of unemployment decreases monotonically as income rises,

with nonwhite male-headed households bearing the largest unemployment

burden, female-headed households being least affected, and white males

falling somewhere in between.                  ,

     We turn next to the effect of inflation in these regressions.

Table 4 shows the sensitivity of each group's unemployment rate to a

one-point rise in the anticipated inflation rate,1' since the

coefficient on unanticipated inflation was insignificant in almost every

case and was always small. While the effect of anticipated inflation is

typically quite a bit smaller than that of base-level unemployment, it

nevertheless does have a significant effect on the unemployment rates of

many of these groups.

      The general, pattern of inflation effects across ages can be seen

in column 1, which combines all race and sex groups. Inflation appears

to have a negative effect on teen unemployment, a positive effect on the

unemployment rate of younger workers and a negative effect on the

unemployment rate for older workers. But only for the middle years

(ages 20-44) is the effect significant. This pattern generally repeats

itself in most of the-race and sex-specific results.. White males follow

the pattern exactly (except for a positive and insignificant coefficient

for teenagers). White females show somewhat mixed results, though their

significant coefficients follow the general pattern. Nonwhite male

unemployment is generally unaffected by anticipated inflation. (None of

the coefficients for this group are significant, although the general

pattern of signs is 'consistent with that discussed above.) Finally,

nonwhite females appear to-differ from the general pattern; •at almost

all ages their unemployment rates tend to fall- with increases in

anticipated inflation --   an   effect that is significant and quite large

in a few'categories'.                   .

affect group-specific unemployment rates, given the national

unemployment rate. It appears that workers in their2Os and 30s either

respond differently to high expected inflation rates (perhaps they are

more willing to quit and look for a better job when demand is expected

to be high) or they are employed in a mix of occupations and industries

that have been negatively affected by high inflation rates over this

time period.

      However, the main conclusion of this section is clear: the

business cycle is not neutral in spreading the burden of unemployment.

Certain workers experience much larger increases in unemployment when

the general economy turns down than others.


2. HOW WELL ARE THE POOR PROTECTED AGAINST INCOME LOSSES FROM

UNEMPLOYMENT?



      The fact that certain groups experience higher unemployment than
others    does not in   itself mean, that those groups are disproportionately
harmed.     A variety of government and private programs are explicitly

designed to cushion the impact of unemployment on incmes. The primary

program is Unemployment Insurance (UI), which is available to all

workers in covered industries who have worked a certain length of time

on their job and who are involuntarily terminated. The percentage of

jobs covered by UI expanded steadily from 58% in 1950 to 93% in 1980, as

illustrated in column 1 of Table 5.

         However., many of the unemployed are new entrants or re-entrants

who do not receive UI. Others do not draw benefits because they

quit rather than being fired, because they have not worked long enough

to be eligible for benefits, or because their unemployment spell lasts

longer than their eligibility for benefits. Column 'of Table 5 shows

the ratio of unemployed people receiving UI to the total number of

unemployed. This ratio has fluctuated greatly, reaching a peak of 78%

in 1975, but falling to 43% by 1982. Smeeding (1984) and Burtless

(1983) note that the recent decrease in UI recipiency appears to be due

to legislative changes in both the eligibility rules for extended

benefits in times of high unemployment, and the length of time extended

benefits are available. For example, the maximum duration of UI in 1976

was 65 weeks, but in 1983 it was only 34-55 weeks (depending on the

state.)

      However, while unemployment compensation provides help to many of

the unemployed, it is less likely to be available to the poor or low-

income workers -with whom we are most concerned. Because of the

eligibility requirements, low-wage workers with unstable employment
records - -   those   who -are thost likely, to experience unemployment --   are
least likely to receive UI. The distribution of unemployment benefits

in 1979 by race, sex, and age is presented in Table 6 and compared to

the distribution of total unemployment." It is clear that unemployment

benefits were disproportionately receivedby' whites, males, and prime-

aged workers.1' (The chi-squared statistics in Table 6 reject the

hypothesis that these numbers were chosen from- the same distribution at

a 95% level for all three categories.)

      Private forms of unemployment protection are also available,

primarily to unionized workers. Many union contracts either contain

provisions for supplemental unemployment benefit funds, available to

workers when they are laid off as a supplement to UI, or provide for

severance pay on the part of the employer. In 1980, 47.7% of union

contracts had some such provision, covering 65.2% of unionized workers.

(U.S. Department of Labor (January 1980).)      Unfortunately, this

protection is also less likely to help lower wage workers, primarily

because low-wage jobs are less likely to be unionized. In 1980, while

37% of the workforce earned less than $200/week on their primary job

(approximately $10,000/year for a full-time worker), only 15.2% of all

unionized workers were in this earnings category.   (U.S. Department of

Labor (May 1980).) The bulk of unionized workers who can benefit from

these programs are solidly in the middle-income earning brackets.

      However, while many poor or near-poor workers are not helped by

explicit unemployment protection schemes, there are a variety of

transfer programs available to help low-income households, including

Food Stamps and AFDC. The eligibility requirements for these programs

guarantee that only very low income households qualify. For example, to

be eligible for Food Stamps, a household Scan have nO more than $1500 in

assets (other than a house and car), and its gross income must be no

more than 130% of the poverty line. In addition, some programs are.

simply unavailable to certain households. For example, only half the

states allowed kFDC payments to intact two-parent families in 1983.

      Gramlich and Laren (1984) investigate the extent to which tax and

transfer systems cushion income loss due to unemployment. They find,

not surprisingly, that income changes resulting from a 1% increase in

unemployment are significantly smaller after taxes and transfers than

before. For poor white male-headed households, a 1 percentage point

rise in the unemployment rate produces a 6% income loss, 56% of which is

replaced by tax and transfer changes. For poor nonwhite male-headed

households, the loss is slightly larger (6.2%) and the replacement rate
                                                                      24.

is smaller (40%). For poor female-headed households, the loss is much

smaller (only 2.3% -- as before this group is less affected by

unemployment changes), but the replacement rate is also much lower (just

27%).


3. THE EFFECT OF UNEMPLOYMENT ON THOSE REMAINING EMPLOYED



        There is one final avenue by which unemployment can differentially

affect poor and non-poor workers. Beyond the loss experienced by those

who are directly unemployed, changes in unemployment rates may also

affect the relative earnings of those workers who remain employed. Are

there some groups who gain or lose relative wages during business

cycles?

        To answer this question, we have collected annual data on median

earnings of full-time, full-year workers, by race and sex. We regress

earnings ratios between these groups on the same set of cyclical

economic variables that were used above. The equation is



(5) E.t/E.t = a + bt +    cilat   + c2lut + diu*t +



                   d2U*t2 + f(Uit/U.) + (E1_1/E_1) + e,


where Eit is the earnings of group i (a lower income group) in time t,

    is the earnings of a comparison (higher income) group j,            is

the relevant unemployment ratio for groups i and j, and the other

variables are defined as before. The results from estimating this

      The time trends show that there have been significant shifts in

relative median earnings among groups: nonwhites have improved relative

to whites and nonwhite women have improved relative to all other groups.

But the business cycle seems to have had little effect on the relative

earnings of most of the groups examined here.

      The relative earnings of nonwhite women versus nonwhite men are

unaffected by inflation or unemployment over this time period. The same

is true for nonwhite versus white men.      Increases in base-level

unemployment do appear to raise the earnings of white women relative to

white men, but the magnitude of the effect is small. In contrast, the

cyclical variables have a significant effect on the earnings of nonwhite

versus white women. Nonwhite women lose wages relative to white women

when base-level unemployment rises and they gain a (small) amount

relative to white women when anticipated inflation rises. This is also

the only regression in which the group-specific unemployment ratio

matters.   Its negative coefficient and the significance of other

economic variables perhaps indicate that these two groups are closer

substitutes in the labor market than men versus women or black men

versus white men.

      Thus, while the business cycle has clear distributional effects

via unemployment, it appears to have less significant distributional

effects on the relative earnings of many workers who remain employed.

      In conclusion, it should be clear that unemployment places a

disproportionately heavy burden on low-income households, an impact that

is particularly severe in nonwhite households and among younger workers.

Not only do these lower-income groups show a higher propensity to

experience unemployment, but they are also less likely to receive

payments from Unemployment Insurance and other sources.

D.   FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE NONRELATIONSHIP BETWEEt INFLATION AND

POVERTY




      Why have so many people believed that inflation hurts the poor?

Perhaps the simplest response is just to state that there never was much

solid reasoning behind this belief. For inflation to have negative

effects on the relative position of the poor, either the incomes of the

poor must rise more slowly than other incomes in inflationary times or

the prices of commodities bought by the poor must rise faster than other

prices. Let us examine each of these issues in turn.


1. INFLATION AND THE INCOMES OF THE POOR



      A significant component of income among the poor is government

transfers. While money wages rise more or less proportionately with

prices in the long run, inflation can hurt the poor (relatively) if

transfers do not rise with inflation as quickly as average wages do. To

some extent, this probably occurs --   which may accoun for the positive
coefficients of inflation in the poverty regressions.

      The clearest example of this has occurred in AFDC payments. Table

.8 indicates the extent to which the real value of AFDC benefits (which

are determined largely at the state level) have declined in the last 14

years. Between 1970 and 1983, the median state's maximum payment fell

27% in real terms. For more generous states, it fell only 17%, but for

less generous states, it fell 29%. As Smeeding (1984) notes in looking

at similar numbers through 1981, much of this fall came during the high-

inflation years of the mid-1970s, when states neglected to raise their

benefit levels. The decrease has slowed in recent years.'9

        In contrast to AFDC, most other transfer progrdms are indexed and

therefore have not experienced serious benefit erosion from inflation.

(However, legislative changes in structure and eligibility rules have

produced real changes in participation and benefit levels in some

programs.) SSI's federal minimum required benefit has been fully

indexed, although state supplements have fallen in real value in many

states. Similarly, Food Stamps were fully, indexed to inflation up until

1981, when the Budget Reconciliation Act reduced their indexing

provisions, primarily by delaying the indexing procedures. Social

Security has also been fully indexed (and in some ways over-indexed)

during this period. Thus, AFDC seems to be an exception to the indexing

rule.

        Another way the poor could lose is if inflation tilts the relative

wage structure, raising high wages faster than low wages. This is

especially likely if unanticipated   inflation   occurs and   high   wages are

indexed while low wages are not. We have no direct evidence on the

relative indexation of high versus low wages. However, we do know that

union wages (about half of which are indexed) rose relative to non-union

wages in the inflationary l970s.     (Johnson (1983).) As noted above,

low-wage workers are less likely to be union members, implying that they

were probably on the losing side of this relative wage change.

        However, for those workers who are unionized, union contracts are

typically indexed so that wages rise by a set number of "pennies per

point" as inflation rises, rather than rising by the same percentage as

inflation. The effect of these contracts is to raise the wages of

lower-paid union members by a higher relative percentage than their

better-paid fellow members. (Card (1983).)
                                                                      28.

     A recent study by Hamermesh (1983) found that higher unanticipated

inflation leads to a lower variance of wages across industrial sectors.

Of course, the variance across industrial sectors accounts for only a

small portion of the variance of wages across individuals. But, if this

finding also holds true for the variance of individual wages, it is one

reason to expect the poor to gain (relatively) from unanticipated

inflation.

      Among race and sex subgroups, the regressions reported in Table 7

do not suggest that inflation, whether anticipated or unanticipated,

tilts the relative wage structure very much. As noted above, the only

group for whom inflation effects mattered were nonwhite versus white

women. And in this case, high anticipated inflation increased relative

earnings for nonwhite females. But the magnitude of the effect was

small.

         In sum, the evidence does not suggest that inflation has seriously

lowered the relative income levels of the poor. The relative earnings

of low wage workers do not seem to have fallen with inflation.       Arid


while a few types of transfer income have lost real value, most programs

have been adequately indexed.

2. RELATIVE PRICE CHANGES AND THE POOR



     The other avenue by which the poor could lose from inflation
is if the prices of the things they buy systematically rise
faster than prices in general. This effect would not show up in
our share regressions, which tacitly deflate the nominal incomes
of every group by the same price index.20 However, there does
not seem to be any evidence that this is the case.

     Years ago, Hollister and Palmer (1972) constructed a price

index specific to poor people by reweighting components of the
CPI and found that the poor persons' price index actually grew a

bit slower during the years 1947-1967 than the CPI. Mirer (1975)
used the same technique for the period of the Nixon price

controls (August 1971 to April 1974), and concluded that
inflation for poor people was a bit higher than average. Minarik

(.1980) constructed a necessities index for the period 1970—1979

which showed that prices of necessities rose slightly less than
the overall CPI. In a far more detailed study, Michael (1979)

calculated household—specific CPIs for each of several thousand
consumer units in the 1960-1961 Consumer Expenditure Survey

(CES), and found no systematic relationship between inflatior. and

income class during the 1967-1974 period. When Hagemann (1982)

performed a similar analysis of the 1972—1982 period using data
from the 1972-1973 CES, he found some tendency for poorer

households to experience higher inflation. But the differences
                                                          30.

among income classes were small and not persistent over

different subperiods.
     All in all, these studies suggest that, if there is any

systematic difference between inflation in prices paid by poor
people and overall inflation, it is miniscule.



3.   INFLATION AND THE RICH



     Finally, it is worth noting that what may be the largest
redistributive effect of inflation does not even show up in the
CPS data —- and this effect suggests that it is the rich, not the

poor, who are robbed by inflation.

      Specifically, under conventional accounting procedures
inflation distorts the measurement of property income (interest,

capital gains, etc.). With unindexed tax laws, this leads to high
effective tax rates on real property income (Feldstein (1982)).
Census income includes transfers, but does not deduct income
taxes. Hence, the high tax burden on property income does not
show up in the data we use. The exaggerated interest income does

show up, at least in principle. In practice, however, interest
                                              21
income is grossly underreported in the CPS;        this is

probably not a major problem. Inflation is also bad for the stock

market, whether it is anticipated or unanticipated (Bodie
• (1976)). And unanticipated inflation obviously devastates the

bond market. But capital gains are not included in Census income,

so none of this affects our data.
                                                           31.

      On balance, then, inflation probably has serious deleterious

effects on recipients of property income. But, of course, most of
these recipients live in the upper reaches of the income
distribution. The poor have little to lose.

      A detailed simulation study by Minarik (1979) accounted for
the aforementioned effects of inflation on (more accurately

measured) property income, and concluded that inflation was a
decidedly progressive tax —— even though it appeared to be
regressive relative to Census money income.

      This suggests that the slight equalization of the income
distribution attributed to inflation by our regressions probably

understates the true equalization. No wonder it was upper—income
people who branded inflation "the cruelest tax."




==========================

IV.   TAX POLICY AND THE POOR



      Macroeconomic policy decisions affect the poor in many ways.
Our analysis in the previous section focussed on general cyclical
effects. We concluded that any expansionary policy that

temporarily reduces unemployment at the expense of greater
inflation transitorily raises the income share of the poor and
probably reduces the poverty count.22 Contractionary policies
have the opposite effects.

      But cyclical effects are not the only way in which macro
                                                           32.

policy decisions affect the poor. In this section of the paper,
we abstract from any effects of policy variables on inflation and
unemployment, which depend mainly on the levels of taxation and
spending, and focus instead on how changes in the structure of

taxation over the past 30 years have affected the poor. We
restrict our attention to taxes, rather than to spending
programs, because the latter are covered in detail by other
papers at this conference.
        Naturally, complicated and controversial questions of tax
incidence quickly arise. We cannot hope to resolve these issues
here. All we can do is reveal our assumptions. Our discussion of

the distributional impact of changes in the tax structure is

guided by the following basic incidence assumptions:
             a. Personal taxes (income and payroll) are not shifted
much.

             b. Corporate income taxes are borne by capital as a

whole;
             c. Excise taxes are shared, but most of the burden is
borne by consumers because long—run supply curves for most
commodities are highly elastic.


A. The Changing Structure of Federal Taxation


        Despite much oratory to the contrary, the overall burden of
federal taxes has risen little over recent decades —— from 17.3%

of GNP in 1950 to 18.7% of GNP in 1983. But the Structureof
                                                            33.

federal taxation has changed dramatically. (See Table 9.) Several
developments are noteworthy.

     First, the corporate income tax has fallen in importance

from 34% of federal tax receipts in 1950 to only 7% in 1983, a
process that was accelerated by the Reagan tax cuts of 1981.23

Roughly counterbalancing this decline has been, a rise in the
share of payroll taxes from 12% in 1950 to 38% in 1983. Replacing

corporate income taxes (which are widely believed to be highly

progressive with respect to total income) by payroll taxes has
certainly shifted the tax burden toward the poor --    particularly
the working poor, for whom the payroll tax is often the most
important tax.24

    •Less significantly,'the share of excise taxes, and customs
duties has tumbled from 18% in 1950 to only 7% in 1983. This

development probably increased the progressivity of the federal
tax structure somewhat --   but   not by as much as might be thought
because the particular items taxed by the federal government are
not a random sample of all consumption goods.25

     Finally, the share of personal income taxes in total federal
taxes increased substantially from 1950 to 1970, but has declined
slightly in recent years as a result of the Reagan tax cuts. The
net increase in this share since 1960 is only 2.5 percentage
               ,



points.
     A rough-and-ready way to summarize all this is to group

personal income., corporate income, and estate and gift taxes

together as "progressive taxes" and group excise, customs, and

payroll taxes together as "regressive taxes." If we do this, the
share of progressive taxes in total federal tax receipts is as

follows:

           1950    1960    1970       1980    1983

           70.5%   67.7%   64.0%      60.3%   55.0%

There is a pronounced trend toward less reliance on progressive
taxation.



B. Changes in Tax Provisions Affecting the Poor26


      The numerous changes in the corporate income tax since 1950

are basically irrelevant to the poor (except for general

equilibrium reverberations). Likewise, the numerous changes in
the nature of federal excise taxes and customs duties are too

disparate to permit any useful generalizations. If we want to
discuss the impact of. detailed federal tax provisions on the

poor, there are only two places to look: payroll taxes and
personal income taxes.


The Payroll Tax                   .




     The payroll tax is viewed as highly regressive because it
taxes only earnings, not property income, and because the
marginal tax rate drops to zero once the maximum covered earnings

base is reached. Table 10 shows that maximum taxable earnings

have grown much. faster than average earnings since 1950. While

the working poor have always paid payroll taxes on every dollar

of earnings, over the years a larger and larger fractionof
nonpoor workers have done so as well. In this sense, the payroll

tax is becoming less regressive.27 However, this is little solace
to the poor, since Table 10 also shows that the payroll tax rate
has more than quadrupled since 1950. There is little doubt that
the burden of the payroll tax on the poor has increased

dramatically during the past 35 years.


The Personal Income Tax

     There is much more to be said about the federal personal
income tax. The provisions of the tax that are most relevant to

the poor are the personal exemption, the standard deduction, the
lowest bracket rates, and (since 1975) the earned income credit.
Table 11 contains data pertinent to these provisions.28

     The personal exemption remained at $600 from 1948 through
1969, and thus was steadily eroded by inflation. During the early
1970s, it was raised in stages to $750, where it remained until
1979. Since 1979, it has been fixed at $1000. Thus, except for a

few "blips", the real value of the exemption has fallen steadily
for decades. Table 11 indicates that the real value of the
exemption is now about half what it was in 1955, and has fallen

from 13.6% of median family income to only 4.1%. Since a falling

real exemption reduces the progressivity of the tax at the low

end, this has been bad news for the poor and near poor.

     Instead of raising the exemption, Presidents Ford and Carter

used a per capita tax credit to ease the tax burden on the poor.

        The credit was $30 per person in 1975 and the greater of $35 per
        person or 2% of taxable income (to a maximum of $180) for

        1976-1978; then Congress eliminated it. Notice that a $35 tax
        credit is equivalent to a $250 rise in the exemption for someone
        in the 14% tax bracket, but only to a $70 rise in the exemption
        for someone in the 50% bracket. So substituting a tax credit for

        an exemption is one way to increase the progressivity of the tax
        structure. But the experiment was short-lived.

             The lowest bracket rate was 17.4% in 1950 and rose to 22.2%
•




        by 1952; since then it has mostly fallen, and is now only 11%.
        This decline in the lowest bracket rate has helped reduce the
    •

        burden of personal income taxation on poor families.
            •The standard deduction stood at 10% of adjusted gross income

        until 1969; then was gradually increased to $2300 for an
        individual or $3400 for a married couple in 1979, where it has

        remained. Inflation, of course, has reduced the real value of the
        standard deduction substantially since 1979. But this is a minor
        setback when set against the fact that the introduction of a
        large flat standard deduction in 1977 (called the "zero bracket

        amount") completely removed many poor and near—poor people from
        the income tax rolls.

             One meaningful way to amalgamate all these factors is to
        construct hypothetical, but representative, low-income families,
        and look at their income tax burdens under different tax
        structures. Table 12 considers three such cases.

             The first case is one of abject poverty: a family of four

for the suggestion.

whose 1983 income is $5000 (about half the 1983 poverty line),

and whose income in earlier years is the same in real terms. Such

a family would never have been subject to income taxation; but
starting in 1975 it would have received a 10% negative tax rate
owing to the earned income credit. Over the entire 1955—1983

period, this family's total (income plus payroll) tax burden
changed little. The burden rose from 1955 to 1965, fell from
1965 to 1975, and has risen slightly since then.

       The second case is a family of four whose earnings are

exactly equal to the poverty line. The income tax burden on this
family was negligible in 1955, became negative thanks to the
earned income credit (EIC), but has lately risen to 3.1%.. When
coupled with the rising burden of the payroll tax, this family
has paid an increasing share ófits earnings in taxes since 1955
and the rate of increase has been extremely rapid in recent

years. Currently, such a family pays 16.5% of its earnings in
federal taxes.

       The third case is a family that earns half the median income
-- an amount suggested by some observers as a good definition of

relative poverty (Fuchs (1967)). This income level ranges from
$12,290 in 1983 down to $2,209 in 1955 (all in nominal dollars)
——   which places the hypothetical family 20—25% above the official
poverty line in recent years. At this income level, the average

income tax rate has crept steadily upward. Specifically, it was
zero under the 1955 tax law, rose to 3% by 1965 as the real value

of the personal exemption declined, and rose further to about 4%
                                                          38.

in 1975—1980 despite the earned income credit and the flat $3400
standard deduction. In 1983 it was 5%•29 When the payroll tax
is included, the overall tax burden on this hypothetical family
has risen astronomically since 1955.

     Overall, we conclude from these examples that the poor and

the near poor have never paid much in the way of personal income
taxes. Taking the 1955-1983 period as a whole, income tax

reductions for the very poor have amounted, to about 10% of
earnings, thanks to the earned income credit. This tax cut
roughly balanced the increase in their payroll taxes. For a

near—poor family earning half the median income, however,
personal income tax reductions (such as the minimum standard

deduction) were not large enough to counteract the effects of
inflation. From 1955 until 1980, the burden of both income an4
payroll taxation on such a family has grown.


C. The Changing Structure of State and Local Taxation



     Between 1950 and 1970, state and local taxes grew much
faster than GNP and much faster than federal taxes. (See Table

13; addendum items.30) The structure of taxation at the state and

local level was also transformed, as Table 13 indicates. Personal
income and. payroll taxes are now much more important sources of

revenue than they were in 1950. Sales taxes are slightly more
important. The big shrinkage came in property taxes and

miscellaneous "other taxes." A (very) rough summary of Table 13
                                  TABLE 13

would say that the share of personal income taxes increased by
about as much as the share of property taxes decreased.

     As late as 1960 only a few states had personal income taxes,

now 40 states plus the District of Columbia and a number of other
large cities have them. With so many different taxes, we cannot

profitably examine changes in tax provisions over time, as we did
for the federal personal income tax. However, most state income
taxes have a progressive rate structure; top marginal rates go as
high as 17.6% (the top rate in Minnesota). Most also have a
substantial zero bracket amount which effectively removes the

very poor from the tax rolls. Thus, although the incidence of the
property tax is highly controversial, it seems unlikely that the
shift from property taxation to income taxation has increased the
overall regressivity of the state and local tax structure, and
may perhaps have decreased it.31

    Where the very poor are concerned, however, income taxes are
pretty much irrelevant; it is sales and payroll (and perhaps
property) taxes that matter. Over the 1950-1983 period, the poor
have paid higher state and local sales taxes and higher state
(and in some cases local) payroll taxes. Thus it seems likely
that the state and local tax burden on the poor has increased.




D. Conclusion cr1 Taxes



     In sum, where the poor are concerned, the main "event" in
                                                             40.

postwar tax history seems to have been the rapid and continuing

growth of the payroll tax. Changes in personal income taxation
have been minor for the very poor, as the earned income credit
and the flat standard deduction more or less cancelled out the

effects of a declining real personal exemption. But the
not-so-poor have paid higher income taxes as well.
     One crude way to summarize all this is to amalgamate all
state, local, and federal taxes (omitting "other". state and local

taxes), and classify them into "progressive" and "regressive"
groups as we did for federal taxes. The uncertainty concerning

the correct classification of the property tax leads us to

calculate these numbers two ways. Specifically, the fraction of
all taxes categorized as progressive is:
                    1950      1960     1970        1980      1983


If property tax      68.2%     64.8%       61.5%     58.1%     53.2%
is progressive
If property tax      56.8%     52.0%       48.1%     49.0%     43.6%
is regressive

Although the levels differ consistently by 9—13 percentage
points, each calculation displays a roughly equivalent trend away
from reliance on progressive taxes since 1950. These numbers
reinforce the conclusion of this entire section that the tax
burden on the poor has become greater in recent years.

                        V. THE LAST DECADE


     The distribution of income has undeniably widened in the last

decade. The shares of the bottom three quintiles have declined while

the shares of the top two have risen. (See columns 1 and 2 of Table

14.) A number of detailed studies have attempted to understand how cuts

in social programs, changes in tax rates, and other factors have

affected the incomes of various groups. Levy and Michel (1983) have

investigated the changes in income distribution, between 1979 and 1983,

noting the skewness of the tax and benefit cuts. A series of studies by

the Congressional Budget Office (1983, 1984a) has produced similar

numbers, as has analysis by Danziger and Smolensky (1983).

      In contrast to these detailed studies, this section will estimate

the influence of the business cycle on poverty rates and income shares

in the last.decade without focussing on the particular structural routes

through which these effects might have occurred. We will compare these

estimated effects with the.actual changes that occurred to see if other

factors have offset the purely cyclical impacts.

      Using the regression results reported in Table 2, we can estimate

the effects of inflation and unemployment on income shares and poverty

rates between 1973 and 1983 as follows. We first calculate a

"noricyclical" income share (or poverty rate) for 1983 by holding

inflation and unemployment constant at their 1973 levels.    (For the

poverty equation, we also remove cyclical effects from Transfers/GNP and

from Poverty Line/Mean Income by trend-lining these variables between

1973 and 1983.) We then compare this noncyclical share to the observed

 income share to isolate the effects of cyclical conditions. Finally, we
                                                                     2.
decompose this difference into the portions due to changes in

unemployment and to changes in inflation over the decade.32 The results

are displayed in Table 14. Comparison of columns 1 and 3 indicates how

the income distribution would have changed if no cyclical effects had

occurred. The difference between columns 2 and 3 (shown in column 4)

indicates the magnitude of the cyclical effects.

       Before looking at these results, we need to comment on the size of

the effects we are discussing. A change of less than 1% in the income

share of any group may appear to be a rather small change. But in a

historical context, even changes of this magnitude are unusual. For

example, the postwar high and low for the share of the lowest quintile

are respectively 5.6% in 1968 and 4.7% in 1983. Viewed against this

background, the .8 percentage point drop that has occurred within the

last 10 years is quite a dramatic change.

       The upper part of Table 14 shows the change in. actual income share

for each quintile over the last decade and indicates the estimated

effect of unemployment and inflation on that share. The basic story

told by these numbers is this. Between 1973 and 1983 the impact of

inflation and unemployment (particularly unemployment) widened the

income distribution. But these cyclical effects were partially offset

by structural changes that our equations do not capture (except by a

time trend.) Thus, if no.cyclical effects had occurred the income

distribution would have narrowed slightly.

       The lowest quintile, in which we are most interested, would have

experienced a rising income share if no cyclical effects had occured --

its   1973 share would have risen to 5.7% in 1983. However, the combined

effects of unemployment and inflation lowered this by .96 points, which

    resulted in an observed income share of 4.7% in 1983. This same pattern

    occurred even more strongly in the second quintile. The cyclical

    variables lowered the income share by 1.22 points, which was somewhat

    offset by a gain of .42 points due to otherfactors. This same pattern

    prevails for the third quintile, but is reversed in the fourth and fifth

    quintiles. For the upper income groups, the net effect of inflation and
•
    unemployment is to raise the income share. Without these effects,

    almost no change would have occured (the fourth quintile would have

    gained .07 points and the fifth quintile would have lost .04 points).

    Note that unemployment consistently has a larger effect than inflation

    on all of these income share changes.

          Finally, turn to the b'ottom of Table 14, in which the effects of

    economic variables on the poverty rate are presented. The story for the

    poverty count is somewhat different. Had no cyclical effects occurred

    over the decade, the -poor would have fallen from 11. 1% to 10. 7% of the

    population.    However, unemployment during this decade had a large

    effect on the poverty count, raising it by 5.01 percentage points. On

    the other hand, the decrease in inflation rates over the decade would

    have lowered the poverty rate by .61 points: Cyclical effects in the

    other variables had almost no effect on the poverty count.     As the

    studies cited above have shown, the poverty population appears to have

    been particularly hard hit, by the high unemployment rates during this

    last decade.

VI. Looking Ahead


     Examining the future can be more fun that examining the

past; you are less constrained by the facts. This section uses
the equations estimated in Section III, in conjunction with

macroeconomic forecasts for the balance of the decade, to project
the poverty rate and the quintile shares of the income
distribution into the future.
     Since no one knows what the future will bring and, in

particular, no one can foresee the timing of recessions well in.

advance, it is prudent to consider a range of possibilities. We
therefore project the evolution of poverty and income
distribution under three different scenarios. (See Table 15.)
        *   Our "Noncyclical" scenario is the August 1984
projection of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO is
careful to say that their numbers represent genuine forecasts for
(the balance of) 1984 and for 1985, but only projections assuming

"moderate noncyclical growth at rates approximating average
postwar economic performance" for subsequent years.
        *   Past history suggests that it is most unlikely for the
economy to grow steadily for seven years without a recession.
Hence our second scenario ("Recession! Recovery") reaches the
same level of unemployment by 1989 as the CBO projection, but has

        the, economy experience a moderate recession (in 1986—1987) along

        the way. As a consequence, inflation runs subs€antially lower in

        the later years of the projection.33
                *   Our third scenario is "Pessimistic." It has the
        unemployment rate stall out at 7% in 1985 and remain there

        through 1989.
             Table 16 shows the projected poverty rate for all persons
        and the shares of. each quintile under the -three alternative

        macroeconomic scenarios.34 The projections say that the share of
        the bottom quintile (which is now near its historic low) will
        rise and the share of the top quintile (which is near its

        historic high) will fall. The magnitudes depend somewhat on

        macroeconomic conditions, being slightly larger under the CBOs
        "noncyclical" forecast than under either of the less sanguine.

        alternatives.. Under the CBO forecast, the poor gain 0.6 of a

        percentage point and -the rich lose 0.8. As noted previously, this
        would constitute a sizable redistribution by historical
        standards.

             Projected movements in the poverty rate over the balance of

        the 1980s are also quite optimistic, and not terribly sensitive
    •
        to macroeconomic conditions (within the range considered). Under
•



        the "noncyclical" forecast, the poverty rate falls to 11.1%

        (roughly its historic low) as the recovery continues. But, if the
        "pessimistic" scenario is more accurate, the decline will be only

        to 11.5%. This difference is minor compared to the projected

        decline in poverty.35                  •

Note: In all simulations, the poverty line for a family of four is assumed
to remain at 34%. In the noncyclical simulation, transfers are assumed to
remain at 12% of GNP even though the economy recovers. In the other
simulations, transfers are adjusted tO reflect the historical relationship
between transfers and unemployment.
                                                             46.

     The basic reason is clear. Most macro forecasters expect
the unemployment rate in 1989 to be well below the 1983 rate. If

this proves to be true, then, according to our regressions, the
income distribution should become more equal and the poverty
count should fall substantially. However, if bad luck (or bad
policy) leads to much worse macroeconomic conditions, the poverty
rate will not fall this much.
     In addition to these cyclical effects, it seems likely that

there will be increases in federal taxes, •perhaps large ones,

between now and 1989. The form these increases will take is
highly uncertain. So we can do no more than speculate on how
these fut,ure tax increases will bear on the poor.

     To date, most of the tax increases enacted since the 1981
tax-cutting binge have been aimed at corporate taxes or at tax

loopholes that mainly benefit the rich. If we get more of the
same, then the coming tax increases will be mostly irrelevant to

the poor.

     Indexing the personal income tax, which begins in 1985, will
help the poor by halting the inflationaEy erosion of the real
value of the personal exemption and the zero bracket amount

(standard deduction).

     Another widely-discussed proposal is to replace our present
personal income tax with an "almost flat" tax with very little

rate graduation. At the top end of the income distribution, such
a change would almost certainly reduce progressivity. At the

bottom, however, things are less certain ——   everything   depends on
                                                                    47.
how large the personal exemption would be. A per capita exemption

of $2500 to $3000 (in 1983 dollars) would keep most of the poor

and near-poor off the income tax rolls. Any smaller exemption
would make the "flat tax" bear much more heavily on the poor than
the present income tax does.

     Finally, the social security payroll tax, the nemesis of the
working poor for decades, is scheduled to rise in stages from its
14% current (1984) rate to 15.3% in 1990. Thus rising payroll

taxes will continue to burden the working poor, just as they have
in the past.




VII. SUMMARY OF MAJOR CONCLUSIONS
== == ==== = = = == ==== = === == === = ===== =

       According to an old cliche now enjoying a revival, a rising
tide raises all boats. Our paper confirms this view, and points

out that the smallest boats get raised the most (relatively).

Conversely, however, they also fall the most when the tide ebbs
-- a point to be kept in mind when the unemployed are drafted to

fight the war on inflation.
       *   The findings reported here, plus a considerable volume of

past research by many economists, support the idea that both the
poverty count and the share of the lowestquintile of income
recipients move significantly over the business cycle.

       For example, according to our estimates in Table 2, a
                                                                    o.

1.   An article entitled "Trickle Down Peters Out" was quickly followed
      by an article entitled "Has Trickle Down Petered Out?"

2. The U.S. poverty line is indexed each year to the Consumer Price
     Index and is thus an absolute poverty standard in real terms.

3. We will not enmesh ourselves here in the argument over whether an
     absolute or relative poverty line is a "better" definition.

4. Blank finds that women's wages -- both for female heads. and for
     working wives of heads -- are far less procyclical than men's
     wages. In addition, the evidence indicates that wives show strong
     countercyclicality in both their labor force participation rates
     and in the weeks and hours that they work: This effect is
     strongest among wives of upper income households, but appears among
     low income wives also. The net effect among working wives is a
     strong countercyclical response to economic growth, somewhat
     offsetting the procyclicality of the head's (the husband's)
     earnings.  However, this effect has less impact for poor
     households, since only about a third of the poor households contain
     married couples.

5. In most of their equations, dummy variables allow for a shift in the
     constant and the time trend in 1958. One possible reason is that
     post-1957 shares are computed from micro data while pre-1958 shares
     are estimated from grouped data.

6. This result is consistent with the recent finding by Gramlich and
     Laren (1984) that as unemployment rates rise an increasing share of
     the population experiences large losses.

7. Specifically, the annual inflation rate was explained by 5 lags of
     itself, supplemented by variables for price controls. We also use
     the Consumer Price Index, rather than the GNP deflator, to be
     consistent with some monthly regressions reported later in this
     paper.

8. Dummy variables for the pre-1958 years, not shown in the table or in
     equation (3), were also used.

9. Of course, a large amount of these government transfers do not go to
     the poor but to lower- or middle-income households. However, total
     government transfers divided by GNP still provides a measure of the
     extent to which our country has decided to devote resources to
     redistributive programs, most of which have at least some effect on
     poor households.

10. Of course, the rise in unemployment should not be sustained
      indefinitely. In the long run, the economy should return to its
     natural rat of unemployment.           .
                                                                   51.

11.   The equation that estimates monthly anticipated inflation includes
       11 monthly dummy variables, 12 lags, and a series of variables
       allowing for price control effects. Its general form is similar
       to that used in Blinder and Newton (1981).

12. This sort of regression is very similar to those run earlier by
       Gramlich (1974).

13. Some workers leave the labor market entirely in response to higher
       aggregate unemployment rates, thus lowering the reported
       unemployment in their race/sex/age group. The change in group-
       specific unemployment is therefore the difference between the
       total employment change and this labor supply effect.    The
       regressions we report do not distinguish between participation
       rate changes and employment changes.

14. Population ratios are omitted in aggregate equations since
       male/female and nonwhite/white. ratios have changed little during
       this period. However, significant changes in the age composition
       of the populatiQn have occured. Population ratios are included in
       all age-specific regressions to control for this "cohort size".
       effect.

15. The sensitivity effect reported here is the marginal effect of
      base-level U* on U... This is often referred to as the "steady
      state effect." Usjig the coefficients defined in equation (4),
        the reported sensitivities in Table 3 are Cd1 +
      - 2d2U*(mean))/(1_g). There isno simple way to calcu4ate standard
       er.,.ors for this sensitivity.' The underlying coefficients on
       unemployment Cd1) are significant in all regressions, and 'the
       coefficients on 0*2 and the lagged dependent variable Cd2 and g)
       are significant in almost all the equations.

16. As in Table 3, this is the marginal effect of antLcipated inflation
       on U.. Using the coefficients defined in equation (4), the
       repo'ed sensitivities in Table 4 are c1/(l-g). There is no
       simple way to calculate the standard eLror for this term.
       Significance levels on the coefficient c1 are indicated in Table
       4.


17. These data, in contrast to those reported in Table 5, show only the
      distribution of state-run UI programs and do not include the
      additional special programs footnoted in Table 5.

18. No clear trends in these age, race, or sex 'differentials between
      the insured and uninsured unemployed were visible in the l970s.
      Unfortunately, the Employment and Training Administration of the
      BLS stopped publishing age, race or sex breakdowns, for UI
      recipients in 1979, so more recent data are not available.

19. The slowdown in inflation, combined with a levelling off of
      caseload growth, seems to have led many states finally to enact
       increases in benefit levels.

20. Quintile shares are essentially relative mean nominal
   incomes. They are also relative mean real incomes if the
   proper deflators are the same for all groups. If the true
   deflator for the incomes of the poor rises faster than the
   CPI, then the share of the poor in real income is below their
   share in nominal income.

21. The Bureau of the Census estimates that only 44% of dividend
    and interest income is reported in the CPS. See Current
    Population Reports, Series P-60, No. 145, August 1984.
22. Recall that according to our poverty regressionshigher
    inflation raises poverty (a little). If the Phillips curve is
    steep enough, riding up the Phillips curve might, according
    to these regressons, raise poverty. But short—run Phillips
    curves are generally quite flat.
23. These calculations deduct payments by the Federal Reserve
    System to the Treasury from corporate tax receipts. In recent
    years, these payments have constituteda nontrivial share of
    total corporate tax receipts, as measured in the national
    income accounts.

24. A possible opposing view is that most of the payroll tax is
    used to finance retirement annuities which are then
    distributed according to a progressive formula. In this case,
    the payroll tax is not a tax.

25. According to Pechman (1983, p. 192), federal excise taxes are
    regressive, but not as regressive as a general sales tax of
    equal yield.
26. Most of the information on changes in the tax code found in
    this subsection and the next comes from the appendixes to
    Pechman (1983).
27. In the limit, as the ratio of maximum covered earnings to
    average earnings approaches infinity, the payroll tax becomes
    a proportional tax on earnings.

28. The years selected differ from those used in other tables
    because these years represent significant landmarks in tax
    history: there was a major tax overhaul of the tax code in
    1954; 1965 marked the full effect of the Kennedy-Johnson tax
    cuts; the personal exemption was gradually increased in the
    1970s and the earned income credit was instituted in 1975;
    1980 is the last year before the Reagan tax cuts; and 1983 is
    the most recent available year.

29. Moon and Sawhill (1984, p. 326) observe that the lowest
    quintile of families gained essentially nothing from the
    Reagan income tax cuts.
                                                        53.

30. Data in the table include only tax receipts. Grants from the
   federal government and nontax receipts, both of which are
   substantial sources of revenue, are excluded.

31. We cannot easily classify state and local taxes into
    "progressive" and "regressive" groups as we did for federal
    taxes, because everything depends on how we treat the
    property tax. If the property tax is viewed as progressive,
    then the overall state—local tax structure is only slightly
    less progressive than the federal tax structure and also
    displays a trend toward diminishing progressivity. But, if
    the property tax is regressive,then the state-local tax
    structure is very regressive and displays a trend toward
    diminishing regressivity.
32. These calculations are complicated by the presence of the
    lagged dependent variable in the equation. To calculate the
    components of'the 1983 share due to unemployment or
    inflation, we calculated the cumulative effect of these
    variables from 1973—1983.

33. Inflation projections are adjusted to correspond to
    unemployment projections according to a rule of thumb by
    which 1 percentage point of additional unemployment for a
    year lowers inflation by 1/2 point.
34. The unemployment projections in Table 1.4 are for total
    civilian unemployment, whereas our regressions require the
    unemployment rates for prime-age males and prime-age white
    males. To bridge the gap, we estimated annual regressions
    relating these specific unemployment rates to the overall
    civilian unemployment rate. The unemployment rate of
    prime—age males is projected to run about 2 percentage points
    below the civilian unemployment rates shown in Table 14. The
    unemployment rate of prime—age white males is projected to
    run a few tenths of a point lower.

35. The forecast for 1984 is that the poverty rate will f all to
    13.5%——a very large drop.
