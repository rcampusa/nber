                  CAUSALITY AND INNOVATIONS BETWEEN
                    FERTILITY AND INFANT MORTALITY

                              ABSTRACT



        The main issue of this paper is to study the sign and

direction of causality between two demographic variables —

the   fertility rate and the infant mortality rate — by using
time series methodology. It is shown that a fall in fertility
will decrease infant mortality below its normal level. It is
also shown that fertility and infant mortality are not mutually
independent but jointly determined. Therefore, when one constructs
a model of the relationship between fertility and infant mortality,
it is suggested that one should estimate a fertility equation in
which infant mortality rate is an endogenous variable in

a simultaneous equations system and vice versa.

                CAUSALITY AND INNOVATIONS BETWEEN

                  FERTILITY AND INFANT MORTALITY

      The relationship between fertility and infant mortality
plays an important role both in the Malthusian theory of population
and in the modern economic theory of population. In the Malthusian
theory an increase in the fertility rate is expected to cause an
increase in the infant mortality rate with a lag. In the modern
economic theory a reduction in the infant mortality rate is expected
to have an impact on the fertility rate with a lag, although
the sign of the relationship is ambiguous. These two theories

suggest the relationship between fertility and infant mortality
reflects lagged causality in both directions. Therefore, it is

natural to apply time—series causality tests developed by Granger
and Sims to fertility and infant mortality. The importance of
such a study is underscored by Williams (1975) who states:

"those who seek to explain fertility treat mortality as an exogenously
given explanatory variable. On the other hand, those who seek to

explain mortality view fertility as an exogenously given independent
variable."    Hence, many existing estimates of fertility demand
functions and infant survival production and demand functions are

marred by simultaneous equation bias.
                                —2—


        In this paper, I apply time series causality tests to
 annual data for the United States, the Netherlands, Japan, and

 Israel. The observation periods are: l920—f979 for the United
States; 1936—1974 for the Netherlands; 1947—1977 for Japan; and
1940-1974 for Israel. It may be argued that such a study may be
more relevant to underdeveloped countries.
                                              But, although infant
mortality rates are relatively low in the four countries at issue,
they have not reached some "minimum level."
                                               In particular, infant
mortality rates in these four countries have fallen rapidly, even
in the last part of the period at issue. The infant mortality rate
in the United States declined at an annually compounded rate of

4.4 percent per year from 1964 to 1977, according to Grossman and

Jacobowitz (1981). The infant mortality rates in the Netherlands
and Japan declined about 54 percent and 73 percent from 1955 to 1974,
                2
respectively.

       The four countries are selected for study because they exhibit

some similarities butalso exhibit some interesting differences.
Currently all four countries can be characterized as developed
economies, but the United States and the Netherlands were at more

advanced stages of development at the beginning of the period than
Japan and Israel. The Netherlands is a more homogeneous country
than the United States. It has already been indicated that infant

mortality rates have declined dramatically in all four countries.
                              —3—



On the other hand their fertility rates have exhibited somewhat

different patterns. The fertility rate in the United States
reached about 123 per 1,000 women aged l5—44 in 1957 and fell
rapidly since, to 68 in 1974. The rate in the Netherlands has
ranged between 65 and 80 per 1,000 women aged 10—49 from 1950
through 1970. In Japan, the fertility rate surprisingly declined
from about 109 per 1,000 women aged 10—49 in 1947 to about 51 in
1961 and then slightly increased except 1966 (the year named
"Hinoeuma").    As an exceptional example, the fertility rate in
Israel increased from about 94 per 1,000 women aged 10—49 in 1955 to
97 in 1974. These similarities and differences should be useful in

illuminating   the nature of the relationship between fertility
and infant mortality.

       One may treat infant mortality as one of the nonmarket goods

produced according to a given household production function by
using parents' time and market goods as the inputs (Becker and
Lewis 1974; De Tray 1974; and Willis 1974). The degree to which
each infant in the household is exposed to its death might depend

on the parents' prenatal care as well as the care after its birth.

The parents can, by devoting time and medical care and providing
nutritious food to children, improve their health status.
The amounts they can afford to allocate depend on income and costs,
                               —4—



e.g., husband's and wife's wage rates, medical cost and the price
of food. Hence, they can directly influence the level of children's
health through their employment and consumption decisions.     Also,
children's health is indirectly influenced by government programs
such as subsidized medical care and family planning (Grossman and

Jacobowitz 1981) and the envirojnentaj. conditions in which the parents

and their children live, e.g., sanitation, water supply, transportation,
urbanization and so on (Eutz, Davanzo, and Habicht 1982). These
above points will explain why infant mortality, in addition to
fertility, should be considered as a nonmarket good, which is

jointly determined with fertility by household behavior.

A recent population study by Eckstein, Schultz and Wolpin (1981)
indicates that fertility and infant mortality were causally related
with each other in Swedish data during the period of 1870 — 1955,

reflecting less significant influence on those demographic variables
of economic and meteorological variables.

       In general, the explanations of causality from infant
mortality to fertility are based on economic, biological, and
psychological reasons. In the modern economic theory of population,

i.e., the theory of household production, a particular household
utility function is assumed to consist of its desired number of
surviving children and a vector of consumption goods in the household.
                               —5—



The desired number of surviving children is the product of number

of births and the survival probability during a given period.
This theory predicts that, if the parents can revise their desired

number of surviving children in response to a reduction in infant
mortality, whether they increase (or decrease) their number    of
births will depend on their own gross price elasticity of demand

for surviving children. Therefore, the sign of association
between fertility and infant mortality is ambiguous. In their

response to a fall in infant mortality rate, the parents may use
hoarding and replacement strategies to attain their desired
number of surviving children. Olsen (1980) found direct replacement
of modest magnitude for the Colombian data and indicated that
each death produces 0.2 new births on the average while fertility

hoarding may raise the total fertility to roughly one-half birth

per death.
       From a biological perspective, in a society in which a large

number of mothers breast—feed their children, a reduction in infant
mortality makes the period of mother's lactation longer, and

as the consequence, delays the next conception (Heer 1966; Heer
 and Smith 1968; Knodel 1968; and Preston 1978) .   From a psychological

 perspective, people in a given society may desire to reduce their
 family size in the process of social and economic development.
 Davis (1945) explains the effect of economic development on
                               —6—



 the family size such that as the economy develops, people in
the society become competitive and individualistic in the urban
society. A large family can be considered to be, not a
                                                       blessing,
but a handicap. Consequently, parents have an incentive to reduce

their fertility in accordance with their optimal family size as
the infant mortality rate falls due to the economic development.
Lee (1981) found, in the English vital rates from 1540 to 1840,
that marital fertility fluctuations
                                    were substantially explained
by the fluctuations in mortality, temperature,
                                                and prices (wheat
prices as the indicator of economic conditions)

       On the other hand, causality from fertility to infant
mortality can be explained on biological and economic grounds.
For example, when fertility rates are relatively high, there may

be relatively large percentage of high risk births. These include
births to young mothers and old mothers, fourth and higher—order

births, illegitimate births, and low birth—weight births. Also,
successive births in a relatively short period will weaken
the mother and influence the physical constitution of children

(Knodel 1968). Therefore, an infant born soon after the birth of
a sibling is exposed to a higher risk of infant mortality because
of the inadequate care of the physically weak mother during

the critical period of infancy. Finally, based on economic reasons,
                                 —7—



parents with many children may allocate fewer resources, including

their own time and purchased goods, to each child than parents with

less children, ceteris paribus. Therefore, as Heer (1966) states,
the more children per household the poorer their nutrition will be,

ceteris paribus. Consequently, higher fertility in the household
will result in higher infant mortality. This same argument can be
also found in Maithus's "First Essay on Population."

          All these above arguments give some apriori explanations of
the direction of relationship between fertility and infant mortality.
They do not, however, necessarily determine whether the researchers
in this field treat       the fertility rate and the infant mortality
rate purely as either exogenous or endogenous variable in their
models because population studies have not yet established dynamic

relationships between fertility and infant mortality in a given
system.

          Section I descibes briefly the statistical technique of
Granger's causality test and the statistical method to observe
dynamic relationships between variables. Section II reports
the empirical results. Finally, section III gives a summary of
the findings of this study.

I,,   STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES OF CAUSALITY TEST

Granger (1969), Sims (1972), and Haugh (1976) have developed
different statistical techniques to identify causality within
a two—variable model. Their papers have sparked many empirical
studies in the area of macroeconomics. 6

          Granger (1969) defines causality between two stationary
stochastic time series, X(t) and Y(t), within a set of information
in the universe as follows: A time series X causes another time
series Y if the current value of Y is more accurately predicted

by using the information which includes at least the own—past
series of Y and the past series of X, than by using the informa.-

tion which excludes the past series of X.

          According to my preliminary work, it is suggested that
the time series of the fertility rate, F(t), and the infant

mortality rate, 14(t), be transformed to their stationary series,
FE(t). and 140(t) .                 by using a logarithmic specifica-
tion with no difference of the model and also by including
a constant and a linear trend in equation.      By following
Granger's definitions (Granger 1969; and Granger and Newbold
1977) ,   I   estimate the following linear regressions of FE(t) and
NOR) on lagged FEs and lagged MOs in a system:      8

where tb,    ti, •i'       o'   '     t1' andt          are the least—square

      and n are the lengths of lag distributions; Dl is a dummy
variable for the period during World War II and D2 is a dummy
variable for certain periods after the War; and                    T is a linear

time trend.

          In order to identify the causality from MO to FE
in equation (1), the null hypothesis is that the set of

parameters bk(s), s=l,2,...,ni, should be zero if there is no

causality from MO1 to FE1. By the same manner, for the test
of the causality from FE1 to MCi in equation (2), the set of
parameters d(s), s=l,2,...,n1, should be zero if there is no

causality from FE to MO1. MO1 in equation (1) and FE in
equation (2) are called             causal variable in their respective

equations.
                              — 10 —




       With respect to dynamic relationships between variables,
Sims (1980) indicates that the estimated coefficients on

successive lags in vector autoregressive models include

complicated cross—equation feedbacks and, hence, the summing
the distributed lagged coefficients is quite misleading.
Instead, an alternative method is to estimate the moving average
representation (MAR) in the system. 10

       Consider an q x 1 vector stationary stochastic time
series X(t) in the vector autoregressive representation (VAR)

with a finite lag specification in a system, e.g., equations

(1) and (2). Let 2(t) represent the best linear forecast of
X(t) based on its past series X(t — s)       ,   S ' 0.   Then,
the innovation in X(t), V(t), is defined as


                     V(t) =   x(t)   —   2(t).                    (3)



Given that (t) is a linear combination of past values of X(t),
V(t) is also a linear combination of current and past values of
X(t) for all t and V(t) is serially uncorrelated.

       The general form of equation (3) is expressed as follows:


                    G(L) X(t) =      V(t),                        (4)
                                    — 11 —




where G(L) = G0L°    -
                         G1L1
                                -   ... -     and L is the lag operator
defined as L1X(t) =      X(t-1).     The q x 1 vector of variables
in the system may be decomposed of an m x 1 vector of ertdogenous
variables —   the   fertility rate and the infant mortality rate,

and an n x 1 vector of exogenous variables —         precipitation   and

temperature (Eckstein, Schultz, and Wolpin 1981).
       After estimating the G's with appropriate lag distributions

in equation (4), X(t) in equation (4) can be expressed as
a linear combination of innovations V(t—s), s 0, i.e.,
the moving average representation (MAR) such as:



                         X(t) =EF(s)V(t-s).                      (5)




According to Sims (1978) and EcIcst!in, Schultz, and Wolpiri (1981),
if components of V are contemporaneously correlated, it is not
possible to partition the variance of X into pieces accounted for
by each innovation. Therefore, ab orthogonalizing transformation
to V in equation (5) is required to obtain U(t) = T V(t), where
T is a lower triangular matrix with zero elements above

the diagonal elements, to make the covariance matrix of U(t)

the identity matrix.            Then, equation (5) can be written
as follows:
                                  — 12 —




                           00

                  X(t) =   ____ F(s) TU(t-s).           .   (6)
                           s=O
Given the above equation (6), a particular i-th estimated
equation of X(t) in the form of MAR is expressed as follows:




                  X.(t)                    e..(t-s)         (7)
                           j:l

where there are q (—m+n) different components of e's. In this
study, q =   2: the innovation in fertility rate and the innovation
in infant mortality rate. In equation (7), the sum of
estimated coefficients of the j—th component of f(s) from s = 0
to s = k represents the cumulative responses in the k+l step—ahead

forecast of X., which is accounted for by the innovation in
                                                                  X.
For the sign of association between fertility and infant mortality,
I present the results of cumulative responses in three, five, and

eight years ahead to an initial one—standard—deviation shock in
innovation in infant mortality.

II.   EMPIRICAL RESULTS

11—1. Granger's Causality Tests

Granger's causality tests between fertility and infant mortality
rates are performed using the annual data for the United States,
the Netherlands, Japan, and Israel. After attempting different
transformations of data and different lag distributions in

the preliminary work, I present the logarithmic results of three

lag distributions in equations (1) and (2).
         Table 11-1—1 contains the P-statistics on the three lag

coefficients of the explanatory variables, fertility rate (F)
and infant mortality rate (H), when fertility rate is the dependent
variable and infant mortality rate is the causal variable.
H—F in this table represents the issue of causality from infant

mortality to fertility under the null hypothesis that infant
mortality does not cause fertility. Table 11—1—2 contains
the F—statistics on the three lag coefficients of the explanatory

variables,' infant mortality (N) and fertility (F), when N is
the dependent variable and F is the causal variable. In this case,
the issue of causality from F to M is tested under the null
hypothesis that F does not cause M.

         Concerning the issue of causality from infant mortality to
fertility in table 11—1—1, we note that fertility is explained

to a large extent by its own past history for these countries.
                               — 14 —




Especially,   the fertility behavior in the United States is
significantly explained and dominated by its previous pattern. 12
The F—statistics on lagged coefficients of fertility is 201.6,

which is much larger than those of the Netherlands, Israel, and
Japan. On the other hand, the F—statistics under infant mortality
(causal variable) indicate the significance in the causal relationship
from N to F. The results in the table show that there exists

statistically significant causality at the conventional significance
level for the Netherlands and Israel. The relatively large

F—statistics of the Netherlands (9.893) and Israel (5.995) suggest

that infant mortality is important in explaining the fertility
behavior in these countries. In Israel, the infant mortality of
its past history is as important as the fertility of its past

history in explaining current level of fertility rate.
       With respect to the issue of causality from fertility to
infant mortality in table 11-1—2, the infant mortality rates are

well explained by their own past history in these four countries.
Unlike the case of fertility, the own past history of infant

mortality is less important in explaining itself in the United States,
although the F—statistics on the three lagged coefficients of

infant mortality is much larger than those of other countries.
The test of causality from F to M in the table indicates that
                                   — 15 —




/   all   results for these four countries are statistically significant

    at the conventional level. Above all, there are strong causal
    relationships from fertility to infant mortality for the United
    States and the Netherlands: the F—statistics are 8.U19 and 7.L440,

    respectively.
             As a summary of Granger's causality tests, we note that
    fertility and infant mortality are not mutually independent but
    significantly causally related with each other. In particular,
                                                                 13
    both are jointly determined in the Netherlands and Israel.

    In other words, fertility and infant mortality are mutually
    interdependent in these countries. For the United States and

    Japan,   there is significant unidirectional causality from fertility
    to infant mortality within a three—lag distribution in the system.

11—2 The Sign of Association between Fertility and Inf ant Mortality

Both fertility and infant mortality rates are expressed by
the fertility innovation and infant mortality innovation, which is

the moving average representation (MAR) in the system. In this
two—equation system expressed by MAR, the ordering of variables in
the orthogonalization is infant mortality and fertility. I present
the results of dynamic relationship in terms of the sign of association

between fertility and infant mortality in table 11—2—1.
       The results in table 11—2—1 report that the cumulative
responses in fertility and infant mortality to the innovations in

infant mortality and fertility in three, five, and eight years ahead,
respectively. In other words, those values under M    F are the sum

of estimated coefficients of the infant mortality innovation,

in estimating fertility, x, in equation (7), while those under
F 4 M are the sum of estimated coefficients of the fertility

innovation, Q•' in estimating infant mortality, X, in equation (7).
       First, with respect to the sign of M   F, the values of
empirically observed cumulative responses are negative almost for
all time horizons shown. That is, typical random shocks in
the infant mortality (a fall in N) will increase fertility above
its normal level for these four countries except k5 in Israel.
In Israel, a fall in infant mortality will increase fertility
                              — 18 —




 above its normal level in three
                                 years and, however, will decrease
fertility below its normal level in five years (see -0.50 at k =
                                                                 3
and 0.52 at k = 5 under N 3 F in Israel). In
                                              general, the observed
negative association, while not inconsistent with theory, is
inconsistent with most previous research.

       Second, with respect to the sign of F 4 N, as usually
hypothesized, the observed values of cumulative responses are
positive at all time horizons shown except k = 3 in Israel.

Therefore, a fall in fertility will decrease infant mortality
below its normal level. The positive asociation seems strengthened

as the longer time horizon for the United States, the Netherlands,
and Japan.

       In addition to the above cunulatiye responses, when we

closely look at the variation of infant mortality accounted for

by its own innovation, we note that the variation in infant mortality
in response to its own random shocks
                                     becomes quickly dampened
in the Netherlands, reflecting non—negligible feedback effects from

the fertility innovation to infant mortality in short periods.
On the other hand, for other three countries, the variation in

infant mortality generated by its own random shocks persists for
a relatively long period in future. 14

       As a summary of the sign of association between fertility

and infant mortality, I find that a reduction in fertility will

decrease infant mortality below its normal level for all the countries,

the United States, the Netherlands, Japan, and Israel, while a fall
in infant mortality will increase fertility above its normal level
for those four countries. The negative association in the latter,
while not inconsistent with theory, is inconsistent with most
previous research.

      * This
             cumulative response in 8 years ahead seems
      substantially large compared with those of other
      countries. Therefore, equations (1) and (2) with
      a first difference in logarithms are also estimated
      in Granger's causality tests. By using the obtained
      innovations in fertility and infant mortality rates,
      the cumulative responses are reestimated. However,
      there is no qualitative change, but the positive
      numerical value of the cumulative response in 8 years
      ahead is much smaller than the value presented above
      in the table.

III.   SUMMARY

The aims of this study are twofold: one is to empirically answer
the question whether infant mortality is historically one of

the significant factors which influenced fertility and vice versa;
and another is to observe the sign of association between fertility
and infant mortality.

        By using a time series causality test developed by Granger,
I have shown that fertility and infant mortality are not mutually

independent but jointly determined. Also, in tens of the sign of
association between fertility and infant mortality, I have shown
that a reduction in fertility will decrease infant mortality below
its normal level, while a fall in infant mortality will increase
fertility above its normal level.

         This paper is a product of my Ph.D. dissertation, sumitted
to the Graduate School and University Center of the City University
of New YOrk. I am indebted to Professors Michael Grossman,
Bernard Okun, Linda N. Edwards, Salih N. Neftci and my colleague,
Mr. Tetsuji Yamada for their helpful comments on a draft of this
paper. All errors in this paper are mine. Any opinions expressed
are those of the author and not those of the institutions with
which I am affiliated.

       2See source of data in appendix f or these figures and the
fertility rates discussed elsewhere.

       3The superstition, Hinoeuma, is that a woman born in that
year is so aggressive that she eats men alive. This "Hinoeuma"
comes every 60 years. See footnote 4 In Hashimoto (1974), p.226.
       4The term "causally" in this paragraph is used in the sense
of Granger's causality. This Granger's causality is explained in
section I.

       5Recent population studies by Lee (1981) and Eckstein,
Schultz and Wolpin (1981) are some attempts to explore dynamic
relationships among demographib, economic, and meteorological
variables.

       6For example, see Haugh (1976), Hsiao (1977), Mehra (1977
and 1978) ,Neftci (1978) , Pierce (1977) , Sims (1972), and William,
Goodhart and Gowland (1976).

       7"Causality" in Granger's model means"linear causality
between variables within a given set of information in a universe."
See Granger (1969), p.L$3O, and also Granger and Newbold (1977),
p.226.
       8The causality test might be sensitive to rnisspecification,
e.g., omitted variables or lag structure in the system.

       9The two dummy variables are used because the intercept
might change for these different periods: Dl = 1 for 1936—1945
and Dl = 0 otherwise; D2 =   I
                             for 1946—1950 and 02 = 0 otherwise;
in the United States, 02 = 1 fnr 1920—1926 and 1946-1955 and
D2 = 0 otherwise; and in Japan, D2 = 1 for 1947—1956 and D2 = 0
otherwise.

       10The rest of this section draws heavily on Sims (1978 and
1980), and Eckstein, Schultz and Wolpin (1981).
       When there are many endogenous variables in the system,
the ordering of variables for the triangular orthogonalization
are an important issue (Sims 1978 and 1980)
       12When whites and nonwhites in the United States are
separately treated, the results of Granger's causality tests are
as follows:

         As a matter of space, although not shown in this paper,
I find the same results in many Western European countries such as
Finland, Italy, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
