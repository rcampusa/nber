        Which is the tighter constraint on private sector investment: weak property rights or limited
access to external finance? From a survey of new firms in post-communist countries, we find that weak
property rights discourage firms from reinvesting their profits, even when bank loans are available.
Where property rights are relatively strong, firms reinvest their profits; where they are relatively weak,
entrepreneurs do not want to invest from retained earnings.

       Which is the tighter constraint on private sector investment: weak property

       rights or limited access to external finance? From a survey of new firms in

       post-communist countries, we find that weak property rights discourage firms

       from reinvesting their profits, even when bank loans are available. Where

       property rights are relatively strong, firms reinvest their profits; where they are

       relatively weak, entrepreneurs do not want to invest from retained earnings.

       (JEL D23, P23)



       Property rights are fundamental: entrepreneurs will not invest if they expect to be

unable to keep the fruits of their investment. Country-level studies consistently show that

less secure property rights are correlated with lower aggregate investment and slower

economic growth (Stephen Knack and Philip Keefer, 1995; Paolo Mauro, 1995; Jakob

Svensson, 1998; Daron Acemoglu, Johnson and James Robinson, 2001). The

microeconomic evidence is more limited, but Timothy Besley (1995), for example, finds

in Ghana a significant link between property rights and investment.

       Secure property rights may be necessary for entrepreneurial investment, but are

they sufficient? External finance could also matter for investment and growth, for if bank

credit is not available it may be hard for entrepreneurs to take advantage of new

opportunities. There is evidence that a well-functioning financial system contributes to



                                             1
investment and growth (Ross Levine, 1997; Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales, 1998).

Is external finance, in addition to secure property rights, necessary for entrepreneurs to

invest, or is property-rights security all that is needed? Broad cross-country studies

cannot answer this question because effective protection for property rights is positively

correlated with the use of external finance. For example, Rafael La Porta, Florencio

Lopez-de-Silanes, Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny (1997, 1998, 2000) show more

external finance is available when there is a stronger legal system in general and more

effective protection of investors in particular, while Asli Demirgüç-Kunt and Vojislav

Maksimovic (1998) find that firms invest more from external funds in countries with

secure property rights.

       Recent experience in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union offers an

experiment that can help disentangle the effects of property rights and external finance.

Although all these former communist countries have relatively weak institutional

environments, there is considerable variation in the extent to which property rights are

protected. For example, Timothy Frye and Shleifer (1997) and Shleifer (1997) provide

evidence that the Russian government acts like a “grabbing hand,” discouraging

entrepreneurs from investing, while the Polish government does not. In general, property

rights have proven more secure in Poland than in other parts of Eastern Europe and the

former Soviet Union. Within countries, also, there is variation in both the perceived

security of property rights and in the access to bank credit. Given these countries’

banking systems, small firms are able to borrow only if they can provide adequate

collateral. Owning collateral is therefore a good proxy for at least having the possibility

to borrow. Firm-level evidence from these post-communist countries therefore allows us




                                              2
to determine whether secure property rights are (a) necessary, (b) sufficient, or (c)

necessary and sufficient for investment by entrepreneurs.

         Our data come from a 1997 survey of recently formed and relatively small

manufacturing firms in five transition countries: Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine,

and Russia. The perceived security of property rights and the use of bank credit vary

considerably both across and within these countries. As an outcome variable, we focus

on the amount entrepreneurs choose to reinvest out of their profits. This provides a

robust measure of investment, as our survey work indicates, that is comparable across

firms.

         Our approach has two parts, both of which are designed to be straightforward to

implement in countries where standard financial information is hard to obtain. First, we

explain the data we were able to obtain, putting particular emphasis on what our

investigation shows is a reasonable way to ask questions about sensitive financial

information and property rights issues (Section I). 1 Second, we test whether secure

property rights are sufficient for investment by entrepreneurs (Sections II and III).

         The entrepreneurs in our sample reinvest less of their retained earnings when they

perceive their property rights to be insecure, irrespective of whether they own the

collateral that is generally needed to obtain credit. This effect is large. Those

entrepreneurs in our sample with the least secure property rights invest nearly 40 percent

less of their profits than those with the most secure property rights (specifically,

entrepreneurs with the least secure perceived property rights reinvest 32 percent of their

profits, while those with the most secure reinvest 56 percent). Secure property rights are

necessary for the entrepreneurs in our sample to take full advantage of opportunities to




                                              3
invest. Moreover, we find that the absence of bank finance does not prevent the

entrepreneurs in our sample from investing. Controlling for property rights, there is no

evidence that access to bank credit leads to more investment for these firms. Secure

property rights are therefore also sufficient for investment. In fact, the firms in our

sample with weak perceived property rights and high levels of unreinvested profits do not

want to borrow.

       Part of the explanation for these results is that, for the firms in our sample,

retained earnings have consistently been large, and therefore have been a source of

potential investment funds. Many of these new firms are extremely profitable because

the relatively hostile business environment creates barriers to entry and because the

partially reformed economy offers entrepreneurs lucrative unfilled niches.2 High profits

mean that entrepreneurs have the resources they need for expansion, without needing to

borrow. The issue is not whether entrepreneurs have enough resources, but rather

whether they want to invest their retained earnings or instead consume these earnings,

perhaps outside the country.

       At the low level of institutional development of the countries in our sample,

secure property rights are both necessary and sufficient to induce investment by

entrepreneurs. The availability of bank loans surely matters for growth, but perhaps only

once property rights are perceived to be secure. If property rights are insecure, it is

immaterial whether or not finance is available. Our findings thus add empirical detail to

the view that certain market-supporting institutions will work only after other institutions

have been built (McMillan, 1997; Shleifer and Vishny, 1998).




                                              4
       Because our survey covers only firms already in existence, we cannot infer

anything about the relative importance of property rights and finance for potential

entrepreneurs who are considering entry. We focus instead on entrepreneurs who are

already in business with small-scale operations. Our question is: under what conditions

will these entrepreneurs reinvest their profits to make their businesses grow?



I The Data



The Sample

       We surveyed private manufacturing firms in May and June of 1997 in Russia and

Ukraine and from September to December of 1997 in Poland, Slovakia, and Romania. 3

The survey was designed to find similar relatively small firms in comparable cities in all

five countries.

       We chose the countries explicitly to look for variation in institutional conditions.

The previously available cross-country evidence, for example from European Bank for

Reconstruction and Development (EBRD, 1996) and Shleifer (1997), suggested that

property rights were less secure in countries further to the East. We intentionally

surveyed only firms that were going concerns, in order to focus on investment decisions

by firms that had managed to enter an industry and survive. Other researchers have

found that weak property rights increase barriers to entry (Simeon Djankov, La Porta,

Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer 2000). Daniel Berkowitz and David N. DeJong (2000)

find variation across Russian regions in the rate of formation of new firms is associated

with the degree of local political support for reform. This paper looks instead at the




                                             5
effects of weak property rights on entrepreneurial investment conditional on entry having

occurred.

       The sample includes about 300 manufacturing firms with between seven and 270

employees in each country; the total sample size for most variables is about 1400

observations. Some of the firms were started from scratch and others were spun off from

state enterprises, which probably reflects characteristics of the population of firms. In

our sample for Poland, Romania and Slovakia, startups far outnumber spinoffs; in Russia

and especially Ukraine, spinoffs predominate. We control for these characteristics of the

firms in our regression analysis.



The Questions

       The survey design incorporated both experience of previous surveys on these

topics and the results of pilot studies we carried out in each country. The pilots tested

precisely how people understood various questions and established the best ways to ask

about sensitive information. For the purposes of this paper, the most important issue was

how to ask about profits and their reinvestment.

       We expected respondents would be reluctant to answer questions about the

specific nominal amounts of profits and investments, and we found this to be the case.

However, they were more willing to answer questions posed in terms of ratios. We also

found that respondents found it much easier to answer questions that posed this ratio in

terms of a closed-end question listing various ranges from which they could choose. For

example, our key question was: “How much did you re-invest out of profits during

1996?” We offered respondents six choices: 0 percent, 1-10 percent, 11-25 percent, 26-




                                              6
49 percent, 50-75 percent, or more than 75 percent. Both the use of ratios and the closed

categories represent compromises. We obtain much higher response rates: in the case of

reinvestment rates, the response rate exceeded 94 percent.4 But we have only categorical

rather than continuous data. As a result, our regressions will be ordered probits.

       Previous research indicated that for particularly sensitive issues, for example

relating to bribes and other issues linked to security rights, the response rate was higher

when we posed the questions in terms of asking about “firms in your industry” rather

than the entrepreneur’s own firm. 5 Our assumption, based on other experience, is that

answers to this question reflect the entrepreneur’s own experience. At least one

respondent confirmed this, telling our survey firm that he knew the questions were

designed to “disguise the fact that [the survey] was after information about his own firm.”

He responded to the questions anyway.



Measuring Property Rights

       The entrepreneur’s beliefs about the security of his or her property rights are

indicated by responses to several survey questions. We asked entrepreneurs first whether

firms in their industry make “extralegal payments” for government services, and second

whether firms in their industry make “extralegal payments” for licenses. More than 90

percent of the Russian entrepreneurs and almost 90 percent of Ukrainian entrepreneurs

answered affirmatively to these questions (see the first two rows of Table 1). Only one in

five entrepreneurs in Poland and Romania said firms make extralegal payments for

services or licenses. The response rates for these questions are well above 98 percent in

the three Eastern European countries, but are 40 percent or less in Russia and Ukraine.

One reasonable interpretation of a refusal to answer the question, in this context, is that


                                              7
the entrepreneur makes these payments and – for obvious reasons – does not want to

discuss them.

        We also asked whether firms make payments for “protection” of their activities,

finding a similar pattern of responses across the countries (in the third row of Table 1).

We chose not to ask directly about whether firms made payments to organized crime,

because we expected that most entrepreneurs would not admit this. However, the indirect

question probably picks up whether a firm believes it is likely to be subject to extortion

by some form of mafia – although we would caution that anecdotal evidence suggests this

sort of organized crime often operates with the tacit protection of some local government

officials.

        For further measures of property-rights security, we asked entrepreneurs whether

they make “unofficial” payments for specific services: payments for renewing their

business registration, and payments to fire, sanitary, and tax inspectors (see the fourth,

fifth, and sixth rows of Table 1). Though the response rates to these questions are lower,

the pattern is the same. A majority of entrepreneurs in Russia and Ukraine say such

payments are common, while a minority of entrepreneurs in the other three countries says

the same. We use these detailed corruption measures to check the robustness of results

from our basic regression.

        Official payments to government are also higher in Russia and Ukraine, where tax

payments are more than one quarter of sales, compared to about a sixth of sales in

Eastern Europe (see the seventh row of Table 1).6 We control for tax payments as a

percent of sales to see whether this is a direct disincentive to invest. We do find some




                                              8
evidence that investment rates are negatively impacted by higher tax rates, though in

contrast to other results, the tax rate findings are not robust.

        Using courts to enforce contracts with trading partners is a logically distinct

activity from protecting property rights. Nevertheless the effects on investment are

similar. Inadequate contractual enforcement could put firms’ profits at risk and make

them reluctant to invest. Asked whether courts could be used to enforce an agreement

with a customer or supplier, most firms in all of the countries said they could.

Affirmative answers to this question ranged from 87 percent in Romania to 56 percent in

Ukraine (see the last row of responses in Table 1).

        Overall, Table 1 shows that the five countries fall into two distinct groups – the

three East European countries have relatively more secure property rights than do the two

former Soviet Union countries. Courts are less reliable in resolving commercial disputes

in Russia and Ukraine, and interactions with the government are also more costly in these

countries. This is consistent with the existing evidence that the regulatory environment in

Eastern Europe is less hostile to business activity than in the former Soviet Union (see,

for example, Frye and Shleifer, 1997).

        Entrepreneurs’ perceptions of the security of property rights may vary within a

country for three reasons. First, different firms may face different realities. Interaction

with the government may be more frequent in some industries than in others. Activities

may vary in the ease with which they can be hidden from government bureaucrats. And

some entrepreneurs may have connections that allow them to avoid extortion. In our data,

for example, entrepreneurs who previously worked as high-level entrepreneurs in state

owned enterprises are less likely to say bribes are paid. Second, entrepreneurs may differ




                                               9
in their perceptions. This is especially likely in an economy undergoing deep reform,

where institutions and circumstances change quickly. We find, for instance, that older

entrepreneurs are less likely to say bribes are paid. Third, the responses may reflect some

other characteristic of the firm or the entrepreneur. In our regressions we control for as

many characteristics as possible, but some unobserved attributes may matter for

investment.



An Index of the Insecurity of Property Rights

       Table 2 shows the correlations among our property-rights measures for individual

firms in all five countries. Not surprisingly, most are highly correlated. Extralegal

payments for services and extralegal payments for licenses have a correlation coefficient

of 0.66, while the correlation between payments for “protection” and either of these

measures is larger than 0.50.

       For our regression analysis, we combine the three main property-rights questions

— extralegal payments for licenses, extralegal payments for services, and paying for

protection — into an additive index of property-rights insecurity for each firm. The

property-rights index we construct ranges from 0 to 3, with 3 indicating that the

entrepreneurs said all three payments were common, 2 indicating an affirmative response

to two of the payments, 1 indicating an affirmative response to one of the payments, and

0 indicating an affirmative response to none. A higher value of this index therefore

represents less secure property rights.




                                             10
        An alternative index for property rights insecurity would equal one if firms make

any one of the three types of payments and zero otherwise. Either of these indexes can be

justified theoretically.

        The additive index is appropriate if responding affirmatively to more than one

question indicates a greater level of insecurity than responding affirmatively to only one

question. The either/or index is appropriate if one bribe-taker has the same effect as

multiple bribe-takers. According to the model of Shleifer and Vishny (1993), if two or

more corrupt bureaucrats coordinate so as to maximize their total bribes, they will extract

the same total amount as a monopoly extortionist. If they compete with each other,

however, their total bribes will, by prisoners’-dilemma logic, exceed the bribe-

maximizing amount. The data show the effects of corruption are additive, as discussed

below (Section III), suggesting the rate of total bribes might exceed what even the bribe-

takers would want.

        A belief that courts are not effective in enforcing contracts is positively correlated

with the corruption measures, but the correlation is smaller. The correlation between

courts and the index for insecurity of property rights is 0.15. While this correlation may

seem low, it probably reflects the fact that believing the courts can enforce private

contracts is quite different from trusting the government not to expropriate your property.

With regard to courts, the issue is presumably whether judges are incompetent or

corruptible. With regard to security of property rights, the issue is to what extent

members of the executive feel constrained to act responsibly and within the law. Even in

environments where the executive is quite predatory (Russia, for example), we see




                                              11
considerable willingness on the part of entrepreneurs to rely on courts for the

enforcement of contracts with other entrepreneurs.

        In the main regressions, we use the effectiveness of courts alongside the index of

property rights. We also run regressions using the components of the index separately.

Finally, an alternative index of property rights that we use in the regressions, ranging

from 0 to 4, adds to the first index the measure of the ineffectiveness of courts (that is, we

add one if the entrepreneur thinks the courts cannot be used to enforce contracts and zero

otherwise).



Reinvestment of Profits

        Initial entrants in transition economies often earn large profits, which decline over

time as new firms enter (McMillan, 1997). Our data are consistent with this at the country

level. Table 3 (second line) shows the firms’ average profit after taxes as a percent of

sales in 1996. Reported after-tax profits are much higher in Russia (21 percent) and

Ukraine (18 percent), where there has been the least progress with economic reform, than

in Poland (10 percent), where the transition has progressed much further. Romania is in

between (13 percent). Slovakia appears to be the outlier in this pattern, with profit rates

much lower than in any of the other countries (6 percent).7 Entrepreneurs were also

asked to estimate profit rates after taxes in their industry, as a percent of sales. As we

would expect, the estimates of industry profits and the firm’s own profit rates are highly

correlated (?=0.41). At the country level, these estimates, also shown in Table 3 (third

line), indicate a similar pattern, but with less variation across countries.8




                                              12
       These profit rates are high relative to the available data for large firms in these

countries. The best data are for Poland. According to the most recent data in

Worldscope, average profit/sales for Polish firms from all industries is about 5 percent.9

However, this average hides considerable disparity. In particular, large firms operating in

sectors with substantial barriers to entry, for example due to regulations, had sales-profit

ratios that were comparable to the small firms in our sample.

       These data are consistent with the idea that the insecurity of property rights may

deter entry into the small firm sector (Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer,

2000). In addition, these partially reformed post-communist economies offer

entrepreneurs lucrative unfilled niches. There is also presumably a survivorship bias for

small firms. We are measuring only the firms that have not gone out of business

(although arguably this should overstate the importance of external finance and

understate the importance of expropriation risk). Large firms may not show such a bias

because, in these countries, the government may provide implicit subsidies that prevent

them from going out of business.

       Entrepreneurs also reported profits as a percentage of sales during their firm’s

first full year of operation. We show in Table 3 (see the sixth, seventh, and eighth lines)

the average first year profit rates by country and by year in which the firms began

operation. In Poland, firms started between 1989 and 1991, just after the reforms,

reported earning an average of 9.9 percent of sales during their first year of operation.

First year profits were markedly lower – 4.2 percent of sales – for firms started in 1992 or

1993, and lower still for the most recent group of entrants (2.1 percent of sales for firms




                                             13
entering between 1994 and 1996). These data are consistent with our expectation that

entry leads to lower profit rates.

        A downward trend over time in profit rates for entrants in their first year of

business is also evident in Slovakia and Romania, though the rate of fall is not as steep as

in Poland. There is even less difference across time in the profit rates of startup firms in

either Russia or Ukraine. Firms entering between 1989 and 1991 had average first year

profit rates of 4.3 percent and 7.6 percent of sales in Russia and Ukraine, respectively.

Those entering five years later had average profit rates of 3.9 percent and 7.4 percent of

sales, respectively. 10

         We also asked what fraction of 1996 profits after taxes were reinvested in the

firm. Polish and Romanian firms reinvested the highest fraction, slightly more than 50

percent on average (fourth line of Table 3). Reinvestment rates average about 40 percent

in Slovakia and Russia, and 30 percent in Ukraine. 11 We also compute the profits

entrepreneurs choose not to reinvest in their businesses (fifth line of Table 3).

Unreinvested profits as a percentage of sales are highest in Russia and Ukraine, where

they exceed 10 percent of sales, and lower in Romania (5.9 percent of sales), Poland (5.2

percent) and Slovakia (5.1 percent). In Russia and Ukraine, where property rights are the

least secure, entrepreneurs are on average the most reluctant to reinvest their profits.

        Table 3 also divides these data into startups and spinoffs. Startups are more

profitable than spinoffs in all five countries, though the difference is much greater in

Poland and Romania than in the other three countries. Startups reinvest a greater

proportion of their profits than spinoffs in Poland, Slovakia and Romania.




                                              14
External Finance

       The survey contains three indications of having received bank credit. First, we

asked firms what their sources of startup capital were. A minority of firms, ranging from

6.6 percent of Polish firms to 27 percent of Slovakian firms, obtained part of their startup

capital from bank loans (see the second line of Table 4). Second, we asked whether they

obtained a loan at some point in the past. Over 90 percent of Russian firms and 79

percent of Ukrainian firms say they have received loans at some time (third line of Table

4). Only half of Slovakian and Romanian firms have had a loan at some point in the life

of the enterprise. Third, we asked whether they obtained loans from banks in 1996, the

year before the survey. The greatest percentage of current borrowers was in Poland,

where just under half (49 percent) of firms said they had loans in 1996. About a quarter

of firms in Slovakia and Romania said they had loans in 1996, with lower percentages in

Russia (17 percent) and Ukraine (14 percent).12

       Although fewer firms in Russia and Ukraine received loans than in the other three

countries, the average loan size was larger there. Loans average less than 5 percent of a

borrower’s annual sales in Poland, more than 10 percent of annual sales in Slovakia and

Ukraine, and almost 25 percent of annual sales in Russia. As a result, the variation across

countries in the total funds provided by banks is small. Including firms who do not

receive loans, Slovakian firms received the most credit in 1996, amounting to 2.5 percent

of annual sales. In Poland and Russia, finance provided by banks represents 2.3 percent

of annual sales, in Romania 1.7 percent and in Ukraine 0.8 percent.

       Even though Polish firms are much more likely to have obtained a loan in 1996

than firms in the other four countries, the Polish credit markets are underdeveloped by




                                             15
western standards. In the United States, small and medium sized firms are surveyed

periodically by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (FRBG). Among the 344 firms

in the 1993 National Survey of Small Business Finances (NSSBF) that are manufacturers

with between 10 and 270 employees, 84 percent reported having a loan at the time of the

survey. This level is substantially higher than the 49 percent rate in Poland. Moreover,

loan amounts were 16 percent of sales among the group of small US manufacturers,

several times the levels in any of the countries we surveyed.13

       Compared to a developed capital market, loans in our five countries are also much

more likely to require collateral. While 20 percent of bank loans obtained by US firms

were without collateral, less than 2 percent of the firms in our sample obtaining loans did

so without collateral. A lack of collateral, however, is not the main reason for less

borrowing in our sample than in the US. More than 75 percent of firms in each of the

countries – and more than 90 percent of firms in Poland and Romania – say they were

able to offer collateral to banks. At least in the minds of entrepreneurs, a lack of

collateral does not appear to be a major constraint on borrowing. 14

       An alternative source of external funds is credit received from other firms. We

measure trade credit by the level of accounts payable reported by firms (the eighth and

ninth rows of Table 4). Trade credit is almost non-existent in Russia (0.1 percent of

annual sales) and is low in Ukraine (0.7 percent), but is an important source of capital in

Poland (2.7 percent) and Slovakia (3.4 percent). Credit received from suppliers is

comparable in size to credit received from banks in Poland, Slovakia and Ukraine.

Reliable data for this question are not available for Romania. 15 (For more on trade credit,




                                             16
see Johnson, McMillan, and Woodruff (2000), where we use trade credit as a measure of

a firm’s trust in its trading partner.)

        Profit reinvestment is a larger source of investment capital than either bank funds

or trade credit in all five countries, as is seen by comparing Tables 3 and 4 (except that

trade credit is bigger than profit reinvestment in Slovakia). In Poland, firms internally

generate funds for investment averaging 53 percent of sales (Table 3, fourth line). Bank

loans average 2.3 percent of sales for the whole sample and 4.8 percent of sales for firms

receiving loans in Poland (Table 4, sixth and seventh lines). In contrast, we estimate that

firms in Russia and Ukraine have unreinvested profits averaging 12 percent of sales

(Table 3, fifth line). This suggests the Russian and Ukrainian firms could have used their

unreinvested profits in productive projects (earning high rates of return), but for some

reason they chose not to. The potential for using retained earnings as a source of capital is

seen from the fact that in, all five countries, the capital available from unreinvested

profits exceeds the capital provided by banks (compare the fifth row in Table 3 with the

sixth row in Table 4).

        Table 2 shows correlations between the various measures of property rights on the

one hand and variables indicating access to credit on the other. We would be concerned if

access to capital is strongly correlated with security of property rights, because that

would make it difficult to disentangle access to credit from security of property. We

measure the ability to access credit in 1996 with two variables – an indication that the

firm received a bank loan at some point before 1996, and an indication that the firm has

collateral that can be used to obtain a loan. The correlations indicate that firms with less

secure property rights are more likely to have had a loan before 1996. Firms with less




                                              17
secure property rights are less likely to have collateral to offer banks, but the correlation

is small and is significant only for the index of insecurity and for a lack of confidence in

courts. Hence, we are not concerned that our measures of insecure property rights are

proxying for a lack of access to credit.16



Assessment

       The cross-country evidence suggests that property rights are an important

determinant of investment by entrepreneurs. In Poland, where property rights are

relatively secure, we find high rates of reinvestment. In contrast, in Russia and Ukraine,

where property rights are weak, we find that the level of unreinvested profits is high;

entrepreneurs there have the ability to do much more investment than they actually do.

The next question is whether these results hold in the firm-level data when we control for

characteristics of the firm and entrepreneur.



II. A Framework for Investment Decisions

       This section lays out a simple framework that explains and defends the

assumptions needed for our regression analysis. A firm’s desired investment level is a

function of both industry and firm-specific factors. Firms in growing industries are faced

with more investment opportunities than are firms in declining industries. Production in a

capital-intensive industry also necessitates higher investment levels. More able

entrepreneurs will find investments more profitable in any industry. All of these factors

affect the profitability of potential investments.




                                                18
        Investment demand also depends on the ability of entrepreneurs to retain any

profits they make. Entrepreneurs may be unwilling to invest when returns are insecure.

The effect of entrepreneurs’ perceptions of property rights on investment decisions is the

main issue we want to explore. Suppose that the firm makes its investment and borrowing

decisions simultaneously, and extortion, if it occurs, comes after any profits are realized,

so that firm’s demand for investable funds is given by

(1)                            Id = I(p, s, r I, r L),

where p represents expected (pre-extortion) profits, s represents the amount of those

profits that will be extracted by corrupt bureaucrats or criminals, rI represents the interest

rate the entrepreneur can earn by investing the firm’s profits outside the firm and rL the

interest rate the entrepreneur pays on borrowed money. Investable funds may be

obtained either internally from retained earnings or externally through credit markets.

Thus:

(2)                            Id = R + Ld,

where R represents reinvested earnings and Ld is the firm’s demand for loans.

        The usual assumption is that the value to the firm of internal funds, rI is less than

the cost to the firm of external funds, rL. The wedge between the two interest rates arises

because entrepreneurs have better information about their prospects than outside lenders

or investors. Lenders demand a premium to offset their informational disadvantage. The

difference between rI and rL creates a pecking order in which internal funds are exhausted

first before external funds are obtained (Stewart C. Myers and Nicholas S. Majluf 1984,

Lakshmi Shyam-Sunder and Myers 1999). This idea was developed from the experience

of firms in the United States. The wedge between the value of internal funds and the cost




                                               19
of external funds is likely to be larger in transition countries than in developed market

economies because information sources are missing and investment uncertainties are

much greater in transition countries. Information asymmetries are therefore likely to be

more severe.

       Firms in transition economies have another reason to prefer internal financing in

addition to borrower/lender information asymmetries. External financing makes it hard

for firms to hide their activities from tax collectors or the mafia. The effective cost of

external finance in Russia is increased, according to Anna Meyendorff (1998), by the fact

that firms that apply for a bank loan are more likely to have to pay their taxes. According

to Richard Lotspeich (1996), firms are reluctant to disclose information to banks for fear

it will be leaked to the mafia. Given these conditions, the assumption that the value of

internal funds is less than the cost of external funds is a reasonable one to make in

examining the investment decisions of firms.

       The difference in cost of internal and external funds leads to a discontinuity

between the investment of internal funds and the decision to seek external funds.

Investment projects must have an expected return (after extortion and adjusted for risk)

comparable to rI to be profitable when financed by internal funds, but a return

comparable to rL to be profitable when financed by external funds. As a result, a firm’s

decision to invest internally generated funds is made independently of a decision to seek

external finance. This allows us to estimate econometrically an equation for reinvestment

of profits independent of the demand for external finance.

       We represent the pecking-order hypothesis by supposing that firm i has a

maximum amount of money that it is willing to reinvest out of its current profits, Ei; this




                                              20
might be the total current profit, or it might be strictly less than that. We assume Ei

depends on entrepreneur-specific characteristics. Then the pecking-order hypothesis

implies:

(3)                     Id = R,                 if Id < Ei

                        Id = Ei + Ld,           if Id > Ei

This gives us the main equation we will estimate, relating the firm’s willingness to

reinvest its profits to its expected profits and the security of its property rights:

(4)                     R = I(p, s, r I),       if Id < Ei

                        R = Ei ,                if Id > Ei.

In our data, we will use explicit measures of p and s. Differences in rI across firms in the

sample will be subsumed in country/industry control variables.

        If the assumption that investment of internally generated funds is independent of

access to external funds were invalid, then investment of internal and external funds

would need to be examined simultaneously. There are (at least) three reasons that

investment of internal funds might depend on access to external funds. First, rL may not

be higher than rI if loans are subsidized by the government. This does not appear to be the

case in our data. Subsidies were most important in loans to state-owned firms. There are

no state-owned firms in our sample. Only in Romania do we find that interest rates paid

by firms spun off from state-owned enterprises are lower than those paid by de novo

startups. In the remaining countries, there are no significant differences in loan rates

between the two groups of firms. Moreover, across the sample, loans given by state banks

have higher interest rates than loans given by private banks. In Poland and Slovakia,




                                               21
where loans are equally divided between state and private banks, interest rates are nearly

the same, with rates from state banks very slightly higher than rates from private banks.

       Second, entrepreneurs for whom property rights are insecure may prefer to invest

bank funds in their businesses and to divert internally generated funds to more secure

accounts. This implies that firms receiving loans should invest, on average, a lower

proportion of their own profits than firms without loans. The data suggest this is not the

case. Among the most profitable firms (those with profits 10 percent or more of sales)

who are investing less than half of their profits, loans are infrequent. Only 64 of 476 (13

percent) of these firms received loans in 1996. On the other hand, 104 of the 259 (40

percent) firms investing more than 75 percent of their profits received loans.17 The survey

does not indicate whether a loan received in 1996 represented new capital, or a rollover

of a loan from previous years. But we would expect that firms investing most of their

profits are both more likely to rollover existing loans and more likely to take out new

loans. In either case, firms that are investing aggressively will be more likely to have a

loan in 1996, as the data suggest.

       Finally, investment may be lumpy, with the minimal investment larger than

retained earnings can accommodate. Given the level of technology used by small-scale

manufacturers in these countries, however, it seems unlikely that investments are lumpy.

Moreover, Table 5 shows that 35 percent of firms without loans in 1996 reinvested half

or more of their profits, indicating that the lack of external finance does not preclude

internally funded investment. (By comparison, 53 percent of firms with loans in 1996

invested half or more of their profits.) Further evidence on this is discussed in Section III,

where we use a firm’s ability to offer collateral and loans prior to 1996 as measured of




                                              22
access to loans in the 1996 reinvestment equation. If investments are lumpy then

reinvestment should be positively associated with collateral; we find no significant

interaction.

       Thus, examining reinvestment of profits independent of access to external finance

appears to be reasonable for our data. In the next section, we examine the determinants of

the firm’s decision to reinvest from its profits (equation (4)). The main hypothesis is that

firms reinvest less if they perceive their property rights to be more insecure.



III. Determinants of Profit Reinvestment

       Security of property rights is positively correlated with profit reinvestment rates at

the country level, as we saw in Section I. Reinvestment rates are highest in Poland and

Romania, where extralegal payments and payments for protection are lowest and the

reliability of the courts is highest. Reinvestment rates are lowest in Ukraine and Russia,

where extralegal payments are highest and courts less effective. Reinvestment rates are

affected, however, by factors other than property rights.



Basic Specification

       In this section, we estimate the reinvestment-demand equation (4), with the

percentage of its profits a firm reinvests as the dependent variable and our property-rights

indices as independent variables. Our data on reinvestment rates are categorical rather

than continuous, and hence we use ordered probit regressions (although we have checked

the robustness of our results using alternative specifications). We control for factors

affecting investment demand other than property rights: the industry profit rate (as a




                                             23
proxy for expected investment opportunities more generally) 18, the age of the firm, access

to external finance (represented by whether the firm had collateralizable assets),

entrepreneur characteristics, and other industry effects.

       Table 6 presents the results of these regressions. There are six categories of

responses to the reinvestment question, increasing in the rate of reinvestment. A positive

coefficient indicates that an increase in the level of the independent variable increases the

chance that a firm is in a higher reinvestment category.19 We exclude from the regression

sample firms that had zero or negative profits in 1996, since we are unable to measure

their reinvestment rate. We also exclude firms not operating at the start of the year in

1996. Both startups and spinoffs are included in the initial regressions (first and second

columns). Recall that the questions on which the key independent variables are based

refer to payments made by firms in the respondent’s industry. To be conservative, we

therefore report t-values based on standard errors adjusted for clustering for 44

industry/country groups. Adjusting for clustering has only a small effect on the standard

errors in these regressions and does not affect the significance level for any of our results.

       The first column of Table 6 includes only the index that represents the insecurity

of property rights. Greater insecurity is associated with lower levels of profit

reinvestment, and this effect is highly significant. The second column adds the variable

that indicates the entrepreneur thinks courts are ineffective. Ineffective courts are

associated with lower levels of investment as well, an effect significant at the 0.05 level.

Additional variables added in the second control for the entrepreneur’s estimate of the

industry profit rate20 and tax rate, the log age of the firm in years, a dummy variable

indicating that the firm is a startup and nine industry dummy variables. Older firms invest




                                              24
a lower proportion and startups a higher proportion of their profits. Higher tax rates are

associated with lower investment rates, though the effect is significant at only the 0.10

level. The regression also controls for the age of the firm and whether the firm is a

startup.

           Our index for the insecurity of property rights is additive. An alternative index

would take a value of one if firms make any one of the three types of payments, and a

value of zero otherwise. Both indices have theoretical merit, but the additive index

explains the data better. The either/or index is significant (β = -0.27, t = 3.48), but has a

lower t-value and results in a lower χ2 (60.8 vs. 65.4 with the additive index). The

additive index can be used to create four dummy variables, the first representing an index

value of zero, the second representing an index value of one, and so on. When dummies

representing index values of three, two, and one are used in place of the index (with the

value zero being the base group), the coefficients are -0.35, -0.26 and -0.14, respectively.

These results suggest that the effects of corruption are additive, perhaps because multiple

affirmative responses indicate stronger convictions on the part of the entrepreneur.

Alternatively, the better performance of the additive index may indicate that those

extracting payments do not coordinate their activities, consistent with the model of

Shleifer and Vishny (1993).

           The first two regressions do not control for country effects. Since much of the

variance in security of property rights is across countries rather than within country, this

measures the full effect of property rights. However, there may be other factors that vary

across countries and affect the demand for investment. If so, then these other country-

level effects will be correlated with our measures of property rights. The regressions in



                                                25
Columns 3-9 control for differences in each industry in each country using 39

industry/country dummy variables. We include interacted controls because the factors

affecting investment demand in the food industry in Poland, for example, may differ from

factors affecting investment demand in the food industry in Russia. Neither the index of

property rights nor the reliability of the courts is much affected by the inclusion of the

industry/country dummies, though the index is now significant only at the 0.05 level. 21



Alternative Specifications

       The regressions in Columns 3-9 also include a set of four variables measuring

entrepreneur characteristics. These variables measure the age, years of schooling, and

prior work experience of the entrepreneur. The two work experience variables indicate

whether the entrepreneur previously was a high level manager in a state-owned enterprise

and whether the entrepreneur had prior experience in the private sector. The coefficients

of these controls for entrepreneur characteristics (not shown on Table 6) indicate that

investment rates are higher for younger entrepreneurs (β = -0.01, t = 2.77 in the third-

column specification) and for entrepreneurs who were previously high level managers at

state-owned enterprises (β = 0.24, t = 2.98 in the third-column specification). Education

and private sector experience have no significant effect.

       We split the sample, in the fourth and fifth columns, into firms that are startups

and those that were spun off from a state enterprise. For startups, the coefficients are

similar to those obtained for the whole sample, though the measure of courts is not

significant at the 0.10 level. The industry tax rate is not significant in either subsample.

However, the entrepreneur’s estimated profit rate for the industry is significant at the 0.10



                                              26
level among startups. Among spinoffs, no variable measuring property rights has any

effect on investment. The industry profit rate has the wrong sign and is insignificant.

There are significant differences between the behavior of spinoffs and startups, with the

regressions doing a better job explaining the behavior of startups. Given that most of the

spinoffs underwent downsizing after being privatized, other factors may play an

important role in determining reinvestment rates for these firms. For the regressions in

the sixth, seventh, and ninth columns we limit the sample to startup firms.

       The regression in the sixth column uses an alternative index of security of

property rights. This alternative index ranges from zero to four – it adds one to the

original index if the entrepreneur thinks courts are ineffective for enforcing contracts. As

with the original index, a higher value represents less secure property rights. The four-

element index has the expected negative sign, and is significant at the 0.01 level.

       Last, we divide the sample by region, first considering investment among startups

in Poland, Slovakia and Romania (the seventh column), and then considering all firms in

Russia and Ukraine (the eighth column). (The number of startups with non-missing

responses in Russia and Ukraine is too small for us to use only startups in this

regression.) The two property-rights measures both have the expected sign in the three

Eastern European countries. The index is significant at the 0.01 level; the significance of

the effectiveness of courts falls below the 0.10 level. In Russia and Ukraine, the

effectiveness of courts is significant. The index of property rights is not included in this

regression because there is not enough variation in the index in the Russia/Ukraine

sample to make the results meaningful. (Only three of 116 firms in the sample answer

“no” to any of the three questions in the index!)




                                              27
       The ordered probit coefficients represent changes in the probabilities of being in

each category of investment. Hence, giving an economic interpretation of their magnitude

is difficult. To gain a better picture of the effect of property rights on investment, we

calculate the probability of being in each investment category conditional on different

values of the property rights index. We use the regression reported in the sixth column of

Table 6, using the four-element security index. The results are shown in Table 7. The

bottom row of the table shows the weighted average reinvestment rate for each value of

the index, using the midpoint of each reinvestment category. Firms with the most secure

property rights (those with an index value of zero) have an average predicted

reinvestment rate of 55.1 percent; those with the least secure property rights have an

average predicted reinvestment rate of 33.5 percent. The most insecure firms’ investment

is therefore 39 percent lower than the investment of the most secure firms.

       In sum, the index of property rights has a significant effect on firms’ investment

rates, especially among de novo startups. We find only weak evidence that tax rates affect

investment demand. The lack of robustness in the tax effects may reflect a lack of

variance in taxes across firms, since statutory tax rates vary only across countries.

Alternatively, perhaps it is the clandestine and unpredictable nature of the unofficial

payments, rather than just the fact that some profits will be taken, that discourages firms

from investing.



Access to Credit

       Our framework assumes that the decision to invest internally generated funds is

independent of access to external funds. It is possible, however, for internal and external




                                              28
funds to complement one another. If investment projects are lumpy, then firms may need

outside finance in order to undertake investment projects at all. In this case, those not

receiving loans would not invest internal funds either. We cannot include a direct

measure of whether the firm has a loan because the latent variable – investment demand –

determines (at least in part) both reinvestment of profits and demand for loans. Instead,

we test for the importance of loans by including variables that are correlated with access

to finance but that we expect are uncorrelated, or only weakly correlated, with investment

demand.22 We include two variables, one indicating that the firm has collateralizable

assets, and the other indicating the firm received a loan prior to 1996. Both of these

variables are strongly correlated with receiving a loan in 1996. Collateral is necessary for

access to loans. Only six of 310 firms reporting loans in 1996 said they did not provide

collateral. Loans obtained prior to 1996 provide an additional indication of

creditworthiness. In most cases (69 percent) where firms had loans prior to 1996 and in

1996 as well, the firm obtained both loans from the same bank. Given that our sample is

limited to firms with positive profits in 1996, we believe these two variables are good

indications of access to credit.23 Neither has a significant effect on the rate of

reinvestment. (ninth column of Table 6). The inclusion of the instruments for bank

finance has little impact on the magnitude or significance of the coefficient on the index

of property rights insecurity. The variable measuring the reliability of courts is now

significant at the 0.10 level.

        In unreported regressions available from the authors, we pursued an alternative

test for an interaction between security of property rights and use of external credit. We

included the index of insecurity as an independent variable in a regression with the




                                              29
receipt of a loan in 1996 as the dependent variable. We found that the index of insecurity

has no effect on the likelihood a firm obtained a loan in 1996. This provides additional

evidence that less secure property rights did not encourage entrepreneurs to invest from

bank funds rather than from their own profits. In the regressions, both the availability of

collateral and receipt of loans prior to 1996 had large and significant effects on the

likelihood a firm received credit in 1996, suggesting that banks’ willingness to lend is an

important determinant of credit availability. The level of unreinvested profits also has a

large and significant effect on the likelihood a firm received credit. The last result

suggests an indirect link between property rights and credit: firms perceiving property

rights as insecure invest less, and so demand less credit. Low levels of observed credit

may result from a lack of demand as well as a lack of supply.



Further Robustness Checks

       Table 8 reports regressions that use the components of the index one at a time. We

use the sample of startups in these regressions. Among the elements of the index,

extralegal payments for government services clearly have the most significant effect (the

first column). Payments for protection fall just below the 0.10 level of significance, and

payments for licenses is insignificant as well (the third and second columns,

respectively).

       The fourth, fifth, and sixth columns of Table 8 replace the components of our

index with the responses to questions about bribes paid for specific services. All three

types of bribes—payments for ongoing registration, payments for fire/sanitary inspection

and payments for tax inspection—are negatively and significantly associated with




                                              30
reinvestment levels. The sample size in these regressions varies and is smaller than the

other regressions because the response rate for these questions is generally lower. The

variable representing trust in the courts has the correct sign in all of the regressions

reported on Table 8, though it is insignificant in all but one of the specifications (see the

last row of coefficients in each column).

        Our findings are also robust to alternative ways of defining the dependent

variable. Ordinary least squares regressions using the midpoint of the investment

categories (i.e., five for the 1-10 percent category, eighteen for the 11-25 percent

category, and so on) produces very similar results. Probits for over/under 75 percent

reinvestment or over/under 50 percent reinvestment also produce similar findings.



Caveats to Our Interpretation

        In the regressions, we treat property rights as exogenous to the investment

decisions of our firms. There are at least two reasons why this may not be a valid

assumption. First, higher investment rates may lead to more secure property rights, as in

the model of Besley (1995). While it is plausible that very large firms in post-communist

transition countries may endogenously create property rights by becoming ‘too big to

fail,’ we do not view this as likely for our firms, given their relatively small size.

        Of more concern is the possibility that higher reinvestment rates and more secure

property rights may both reflect the optimism of the responding managers. Managers may

also attempt to justify an unwillingness to invest by saying that property rights are

insecure. In either of these cases, endogeneity of property rights security arises from our

inability adequately to control for manager characteristics. We lack direct measures of a




                                              31
manager’s attitudes, but managers who say property rights are less secure also say their

own profits and their industry’s profits are higher. Insecurity is also significantly

correlated with characteristics of the manager that we can measure. For example, older

managers and managers who formerly worked as a high level manager of a state-owned

enterprise say property rights are more secure. These correlations suggest there is an

important exogenous component of our insecurity index. Nevertheless, the estimated

impacts of insecurity on investment may be overstated if unmeasured manager

characteristics are important.

       Alternatively, our regression coefficients may understate the effects of property-

rights insecurity. Since we surveyed existing firms, our sample omits both failed firms

and potential firms that were deterred from entering. Both failure and the decision not to

enter presumably reflect the insecurity of property rights. Additionally, because our

regressions look at the determinants of firms’ marginal investment decisions in their

current lines of activity, we cannot pick up possible intersectoral distortions. For

example, certain industries might be especially susceptible to extortion; the insecurity of

property rights might cause entrepreneurs to shun those industries. If capital is more

susceptible to extortion than labor, weak property rights may also cause production to be

inefficiently labor-intensive. We have no way of determining the net effect of the biases

of opposite directions.

       In summary: Weak perceived property rights have a consistently negative effect

on reinvestment in our regressions. The index of property rights is significant in all

subsamples apart from spin-offs. The measure of trust in courts has a less robust effect on




                                              32
reinvestment, but is significant for the full sample. The availability of collateral is not

correlated with the reinvestment of profits.



IV. Conclusion

       Firms’ investment is affected by the perceived security of property rights, as

shown by both our cross-country data and firm-level regressions. Reinvestment rates are

lowest in Russia and Ukraine, where bribes for government services and licenses are

common, firms make payments for protection, and the courts are least effective, and

highest in Poland and Romania, where property rights are the most secure. Within

countries, also, there is also significant variation, as our firm-level regressions indicate.

The entrepreneurs who perceive their property rights to be the least secure reinvest 32

percent of their profits, while those with the most secure property reinvest 56 percent.

Insecurity of property rights, all else equal, reduces a firm’s investment by over a third.

       Most of the firms say they were able to offer collateral to banks (more than three-

quarters of the firms in each of the countries). Lack of collateral, therefore, does not

appear to have been a binding constraint on firms’ investment. There are two reasons

why, until now, external credit has not been essential for private-sector development.

First, insecure property rights mean firms have limited incentive to invest and therefore

little demand for external finance (especially in Russia and Ukraine). Second, the high

profits of early entrants in all these transition economies meant that firms that wished to

invest were able to do so. The potential for using retained earnings as a source of

investment is seen from the fact that in, all five countries, unreinvested profits exceed the




                                               33
funds provided by banks. Our evidence indicates, then, that secure property rights have

been both necessary and sufficient for investment.

       Although the firms have had little demand for external finance at the time of our

survey, they will begin to need access to credit as these economies develop their market-

supporting institutions. This is because legal and bureaucratic reforms increase the

demand for investable funds by solidifying property rights; 24 and because profits will be

driven down to normal levels as transaction costs fall and market competition increases,

so investment from internal funds will not be sustainable.

              For more detail on the survey see Appendices A, B and C, which are on the American

Economic Review web site, www.XXX.) The questionnaire and the complete raw data are

available at http://www-irps.ucsd.edu/faculty/cwoodruff/data.htm
          2
              High profits to new entrants appear to have been common in the early stages of reform

in the formerly planned economies. China's newly entering rural firms had an average rate of

profit on capital of 40 percent in 1978, the first year of reform; in subsequent years this profit rate

fell as China's marketization proceeded (Barry Naughton, 1995, p.150). Anecdotal evidence that

early entrants in Poland earned high profits is given in Johnson and Gary W. Loveman (1995).
          3
              We chose these three countries on the basis of country-level measures that indicated

substantial variation in institutional environment. The survey is described in more detail in

Appendix A, and Appendix C summarizes our key questions about finance, profits,

investment, and property rights. (These appendices are available at www.XXX.)




                                                    40
        4
            For questions where the range of potential responses ranged too widely to use

categories, we did ask for specific nominal amounts. In these cases –for example, when we asked

firms how much capital they invested in the firm at startup – response rates were much lower.
        5
            This way of asking about sensitive issues, such as property rights and underground

economic activity, was developed by Daniel Kaufmann in his earlier empirical work. See, for

example, Joel Hellman, Geraint Jones, Kaufmann, and Mark Schankerman (2000). The results

seem consistent with available cross-country evidence and across surveys.
        6
            We asked entrepreneurs to report taxes as a percent of total sales. Firms in Eastern

Europe and the former Soviet Union routinely underreport sales to avoid taxes and extortion

(Johnson, Kaufmann, and Shleifer, 1997). In separate questions, entrepreneurs indicated that the

percentage of sales hidden by firms in their industry is about 41 percent in Ukraine, 29 percent in

Russia, and around 6 percent in the other three countries. It may be that some entrepreneurs

reported taxes and profits as a percent of official sales rather than total sales. If so, then the tax

burden and profit rates will be overstated, especially for Russia and Ukraine. But this should not

affect our analysis of reinvestment rates.
        7
            Responses to questions about the entrepreneur’s own profits were provided in

categories. Appendix B (at www.XXX) explains how the numbers in Table 3 were calculated

from these responses. The profit data are also compared in Appendix B to data from the National

Survey of Small Business Finance, conducted in 1993 in the United States among similarly sized

firms (Federal Reserve Board of Governors, 1994).
        8
            Throughout, we use the reported rate of profit as a proxy for the firm’s cash flow

available for reinvestment. In reality, profits and cash flow may diverge for a number of reasons,

in particular depreciation. However, information on depreciation recorded by the firms is not

available from the survey.




                                                   41
        9
            Worldscope also has data for Russia and Slovakia, although this is available for fewer

firms. The average profit-sales ratio in Russia for 1999 is 7.11 percent, although firms with

substantial market power show higher profit rates. Almost all the Slovak firms show losses.
        10
             T-tests comparing the profit rate in the early period (1990-92) with the profit rate in the

last period (1994-96) indicate that the drop in first-year profit rates is significant at the 1 percent

level in Poland (t = 3.38) and in Slovakia (t = 2.96), but not in Romania (t = 0.99), Russia (t =

0.30), or Ukraine (t = 0.61).
        11
             See Appendix B (at www.XXX) for the details of these calculations as well as some

caveats to their interpretation.
        12
             There are no reliable comparable data on credit to the private sector across transition

countries, but the ratio of broad money to GDP provides a rough indicator. In 1996, broad money

was 37.5 percent of GDP in Poland, 28.9 percent in Romania, 13.1 percent in Russia, 71 percent

in Slovakia, and 11.16 percent in Ukraine (EBRD 1997). The real money supply in Russia and

Ukraine fell dramatically between 1991 and 1996, which partially accounts for credit becoming

harder to get in these two countries (EBRD 1997). Of course, our sample has quite different

characteristics from the large state or privatized firms that receive (or do not receive) most of the

credit in these transition economies.
        13
             When lines of credit are excluded, loans were 5.8 percent of sales among the small

manufacturers in the NSSBF survey. Both of these averages assign a value of zero to firms

without loans. (See Appendix B, at www.XXX, for more discussion of the NSSBF data.)

        14
             While the response rate to the collateral question was more than 99 percent in

Romania, it was only 76 percent in Ukraine and 61 percent in Russia. If nonrespondents are less

likely to have collateral, then the numbers in Table 2 may overstate the availability of collateral in

Russia and Ukraine. Still, as a lower bound (taking all nonrespondents as having no collateral),




                                                    42
the survey indicates that more than half of firms in Russia (53 percent) and Ukraine (57 percent)

are able to offer collateral.
           15
                Apparently respondents misunderstood what we were asking. This question may not

have been translated properly.
           16
                The correlations between property rights and access to credit are driven primarily by

differences across countries. When Poland, Slovakia and Romania are separated from Russia and

Ukraine, insecure property rights are positively correlated with a lack of collateral. However, the

correlations are low, all below 0.11, and there is no correlation between security of property

rights and having had a loan before 1996. In Russian and Ukraine, firms with less secure property

rights are more likely to have collateral to offer and to have had a loan before 1996.
           17
                Because of the categorical responses, we cannot determine how many firms obtained

new loans and invested more than 100 percent of their profits, though it is likely that some did.

Just over a fifth of the firms reported investing more than 75 percent of profits, the highest

reinvestment category. In Poland 35 percent of firms reported investing at least 75 percent of

profits.
           18
                We do not use the firm’s own profit rate due to concern about reverse causation: higher

investment levels might lead to higher rates of profits. Given our belief that the manager’s

estimate of industry conditions is based on his own experience, use of industry profits does not

completely eliminate endogeneity concerns. However, none of the results we report are altered if

we use the firm’s profit rate during its first year of operation, or exclude all measures of profits.
           19
                We have run all of the regressions using ordinary least squares, using the midpoint of

the reinvestment categories, with robust standard errors. The results are qualitatively similar to

those reported. We prefer the ordered probit because it does not require the assumption that

investment rates are exactly at the midpoint of the categories specified in the survey. (See




                                                     43
Appendix B, at www.XXX, for the details on the six categories of responses to the reinvestment

question.)
        20
             We use the entrepreneur’s estimate of industry profits rather than the firm’s own profits

because we believe the former are more likely to represent the expected profits from new

investments. Additionally, own profits may be determined in part by reinvestment, creating

endogeneity problems. Nevertheless, when we rerun all of the regressions in Table 6 with own

profits replacing industry profits, we find that own profits are significant everywhere that industry

profits are significant. The property rights index and courts results are not affected.
        21
             Because response rates were lower in Russia and Ukraine, only 14 percent of the

observations in the regressions are firms in those countries. This may explain why the country

controls have only a small impact on the property rights variables.
        22
             Because investment opportunities may be correlated across time within a firm, we had

some concern that either of these variables might be partially endogenous to current reinvestment

rates. Their insignificance in the reinvestment equation suggests that endogeneity of our measures

through temporal correlation of investment rates is not a serious problem.
        23
             Our results are consistent with those found by Andrzej Bratkowski, Irena Grosfeld and

Jacek Rostowski (2000), who find for a sample of new firms in the Czech Republic, Hungary and

Poland that loans are significantly associated with collateral and past loans.
        24
             Low reinvestment may be the result of a high required rate of return, rather than a high

probability of expropriation, because imperfect financial markets mean entrepreneurs bear a large

amount of idiosyncratic risk. Improved capital markets would then facilitate investment because

they would increase diversification possibilities and reduce idiosyncratic risk.




                                                   44
Appendix A: The Sample and the Survey
        The data reported here are from surveys undertaken in Russia and Ukraine in May

and June 1997, and in Poland, Romania and Slovakia in September-December 1997.

Pilot surveys were undertaken in Russia and Ukraine in January-February 1997, in

Poland and Slovakia in March 1997 and in Romania in August 1997. The sample of

about 300 firms in each country was drawn from a list provided by the country’s official

statistical office. In order to increase the cross-country comparability of the sample, the

initial selection was limited to one medium-sized city in each country: Katowice

(Poland), Brasov (Romania), Bratislava (Slovakia), Volgograd (Russia) and

Dnepopetrovsk (Ukraine). Only in Slovakia did we have trouble identifying a large

enough sample of firms meeting our size criteria who were willing to participate. In the

final sample, about one-quarter of the Slovakian firms are located in Bratislava, one-

quarter in Kosice, and the remaining half are spread across seven other cities.

Participation rates were high among the firms contacted—in excess of 70% in Poland and

Romania, and 68% in Slovakia. We believe the resulting sample is reasonably

representative of small and medium-sized manufacturing firms in each country, though it

is not a census.1

        Appendix Table 1 provides a summary of the characteristics of firms in the

sample. Most were started in 1990 or after; many within 3 years of the survey. Only in

Poland was a significant share of the firms founded before 1988. The majority of firms in

Russia and Ukraine were privatized, or spun off from state-owned enterprises; the

majority in the other three countries started from scratch, with none of their equipment

coming from state-owned enterprises.



1
  In Russia, in particular, there is considerable regional variation in new firm activity, so results
for one city are not necessarily true of other regions. See Berkowitz and DeJong (2000).
        At least 85% of the entrepreneurs in each of the countries report that they have

previous experience working in a state enterprise. Previous work experience in the

private sector is much more common for startup firms than spin-offs. At least 29% of

startup entrepreneurs have prior private sector experience in every country except

Romania. In all five countries the educational background of entrepreneurs is similar; the

average amount of schooling is 15-16 years everywhere.

        Measured by employment, in all five countries spinoffs were much larger in their

first year of operation than the startups. The startups were smallest at birth in Slovakia

and largest in Poland, though there is not a large difference among the countries in the

average size of startups in their first year.

        In Poland, Romania and Slovakia, the sample was drawn so that one-quarter of

the firms were from the same industry, metal parts and products. Nearly a fifth of the

Ukrainian firms and one-eighth of the Russian firms also produce metal products. The

remaining firms are spread across manufacturing sectors, as shown in Appendix Table 1.

        The survey was administered face-to-face in the local language by interviewers

contracted in each country, with responses provided by the entrepreneur (typically also

the general manager) or deputy general manager of each firm. The largest part of the

survey is a series of questions related to the longest running and newest customer and

supplier relationships. There are also sections on the resolution of contract disputes with

customers and suppliers, access to formal bank finance, hidden and unofficial payments,

and a set of general questions regarding the size and profitability of the firms.
Appendix B: Finance variables


       Because of the sensitivity of the issues, entrepreneurs were asked for profit and

reinvestment rates by category. For profits as a percent of sales, the categories were:

negative, 0%, 1-10%, 11-20%, 21-40% and more than 40%. For the percentage of profits

reinvested, the categories were 0%, 1-10%, 11-25%, 26-49%, 51-75% and more than

75%. The midpoint of each category was used in compiling Table 1. For example, firms

reporting profits between 1 and 10% of sales were assigned profit rates of 5% of sales,

those reporting profits 11-20% of sales, 15%, and so on. Firms reporting negative profits

were assigned a value of –5% of sales and firms reporting profits of more than 40% of

sales were assigned values of 45% of sales. Only a small percentage of the firms have

profits which are negative (5.2%) or greater than 40% of sales (2.3%).

       To benchmark our survey responses, we compare them with data from the

National Survey of Small Business Finances (NSSBF), conducted in the United States in

1993 (Federal Reserve Board of Governors, 1994). Of 4637 firms in the NSSFB, 344 are

manufacturers with between 10 and 270 employees. The average size of firms in this

subsample of the NSSBF is 77 employees, somewhat larger than the average of 55

employees in our sample. The US firms are more likely to report negative profits (23%

vs. 5% of the firms in our survey) or positive profits below 10% of sales (60% vs. 35%),

and less likely to report profits of 10-20% of sales (8% vs. 40%) or profits of 20-40% of

sales (2% vs. 15%). In both samples, 2% reports profits in excess of 40% of sales. The

average profit rate for US manufactures is 3.4% of sales, lower than each of the countries

in our survey. This average is impacted by values in the tails of the distribution. When the

US data are recoded to correspond to the categories in our survey, (i.e., profits above 0

and less than 10% recoded as 5%, and so on), the average profit in the sample of US

manufacturers is 4.4%.2

2
  When manufacturers with less than 10 or more than 270 employees are included, the US profit
rates are higher – 4.8% using the raw data and 6.5% using the categories.
       The higher profit rate found when the US data is recoded to our categories raises

the question of whether our estimated profits are similarly biased upward. Two factors

account for approximately equal shares of the upward bias in the US estimates. First, the

categorical data crops the lower (and upper) tail of the distribution. The average profit

rate in the lower tail is much lower than –5% in the US data. Since the lower tail is much

smaller in our data, we expect that –5% is a better representation for our data. Second,

within each category, the distribution is weighted toward firms with lower profit levels.

Thus there are more firms in the US sample earning profits that are 1%-5% of sales than

firms earning profits that are 6%-10% of sales. As a result, using the midpoint of the

range overstates the average profit rate in the range. For our data, the number of firms

reporting 11-20% profits is as large as the number reporting 1-10%. So we would not

expect the midpoint to be biased for the 1-10% group. On the other hand, there are a

lower number of firms in higher profit categories in our data, as in the US. In the US

data, the average profit rate of all firms earning 10-20% is 14%, and the average for firms

earning 20-40% is 28%. Using these values with our data lowers the average profit rate

shown in the first line of Table 1 to 9.4% in Poland, 5.4% in Slovakia, 12.2% in

Romania, 19.4% in Russia and 17.0% in Ukraine. Note that the categories do not affect

the reinvestment regressions shown in Table 6 because responses to the industry profit

rate are continuous rather than categorical.

       For reinvested profits as a percent of sales, there is another potential bias in our

estimates. We obtain the estimate of each firm’s internally generated investment as a

percent of sales by multiplying estimated profits as a percent of sales by the reinvestment

rate. Across categories there is a positive correlation between reinvestment rates and

profit rates. If the same is true within categories, then the numbers of Table 1 may

understate the reinvestment of profits and overstate the unreinvested profits.

       To give some idea of the potential magnitude of the error caused by using the

midpoints of ranges, we calculated a lower bound on the unreinvested profits in the five
countries. We did this by taking the lowest value in each range for profits (e.g., 1% for

the 1%-10% category) and the highest value in each range for the reinvestment rate (e.g.,

10% for 1%-10%). These provide a lower bound on the profit rate, and an upper bound

on the reinvestment rate. Multiplying the lower-bound profit rate by 100% minus the

upper-bound reinvestment rate provides a lower bound for profits that are not reinvested.

The lower bound estimates of unreinvested profits as a percent of sales are 7.5% in

Ukraine (compared to 12.3% on Table 1) , 6.7% in Russia (11.7%), 2.7% in Romania

(5.7%), 2.3% in Poland (4.8%) and 1.5% in Slovakia (3.6%). The levels in Russia and

Ukraine, which certainly underestimate the level of unreinvested profits, are still far

above the average level of bank credit in any of the five countries (see Table 2).

       Finally, the data on Tables 1 and 2 are unweighted averages of the firms in the

sample. Since our loan regressions (not reported but available from the authors) indicate

that larger firms are more likely to receive loans, the data may understate the importance

of bank credit in these countries. We have also calculated weighted averages for loans,

reinvested profits and unreinvested profits, using the number of employees as weights.

Employment-weighted data for bank credit and unreinvested profits produce the same

pattern as the unweighted data in four of the five countries. In Slovakia, however,

employment-weighted bank loans average 3.9% of sales (compared with an unweighted

average of 2.5% shown on Table 2) and employment-weighted unreinvested profits

average 3.3% of sales. Hence, in Slovakia, the employment-weighted data suggest that

bank credit is larger than the level of unreinvested profits.

                                    Relevant Excerpts from the Questionnaire


The purpose of this survey is to gather information on institutional constraints and adaptation in SME
Development in Poland/Slovakia/Romania (Interviewer: Read out appropriate country). This study is
commissioned by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and MEMRB were

Profit reinvestment as a percent of profits excludes firms with zero or negative profits. In order to make the data more
comparable to the external finance data shown in Table 4, we assume that firms with negative or zero profits reinvest
zero percent of sales and have unreinvested profits of zero percent of sales. Profit reinvestment as a percent of annual
sales is calculated by multiplying profits as a percent of sales by profit reinvestment as a percent of profits. Unreinvested
profits as a percent of sales is calculated as profits as a percent of sales times one minus profit reinvestment as a percent
of profits. See Appendix B for more detail on the calculations.

Regressions are ordered probits. The dependent variable is the firm's profit reinvestment rate, divided into categories, with a higher value indicating more investment as a percent of profits
(see Appendix B for details). T-statistics based on robust standard errors are in parentheses. Country and industry controls are interacted when both are included. Manager controls are
manager's age and education level, an indicator that the manager was previously a high level manager in an SOE and an indicator that the manager has previous expericence in the private
sector.

We calculate the probability of being in each investment category conditional on different values of the property rights index. We
use the regression reported in Column 6 of Table 6, utilizing the four-element security index (i.e., including belief in the
effectiveness of the courts). The last row of Table 7 shows the weighted average reinvestment rate for each value of the index, using
the midpoint of each reinvestment category

All regressions are ordered probits. The dependent variable is the level of investment, divided into categories, with a higher
value indicating more investment as a percent of profits (see Appendix B for details). All regressions also include the
entrepreneur's estimate of the industry profit rate and the age of the firm. T-statistics based on robust standard errors are in
parentheses.
