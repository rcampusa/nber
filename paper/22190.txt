What Explains the Flow of Foreign Fighters to ISIS?

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper provides the first systematic analysis of the link between economic, political, and
social conditions and the global phenomenon of ISIS foreign fighters. We find that poor
economic conditions do not drive participation in ISIS. In contrast, the number of ISIS foreign
fighters is positively correlated with a country's GDP per capita and Human Development Index
(HDI). In fact, many foreign fighters originate from countries with high levels of economic
development, low income inequality, and highly developed political institutions. Other factors
that explain the number of ISIS foreign fighters are the size of a country's Muslim population and
its ethnic homogeneity. Although we cannot directly determine why people join ISIS, our results
suggest that the flow of foreign fighters to ISIS is driven not by economic or political conditions
but rather by ideology and the difficulty of assimilation into homogeneous Western countries.

1.       Introduction

About 30,000 fighters from at least 85 countries have joined the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
(ISIS) as of December 2015. Although the great majority of ISIS recruits come from the Middle
East and the Arab world, many foreign fighters also come from Western nations, including most
members of the European Union, as well as the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
Thousands of fighters from Russia and hundreds from Indonesia and Tajikistan have also joined
ISIS. The recruitment of foreign fighters to join ISIS is a global phenomenon.1
      Because of the threat ISIS poses to other nations, it is critical to understand the factors that lead
foreigners to join this Islamic jihadist state. Foreign recruits represent a threat to the international
community for a number of reasons. After joining ISIS, they engage in combat in Syria and Iraq
against ISIS enemies. They also can easily return home from combat largely unnoticed on their
government-issued passports. As returnees trained in terrorist tactics and furnished with new
connections, these fighters can create terror networks to commit attacks at home (Hegghammer,
2013). For example, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the alleged leader of the cell that committed the Paris
attacks in November 2015, visited Syria, returned radicalized, and recruited an extensive network
of accomplices to conduct the attacks (The Guardian, November 18, 2015).
      Foreign fighters also provide ISIS with the human capital needed to operate in foreign countries.
Once in Syria or Iraq, they can recruit operatives and lead them to commit attacks in Western
countries without even returning home. As FBI director James Comey stated (House Homeland
Security Committee Hearing, September 2014),

        Foreign fighters traveling to Syria or Iraq could, for example, gain battlefield experience
        and increased exposure to violent extremist elements ... they may use these skills and
        exposure to radical ideology to return to their countries of origin, including the United
        States, to conduct attacks on the Homeland.


The extreme gravity of this phenomenon leads us to ask: Why do people from all over the world
join ISIS? We provide the first systematic analysis of the link between economic, political, and
social conditions with the global phenomenon of ISIS foreign fighters. We combine a detailed data
set on the number of ISIS foreign fighters emerging from countries around the world with data on
  1
      The only country in the Middle East for which there are no records of ISIS foreign fighters is Cyprus.

countries’ social, political, and economic indicators. These indicators capture individual countries?
political freedom, social fragmentation, economic development, inequality, and unemployment.
   We find that poor economic conditions do not drive participation in ISIS. In contrast, the
number of ISIS foreign fighters is positively correlated with a country’s GDP per capita and its
Human Development Index (HDI). In fact, many foreign fighters originate from countries with high
levels of economic development, low income inequality, and highly developed political institutions.
Other factors that explain the number of ISIS foreign fighters are the size of a country’s Muslim
population and the degree of its homogeneity. Interestingly, a country’s political characteristics
are not correlated with the number of ISIS fighters from that country. The results are robust for
different empirical specifications, econometric models, and samples of countries.
   The notion that social, economic, and political conditions may correlate with terrorism is not
new. The widespread view among policy makers after the 9/11 attacks is that poverty breeds
terrorism. This view is based largely on research into the economics of conflict, which suggest that
political unrest is correlated with poor economic conditions. For example, Alesina et al. (1996)
argue that poor economic conditions increase the likelihood of political coups, and Collier and
Hoeffer (2004) and Miguel, Satyanath, and Sergenti (2004) show that poor economic conditions are
correlated with civil wars.
   A growing body of empirical literature either confirms a negative correlation between terrorism
and economic prosperity [Abadie (2006); Benmelech, Berrebi, and Klor (2012)] or finds no corre-
lation between the two [Krueger and Maleckova (2003); Drakos and Gofas (2006); Piazza (2006);
Krueger and Laitin (2008)]. To our knowledge, our study is the first to find a robust positive cor-
relation between GDP per capita, HDI, and volunteering into an insurgent army. It even contrasts
with a similar analysis by Krueger (2006) that focuses on foreign fighters captured in Iraq in 2005.
As in our study, Krueger (2006) finds that countries with a large Muslim population are more likely
to have more of their citizens join the Iraqi insurgency. Contrary to our findings, however, Krueger
(2006) reports that low levels of civil liberties or political rights are associated with a larger number
of foreign fighters captured in Iraq, and he finds no correlation between the number of fighters and
GDP per capita.
   Our results indicate that foreign recruits into terror organizations come from a new type of
country: they come largely from prosperous, ethnically and linguistically homogenous countries.
We believe that this novel finding is explained by the willingness of individuals to volunteer into ISIS

                                                   2
(the supply of foreign fighters) and by ISIS recruitment strategy (the demand for foreign fighters).
As much of the previous literature states, most recruits are driven by religious and political ideology.
Our analysis suggests that the more homogenous the host country is, the more difficulties Muslim
immigrants experience in their process of assimilation. This induces some of them to radicalization
(Gould and Klor, 2016). On the demand side, it is documented that ISIS targets recruits from
prosperous Western countries (Weiss and Hassan, 2014). These recruits bring to ISIS all the
benefits mentioned above. ISIS lures this target audience by preying on impressionable youth
through its sophisticated propaganda machine and use of social media.
     The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in the paper
and presents the summary statistics. Section 3 contains the empirical analysis of the determinants
of ISIS foreign fighters. Section 4 concludes.


2.     Data and Summary Statistics

The main data set used here comes from two reports issued by the Soufan Group, which provides
strategic security intelligence to governments and multinational organizations. The first report,
Foreign Fighters in Syria, by Richard Barrett, was published in June 2014 (Barrett, 2014). This
report calculates the number of ISIS foreign fighters from each country using official estimates of
the number of citizens and residents of each country who have traveled to fight in Syria. According
to Barrett (2014, p. 11), the figures are based generally on information gathered from social media,
community sources, or investigations. Because ISIS prefers to conceal the identity of its members,
it is likely that the reported numbers underestimate the actual number of recruits. As Barrett
(2014, p. 12) writes:

       It is only when someone dies that his family learns that he went to Syria, either through
       a telephone call from a friend designated by the dead fighter for that purpose, or through
       a death notice published on a group’s website, Facebook page or Twitter feed.

Barrett (2014) provides estimates of the number of citizens or residents who have joined ISIS and
have traveled to fight in Syria for 25 countries. He also lists 57 countries from which citizens or
residents are reported to have joined ISIS and traveled to fight in Syria but for which no official
count exists.
     A report by the Soufan Group updates the numbers in Barrett (2014). This report, titled

                                                   3
Foreign Fighters: An Updated Assessment of the Flow of Foreign Fighters into Syria and Iraq
(Soufan Group, 2015), was released in December 2015. In addition to providing data on 65 countries
of the number of citizens or residents who have joined ISIS and have traveled to fight in Syria and
Iraq, the report lists 20 nations from which citizens or residents are reported to have joined ISIS
and traveled to fight in Syria but for which no official or unofficial count exists.

2.1.    Ranking of ISIS Foreign Fighters by Country

Table 1 ranks countries based on the number of its citizens or residents who have become ISIS
fighters. The information is based on data in Soufan Group (2015). For each country, the official
count of ISIS foreign fighters is listed along with unofficial estimates when available. As the table
demonstrates, Tunisia has the highest number of ISIS foreign fighters (6,000), followed by Saudi
Arabia (2,500), Russia (2,400), Turkey (2,100), and Jordan (2,000). Among countries in Western
Europe, France has the highest number of ISIS foreign fighters (1,700), followed by Germany (760),
the United Kingdom (760), and Belgium (470). Cambodia, Moldova, Romania, and South Africa
have only one ISIS foreign fighter each.
    Table 2 provides information on the 15 countries for which there are only unofficial counts
(Soufan Group, 2015). According to unofficial data, there are 600 ISIS foreign fighters from Libya,
followed by 500 from Kyrgyzstan, and 360 from Turkmenistan. Kuwait and Somalia have 70 ISIS
fighters each, followed by Serbia with 60, and Afghanistan, Georgia, and Trinidad and Tobago with
50 each.2 Table 3 lists the 20 countries for which there are indications that citizens or residents
have left to join ISIS and fight in Syria or Iraq but no official or unofficial count exists.
    Next, we calculate the number of ISIS foreign fighters per million by dividing the number of ISIS
fighters from each country by the country’s population (in millions), using data from the World
Bank. We use the official count of foreign fighters for countries when this figure is available (Table
1). Otherwise, we use the unofficial count presented in Table 2. Table 4 shows the population-
based ranking of ISIS fighters. Tunisia ranks first in the number of ISIS foreign fighters to overall
population, with 545.5 ISIS fighters per million individuals, followed by the Maldives (500 per
million), Jordan (303 per million), and Lebanon (200 per million). Among Western European
countries, Belgium ranks first (42 per million), followed by Austria (35.3 per million), Sweden (30.9
  2
    In cases in which either the official or the unofficial count is reported as a range in the report by The Soufan
Group (2015) we use the mid-range point as the count number.




                                                         4
per million), and France (25.7 per million).
    Table 5 shows the number of ISIS foreign fighters relative to the Muslim population in each
country (in millions).3 As the table illustrates, Finland has the largest number of ISIS foreign
fighters relative to the size of its Muslim population, followed by Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, and
Austria. This table already suggests that inequality and poverty are unlikely to be root causes of
recruits joining ISIS. After all, Finland’s GDP per capita in 2010 was equal to $46,205, and it has
a Gini coefficient of 27.1, which makes it not only one of the wealthiest countries in the world but
also the 11th most egalitarian. Likewise Norway, which ranks fourth worldwide in terms of equality
and in the top fifth percentile in GDP per capita, is in the top ten countries with the most ISIS
fighters relative to its Muslim population. Belgium and Sweden, which rank third and fourth in the
number of ISIS fighters in Table 5, are respectively the 12th and 15th most egalitarian countries in
the world.

2.2.    Summary Statistics

Table 6 presents descriptive statistics for the number of foreign fighters and the social, economic,
and political indicators used in the empirical analysis. It reports mean, 25th, and 75th percentiles
along with the median, the standard deviation, the minimum and maximum, and the number of
observations for each variable.
    The mean number of ISIS foreign fighters is 164.29, with a standard deviation of 594.78. In
calculating the number of ISIS fighters, we omit the countries reported in Table 3, given that
information on their number of foreign fighters is unavailable. Next, we define a dummy variable
that takes the value of 1 for countries with at least one ISIS fighter (including countries listed in
Table 3), and zero otherwise. As Table 6 shows, 43.5% of countries have a positive number of ISIS
fighters who have traveled to fight in Syria and Iraq.4 The mean population of countries in the
sample is 36.74 million individuals, with an average Muslim population of 24.2% and a median of
2.7%.
    We use the World Bank’s GDP per capita (in current US prices, 2010) as our first measure of
economic development. The GDP per capita in 2010 ranges from $214 to $145,221 with a mean
(median) of $14,404 ($5,056). We also use the United Nations Human Development Index (HDI)
  3
    The data on Muslim populations are as of 2010 and were obtained from the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan
American think tank that provides information on social issues, public opinion, and demographic trends.
  4
    Given that the analysis in this paper focuses on foreign fighters we exclude Iraq and Syria from the sample.



                                                       5
from 2010 as an alternative measure of economic development. The HDI measures the well-being
of the residents of a country based on three different dimensions: education, health, and income.
This measure is constructed using country data on life expectancy at birth, school enrollment ratio,
adult literacy, and GDP per capita. The index has a potential range of zero to 1, though the actual
minimum is 0.326 (Niger) and the maximum is 0.94 (Norway). As a measure of income inequality,
we focus on the Gini Index, which is available from the World Bank database for 151 countries. The
Gini Index ranges from a minimum of 16.6 (Azerbaijan) to a maximum of 63.4 (South Africa), with
a mean of 39.36. Our final economic measure is unemployment. The unemployment rate across
the 164 countries for which data are available in 2010 is on average 8.61%, with a 25th percentile
of 4.65% and a 75th percentile of 10.50%.
   As our measure of political freedom, we use Freedom House’s Political Rights for the year 2010.
The Political Rights Index ranges from 1 to 7, with high values representing the absence of political
rights. Table 6 shows that at least 25% of the countries in our sample are full democracies with a
political rights index equal to 1.
   We also include in our analysis indices for ethnic, linguistic, and religious fractionalization.
These indices were built in Alesina et al. (2003) and have been updated every year since by the
Quality of Government Institute at the University of Gothenburg. The indices calculate the proba-
bility that two randomly selected individuals from a given country will not share the same ethnicity,
language, and religion. As with all previous measures, the indices show a great deal of variation
among the countries in our sample. Korea, Japan, and Portugal are examples of countries with
very low ethnic and linguistic fractionalization, whereas African countries (for example, Cameroon,
Kenya, and Liberia) show high levels of ethnic and linguistic fractionalization. Muslim countries
tend to have low levels of religious fractionalization (for example, Algeria, Morocco, and Turkey are
all below 0.01), whereas Australia, the United States, and South Africa are the three countries with
the highest levels of religious fractionalization (their levels are 0.821, 0.824, and 0.86, respectively).
   Last, we collect information on the distance in kilometers between each of the countries and
Syria. The mean distance is 6,265.9 kilometers and ranges from a minimum of 84 kilometers to a
maximum of 16,651 kilometers.

3.     Empirical Analysis
3.1.    Determinants of ISIS Foreign Fighters

Before we move into the systematic analysis of the determinants of ISIS foreign fighters, we provide
a preview of the main correlations of interest in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 presents scatter plots
(together with the estimated linear fit) of the economic indices used in the analysis with the number
of ISIS foreign fighters normalized by each country’s Muslim population. Figure 2 presents similar
scatter plots but focuses on the Political Rights Index and the available indices of fractionalization.
Only countries with a positive number of ISIS foreign fighters are included in the plots.
     Figure 1 shows that the number of ISIS foreign fighters per Muslim residents is (i) positively
correlated with GDP per capita and with HDI, the available measures of economic prosperity; (ii)
negatively correlated with economic inequality; and (iii) not highly correlated with unemployment.
These findings directly contradict the recent assertions of Thomas Piketty, the prominent scholar
of income inequality. In an op-ed published in Le Monde in the aftermath of the recent Paris
terror attacks, Piketty (2015) claims that “only an equitable model for social development will
overcome hatred.” The large number of foreign fighters coming from highly equitable and wealthy
countries like Finland, Belgium, and Sweden (see Table 5) and the correlations shown in Figure 1
run contrary to those claims.
     Figure 2 presents a similar picture regarding the Political Rights Index and the factionalization
indices. The figure shows that most ISIS foreign fighters come from established democracies at the
top of the scale on political rights. It is also evident that societies with lower levels of ethnic and
linguistic fractionalization contribute more foreign fighters to ISIS per number of Muslim residents.
     We turn next to the regression analysis, in which we use different empirical models to estimate
the determinants of the flows of ISIS foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria. Table 7 reports results from
a probit regression estimating the probability that at least one foreign fighter from a given country
joins ISIS. We define a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 for all countries in Tables 1, 2,
and 3, and zero otherwise. We use the dummy variable as our dependent variable in the regression
analysis reported in Table 7.
     In Column (1) of Table 7 we focus exclusively on the economic determinants of joining ISIS.
We add to our model political and social variables in Column (2), and we include continent fixed
effects in Column (3). As an overall measure of the country’s level of development we use the log of


                                                   7
GDP per capita in the year 2010 in the first three columns of the table. In Column (4) we use an
alternative measure of development instead of GDP per capita – the Human Development Index
– a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and income per capita indicators, which are
used to rank countries into four tiers of human development. In Column (5) we focus on the Gini
Index as a measure of income inequality.
   As Table 7 demonstrates, a country’s population size and the size of its Muslim population
are significant determinants of the number of ISIS foreign fighters originating from the country.
According to the estimated coefficients, a 10% increase in the size of the Muslim population (relative
to its mean) increases the likelihood that there will be at least one ISIS foreign fighter by 1.2
percentage points.
   As the first three columns of the table show, GDP per capita and the likelihood that at least
one fighter from a given country joins ISIS are highly positively correlated. The coefficient is also
of a substantial magnitude: A 10% increase in GDP per capita is associated with an increase of 1.5
percentage points in the likelihood that citizens and residents of the country end up joining ISIS.
   Similar to the positive association between GDP per capita and the likelihood of joining ISIS,
we find in Column (4) that an alternative measure of development – the Human Development
Index – is also positively correlated with the likelihood of joining ISIS. We turn next to analyze the
impact of the income inequality on the probability that an individual from the country joins ISIS.
Interestingly, Column (5) of Table 7 demonstrates that the marginal effect of the Gini Index of
income inequality is negative (though not precisely estimated). In contrast to the assertions made
by Piketty (2015), we do not find that an increase in income inequality is associated with an increase
in the likelihood of joining ISIS. Moreover, we find a positive correlation between unemployment
and ISIS foreign fighters – although, as we show in our robustness tests Tables, this correlation is
driven entirely by Muslim countries.
   Moving to the political variables, we conjecture that the inability of individuals to participate
freely in the political process and exercise freedom of expression and belief may lead to radicalization
and increase the likelihood of joining ISIS. Yet, as Columns (2) through (5) of Table 7 show, we
find that a country’s political characteristics are not correlated with the propensity to join ISIS.
   In unreported results we focus exclusively on countries whose Muslim population is less than one
third of their total population. When we run the regressions using the subsample of non-Muslim
countries, we obtain results that are almost identical to those reported in Table 7 with the full

                                                   8
set of countries. The only difference between the results is that unemployment is not a significant
determinant of the likelihood of joining ISIS in non-Muslim countries. That is, we observe a
positive correlation between indicators of economic prosperity and the likelihood of joining ISIS,
whereas income inequality, unemployment, and social and political conditions are not determinants
of joining ISIS in non-Muslim countries.

3.2.      Robustness Tests

In this subsection we test the robustness of the baseline findings reported in Table 7 to alternative
estimations and model specifications. In Table 8 we conduct similar analysis to Table 7 using the
log of the number of ISIS fighters from each country as the dependent variable. We use the group
of countries for which the number of ISIS foreign fighters is known either officially or non-officially
(Tables 1 and 2), as well as all countries for which there are no ISIS foreign fighters – that is, all
the other countries in the world excluding those countries in Table 3, resulting in 143 countries.5
We set the number of ISIS foreign fighters at zero for all countries that are not listed in Tables 1,
2, and, 3, and the dependent variable is defined as the log of (1+Number of ISIS fighters).
       The results in Table 8 are generally similar to those documented in Table 7. As Table 8 shows,
the main determinants of the number of ISIS foreign fighters are the size of the country’s Muslim
population, its economic prosperity – measured by either GDP per capita or HDI – and its ethnic
fractionalization.6
       We estimate regressions for all countries (Columns (1) - (5)) as well as for only non-Muslim
countries – countries whose Muslim population is less than one third of their total population – in
Columns (6)-(8). As the table demonstrates, whereas general measures of economic development
such as GDP per capita and HDI are positively correlated with the number of ISIS foreign fighters,
unemployment is positively associated with the number of ISIS foreign fighters only in Muslim
countries. Moreover, our measure of income inequality (Gini) is not correlated with the number of
ISIS foreign fighters in either sample.
       As Column (6) of Table 8 demonstrates, among non-Muslim countries, the elasticities of ISIS
foreign fighters to the Muslim population and GDP per capita are 0.384 and 0.507, respectively.
   5
     Countries in Table 3 are countries with ISIS foreign fighters but for which official or non-official counts are not
available.
   6
     The three available measures of fractionalization are highly correlated. Hence, from Table 8 onwards we include
only ethnic fractionalization in the empirical models to avoid concerns related to multicollinearity. We obtain the
same results if we include either of the other two available measures of fractionalization.


                                                           9
That is, an increase of 10% in the size of the Muslim population is associated with an increase of
3.8% in the number of ISIS foreign fighters, and an increase of 10% in GDP per capita is associated
with an increase of 5.1% in the number of ISIS foreign fighters. This column also shows that ethnic
fractionalization is highly negatively correlated with the number of ISIS foreign fighters – implying
that these fighters tend to come from more ethnically homogenous societies.
   Whereas in Table 7 we studied the “extensive margin” of ISIS foreign fighters, Table 9 focuses
on the “intensive margin.” That is, conditional on a country having at least one ISIS foreign fighter,
how do different variables affect the number of ISIS foreign fighters from a particular country? For
this purpose, Table 9 further restricts the sample by looking only at countries with both an official
or a non-official count of ISIS foreign fighters and, according to these data, with at least one foreign
fighter. We use the official count whenever it is available (the countries listed in Table 1) and the
non-official count when an official count does not exist (the list of countries in Table 2), and we
define the dependent variable as the log of the number of ISIS fighters.
   Count data, official or non-official, exists for 65 countries. Given that data on the explanatory
variables does not exist for every country – the final sample that is used in the regression in the
first column includes 61 countries with non-zero count data. Of course, this limits the available
variation in the data, especially when we also control for continent fixed effects. As before, we
include all countries with available information in Columns (1)-(5) and non-Muslim countries in
Columns (6)-(8).
   As Table 9 illustrates, the elasticity of the number of ISIS fighters to the size of the country’s
Muslim population is significant at the 1% level and is between 0.718 and 1.110. That is, a 10%
increase in the size of the Muslim population is associated with between seven and 10% increase in
the number of ISIS foreign fighters. Although the smaller sample size does not allow us to estimate
the coefficients on the economic and social variables with sufficient precision, their sign and magni-
tudes are in line with those estimated in Table 8. The estimates in Table 9 confirm the conclusion
from the previous tables that dire economic conditions are not root causes of participation in ISIS
operation in Iraq and Syria.
   We next analyze the link between the number of ISIS foreign fighters and economic conditions
using a count data model because the dependent variable is a nonnegative integer, and we report
the results in Table 10. One common feature of count data (which also holds in the ISIS foreign
fighters data) is that the conditional variance is higher than the conditional mean – that is, the

                                                  10
data exhibit overdispersion. Given the overdispersion in the number of ISIS foreign fighters, we use
a negative binomial model to estimate the effects of economic, political, and social conditions on
the number of foreign fighters in each country.
     Consistent with the previous analyses, Table 10 also shows that (i) there exists a positive and
highly significant correlation between the number of ISIS foreign fighters and the size of the local
Muslim population; (ii) the number of ISIS foreign fighters and economic development (measured
by either GDP per capita or HDI) are positively correlated; and (iii) there is a negative correlation
between social fractionalization and the number of ISIS foreign fighters. Interestingly, our negative
binomial estimates suggest not only that income inequality does not lead to more participation in
ISIS but, in fact, that income inequality exhibits a significant negative correlation with the number
of ISIS foreign fighters. That is, controlling for other socioeconomic variables, income inequality is
associated with fewer – not more – ISIS foreign fighters.


4.     Conclusion

Using data on the number of ISIS foreign fighters from around the world, we provide a systematic
analysis of the link between economic, political, and social conditions and the global phenomenon of
ISIS foreign fighters. Our results show that, in contrast to conjectures made recently by economists
and policy makers, economic conditions are not the root causes of the global phenomenon of ISIS
foreign fighters. In fact, many foreign fighters originate from countries with high levels of economic
development, low income inequality, and highly developed political institutions.
     If poverty and lack of social equality are not to blame, then why are Western European coun-
tries disproportionately significant sources of ISIS foreign fighters? The reason lies in other country
characteristics: they are ethnically and linguistically homogenous. In fact, the more homogenous
the host country is, the greater difficulty immigrants such as Muslims from the Middle East ex-
perience in assimilating. As other research has shown, isolation induces some of them to become
radicalized.
