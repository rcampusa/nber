Wage dispersion between and within plants: Sweden 1985-2000

                                                ABSTRACT

The paper describes the Swedish wage distribution and how it correlates with worker mobility and
plant-specific factors. It is well known that wage inequality has increased in Sweden since the mid-1980s.
However, little evidence has so far been available as to whether this development reflects increased
dispersion between plants, between individuals in the same plant, or both. We use a new linked employer-employee
data set and discover that a trend rise in between-plant wage inequality account for the entire increase
in wage dispersion. This pattern, which remains when we control for observable individual human
capital characteristics, may reflect increased sorting of workers by skill levels and/or increased scope
for rent sharing in local wage negotiations. Our discussion suggests that both factors may have become
more important.

Over the period lasting from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s, Sweden
experienced a sharp decline in wage inequality. Overall wage inequality fell
along with educational wage differentials and wage differentials between young
and older workers. This development came to a halt in the mid-1980s and the
subsequent years have seen a reversal of previous trends. The rise in wage
inequality since the mid-1980s has been particularly marked for private sector
workers (le Grand et al, 2001).
    The causes of the fall of Swedish wage inequality have been discussed in
Edin and Holmlund (1995), Hibbs (1990) and other contributions. Institutional
factors almost certainly played a role. The so called solidarity wage policy
pursued by the major trade union confederation was clearly attempting to
reduce wage differentials and appeared to have been successful in these
ambitions. However, there is also evidence that the usual supply and demand
factors played some role, in particular concerning the evolution of educational
wage differentials. Changes in the university wage premium (college versus
high school) are strongly negatively correlated with changes in the relative
supply of university educated people in the labor force up to the mid-1990s.
From the mid-1990s, however, this pattern no longer holds. The university wage
premium has continued to increase despite a continuous increase in the relative
supply of university educated people in the labor force (Gustavsson, 2004).
    Earlier studies of changes in Swedish wage inequality have been silent on
the question as to what extent the changes are attributable to changes in
dispersion between and within firms or plants. The main contribution of the
present paper is to document how wage dispersion between and within plants
has evolved since the mid-1980s. We use hitherto largely unexploited data and
find a continuous rise in between-plant wage inequality. This development may
reflect increased sorting of workers by skill levels so that high-skilled and low-
skilled workers to a greater extent are found in different plants. Another
possibility is that the importance of rent sharing at the plant level has increased,
perhaps reflecting stronger local unions or more scope for differential wage
outcomes due to a greater between-plant variation in the ability to pay. Our data
do not allow clean tests of alternative hypotheses but they suggest that both
sorting and genuine plant effects may have become more important.


2
    Our paper also includes a fairly detailed descriptive analysis of the
associations between worker mobility at the plant level and various measures of
wage inequality within and between plants. This analysis confirms some
wellknown stylized facts: most mobility takes place in the lower part of the
plant’s wage distribution, both in terms of exit and entry; mobility rates are
strongly pro-cyclical; and smaller plants experience higher mobility.
    The plan of the paper is as follows. We begin in section 2 by giving a brief
overview of the Swedish labor market institutions, the turbulent macroeconomic
events of the 1990s and evolution of labor mobility and fixed-term contracts as
a background to the analysis of wages and mobility later in the paper. Section 3
describes the data, section 4 provides snapshots of plant wages and mobility and
section 5 portrays in some detail the evolution of the wage structure. Section 6
provides a discussion and section 7 concludes.

Swedish legislation on employment protection dates back to the 1974
Employment Protection Act, which has remained largely intact over the past
three decades. The law presumes that an employment contract is valid until
further notice, unless stated otherwise. An employer must provide a valid reason
for terminating a contract. “Lack of work” is valid reason and the employer’s
assessment of whether there is lack of work can not be disputed in court.
Layoffs have to be notified to workers several months ahead of their
implementation and must, in general, proceed according to seniority. No
redundancy pay is stipulated in the law although such pay may be part of
employer-union deals at the plant level.
   The legislation allows for temporary (fixed-term) contracts. For example, the
law has always permitted the use of temporary contracts to replace an absent

                                                                                             3
worker. Another common form of temporary contract involves project work in
construction or research. Contracts for probationary periods are also allowed.
   During the 1990s there have been no significant reforms of the Employment
Protection Act concerning the termination of open-ended contracts. There have,
however, been several changes to the statutory regulation of fixed-term
contracts. In January 1994 the maximum permitted duration for probationary
contracts and those motivated by a temporary increase in labour demand were
prolonged from six to twelve months. However, this was immediately repealed
in January 1995. The reforms of 1997 were arguably more important. The
employer was now given the opportunity to hire for a fixed duration without
having to specify a particular reason. However, an employer could only use a
maximum of five such contracts and a particular individual could not be
employed under such a contract for more than twelve months during a three-
year period. If the plant is newly established, the period may be extended to 18
months.
   Another important element of the 1997 law was the opportunity to strike
collective agreements on derogations from statutory law regarding fixed-term
contracts at the local level, provided that the parties had a central agreement in
other matters. Prior to 1997, these agreements could only be made at the central
level.
   Comparisons with employment protection in other countries suggest that the
Swedish legislation is neither very stringent, not very liberal. The OECD-
comparisons concerning ”employment flexibility” rank Sweden as number 18
among 26 countries. By this ranking Sweden would be less flexible than, for
example, the Netherlands, Denmark and the United Kingdom, but more flexible
than France and Germany (see OECD, 1999).

Union density in Sweden has hovered above or around 80 percent of the number
of employees over the past couple of decades. The coverage of collective
agreements is even higher as the collective agreements typically are extended to
non-union workers. The trend decline of union density visible in many countries
has been conspicuously absent in Sweden. A high degree of union membership
is an integral part of what has been referred to as the Swedish Model. Indeed,
labor legislation concerning employment protection and worker co-
determination is based on the presumption that the overwhelming majority of
the workers are union members.


4
    The fact that the provision of unemployment insurance is closely linked to
union membership is almost certainly an important explanation of the high
unionization rate. Three other Nordic countries with very high union density –
Denmark, Finland and Iceland – also organize their unemployment insurance
through union-affiliated insurance funds. There is by now a reasonable amount
of evidence suggesting that such institutional details explain some of the
country differences in unionization (see e.g. Boeri et al, 2001).
    Post-war wage determination in Sweden has frequently been associated with
centralized wage bargaining as well as so-called solidarity wage policy.
Nationwide coordination of wage negotiations was implemented from the mid-
1950s and continued for almost three decades. The key players in these
negotiations were LO (the Swedish trade union confederation) and SAF
(Swedish employers’ federation). The guiding principle for LO’s wage policy,
as laid out in several influential documents by their economists Gösta Rehn and
Rudolf Meidner, was “equal pay for equal work”. One implication of this
principle was that wages should not be made dependent on the ability to pay
among particular plants or industries. In theory, the policy recognized the need
for wage differentials among workers so as to reflect differences in
qualifications. In practice, there was always a clear egalitarian ambition in LO’s
wage demands.
    The centralized wage negotiations came under increasing stress during the
late 1970s when some employer organizations argued that the central frame
agreements left too little room for flexibility at the local and industry level. A
significant step towards more decentralized wage bargaining came in 1983,
when the metalworkers’ union and their employer counterpart sidestepped the
national negotiations and opted for an industry agreement. Wage negotiations
after 1983 have mainly taken place at the industry level, albeit with exceptions
in the early 1990s when double-digit inflation and an emerging macroeconomic
crisis led the government to initiate a coordinated “stabilization drive” so as to
achieve a deceleration of wage inflation. The drive took the form of a
government-appointed commission that delivered a proposal for economy-wide
wage restraint for the period 1991-93. This involved negotiations with over 100
organizations and the proposal was finally accepted across the whole labor
market. The following years involved a return to largely uncoordinated
industry-wide bargaining.
    In the summer of 1996, several blue-collar unions in the manufacturing
sector launched an important initiative that eventually materialized as the so-


                                                                                 5
called Industrial Agreement (IA) of 1997. The agreement was struck by the
blue- and white-collar unions as well as employer organizations in the industrial
sector and was mainly concerned with procedural “rules of the game”. It rep-
resented an attempt to establish consensus around timetables for negotiations,
the role of mediators, and rules for conflict resolution. A group of “impartial
chairs” have been appointed and the agreement states rules for when and how
these chairs could intervene in the negotiation process.
    The Industrial Agreement has served as a model for similar agreements in
the public sector (and also in parts of the service sector). As of 2002, over 50
percent of the labor force is covered by IA-type agreements. IA also came to
serve as a model for government policies concerning industrial relations. A new
national mediation institute (Medlingsinstitutet) has been created (in operation
from June 2000) with the power to appoint mediators even without the consent
of the parties concerned.
    The IA innovations that emerged in the late 1990s represent a move towards
more informal coordination in wage bargaining. Perhaps paradoxically, the
move towards informal macro-coordination in wage bargaining has taken place
simultaneously with a clear shift towards stronger local influence over the
distribution of wage increases. Pay setting in the public sector is a case in point.
Previous rigid wage scales have been abandoned and there is, at least in theory,
substantial room for wage adjustments tailored to the needs of recruiting and
retaining employees.

During the 1980s, Swedish labor market performance was widely appreciated as
a remarkable success story. Whereas unemployment in Western Europe climbed
to double-digit figures, the Swedish unemployment rate remained exceptionally
low by international standards. The average unemployment rate during the
1980s was around 2 percent and by the end of the decade it had fallen to 1.5
percent. Employment-to-population rates were also exceptionally high by
international standards. In 1990, total employment had risen to 83 percent of the
working age population, whereas the average European figure was 61 percent
and the OECD average 65 percent.
    In the early 1990s, the picture of outstanding Swedish labor market
performance changed dramatically. Between 1990 and 1993, unemployment
increased from 1.6 percent to 8.2 percent and total employment declined to 73
percent of working age population (see Table 1). The level of GDP fell from


6
peak to trough by 6 percent over a three year period. For five successive years
in the mid-1990s, official unemployment was stuck at around 8 percent whereas
extended measures of unemployment reached double-digit figures.

    Why did Swedish unemployment rise so sharply in the early 1990s? It can be
argued that the main causes were a series of adverse macroeconomic shocks,
partly self-inflicted by bad policies and partly caused by unfavorable
international developments. The policy failures date back to the 1970s and
include an inability to pursue a sufficiently restrictive aggregate demand policy

                                                                                              7
so as to bring inflation under control. This inflationary bias in policy was
especially pronounced in the late 1980s when it was fueled by financial
liberalization. The timing of financial liberalization and a major tax reform in
1990-91, which contributed to a slump in the housing market, was not well
designed. When macroeconomic policy finally took a firm anti-inflationary
stand in 1991, the economy was already edging towards recession. The depth of
the recession was reinforced by the international recession of the early 1990s
and by increasing real interest rates.
    Although the prospects for a sustained labor market improvement appeared
remote in the mid-1990s, a strong recovery was in fact around the corner. From
1997 and onwards, employment exhibited a marked increase and unemployment
fell precipitously. By the end of 2000, unemployment had reached 4 percent of
the labor force and it remained fairly constant at this level during 2001 and
2002. To some degree, this recovery reflects the unwinding of earlier shocks
and a return to what may be close to the equilibrium unemployment rate. There
is little doubt that the extremely low unemployment rate around 1990s was not
sustainable. Over the 1990s, several reforms may have facilitated to return to
lower equilibrium unemployment. For example, unemployment insurance
became less generous, a number of deregulations in product markets took place,
and labor market reforms opened up for temporary work agencies.

Available measures of labor mobility in Sweden reveal strong cyclical patterns.
However, any statements about cycles versus trends are problematic considering
the exceptionally deep and prolonged slump of the early 1990s. A noticeable
change is the rapid growth of fixed-term employment contracts.
   One source of information on labor mobility is the retrospective labor force
surveys. Data on external job mobility – change of employer at least once
during the past year – reveal annual mobility rates hovering between 6 and 12
percent since the mid-1960s. There is some evidence that internal mobility –
change of position without changing employer – has shown a slight trend
increase, at least up to the late 1980s.
   Overall labor turnover has been markedly pro-cyclical, with quits accounting
for the overwhelming share of the total number of worker separations. For blue




8
collar workers in mining and manufacturing, the annual quit rate amounted to
22 percent over the period 1968-1988, to be compared with an average annual
layoff rate of only 2 percent.2 The importance of layoffs increased substantially
during the slump of the 1990s, but separate data on quits and layoffs are not
available after 1988. Other evidence, such as information on unemployment
inflow and advance notification of layoffs, indicates sharply rising layoff rates
in the early 1990s.
    The distinction between quits and layoffs is often fuzzy, and especially fuzzy
for fixed-term contracts which have grown relentlessly during the 1990s. As
shown in Figure 1, the sharp fall in total employment in the early 1990s was due
to sharply falling employment in open-ended contracts. The number of fixed-
term contracts stood at approximately the same level in the first quarter of 1994
as it did four years earlier. When the economy approached the cyclical peak in
the late 1980s, we observe rising permanent employment along with a decline in
the number of fixed-term contracts. From the early 1990s and during most of
the rest of the decade there is a remarkable increase in fixed-term contracts that
amounts to roughly 50 percent. Measured relative to total wage and salary
employment, the number of temporary workers rose from 10 percent to 16
percent; see Figure 2. Note, however, the declining share of fixed-term contracts
in the late 1980s and the late 1990s, periods with falling unemployment.3




2
   Quits are worker separations “initiated by the employee” whereas layoffs are separations
“initiated by the employer”. The data are based on surveys to firms and were collected by
Statistics Sweden. Empirical studies of worker mobility in Sweden up to the early 1980s are
reported in Holmlund (1984).
3
  Fixed-term contracts account for a much higher share of the total flow of new hires than of the total
stock of employment. Available data for the private sector reveal that fixed-term contracts accounted
for roughly 50 percent of all new hires in the late 1980s. By the late 1990s, they accounted for some

)LJXUH Temporary work (percent of total wage and salary employment) and
unemployment (percent of the labor force), seasonally adjusted quarterly data
1987Q1 – 2004Q2. (6RXUFH: Labor force surveys, Statistics Sweden.)


    The prevalence of fixed-term contracts is particularly visible among women,
the young and foreign-born residents. By the turn of the century, 18 percent of
the female employees were on fixed-term contracts, a figure to be compared
with 13 percent for the male employees. The trend rise in temporary work is
striking for both men and women. Among young female workers aged 16-24,
close to 60 percent were in temporary work by the end of the century; the
corresponding share for young men was around 40 percent.
    Temporary work has increased in every broad sector of the economy. Two
sectors stand out. Financial and Business services exhibit both the greatest
increase in fixed-term contract rate and share of all fixed-term contracts while
Health and Care show the lowest growth rates in both these figures.
    The most frequent form of fixed-term contracts involves replacement of
absent workers. Sweden has generous allowance for many forms of leave,
particularly parental leave and long statutory holidays. The incidence of leave


                                                                                11
replacements has, however, remained roughly constant at around 4-5 percent of
total wage and salary employment. The entire rise in temporary work is
accounted for by other categories, viz. on-call contracts, project work and
probationary employment.
    Why did fixed-term contracts exhibit such rapid growth during the 1990s?
Holmlund and Storrie (2002) discuss this issue and conclude that legislative
changes are unlikely to be crucial. Changes in the industrial structure of
employment, or in the demographic composition of the labor force, have
likewise negligible explanatory power. A more promising explanation focuses
on the consequences of adverse macroeconomic conditions. A recession is
associated with relatively more hirings on temporary contracts, reflecting
weaker incentives on part of firms to offer long-term contracts when workers
are easier to find as well as an increased willingness on part of workers to
accept temporary work when job offers are in short supply. The Swedish
experience as well as the developments of temporary work in the other Nordic
countries lends support to this hypothesis. The share of temporary work has
been relatively stable in Norway (with stable or falling unemployment) but
increased sharply in Finland over the 1990s, i.e., a period when Finnish
unemployment skyrocketed.
    The trend rise in temporary work over the 1990s may thus to a significant
degree reflect changes in the macroeconomic environment, and in particular the
rise in unemployment from the exceptionally low (and unsustainable) levels in
the late 1980s to the much higher (and presumably sustainable) levels prevailing
in recent years. In addition, other more “structural” forces may have tilted
employers’ preferences towards more flexible staffing arrangements but it is
difficult to pinpoint the exact causes. Hiring labor on a fixed-term contract can
accommodate fluctuations in the workload associated with a volatile market
environment but evidence on LQFUHDVHG volatility is hard to come by.4

 Houseman (2001) reports from a survey of US employers that flexible staffing arrangements are
mainly used to accommodate fluctuations in workload or absences.

In order to study wage dispersion, wage changes and mobility, we use a linked
employer-employee data base containing information on all workers and plants
in both the private and public sectors. From the data base we derive measures of
wage levels, wage changes, mobility and tenure. Through the employer-
employee link we are able to derive plant aggregates of these measures as well
as measures of wage dispersion at the plant level. In addition to these core
measures we also use information on observable characteristics (age, gender,
immigrant status and education) of the workers.
   The basic data source is a version of a register data base (RAMS) provided
by Statistics Sweden. RAMS contains yearly plant-level data on all workers that
were employed at a plant some time during each year, irrespectively of whether
were employed on a fixed-term or a permanent contract. The data include
information on total annual earnings as well as the first and the last remunerated
month for each employee. We construct monthly wage data by dividing total
earnings during the year by the number of remunerated months, including only
employment spells that cover November each year. Thus, we use the average
monthly wage-bill paid to an employee by a single employer as our measure of
the employee’s wage.
   The data is yearly and cover the period 1985-2000. The underlying
population consists of all individuals aged 16-65 who resided in Sweden
anytime between 1990 and 2000. This implies that the oldest workers as well as
workers that emigrated or died before 1990 are missing during the first five
years. Thus, in effect, we have an age restriction of 16-60 in 1985 and 16-64 in
1989.
   The data do not contain information on hours worked so in order to focus on
workers that are reasonably close to full time employment we consider a person
to be full-time employed if and only if the wage for November exceeds a
minimum wage.5 Furthermore, an individual is only counted as employed by at
most one plant each year with priority given to the observation generating the
highest wage.

  The minimum wage is defined as 75 percent of the mean wage of janitors employed by local
municipalities according to Statistics Sweden’s information on monthly wages, the cut-offs are
available upon request.

Note: Total sample size is 3,040,555 individuals.


    The dataset is based on information on total labor earnings collected for the
purpose of calculating taxes. Thus, the data include the earnings of DOO
employees, including top CEO’s, which implies that some of the observations
are extreme outliers. It should be noted that there is great persistence over time
in the recorded wages of these individuals, suggesting that the extreme values
are not due to errors. As is evident from Table 2, the wages of the top earners
have a large impact on the standard deviation of monthly wages while the mean
hardly is affected at all (this pattern is of course even more noticeable when
looking at wages in levels). It might be misleading if a very small number of
workers influence the statistics in such a dramatic way, especially when
comparing to other data sets where this group may be excluded by construction.
On the other hand, wages of top earners within each plant are in the focus of
parts of the paper. Considering this, we retain all but the top 0.5 percent in the
wage distribution in the relevant years. In an effort to reduce the impact of
measurement errors in changes we also rank individuals according to their log
wage change and drop the highest and lowest half-percentile each year.
    Table 3 compares the constructed wage distribution to the “actual” wage
distribution calculated from the 3 percent random sample in the LINDA-
database (see Edin and Fredriksson, 2000). The constructed data correspond
reasonably close to the actual data when looking at log wages but appear to
contain some noise in the estimated dispersion of both wages and wage
changes.

Note: The observations with the largest (and smallest for the actual data) 0.5 % of wages as well
as the largest and smallest 0.5 % of log wage changes are excluded from the data.


   The individual identifiers are based on official personal identification
numbers which should be very accurate and consistent over time. However,
plant identifiers may change over time for administrative reasons. In order not
to misclassify the disappearance of administrative plant numbers as plant
closings, we only include plants that existed in two consecutive years when
studying changes (and, for comparability, throughout section 4). Thus, the
calculated exit rates (i.e. the fraction of employees in a plant that leave within a
year) does not include plant closings. Since our tenure variable is calculated
within the sample, changes in administrative plant numbers will probably mean
that we underestimate the fraction of long tenured workers. When calculating
wage changes for people that change plants, we only include people that
changed between plants with at least 25 employees in both years in order to get
consistency with the definition used elsewhere in this analysis.

Note: Size is the total number of employees each year.


    Our analysis is focused on the corporate sector, and in order to get a
meaningful description of the wage dispersion within establishments we include
only plants with at least 25 employees.6 Table 4 displays the relative size of the
corporate sector for the years 1985 and 2000.7 We include both a measure
where we use the entire corporate sector and one where we restrict the analysis
to the private corporations. It is shown that the size of the corporate sector, as
measured in number of employees, increased slightly between 1985 and 2000
(from 63 to 66 percent).
Table 4 also shows the share of workers in each sector that worked in plants
with at least 25 employees. It is shown that 59 percent of individuals employed
in the corporate sector in 2000 worked in 25+ sized plants; the corresponding
number for 1985 was 57 percent. Figure 3 shows the log plant-size distribution
for 2000. It is obvious that most 25+ sized plants have close to 25 employees,
and as a consequence, a significant fraction of plants move around the 25 limit

This section provides detailed descriptive evidence of wages, wage changes and

1986, 1990, 1995 and 2000. The purpose of the analysis is to provide an

mobility in Sweden since the 1980s in order to facilitate comparisons with other


                                                                               17
countries and depict the most important changes that have occurred during the
period under study.
   The analysis is based only on plants in SULYDWHO\ RZQHG firms in the
corporate sector. It is worth noting that the period under study was characterized
by a steady increase in the share of workers in private plants within the
corporate sector: in 1986 only 77 percent of workers worked in plants owned by
private firms, whereas the corresponding share was 87 percent in 2000 (see
Table 4).
   Since the focus of this section is on describing the pattern and changes in
wages and turnover at the plant level, most statistics are calculated with one
plant as one observation implying that all included plants have an equal weight.
Thus, small plants are up-weighted compared to an analysis based on
individuals.

Figure 4 shows the log real wage distribution for the four years (wages are
deflated by the consumer price index). The figure reveals a steady increase in
real wages, but also an increase in dispersion. This is also shown by the first
panel of Table 5, where the standard deviation of log wages increases from
0.307 to o.340 between 1986 and 2000. This reproduces what is a well-known
fact from several previous studies, namely that the wage dispersion in Sweden
started to increase in the mid-1980s after several decades of wage compression.8

    The second panel of Table 5 shows that the EHWZHHQ plant dispersion,
measured as the standard deviation of plant average wages, increased over time.
As a contrast, the third panel shows that the ZLWKLQ plant dispersion, measured
as the mean of the within plant standard deviation of wages, remained relatively
constant over time. This impression also holds in the fourth panel showing
statistics for the coefficient of variation within plants. Thus, it appears as the
prime source of increased dispersion is between, rather than within, plants. We
will return to this issue at length in section 5 of the paper.
    The fifth panel of Table 5 reveals a positive correlation between the wage
OHYHO in a plant and the wage GLVSHUVLRQ within the plant. This result is probably,
at least partly, driven by the skewness of the wage distribution (see Figure 4




                                                                                 19
above). The wage dispersion among high-paid people is larger even in relative
terms.9
   The last two panels of Table 5 show the evolution of wage dispersion for
young (25-30) and old (45-50) workers. The results show that the increase in
wage dispersion was larger for young workers than for prime aged workers.
However, if we compare the log wages of young wages to the average log
wages displayed in the top panel we see that youth wages appears to have
remained relatively stable at approximately 90 percent of the average wage over
the period.

 Some caution is warranted when comparing these numbers to other data sources since the used
data are rather unique in including the earnings of all people receiving remuneration from each
plant, including top CEO’s. Note however that we, as explained in Section 3, excluded the top 0.5
percent of wages each year.

In this subsection we study wage changes within and between plants. In doing
so, we only look at changes for workers that are employed by plants in the
sample (i.e. by plants with at least 25 employees in the private corporate sector)
in two consecutive years. Figure 5 shows the distribution of wage changes for
the four years. It can be noted that many workers experienced a real wage
decline between 1989 and 1990.
    Table 6 looks at wage changes. The top panel shows the mean and
distribution of individual wage changes: the average real wage change was
between four and five percent except in 1990 when it was close to zero. As for

22
the dispersion, there appears to be some variation over time, but not much to
indicate a trend.

)LJXUH. Distribution of log real wage changes.


   Figure 6 and the second panel of Table 6 show the distribution of plant
average wage changes using information on the workers that remained in the
plant for two consecutive years (from W– 1 to W). We see that the dispersion of
wage changes EHWZHHQ plants, as measured by the standard deviation of plant
wage changes, increased over time. As a contrast, it is shown in the third panel
that the dispersion of wage changes ZLWKLQ plants (the mean of the standard
deviation of wage changes within a plant) was relatively stable. Thus, the results
suggest that the rate of real wage changes increasingly varies between plants,
but that the variation of wage changes has remained stable within plants.

)LJXUH Distribution of plant average log wage changes for workers who
remain in the same plant.


    The bottom three panels of Table 6 show the distribution of wage changes
separately for different tenure groups: (i) for those that changed plants (from
one plant in the sample to another), (ii) for those with short (1-3 years) tenure,
and (iii) for long tenured (> 3 years) workers. The tables show, as expected, that
wage increases are smaller for workers with long tenure than for workers with
shorter tenure. The wage increases for workers that change plants are smaller
than average at the start of the period, but larger at the end of the period. This
observation seems consistent with the observed increase in the importance of
plant effects. However, it should also be noted that the dispersion of wage
changes is much larger for those that change plants, suggesting important
differences between voluntary and involuntary worker separations. It is
important to keep in mind that the analysis is based on raw differences and that
the probability of changing plants may be correlated with other characteristics
that may affect the rate of wage growth, such as age or education.

We now take a look at worker mobility the plant level. The HQWU\UDWHis defined
as the share of workers in a plant in year Wthat did not work in the plant in W1.
Correspondingly, the H[LW UDWH is defined as the share of workers in a plant in
year W that did not remain in the same plant in year W.
    The top panels of Table 7 shows some background statistics. We see an
increase in the number of plants over time (top panel) and some decrease in the
average number of employees per plant (the second panel) consistent with the
declining average plant size we described in section 3. The third panel shows
the employment growth rates of the plants and by comparing the left part of the
table (all 25+ sized plants) with the right side (only 100+ sized plants) it is clear
the smaller plants had higher growth rates than larger plants during this period.
    Comparing the exit rates depending on the size of the plant in the fourth and
fifth panel we see that there are fewer exits in the largest plants; presumably this
is because they can provide more career opportunities than smaller organizat-
ions.
    In the following panels (6 and below) we show exit and entry rates for
different parts of the plant wage distribution. It is clear that most of the mobility
takes place in the lower part of a plant’s wage distribution, both in terms of exit
and entry. Exit rates in the top quartile are in the order of 13 to 18 percent
whereas exit rates in the bottom quartiles are between 26 and 36 percent. The
corresponding numbers for entry rates are 10 to 14 percent in the top quartile
and 40 to 44 percent in the bottom quartile. Thus, there is relatively more entry
than exits at the lower part of the plant wage distribution and relatively more
exits than entry at the higher part of the wage distribution suggesting that
workers to some extent enter at lower wage levels and get promoted to higher
wage levels before leaving the plant.
    The most important development over time seems to be some pro-
cyclicality, in terms of entry rates and exit rates. In both the (relative) slump
years of 1986 and 1995 we see that exits as well as entries were relatively
uncommon (panels 5 to 16) and the fraction of high tenured workers was
relatively large in 1995 (panel 17).

Note: All statistics are at the plant level with one plant as one observation except otherwise noted.
Separate tables for high and low level jobs can be found in Appendix A. Correlations are with
average log wages in plants, average log wage changes for workers remaining in the plant, and
standard deviation of log wages within plants.1 Note that tenure is calculated from 1985 onwards,
and thus truncated at different values for different years.


    The six bottom panels (18 to 25) of Table 7 show correlations between entry
and exit rates and different aspects of the plants wage distributions. In
calculating these correlations we use the log wages, the standard deviation of
log wages and the log wage changes (for those remaining in the plant between
year W and W-1). The purpose is to describe the relationship between wage levels
and wage structures on one side and mobility on the other side.
    The correlations between average wage and exit rates are negative in the first
years but they grew over time and for the large plant sample they are positive
for the last two years. The correlation between average wage change and exit
rates fluctuates substantially between the years and even change signs. Exit
rates are in all cases positively correlated with the standard deviation of wages
and this correlation appears to be growing over time.


30
    As for the entry rates, the correlation with the average wage is similar to that
for exit rates; it starts out negative but is positive at the end of the period. High
entry rates also appear to be positively correlated with wage growth as well as
with within plant wage dispersion, and at least in the case of dispersion,
increasingly so over time.
    Appendix A shows tables that depicts high and low level jobs separately.
+LJKOHYHOMREV are defined as jobs paying more than the 80th percentile of the
wage distribution in the data and /RZOHYHOMREV are defined as the jobs paying
less than the 20th percentile of the distribution. The story told by these numbers
are essentially the same as in Table 7: both entry and exits are more common
for low level jobs and less common for high level jobs, with a more pronounced
pattern for entries. The main difference seems to be that the correlation between
mobility and the plant wages, wage changes and wage dispersion all are more
positive for high level jobs.
    This concludes the snapshots of wages and mobility. The most noteworthy
observation is the rise in between plant wage dispersion whereas the within
dispersion has remained largely constant. The next section takes a closer look at
this development.

Figure 7 shows the overall log wage variance throughout the time period for the
entire economy, for the corporate sector, for the private corporate sector and for
manufacturing. The figure clearly shows that the wage dispersion has increased
quite consistently for all of these except for manufacturing where the dispersion
has been relatively stable.

   The description in the previous section suggested that differences between
plants may play an important role in explaining the growing wage dispersion in
Sweden since the mid-1980s. The purpose of this section is to study in some
detail the changing role that plants have played in explaining the growing wage
dispersion between workers in the Swedish economy.

We start by looking at how the share of log wage variance that can be attributed
to plant-specific factors has changed over time. Figure 8 shows that the between
plant variance as a share of overall variance has increase steadily throughout the
period. The development is equally visible when studying the entire economy as
when studying only the corporate sector. There is a steady increase in the
importance of plant effects also when focusing only on the manufacturing
sector, even though the increase is less pronounced in that sector. Throughout

we will include the entire corporate sector regardless of ownership (see the
discussion in the beginning of the previous section).

entire increase in wage dispersion over the period. Figure 9 shows the evolution
of within plant variance which contains a slightly cyclical pattern, but has no

    It is possible that the increase in between plant variance is due to changes in
the industry composition. Thus, in Figure 10 we decompose the between plant
variance in two parts, between plants within the same 2-digit industry and
between 2-digit industries.10 The figure clearly shows an increase in both the
wage variances between plants in the same industry, and between industries.
We have also looked at the variance between plants within the same firm; this
variance is small (since many firms just have one plant) but increasing.
    As a (very) rough formal analysis of time trends for different industries, we
estimated time trend estimates for the entire economy as well as separately for
all 1-digit industries. The results (not displayed) showed that all industries had

positive trends in between plant variances, while only three industries had
trends in within-plant variance. To further asses the role of structural change we
have looked separately at all plants that existed in 1985 and/or 2000, as well as
dividing these plants by employment growth rates. All the results from these
experiments suggested that the growing difference between plants is driven by
increased differences between plants in the wages they pay, rather than by
changes in the composition of plants in the economy.

The increased between-plant wage inequality may have occurred for two very
different reasons. First, it may be due to increased sorting of workers by
observed and unobserved skills so that high-skilled and low-skilled workers to
an increasing degree are found in different plants. Another possibility is
increased importance of “true” plant effects, such as effects operating via rent
sharing at the plant level. For example, between plant wage dispersion is likely
to rise if wages at the plant level become more responsive to plant-specific price
and productivity conditions.
    To get a first look at the importance of sorting according to skill we will
include traditional observable human capital variables (age, age squared,
education, gender and immigrant) in a “Mincer-type” regression. The results
from the regressions can be found in Appendix B. As already has been shown in
e.g. Gustavsson (2006), the explanatory power of observable characteristics has
declined over time.
    We proceed by including plant fixed effects in the Mincer equation and
calculate the fixed effects R2, defined as the fraction of total residual variance
attributed to the plant effects. This fraction captures the additional explanatory
power of plant effects after controlling for observable characteristics.12 The
results displayed in Figure 11 show that the plants play an increasingly
important role also after controlling for observable skills: there is a trend
increase in the fraction of residual variance attributed to plant effects. We also
calculate the correlation between the fixed effects and the prediction from
observables and take this as a measure of the degree of sorting on observables in
order to answer the question: to what extent do individuals with high earnings
potential work in plants with large plant effects? Figure 11 reveals an increase
in the degree of sorting: workers with favorable observed human capital
attributes show an increasing tendency to work in high paying plants.




12
  The fraction is formally equivalent to what Kremer and Maskin (1996) refer to as an index of
segregation (or correlation) by worker skill.

   How should these patterns be interpreted? There is clearly evidence of
increased sorting on observed skills and there is a presumption that this also is
associated with more sorting on unobserved skills. Conclusions about the
development of true plant effects are more problematic, however, since such
conclusion would require that the observed human capital characteristics
capture all skill differences between individuals, which seem like a rather strong
assumption.13


13
   Figure 11 also show that observed human capital variables can explain less of the within-plant
variance over time.However, using the within-estimated coefficients to calculate the between R2
we see no evidence of a trend, suggesting that the between plant variance of observables have




                                                                                                         37

We noted already in Section 4 that the variance of log wages within a plant is
correlated with the average log wage of that plant and that this may be reflect
the skewness of the log wage distribution. Thus, we may be interested in the
changing role of plants in different parts of the skill distribution. We study this
by dividing the sample of individuals into quartiles of predicted wages from the
estimated OLS-Mincer equations. Figure 12 shows an interesting pattern; the
plant effects become increasingly important for all quartiles except the top
predicted quartile.14 Thus, it appears that the increasing importance of plant
effects is a feature of all parts of the skill distribution H[FHSWat the most highly
skilled quartile. Plant effects were clearly most important for the highest skilled
workers at the beginning of the time period; but at the end of the period there
were little or no differences between different parts of the skill distribution. This
suggests that changes in bargaining institutions may have been a factor of
importance. For white collar workers in the top of the earnings distribution there
has typically been considerable scope for individual bargaining with the
employer and the national wage agreements have been less relevant for those
workers than for other groups. A speculative interpretation of Figure 12 would
be that a gradual erosion of the bite of national wage agreements have made
wage setting processes more similar across skill groups, with a tendency to
emulate practices among the workers with the highest pay.




increased relative to the within plant variance. We interpret this as further support to the notion of
increased sorting.
14
   It should be noted that the pattern of increased plant effect R2:s can be replicated using only
males. Thus, it is not likely that the differences between predicted wage quartiles are driven by
different time patterns for men and women.

So far this section has focused entirely on wage levels. However, changes in the
variance between plants in wages may have implications for both wage changes
and mobility. In Figure 13 we study the fraction of wage growth variance that
can be attributed to plant effects for the different years (using only workers that
remain in the same plant). The pattern is less obvious than when studying wage
levels, but there is a marked shift in plant specific wage growth in the beginning
of the 1990s. This pattern also remains after controlling for observables. The
strongest pattern emerging from the figure is however an increased sorting on
observables (measured as the correlation between observed human capital and
plant fixed effects) starting in the mid-1990s, where workers with high
predicted wage growth rates (e.g. young workers) increasingly sort themselves


                                                                                                      39
to plants with high residual wage growth rates. However, it should be noted
that, as is evident from Figure 13, the within plant predictive power of the
observables is quite small (in the order of 1-3 percent).

    In Section 4 we noted what appeared to be increased wage changes for those
that changed plants relative to the average wage change. However, when
studying the time pattern throughout the period it is apparent that the difference
is highly volatile with little evidence of a trend (in most cases the differences
are insignificant), a picture that also remains after controlling for observable
characteristics. What appears to be a robust pattern however is a procyclicality
of the fraction of worker observed in the data in two consecutive years that have
changed plants between the years (see Figure 14). The fraction changing jobs in
1993 is roughly half that in 1988 and 2000.

It appears clear that wages have become more dispersed between plants in the
cross section. In this subsection we study whether the same is true for the time
dimension – that is, does the apparent increase in cross sectional flexibility also
mean that average plant wages are more volatile over time?
    We have computed the year by year correlations of plant log wages. The
correlations are displayed in Figure 15 and vary between 0.92 and 0.96 with a
marked pro-cyclical pattern – the four years with the lowest correlations are
1991-94 – but with no trend. Thus, plant specific wages do not IOXFWXDWH more in
2000 than they did in 1985, even though wages are more dispersed in the cross
section.
    A main drawback of our data is the lack of information on productivity at the
plant level. It is not possible, therefore, to examine how plant wages respond to
changes in value productivity. However, since our results show that wages do
not fluctuate more, but are more dispersed in the cross section, it is suggested

                                                                                                      41

We have documented a continuous increase in between-plant wage inequality
since the mid-1980s. This increase holds in the raw data but also after controls
for observable human capital attributes. It holds within industries as well as
between plants in different industries. It is also interesting to note that the
development is visible in all parts of the (observed) skill distribution except for
the most highly skilled workers.



42
    How can this development be explained? One possibility is increased sorting
of workers by skill. Other possibilities revolve around rent sharing and what we
have referred to as true plant effects. Suppose that wage negotiations have
gradually become more decentralized, with increased bargaining power for local
unions. This could cause an increase in wage dispersion as wages adjust to plant
level productivity, recognizing that plant productivity levels typically are much
more dispersed than wages. Another twist on the rent sharing theme is that the
dispersion of plant productivity has increased, something that would translate
into more wage dispersion to the extent that there is some scope for rent sharing
at the plant level. We discuss these possibilities in turn.

    6RUWLQJE\VNLOO
The segregation by skill theory of Kremer and Maskin (1996) is concerned with
the idea that a rise in the overall (mean) skill levels may be accompanied by a
rise in wage inequality as well as a rise in segregation across plants of workers
of different skills. Key assumptions are that workers of different skills are
imperfect substitutes, different tasks within a plant are complementary and
different tasks differ in the sensitivity to skill. The distribution of worker skills
is exogenous and the competitive economy operates under constant returns. The
equilibrium wage distribution depends on skill distribution but also on how
workers of different skills are matched with one another. The model predicts
that a rise in the dispersion of the skill distribution will cause increased
segregation of workers. Moreover, a rise in the mean of the skill distribution
increases wage inequality across plants when the skill distribution is sufficiently
dispersed.
    Kremer and Maskin provide empirical evidence that suggests that
segregation by skill has become increasingly prevalent in the US, the UK and
France over the 1980s and the 1990s. There is furthermore some evidence, from
data on US states, that segregation by skill is amplified by increased variance of
skills, consistent with the theory.
    The level of education has increased substantially in Sweden in recent
decades. Between 1970 and 2000, the fraction of the population with upper
secondary education increased from 30 to 50 percent and the fraction with
tertiary education from 7 to 30 percent (Björklund et al, 2005). Has there also
been an increase in the dispersion of education? If so, the Kremer and Maskin
theory would predict increased segregation by skill, consistent with what we
observe in the Swedish data.


                                                                                   43
   We have transformed our data on education levels into years of schooling
and computed the variance of schooling using all individuals in the data. The
results are displayed in Figure 16 and reveal a marked increase in the variance
of schooling from the early 1990s and onwards (but a slight decline in the late
1980s). Although this pattern is broadly consistent with the Kremer and Maskin
theory, the exercise does certainly not demonstrate a causal relationship
between the dispersion of education and segregation of workers by observed
and unobserved skill, or between the dispersion of skills and between-plant
wage inequality. At the very least the results suggest that future work on the
sources of increased wage inequality in Sweden should explore how changes in
the level and dispersion of schooling have affected employers’ incentives to
match workers of different skills in the same plants.

In a standard bargaining framework, the bargained wage is determined by
“inside” and “outside” factors. The former include measures of the plant’s
ability to pay, the latter overall labor market conditions. Imagine a plant-level
wage negotiation between an employer and a local union. The stronger the local
union is, the more responsive would the bargained wage be with respect to the
plant’s ability to pay. The power of the local union will be constrained not only
by a strong bargaining position of the employer but also by a central union that
is able to strike wage agreements at the national or industry level. The more
centralized the wage bargaining system, the weaker the links between plant-
specific productivity factors and wage agreements at the local level. And
conversely, the less centralized the bargaining system, the more scope for local
rent sharing.
    A number of studies have examined this hypothesis using data on plants or
industries.15 By and large, most studies find that rent sharing has been of limited
importance in Sweden. There is so far little hard evidence that increasingly
decentralized wage negotiations have changed this pattern. Forslund and Lindh
(2004) used plant data for Swedish mining and manufacturing and looked at the
cross-sectional relationship between plant wages and plant productivity,
measured as the nominal value added per employee. In regressions for each year
for the period 1970-96 they related log wages to log productivity. The estimated
coefficient on productivity was closely centered on 0.05. The mean of the
estimates was 0.055 for the period 1970-82 and 0.051 for the period 1983-96.
The authors report that panel data regressions produce similar estimates. There
is no indication in this study that wages have become more responsive to plant
level productivity despite the fact that wage negotiations arguably have become
more decentralized since the mid-1980s. Unfortunately, since our data do not
include any plant level productivity measures it is not possible to shed new light
on this hypothesis.

An increase in the productivity dispersion across plants may cause an increase
in between-plant wage inequality as long as there is some scope for local rent
sharing. The recent paper by Dunne et al (2004) brings new evidence on this
issue in a study of wage and productivity dispersion in US manufacturing. The
study exploits establishment data over the 1975-92 period and finds that almost
all of the increase in hourly wage dispersion is accounted for by an increase in
the between-plant component. Interestingly, the study also documents an
increase in the between-plant distribution of productivity over the same period.
Moreover, wages and productivity at the plant level are strongly positively
correlated, both in levels and changes. The paper also finds that an important
source of the rise in wage and productivity dispersion between plants is
accounted for by changes in the distribution of computer investment across
plants.
    Data on the evolution of the productivity dispersion across Swedish plants
are rare. Some information in offered by Forslund and Lindh (2004) who
computed a productivity measure (the standard deviation of log value
productivity) for mining and manufacturing. Interestingly, there is a trend rise in
productivity dispersion, especially from the early 1980s and onwards. To the
extent that this development holds for the private sector as a whole, it may help
explain the rise in between plant wage inequality.

The paper has provided new evidence on the evolution of wage dispersion in
Sweden with particular focus on dispersion within and between plants. We use
linked employer-employee data and find a striking trend increase in between
plant wage inequality since the mid-1980s. Interestingly, this trend in between
plant variance makes up the entire increase in wage dispersion over the period.
   The increase in wage dispersion between plants is present in the raw data but
also when we control for workers’ human capital characteristics. Thus, sorting
by observed characteristics can only explain part of the increase. We find that
the basic pattern holds within industries as well as between plants in different
industries. Also, increasing between plant wage dispersion has been substantial
throughout the individual wage distribution, except for individuals at the top of


46
the distribution. Overall, our results suggest that the growing difference between
plants is driven by increased differences between plants in the wages they pay,
rather than by changes in the composition of plants in the economy.
   It lies close at hand to suspect that a gradual evolution towards more
decentralized wage bargaining practices is a factor of importance. Our data are
however not rich enough to test alternative hypotheses concerning the
mechanisms behind the rise in wage inequality between plants. It is premature,
therefore, to identify the causes of the rise in between plant wage inequality. To
make progress on this front we need more information on plant characteristics,
and in particular measures of (value) productivity at the plant level.
