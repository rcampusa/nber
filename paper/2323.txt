                   Employee Retirement and a Firm's Pension Plan




                                     ABSTRACT




       The provisions of the pension plan in a large corporation are described

in detail. The implications of the provisions are indicated by pension accrual

profiles. These profiles are set forth, together with standard age-earnings

and Social Security accrual profiles, in the form of life-time budget constraints.

The plan provided very strong incentives to retire beginning at age 55. After

age 65, negative pension and negative Social Security accruals effectively impose

almost a 100 percent tax rate on wage earnings for many employees of the firm.

Departure rates from the firm are compared with economic incentives inherent

in the plan provisions. The inducements in the plan provisions to retire early

have had a very substantial effect on departure rates from the firm. Over 50

percent of those employed by the firm at age 50 leave before 60 and 90 percent

before age 65. The jumps in departure rates at specific ages coincide precisely

with the discontinuities and kink points in the worker compensation profiles

that result from the pension plan provisions together with wage earnings profiles

and Social Security accrual.

     In this paper, the relationship between pension accrual and retirement is

analyzed, based on the experience in a large Fortune 500 firm engaged in

sales. It's name may not be disclosed. The data are the employment and

earnings histories between 1969 and 1984 of all workers who were employed by

the firm in any of years between 1980 and 1984. The provisions of the firm

pension plan are such that persons of the same age face very different pension

accrual profiles, and thus pension compensation at a given age. Hence,

different individuals face very different incentives for continued work versus

retirement.

     The paper begins with a detailed description of the plan and the

incentive effects inherent in its provisions. The incentive effects of the

provisions are described in terms of their effects on the budget constraints

facing employees over their working lives. For completeness, the accrual of

Social Security benefits is described together with pension benefit accrual.

The evaluation of the incentive effects of plan provisions requires the

estimation of wage earnings. The procedure used to estimate these profiles is

described in the following section.

     We then show the relationship between wage earnings, pension wealth

accrual, and Social Security accrual on the one hand and departure rates from

the firm on the other. It is apparent from this relationship that the effect

of the pension plan provisions on departure rates is very substantial. In

subsequent analysis we will develop a model that will allow us to predict the

effect of changes in the provisions on departure rates. That is not possible

based only on the relationships presented here. But the detail shown here

provides information that is often lost in formal statistical models.

     The analysis makes clear that estimation of the effects of pension plans

on labor force participation of older workers can only be done by taking
                 EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT AND A FIRM'S PENSION PLAN

                                      by
                    Laurence J. Kotlikoff and David A. Wise


     In previous work we analyzed the incentive effects of the provisions of

private pension plans.' The incentive effects were described by the accrual

of pension wealth resulting from an additional year of work, treating the

addition to pension wealth as a form of compensation in units comparable to

the wage. We found that the provisions of almost all plans implied a large

loss in pension wealth for work past the age of 65. Often this loss was more

than 40 percent of the wage that would be earned for the additional work. In

some plans wage earnings after 65 would be entirely offset by the concomitant

loss in pension wealth. The typical plan also provided substantial incentive

to retire at the age of early retirement provided in the plan. This was often

as young as 55. In addition, the typical plan provides a strong incentive not

to retire before the early retirement age. Although this work documented the

incentive effects inherent in the timing of the accrual of pension benefits,

no attempt was made to estimate the actual effects of these incentives on

retirement. That is, we considered the effect of pension benefit accrual on

compensation by age, but not the effect of compensation on continued labor

force participation. Indeed, based on the data used for that analysis there

was no way to relate the plan provisions to retirement, or to departure rates

from the firm.

account of the precise provisions of individual plans. Simply knowing that an

employee has a private pension plan tells nothing about the labor force

incentive effects of the plan's provisions. While a great deal of effort has

been directed to estimating the effects of Social Security provisions on labor

force participation, much less attention has been given to the effects of

private pension plans. The data presented here suggests that pension plans

are likely to have a much greater effect than the recent changes in Social

Security benefits, for example.



I.   The Firm Pension Plan

     A.   The Plan Provisions


     The firm has a defined benefit pension plan with earnings-related

benefits and a Social Security offset. The plan's early and normal retirement

ages are 55 and 65 respectively with vesting after 10 years. Actuarially

reduced benefits are available starting at age 55 for vested terminators --

vested workers who leave the firm prior to age 55. For early retirees --
workers who retire between ages 55 and 65 - -   less   than actuarially reduced

benefits are provided. For workers who retire after age 65 there is no

special actuarial benefit increase.

     In addition to the more favorable benefit reduction afforded to early

retirees, early retirees receive a supplemental benefit equal to their Social

Security offset between the time they retire and the time they reach age 65.

Hence, in comparison to a vested terminator who leaves the firm at age 54 and

starts collecting benefits at age 55, an early retiree who leaves at age 55

enjoys a smaller benefit reduction and also receives a supplemental benefit

until age 65. Not surprisingly, the profile of vested accrued benefits by age
                                             .4-



jumps sharply for most workers at age 55. Thus there is a large bonus for

remaining with the firm    until   age 55.

      The formula for the basic benefit before reduction for early retirement

and before any applicable Social Security offset is the average earnings base

times x percent times the first N years of continuous service, plus y percent

times the rest of continuous service:


      Benefits — (Earnings Base) [(x)(Service)]

           if Service is less than N years
(1)
      Benefits —   (Earnings Base) [(x)(Service) + (y)(Service   -
                                                                     N)]
           if Service is greater than N years


The parameters x and y are both less than 0.05 and y is less than x. N lies

between 15 and 30. The average earnings base is calculated based on earnings

between the start year and the year of either vested termination or

retirement. The start year has traditionally been Increased by two years

every other year, varying from k to k+l years before the current year, where k

is between 5 and 10. In our accrual calculations we assume a one or two year

increase in the start year every two years. Excluding the two lowest years of

earnings (except that the number of earnings years used can't be reduced below

five), the earnings base is calculated as the average annual earnings from the

start year to the year of vested termination or retirement.

      The Social Security adjustment is (1) p (p lies between 0.5 and 1) of the

Social Security benefit calculated by the firm, denoted SSB, times the ratio

of completed service to the amount of service the worker would have if he or

she stayed until age 65, less (2) Z (Z lies between $1,000 and $5,000) times

the ratio of continuous service as of January 1, 1976 to the continuous

service the worker would have if he or she stayed until age 65:
                                             -5-




                                    S                      S(76)
(2)            SSADJ — pSSB                  -   Z
                              S +   (65-A)           S +    (65-A)


Here, S is years of service, and S(76) is the years of service the worker had

in 1976. A is the worker's current age. The first term is smaller the

younger the age of retirement, which reduces the adjustment. But if the

worker has pre-1976 service, the second term is also smaller the younger the

retirement age and this increases the adjustment.

      The term SSB, the FIRM's calculation of the worker's age 65 Social

Security benefit, is based on the worker's earnings to date with the firm. In

the SSB formula earnings last year are extrapolated forward, assuming no

growth factor, until the worker reaches age 65. The average of past earnings

with the firm as well as extrapolated future earnings is then entered into a

three bracket progressive benefit formula to determine SSB.

      For early retirees the factor by which benefits are reduced depends on

age and service. For example, if the worker retires at age 55 with 20 years

of service the reduction is fifty percent; it would be only 33 percent if the

worker had 26 or more years of service. For workers with 30 or more years of

service, the reduction drops to zero at retirement ages between 60 and 64.

      The pension accrual can vary widely for workers of the same age, but with

different service and for workers with the same service, but of different

ages. These accrual differences reflect the fact that many of the features of

the benefit and Social Security formulae involve either age or service or

both. Indeed, it is fair to say that the firm's benefit formula could hardly

be better designed from the perspective of maximizing service and age-related

differences in accruals. This variation comes at the cost of a fairly
                                     -6-



complicated set of provisions which may not be fully understood by individual

workers.


     B.    Pension Accrual

     To describe the effect of the provisions on pensron wealth, the accrual

profiles for persons born and hired by the firm in several different years

have been calculated for the calendar period beginning in 1980. For each

employee group defined by year of birth and year of hire, accruals are

calculated through age 70; the number of years of accruals that are presented

thus depends on the age of the employee in 1980. One profile is graphed in

Figure 1. It is used as an illustration to explain the derivation of such

profiles. Profiles for different employee and age groups are compared in the

next section.

     The graph shows the pension accrual profile for male managers born in

1930 and hired by the firm in 1960. By 1980, they were 50 and had 20 years of

service with the firm. (To calculate pension accrual, we have used the

convention that a person hired in a given year has one year of experience in

that year. Thus in some of the tables shown below, the person used in this

example would be assumed to have 21 years of experience in 1980.) The accrual

is the change in the discounted value of future pension benefit entitlements

for an additional year of employment. The accrual of Social Security benefits

is shown on the same graph. Predicted wage earnings for each year are also

shown. These predictions are based on actual average earnings of firm

employees, by age and years of service. The prediction method is described

and the results are discussed in detail in section II. All of the numbers

presented in this section are in real 1985 dollars.

    At age 50, in 1980, the typical male manager has wage earnings of about

$48,446 per year. Compensation in the form of pension accrual is $2,646, or
                                      .7-



about 6 percent of wage earnings. If the manger were to retire at this age,

he would be entitled to benefits at 65, based on his earnings in the seven or

eigit preceding years. The benefits would not be available until age 65, and

thus have a relatively low present value at age 50.

     As described above, normal retirement benefits could be taken earlier, as

early as age 55, but they would be reduced actuarially such that the present

discounted value of the benefits remains unchanged. The reduction in the

benefit would be just enough to offset the fact that benefits would be

received for more years. If the person remains in the firm until age 55 and

then retires, however, benefits are available immediately and the reduction in

benefits for early retirement is less than the actuarial reduction. In

addition, the worker who remains until age 55 and then retires is eligible to

receive a supplemental benefit until age 65 equal to his Social Security

offset. Thus there is a very large increase in pension wealth at age 55,

$72,527, corresponding to the large spike in the graph. In effect, there is a

bonus of $72,527 for remaining in the firm from age 54 to 55.

     After age 55, pension accrual falls, to about 10 percent of the wage at

age 60 (in 1990). Accrual is higher than just before age 55 primarily because

the early retirement reduction factor if the worker remains until 55 is less

than it would be if he left the firm before 55. (If he leaves before 55, the

reduction is actuarially fair.) But as the worker ages beyond 56 this effect

is partially offset by the fact that an additional year of service adds only

1, instead of 2 percent to benefits. Pension accrual is in fact negative

beginning at age 61 (in 1991). Indeed between ages 61 and 65 the loss in

pension benefits is equivalent to about 20 percent of wage compensation.

     The loss in compensation between ages 60 and 61 is equivalent to a wage

cut of about 14 percent. The worker has 30 years of service at that age and,
                                      -8-



because of the plan's early retirement reduction factors, is already eligible

for full retirement benefits. Thus no increase in benefits will result for

working another year from the application of one fewer year of early

retirement reduction, as was the case before 30 years of service. In

addition, for each year that benefits are not taken between age 55 and 65, the

receipt of benefits for a year without the Social Security adjustment

(reduction) is foregone. This advantage is lost at age 65 (in 1995).

Thereafter, the loss in benefits from working an additional year is smaller

because this formerly foregone opportunity is no longer available. In

addition, the accruals depend on the Social Security adjustment, and to a

small extent on the updating of the years used in the calculation of the

earnings base.

     Social Security accruals for the male managers considered in figure la

range from about $1,000 to $8,000 between age 50 and 65. After 65, Social

Security accrual becomes negative, about -$8,500 at age 66.

     In summary, the typical manager in the firm, making about $48,000 per

year in wage earnings at age 60, would lose about $42,000 in pension wealth

were he to continue working until age 65. Thus, in addition to the expected

concentration of retirement at age 55, we would expect a large proportion of

this group to retire before 65. After age 65, Social Security benefit accrual

also becomes negative. At 66, the loss in private pension benefits and Social

Security benefits together amounts to about 32 percent of wage earnings at

that age. This suggests a concentration of retirement at 65 as well.

     The data in figure la are shown in the standard budget constraint form in

figure lb. Total compensation, including wage earnings, Social Security

wealth, and pension wealth, is graphed against age, beginning in 1980. The

vertical axis shows the total resources that the person would acquire from
                                     -9-



employment with this firm. Accumulated earnings before 1980 are ignored in

the graph.

     There is a discontinuous jump in the graph at age 55. For reasonable

preferences for income (that can be used for consumption) versus retirement

leisure, one would expect to see a large proportion of workers facing this

constraint retiring at age 55 and most retiring prior to age 65.

     Additional graphs showing wage earnings, pension accrual, and Social

Security accrual over the working span are shown in figures 2a and 2b; again,

the first shows accruals by year, and the second shows cumulated amounts in

the standard budget constraint form. These graphs pertain to a male manager

who is hired in 1980, at age 20, and who continues working with the firm until

age 70. For such workers, the pension accrual at age 55 is $168,000,

equivalent to 164 percent of the wage at that age. Wage earnings for this

group reach a maximum at age 59. Pension benefit accrual becomes negative at

age 61, and Social Security benefit accrual becomes negative at age 65. In

the first year of work after age 65 the loss in pension benefits and Social

Security benefits together amounts to $40,000, about 45 percent of wage

earnings at that age. Thus the lifetime budget constraint shows an upward

discontinuity at age 55 and a decline in the rate of wage increase around age

60. The decline is especially abrupt after age 65.2   Retirement at age 55,

between 55 and 65, and possibly at 65 would seem to be quite likely for

workers facing budget constraints like this one.




     2The decline in this firm at age 65 is likely to be mild compared to that
in many other firms in which the fall in pension accrual at age 65 is much
greater than it is here. See Kotlikoff and Wise [1985 and 1987].

     C.   Decomposition of Pension Accrual

     The calculations underlying the pension accrual in figures la and lb are

explained in this section. The wage earnings and other dollar values in this

section are in current dollars, however, while the graphs are in constant 1985

dollars. The nominal interest rate assumed throughout this analysis is 0.09,

and the real interest is. assumed to equal 0.03.

     The calculations are shown in table 1 for male managers who were born in

1930 and hired by the firm in 1960, the same group whose accrual profile is

illustrated in figures la and lb. Columns (1) through (4) are self-

explanatory. Column (5) is the average earnings base used to calculate

pension benefits. The normal retirement benefit is shown in column (6). It

is calculated using the formula in equation 1 above. The Social Security

benefit in column (7) is calculated by the firm based on earnings projected

forward to age 65. Column (8) is the Social Security adjustment shown in

equation 2. Column (9) is (7) minus (8). Column (10) is 1 minus the early

retirement adjustment, the proportion of the benefit that remains after the

adjustment. Once the person has worked for 30 years there is, according to

the firm's early retirement reduction provisions, no reduction even though the

person is only 60 years old at that time.

      Column (11) is column (10) times column (6). It is the benefit that a

person who retired early would receive between the early retirement age and

age 65. After age 65, benefits are based on the adjusted retirement benefits,

reduced by the early retirement reduction factor. These benefits are shown in

column (12), which is (10) times (9).

     The annuity value of a dollar received each year from 65 until death is

shown in column (13). It accounts for the probability that a person will be

alive at each year in the future. The probability that a person will live
                                            -11-


from the current age until 65 is shown in column (14). The current value of a

dollar that will be received at age 65 is shown in column           (15). At the
current    age, the present value of the pension benefits that the manager can

receive at age 65 is shown     in column (16), and is given       by (12) x (13) x (14)

x (15).

        If the manager retires at age 55 or later, he will receive benefits until

age 65 that are not reduced by the Social Security adjustment. He receives

the normal retirement benefits in column (6) reduced only by the early

retirement reduction factor, (10), and shown in column (11). The present

value of these benefits from the year of first collection until age 65 is

shown   in column (17). These benefits plus those that will be received after
age   65, are the present value of his pension wealth and are shown in column

(18) ((16) plus (17)).

      The change in pension wealth from one year to the next, 1(a), the pension

accrual, is shown in column (19). The accrual at age a is given by


(3)         1(a) — Pw(a+l) -   Pw(a)(l+r)

where   a is pension wealth and r is the nominal interest rate, taken to be

0.09. Again, these pension accruals, together with Social Security accruals

and the wage, are graphed in figure la above, but in 1985 dollars. The accrual

as a percent of wage earnings is shown       in    column (20).


      D.    Variation in Accrual Profiles by Age and Year of Hire

      The two accrual profiles discussed above pertain to persons who were born

in a given year and who were hired by the firm in a given year. The profile



     3For more algebraic detail on the calulation of pension wealth, see
Kotlikoff and Wise [1985].
                                       -12-



in the calendar period beginning in 1980 may be quite different for persons of

different ages and with different years of service. Thus, profiles have been

cal-culated for several additional groups, 15 in all, defined by year of birth

and year of hire, as follows:


     Year of              Year of Hire
      Birth

      1960      1980

      1950      1980   1975

      1940      1980   1975     1970

      1930      1980   1975     1970   1960

      1920      1980   1975     1970   1960   1950


Pension accruals for managers with these birth and hire years are shown in

table 3. Those born in 1940 reach age 55 in 1995, and for each of these

groups there is a discontinuous increase in pension wealth in that year. It

is $29,639 for those with 15 years of service in that year and $82,953 for

those with 25 years of service. Comparable jumps occur in 1985 for those born

in 1930. Accruals are often negative for persons over 60.

     Pension accruals provide a large incentive for some groups to stay in the

firm for another year and strong incentive for others to leave. For example,

staying with the firm in 1985 brings pension accrual of $72,527 for 55 year

old managers with 25 years of service (born in 1930 and hired in 1960), but a

loss of $14,936 for 65 year olds with 35 years of experience (born in 1920 and

hired in 1950). Thus there is enormous variation in the effective

compensation for continued service. One might expect therefore that some

groups would be much more likely than others to retire in a given year.

     In some instances there are erratic fluctuations from one year to the

next, from negative to positive to negative for example. This typically
                                     -13-


occurs if an increase in benefits in one year is not followed by a comparable

increase in the next. For example, suppose that the normal retirement benefit

is higher in year a than in either year a-l or in year a+l. Then the accrual

from a-i to a will tend to be positive, but the accrual from a to a+l will

tend to be negative. Dropping a low earnings year and adding a higher one in

the calculation of the earnings base may create this effect. Other provisions

in the pension calculation formula may do so as well. For convenience, total

cumulated pension wealth is shown in table 3 for the same groups. Social

Security accruals and cumulated Social Security wealth are shown in tables 4

and 5 respectively. Annual wage earnings and cumulated earnings are shown in

tables 6 and 7.

     Graphs of two of the profiles are shown in figures 1 and 2 above; several

others are shown below. Young new hires will have rapid wage growth in the

subsequent 20 years, but very little accrual of pension wealth. This is shown

in figure 2 above for persons born in 1960, and 20 years old at the time of

hire in 1980. Their incomes will rise from about $20,000 in 1980 to over

$70,000 in the year 2000, when they are 40 years old. But even in 2000 their

pension accrual will be only $1,558. Their total accrued pension wealth at

age 40 will be only $11,894, a very small fraction (1.2 percent) of their

total earnings over the period.

     A manager hired in 1980, but born in 1940, will have much lower wage

growth over the next 20 years, from about $28,000 in 1980 to under $52,000 at

age 60 in 2000. (See figures 3a and 3b.) This person will also have little

pension wealth accrual through age 54, when his total pension wealth will be

less than $13,000. In 1995, however, when the person is 55 and eligible for

early retirement, it will increase by almost $30,000 to a total of over

$47,000. In the next few years accrual is less than $7,000 per year. The age

55 spike in accrual suggests a potential concentration of retirement among

this group at age 55 (in 1995). But the actual pension that would be received

is still very small, only about 12 percent of salary (from tables not shown).

Thus retirement may be unlikely.

     Managers of the same age, but hired 10 years early may be much more

likely to retire in that year. (Figures 4a and 4b.) They experience a much

sharper increase in pension wealth in 1985, from just under $42,000 to over

$133,000. The pension benefit to wage replacement rate at 55 for this group

is about 26 percent. But accrual after 55 remains positive for this group;

pension wealth increases to almost $209,000 by age 60. Thus pension wealth

accrual may still provide a substantial incentive to remain with the firm.

     In contrast, persons born in 1920 and hired by the firm at age 40 (in

1960) will have essentially no pension accrual in 1985, and, indeed, it will

become negative in a few years. (Figures 5a and 5b.) Earnings for this group

are declining as well. One might think that persons who are in this group and

are still working would be likely to retire. But, if still working, they

chose not to retire earlier, when compensation from continued work began to

decline. They would have been eligible for early retirement at age 55 (in

1975), when they had been employed for 15 years.

       At that time they would have faced earnings and pension accrual

profiles like those shown in figures 6a and 6b. The group described in these

graphs was born and hired 10 years later (in 1930 and 1970 respectively) and

thus had 15 years of service at age 55 (in 1985), when pension accrual was at

a maximum. Thereafter, accrual declines and becomes negative around age 65,

after 25 years of service. That the group pictured in figure 5 didn't retire

earlier may suggest that their preferences are such that they are also not

likely to retire in a given subsequent year either. They may want to work
                                        -15-


more than others and that's why they didn't retire when pension accrual and

earnings started to decline. In addition, however, the group had not

accumulated substantial pension wealth at any time, even before it began to

decline, and thus may always have been in a poor position to leave the labor

force.


     E.   Variation by Employee Type

     The pension accrual profiles for other employee groups look very much

like those described above. Accrual is minimal during the first years of

service. There is typically a discontinuous increase in pension wealth at age

55. And accrual typically becomes negative after 30 years of service,

sometimes before that. Social Security accrual becomes negative after 65.

The major differences among the groups stem from different age-earnings

profiles. An illustration of the similarity and difference is provided by

graphs like that in figure 2, but for different employee groups. They are

shown in figures 7 through 11 for male managers, salesmen, saleswomen, male

office workers, and female office workers, respectively. (The graphs for male

managers are reproduced here for ease of comparison.) In each case the data

pertain to persons born in 1960 and hired in 1980. Thus they all pertain to

compensation over the life cycle for persons who remain in the firm. As is

clear from the graphs, the accrual profiles are qualitatively similar; but

there are some important differences.

     First, managers earn more than the other employee groups. The wage

earnings profiles also differ in shape. The peak earnings for managers occurs

at age 59. At age 66, if they still are in the labor force, 45 percent of

their wage earnings is offset by negative pension and Social Security accrual.

The earnings of salesmen peak much earlier, at age 50. At age 66, almost 95
                                     -16-


percent of their wage earnings are offset by loss in pension and Social

Security wealth. Thus this effect creates a greater incentive for the

salesmen than for the managers to retire after age 65. The peak wage

earnings for saleswomen occurs at age 57; at 66 almost 75 percent of their

wage earnings is offset by pension and Social Security wealth losses. The

peak earnings for male and female office workers occurs at ages 59 and 62,

respectively. At age 66, 48 and 46 percent, respectively, of their earnings

would be offset by loss in pension and Social Security wealth.

     The budget constraints for all groups show a discontinuous jump at age

55, but it seems most pronounced for managers. The budget constraint for

salesmen is essentially flat after 65; their net compensation after 65 is

virtually zero. The same is true for saleswomen. The net compensation of

managers and male office workers is positive, but declining rapidly at age 65,

and the budget constraints for these two groups become flatter after 65. The

budget constraint nonlinearities seem to be the least pronounced for female

office workers.



     4Managerial compensation is primarily in the form of salary, whereas the
compensation of salesmen is in the form of commissions to a large extent.
They may be more like self-employed or piece rate workers. In particular,
their earnings may be determined to a large extent by the number of hours that
they choose to work. This may also effect the relationship between
compensation and retirement. Firm officials inform us, however, that most
salespeople work only for the Firm. To the extent that the numbers of hours
that they work do not decline substantially with the wage, profiles reflect
age-productivity profiles.

     5There should be no presumption that men and women classified by us as
office workers are performing the same jobs. The classification does not
assure that.

II. The Prediction of Earnings of the Firm's Workers


     Data are available for each worker employed in the firm from the

beginning of 1980 through the end of 1984. Most werein the firm in more than

one year and many for all years. These years define the sample. Earnings for

anyone in the sample are available beginning in 1969 if the person was

employed then or beginning in the year that the person joined the firm 51 it

was after 1969. Thus it is possible to follow the same person for up to 17

years. In particular, it is possible to estimate individual-specific earnings

effects. By combining data for workers of different ages and with different

years of service in the firm, it is possible to predict earnings. We use

these predicted earnings in considering whether a person leaves the firm in a

given sample year, like 1980. The probability of departure in a given year is

related to how much the person would have earned during that year and on

pension and Social Security accrual during that year. In future estimation,

we will consider not only next year's earnings and pension and Social Security

accrual, but also the effects of future earnings and pension and Social

Security accrual.

     Because earnings in the first and last years in the firm are likely to

represent pay for only part of the year, they are excluded in the estimation

of earnings. To be included, a person must have earnings data for at least

three years. Workers with three years of data would have only one usable

earnings observation. This group must be distinguished in the estimation

procedure. Although persons with fewer than three years of earnings are not

used in the estimation of earnings equations, they are included in the

analysis of retirement discussed in section III. In this section the earnings
                                      -18-


estimation procedure is discussed first and then the results are presented.

In addition to their use in the subsequent prediction of retirement, the

earnings results are of considerable interest in their own right.   It is rare

to have access to earnings data for the same persons over such a long period.

It is often claimed, for example, that real wage earnings decline late in a

person's working life. We are able to determine with relative certainty

whether this is true for this firm.


      A. The Method

     Earnings histories from 1969 are available for workers employed during

the period 1980 through 1984. To explain the main features of the estimation

procedure, figure 12 describes the earnings of two persons who are in the data

set for seven years. The first person is age 40 to 46 over these seven years,

and the second is age 45 to 51. (They could also have different years of

service, but that is ignored in this example.) Earnings by age for the

typical person in the firm are represented by the solid line in the middle of

the graph. The first person has higher earnings than the average employee.

His earnings exceed those of the typical person by an amount u1, the

individual-specific earnings effect for person 1. It may arise, for example,

because this person works harder than the typical employee or because he has

greater ability or more training.     Earnings for person 1 fluctuate from year

to year, however. The deviations with age from the central tendency of his

earnings, indicated by the person 1 average, are indicated by alt' where t

indicates the deviation in year t. Future earnings for person 1 must be

estimated for our analysis. They are indicated by the dashed part of the

line. They depend on u1 and on the estimated relationship between age and

earnings, which, aside from the individual-specific term, is assumed to be the
                                                          -19-



same for individuals within a sex-occupation group. The earnings model is

presented more formally in the following sections.

     1.     Earnings Equation Specification

     To simplify the presentation, we include only one right-hand variable,

age. In practice estimation is based on age and years of service. The exact

specification is presented below. An earnings equation that captures the

ideas discussed above is:


(4) in Et —       Pb + fliAit + P2At             +


                — it    +       it

    Var(c) —     Var(u) + Var(v)             —
                                                 a   ,    Var (u) —           Var   (ii)   — a,7

                            —e e uieit
                                                                          2
                                    1it 'i                 Pit Uj

                                           -20-


The last approximation is a reminder that because of the nonlinear

relationship between earnings and age, the expected value of exp[7j] is not

equal to 1, even though the expected value of             is 0.

      In addition to the parameters ,      the    variances of u and ,   are also of

interest. The first indicates the systematic earnings variation across

individuals due to individual-specific effects. The second is a measure of

the extent of non-systematic variation.           The method of estimation used here

does not allow for the possibility that the individual-specific terms u may be

correlated with age. For example, it may be that persons whose earnings are

higher, because of the attributes u, are more likely to continue working at

older ages. We did obtain such estimates using a differencing procedure. Rut

for our purposes the procedure has two important shortcomings: First, it

means that certain age and service parameters are not identified. Second, it

imposes the rate of salary increase by age that existed over the period of the

data, because this relationship depends only on changes in earnings over the

period of the data. (The method we use allows the effect of age to be

determined in part by comparison of the earnings of workers with very

different ages.) This increase is apparently low relative to longer term

increases, and hence may imply expected future increases with age and service

that are too low. We also discovered that individual specific terms based on

the method that we have used are not correlated with firm departure rates.

      2.       Estimation Method

      Estimation of equation (4) yields residuals

where n is the number of observations for person i and k is the number of

parameters (3 in this example). To obtain estimates of additional parameters

of interest we need to distinguish persons with more than one observation from

those with only 1.

       For estimation of the likelihood that a person will retire in the next

year, we need to use predicted earnings in that year. For future analysis we

will need to predict earnings in subsequent years as veil. The predictions

       d.        The Estimated Components of Earnings

       To consider how much earnings deviate from what might be predicted for

that person, or from what that person himself might predict, it is useful to

divide earnings into expected and unexpected components. We do that by

defining




     6Simulated actual future earnings could be obtined by taking a random
draw it from the estimate distribution of 'l N(O, ), for each future year
and using                                          '7

     Earnings were predicted using the following variables:

          Age

          Age Squared

          Age Squared x Service

          Service

          Service Squared

          Service Squared x Age

          Age x Service

          Age Squared x Service Squared

     4.   Earnings Function Estimates

     The estimated earnings function parameters are shown in table 8. The

implications of the estimates are shown in figures 12a through l2e,

distinguished by employee group. Figure 12a, for example, shows earnings

profiles for managers by age of hire in 1980, where the nine profiles on the

graph pertain to persons hired at successively older ages- -from 20 to 60 in

five-year intervals. Earnings are calculated through age 70 for each cohort.

First, it is clear that, for any age, earnings increase substantially with

years of service. Earnings at the time of hire increase with age, but the

bulk of the difference in earnings is accounted for by years of service in the

firm. For example, persons who are 55 and just hired (profile 8) earn much

less than those who are 55, but have been working for the firm since age 20

(profile 1). Finally, the decline in earnings for older workers is much

greater for long-term employees than for those who have been hired recently.

     Similar patterns apply to other employee groups, but with some

significant variations. The earnings of male office workers at the time of

hire vary greatly by age, increasing and then declining rapidly. The

importance of these profiles for our work is that future expected earnings

depend in an important way on the age and years of service of an employee, and

the employee group.

     In our prediction of earnings beyond 1984 we use the 1984 year dummy and

add a 1.5 percent real wage growth factor; i.e., the predicted earnings for

year t is the predicted earnings for 1984 times (l.5)(t-l984).



III. The Relationship between Retirement. Age, and Years of Service


     In this section, the relationship of retirement to age and years of

service is described. The intention is to consider the extent to which
                                        -26-



retirement behavior is consistent, by economic reasoning, with the budget

constraints described in section II. To do this, we consider in detail

empirical hazard rates by age and years of service. These results will serve

as a guide to future development and estimation of more formal models of

retirement. They are the empirical regularities with which the models must be

consistent. In addition, however, this extensive descriptive analysis

supports several initial conclusions:

     • The favorable early retirement benefits have a very strong effect on
       departures from the firm, possibly increasing departure rates between
       ages 55 and 60 by as much as 30 percentage points (e.g. from 14 to 44
       percent).

     • The loss in compensation do to negative pension accrual for many
       employees after age 60 and negative Social Security accrual after age
       65 apparently also induce departure; only 58 percent of those employed
       at age 54 remain through age 59, and only 21 percent of those employed
       at 59 remain through 64. About half of the few remaining at 65 retire
       at that age.

     • The special early retirement incentive offered in one year increased
       departure rates very substantially.




     A.   Empirical Hazard Rates

     Hazard rates by age and years of service are shown for all employees

combined in table 9. The yearly hazard rate is the proportion of those

employeed at the beginning of the year that retires- -more strictly speaking,

leaves the firm- -during the forthcoming year. Several aspects of the data

stand out. There is substantial turnover in the first 9 years of employment,

especially during the first five years. On average, about 15 percent of those

employed five years or less leave in a given year. The table shows rates only

for employees 40 and older. The departure rates are somewhat higher for

younger workers, 16 or 17 percent for those employeed 5 years or less and 10

to 12 percent for those employed 6 to 9 years. There is a sharp decline in
                                     -27-



departure rates at 10 years of service, when employees are about to become

vested in the pension plan. Before the early retirement age, 55, the typical

decline is from 8 or 9 to 4 or 5 percent. After 55, when vesting caries with

it eligibility for early retirement, it is much sharper, often from 10 percent

or more to 3 percent or less.

     The availability of early retirement benefits at 55 apparently has a

substantial effect on retirement. Before 55 departure rates are typically

around 2 percent. At 55, they jump to 10 percent or more. It is important to

notice that the departure rates stay at that level until age 60, when there is

another jump in the rate of departure. The jump at 60 corresponds to the age

at which pension accrual becomes negative for many employees. (For those with

25 or more years of service, benefits increase at one instead of two percent

per year. After age 60 with 30 years of service there is no early retirement

reduction; full retirement benefits are available.)

     To understand the potential importance of the early retirement benefits,

suppose that if it were not for this inducement, the departure rates would

remain at 3 percent until age 60 instead of the 10 or 12 percent rates that

are observed. (Notice that the departure rates for employees aged 55 to 61

who are in their tenth year of service- -not yet vested and hence not eligible

for early retirement benefits--are also two or three percent on average.)

Departure at 3 percent per year would mean that 14 percent of those who were

employed at 55 would have left before age 60. At a departure rate of 11

percent per year, 44 percent would leave between 55 and 59. Such a

difference, even if only for a small proportion of all firms, can have a very

substantial effect on aggregate labor force participation rates. It is in

part the dramatic fall in labor force participation rates for the older

population that has motivated research such as ours.
                                       -28-



     The jump in departure rates at 60, especially noticeable for persons with

25 or more years of service, has been mentioned just above. There is another

sharp increase in departure rates at 62 when Social Security benefits are

first available. (There is no sharp kink in the budget constraint at this age

because of the actuarially fair increase in Social Security benefits if their

receipt is postponed until age 65.) The increase at 62 is also noticeable for

employees with less than ten years of service and not yet vested in the firm

pension plan. They can take Social Security benefjts, of course.

     Finally, there is a very sharp increase in the departure rate at age 65.

At this age the loss in Social Security benefits with continued work induces a

kink in the budget constraint. As described above, the budget constraint for

many workers becomes essentially flat at this age, due to negative pension

accruals and falling wage earnings, as well as the loss in Social Security

wealth. The fall in wage earnings and pension wealth typically begins at an

earlier age, as emphasized above. It is important to keep in mind that the

large departure rates before 65 mean that most employees have left well before

that age. Thus high departure rates at 65 indicate only that a large

proportion of the few that continue work until 65 retire then. The cumulative

hazard rates below highlight this point.

     A more compact version of table 9 is shown in the tabulation below for

salesmen. About 40.7 percent of employees are salesmen and women, about 56.2

percent are office workers, and only 3.1 percent managers. Thus for purposes

of comparison, it is best to have in mind the accrual and budget constraint

graphs for sales and office workers.

These results confirm the findings for all employees discussed above. They

may be summarized briefly:

       There is a large increase in the departure rates at the early
       retirement age of 55, but only for vested employees, those with at
       least 10 years of service. For employees with 16 or more years of
       service, the jump in departure rates increases very noticeably with
       age.

     • The departure rates remain at these higher rates through age 59.

     • At age 60, the departure rates increase very precipitously for persons
       with 30 or more years service, for whom full benefits are available;
       there is no longer an early retirement reduction and subsequent pension
       accrual is negative.

     • When Social Security benefits become available at 62, the departure
       rates increase very sharply, but apparently only for those who are
       vested in the firm plan, contrary to the results for all employees
       taken together.

     • Finally, there is a large increase in departure rates at 65, after
       which Social Security accrual rates become strongly negative.

These departure rates were obtained by calculating hazard rates over the next

four years separately for persons who were age 50 in 1980, age 51 in 1980,

•   . .. , and   age 63 in 1980. Those who were age 50 in 1980 were 51 in 1981, 52

in 1983, etc. Thus these calculations yield hazard rates in different years

for employees of the same age. In particular, given employment at age 50, the

cumulative rates show the percent still employeed at older ages. (The

cumulative rates for those aged 50 are all based on the 1980 departure rate of
                                     -31-


.031. The rates for those aged 51 are all based on the 1981 rate of .033.

The 1983 rate for those aged 52 is based on the 1982 rate. The rate for those

who were 65 in 1981 is based on the 1983 rate.)

     Note first that departure rates of employees who have been in the firm

for only 8 to 10 years,and are not yet vested, are very low at every age, as

emphasized above. And again, the increase in the departure rates at 55, 60,

62, and 65 stands out. Based on the 1981 and 1982 departure rates, only 48

percent of those employed at 50 would still be employeed at 60, and then 17

percent of these would leave. Only 10 percent would remain until age 65 and

then about 50 percent of these would leave.

     The data also show the effect of a special early retirement incentive

that was in effect in 1982 only. The incentive program provided a bonus to

employees who were eligible for early retirement in 1982; that is, those who

were vested and were 55 years old or older. The bonus was equivalent to three

months salary for 55 year old employees and increased to 12 months salary for

60 year olds. At age 65, the bonus was 12 months salary for employees with 20

or fewer years of service and declined to 6 months salary for those with 30 to

39 years of service.

     It is clear that the effect of the incentive was large. The departure

rates for 1981 and for 1983 are virtually identical. But the rates were much

higher in 1982. For example, the departure rate for 60 year olds was 17

percent in 1981 and in 1983, but 32 percent in 1982. For those age 63, the

departure rate was 37 percent in 1981 and in 1983, but 54 percent in 1982. Of

those employeed at age 50, 40 percent would still have been ernployeed after

age 60 based on the 1981 and 1983 departure rates. Only 27 percent would

remain after age 60 based on the 1982 rates.7



     7This comparison may not be precise because the special incentive, were
                                      -32-



      Even under the normal plan, only 10 percent of those employeed at age 50

would still be employeed at 65. Only 1 percent would remain until 65 with the

special incentive.



IV.   Summary and Conclusions


      The provisions of the pension plan in a large corporation have been

described in detail. The implications of the provisions are described by

pension accrual profiles. The pension accrual profiles are set forth together

with standard age-earnings profiles and Social Security accrual profiles in

the form of life-time budget constraints. The plan provides very strong

incentives to retire beginning at age 55. After age 65, negative pension

accruals and negative Social Security accruals effectively impose almost a 100

percent tax rate on wage earnings for many employees of the firm.

      Departure rates from the firm have been compared with economic incentives

inherent in the plan provisions. It is clear from this descriptive analysis

that the inducements in the plan provisions to retire early have had a very

substantial effect on departure rates from the firm. Indeed over 50 percent

of those employed by the firm at age 50 leave before 60 and 90 percent before

age 65. The jumps in departure rates at specific ages coincide precisely with

the discontinuities and kink points in the worker compensation profiles that

result from the pension plan provisions together with wage earnings profiles

and Social Security accrual.

      A great deal of effort has been devoted to estimating the effect of

Social Security provisions on labor force participation. In particular,



it to be prolonged, would alter the retirement rates prior to each of the ages
considered in 1982.
                                     .33-


Hausman and Wise [1985], Burtless [1986], and Boskin and Hurd [198] have

attempted to estimate the effect on labor force participation of the increases

in Social Security benefits during the early 1970's. It would appear from the

results here that the effects of these across the board increases in Social

Security benefits are likely to be small relative to the effects of the

private pension provisions. For example, it seems clear that shifting the age

of early retirement from 55 to 60 would have a very dramatic effect on

departure rates. Leaving the early retirement age at 55, but eliminating

negative pension and Social Security accruals thereafter would apparently also

have a substantial effect on retirement rates. Precise estimates of the

effects of such changes will be made in future work.
