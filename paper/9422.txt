How Do Markets Function? An Empirical Analysis of
Gambling on the National Football League

                                           ABSTRACT

       The market for sports gambling is structured very differently than the typical financial
market. In sports betting, bookmakers announce a price, after which adjustments are small and
infrequent. As a consequence, bookmakers do not play the traditional role of market makers whose
primary function is to match buyers and sellers, but rather, take large positions with respect to the
outcome of game. Using a unique data set that includes both prices and quantities of bets placed over
the course of an NFL season, I demonstrate that this peculiar price-setting mechanism allows
bookmakers to achieve substantially higher profits than would be possible if they played the role of
the typical market maker. Bookmakers are more skilled at predicting the outcomes of games than
bettors and are able to systematically exploit bettor biases by choosing prices that deviate from the
market clearing price. While this strategy exposes the bookmaker to risk on any particular game, in
aggregate the risk borne is minimal. Bookmaker profit maximization provides a simple explanation
for heretofore puzzling deviations from market efficiency that were observed in past empirical work.
I find little evidence that there exist bettors who are systematically able to beat the bookmaker, even
given the distorted prices that bookmakers set. The results concerning whether aggregating across
bettor preferences improves the ability to forecast outcomes are inconclusive.

        There are many parallels between trading in financial markets and sports wagering.

First, in both settings, investors with heterogeneous beliefs and information seek to profit

through trading as uncertainty is resolved over time. Second, sports betting, like trading in

financial derivatives, is a zero-sum game with one trader on each side of the transaction. Finally,

large amounts of money are potentially at stake. Americans are estimated to wager as much as

$380 billion annually on sporting events (National Gambling Impact Study Commission 1999).

       In light of these similarities, it is surprising that these two types of markets are organized

so differently. In most financial markets, prices change frequently. The prevailing price is that

which equilibrates supply and demand. The primary role of market makers is to match buyers

with sellers. With sports wagering, however, market makers (casinos and bookmakers) simply

announce a “price” (which takes the form of a point spread, e.g., the home team to win a football

game by at least 3.5 points), after which adjustments are typically small and infrequent.2 If that

price is not the market clearing price, then the bookmakers may be exposed to substantial risk. If

bettors are able to recognize and exploit mispricing on the part of the bookmaker, the bookmaker

can sustain large losses. The risk borne by bookmakers on sports betting is categorically

different than the casino’s risk on other games of chance such as roulette, keno, or slot machines.

In those games of chance, the odds are stacked in favor of the casino and the law of large

numbers dictates profits for the house. In contrast, however, if the bookmaker sets the wrong

line on sporting events, it can lose money in the long run. The presence of even a small number


       2
           In the five days preceding a game, the posted price changes an average of 1.4 times per
game. When the price does change, in 85 percent of the cases the line moves by the minimum
increment of one-half of a point. Thus, the posted spread on Tuesday is within one point of the
posted spread at kickoff on Sunday in 90 percent of all games. These calculations are based on
information on changes in the casino lines reported at www.wagerline.com.

                                                  1
of bettors whose skills allow them to achieve positive expected profits could prove financially

disastrous to the bookmaker. Such bettors could either amass large bankrolls, or in the presence

of credit constraints, sell their information to others.

        Although the mechanism used for price-setting in sports betting seems peculiar, there are

at least three scenarios in which the bookmaker can sustain profits implementing it. In the first

scenario, bookmakers are extremely good at determining in advance the price which equalizes

the quantity of money wagered on each side of the bet. If this occurs, the bookmaker makes

money regardless of who wins the game since the bookmaker charges a commission (known as

the “vig”) on bets.3 Following this strategy, bookmakers do not have to have any particular skill

in picking the actual outcome of sporting events, they simply need to be good at forecasting how

bettors behave. Popular depictions of bookmaker behavior have stressed this explanation.4

        An alternative scenario under which this price-setting mechanism could persist is if

bookmakers are systematically better than gamblers in predicting the outcomes of games. If that

were the case, the bookmaker could set the “correct” price (i.e. the one which equalizes the



        3
           Typically, bettors must pay the casino 110 units if a bet loses, but are paid only 100
units if the bet wins.
        4
         For instance, a website devoted to educating novice gamblers (www.nfl-betting.org)
writes, “A sports bettor needs to realize that the point spread on a game is NOT a prediction by
an oddsmaker on the outcome of a game. Rather, the odds are designed so that equal money is
bet on both sides of the game. If more money is bet on one of the teams, the sports book runs the
risk of losing money if that team were to win. Bookmakers are not gamblers--they want to make
money on every bet regardless of the outcome of the game.” Similarly, Lee and Smith
(forthcoming) write, “Bookies do not want their profits to depend on the outcome of the game.
Their objective is to set the pointspread to equalize the number of dollars wagered on each team
and to set the total line to equalize the number of dollars wagered over and under. If they achieve
this objective, then the losers pay the winners $10 and pay the bookmaker $1, no matter how the
game turns out. This $1 profit (the “vigorish”) presumably compensates bookmakers for making
a market and for the risk they bear that the pointspread or total line may be set incorrectly.

                                                   2
probability that a bet placed on either side of a wager is a winner). Although the money bet on

any individual game would not be equalized, on average the bookmaker will earn the amount of

the commission charged to the bettors. Unlike the first scenario above, however, if prices are set

in this manner, the bookmaker will lose if gamblers are actually more skilled in determining the

outcome of games than is the bookmaker.

         The third possible scenario combines elements of the two situations described in the

preceding paragraphs. If bookmakers are not only better at predicting game outcomes, but also

proficient at predicting bettors preferences, they can do even better in expectation than to simply

collect the commission. By systematically setting the “wrong” prices in a manner that takes

advantage of bettor preferences, bookmakers can increase profits. For instance, if bookmakers

know that local bettors prefer local teams, they can skew the odds against the local team. There

are constraints on the magnitude of this distortion, however, since bettors who know the

“correct” price can generate positive returns if the posted price deviates too much from the true

odds.5

         In this paper, I attempt to better understand the structure of the market for sports

gambling by exploiting a data set of approximately 20,000 wagers on professional football placed

placed by 285 bettors at an online sports book as part of a high-stakes handicapping contest.

Two aspects of this data set are unique. First, in contrast to previous studies of betting that only

had information on prices, I observe both prices and quantities of bets placed. That information


         5
         This assumes that bookmakers are unable to offer different prices to different bettors.
Indeed, there is evidence that local bookmakers who deal repeatedly with the same clients are
able to exercise some degree of price discrimination. See Strumpf (2002) for empirical evidence
that bookmakers both shade the odds against the home team and offer different odds to bettors
with different past betting histories.

                                                   3
allows me to determine whether the bookmaker appears to be equalizing the amount of bets on

each side of a wager. Second, I am able to track the behavior of individual bettors over time,

which provides a means of determining whether some bettors are more skillful than others.

Although my data are from one bookmaker, the patterns observed here are likely to generalize

since all bookmakers offer nearly identical spreads on a given game.

       A number of results emerge from the analysis. First, I demonstrate that the bookmaker

does not appear to be trying to set prices to equalize the amount of money bet on either side of a

wager. In almost one-half of all games, at least two-thirds of the bets fall on one side of the

gamble. Moreover, the spread chosen systematically fails to incorporate readily available

information (e.g. which team is the home team) that would help in equalizing the money bet on

either side of a wager.6 For instance, in games where the home team is an underdog, on average

two-thirds of the wagers are on the visiting team. These findings argue strongly against the first

scenario presented above and the popular depictions of bookmaker behavior. A rationale for this

failure to equalize the money emerges in the paper’s second finding: bookmakers appear to be

strategically setting prices in order to exploit bettors’ biases. Bettors exhibit a systematic bias

toward favorites, and to a lesser extent, towards visiting teams.7 Consequently, the bookmakers



       6
          Of course, it is not the number of bets on either side of a wager that the bookmaker
wants to equalize, but rather, the total dollars bet on either side. In my data, however, all wagers
are constrained to have the same dollar value, so the two are equivalent. If there are large
bankroll bettors outside my sample who systematically bet against the prevailing sentiment of
other bettors, conclusions based on my sub-sample may be erroneous.
       7
         This finding is not to be confused with the bias towards longshots that has been
observed in parimutuel horse-race betting (e.g. Ali 1977, Golec and Tamarkin 1998, Jullien and
Salanie 2000, Thaler and Ziemba 1988). In football, the odds are set to make the chance of each
team covering the spread about fifty percent, making this consideration irrelevant.

                                                  4
are able to set odds such that favorites and home teams win less than fifty percent of the time, yet

attract more than half of the betting action. By choosing these prices, it appears bookmakers

increase their gross profit margins by 20-30 percent over a price-setting policy that attempts to

balance the amount of money on either side of the wager. On the dimension of favorites versus

underdogs, bookmakers appear to have distorted prices as much as possible without allowing a

simple strategy of always betting on underdogs to become profitable. The fact that home teams

and underdogs cover the spread a disproportionate share of the time has been well established in

the literature (e.g. Golec and Tamarkin 1991, Gray and Gray 1997). My findings provide an

explanation for that empirical regularity: it is profit maximizing for the bookmaker who sets the

spread. Third, there is little evidence that there are individual bettors who are able to

systematically beat the bookmaker.8 The distribution of outcomes across bettors is consistent

with data randomly generated from independent tosses of a 50-50 coin. Moreover, how well a

bettor has done up to a certain point in time has no predictive value for future performance.

Finally, the evidence is mixed as to whether aggregating bettor preferences has any predictive

value in helping to beat the spread. In my sample, there is some weak and ultimately statistically

insignificant, evidence that bettors are more likely to predict correctly when there is agreement

among them as to which team looks attractive. Altogether, the results are consistent with the

conclusion that the bookmakers are at least as good at predicting the outcomes of games than are

even the most skilled gamblers in the sample, and the bookmakers exploit their advantage by



       8
          While only tangentially related to the issues addressed in this paper, it is worth noting
that there is an extensive academic literature devoted to the question of testing for market
efficiency in wagering markets (e.g. Asch, Malkiel, and Quandt 1981, Sauer et al. 1988,
Woodland and Woodland (1994), Zuber, Gandar, and Bowers 1985).

                                                  5
strategically setting prices to achieve profits that are likely higher than would be possible if they

simply acted as market makers letting supply and demand equilibrate prices.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides some background

on wagering on professional football in the United States. Section III describes the data set used

in the paper. Section IV presents the empirical findings. Section V concludes.



Section II: Background on football wagering

       Football is the most popular sport for wagering in the United States, generating 40

percent of sports-betting revenue for legal bookmakers in Nevada (Nevada Gaming Control

Board 2002). USA Today reports that half of all Americans have a wager on the outcome of the

Super Bowl. The most common type of bet in pro football involves picking the winner of a game

against a point spread ( a so-called “straight bet”).9 For instance, if the casino posts a betting

line with the home team favored by 3 points, a bettor can choose either (1) the home team to win

by more than that amount, or (2) the visiting team to either lose by less than three points or to

win outright. In the event the game ends exactly on the point spread, all bets are refunded.

Regardless of which team is chosen, the bettor typically pays the casino 110 units if they lose the

bet and collects 100 units when victorious. The difference in the amount paid on a loss versus


       9
           There are many other types of bets available. For instance, one can bet on whether the
total number of points scored in a game is above or below a certain level. One can also bet on
which team will win the game (not against the spread), with the payouts appropriately adjusted to
reflect the probability of these outcomes. It is also possible to parlay bets on a series of games
such that the bettor receives a large payout if correctly picking all the games and receives zero
otherwise. Because my data only covers straight bets, I do not focus on these other bet types.
Woodland and Woodland (1991) argue that the use of point spreads as opposed to odds that
depend only on which teams wins or loses is a bookmaker profit-maximizing response to risk
aversion on the part of bettors.

                                                  6
the amount won for a victory is the casino’s commission, known as the “vig.” Because the bettor

can take either side of the wager at the same payout rate, the casino needs to pick a betting line

that roughly equalizes the probability of the two events occurring (in this case home team

winning by more than three or more points, or failing to do so). The bettor receives the spread in

force at the time a wager is placed, regardless of later adjustments made by the bookmaker.

        Define terms as follows: p is the probability that the favorite wins a particular game, f is

the fraction of the total dollars bet on the game that go to the favorite, and v is the vig or

commission charged by the bookmaker, which is paid only on losing bets.10 The bookmaker’s

expected gross profit per unit bet11 is given by



(1)     E[Bookmaker profit] = [(1-p)f)+p(1-f)](1+v)- [(1-p)(1-f)+pf]



The terms inside the left set of brackets is the fraction of dollars bet in which the bookmaker

wins. That amount is multiplied by 1+v to reflect the bookmakers vig. The terms in the right set

of brackets are the cases in which the bookmaker loses and has to payout to the bettor.

Rearranging terms, equation (1) simplifies to



(2)     E[Bookmaker profit] = (2+v)(f+p-2pf)-1


        10
           I define the model in terms of favorites and underdogs simply because this is the most
salient dimension empirically. Game outcomes could be characterized along any relevant set of
dimensions.
        11
           For simplicity, I treat the number of wagers placed as fixed in the analysis. To the
extent that changing the odds affects the total volume of bets, the bookmaker’s overall gross
profit would be a function of both the number of bets and the gross profit per unit bet.

                                                   7
If either the probability the two teams win is equal (p=.5) or the money bet on both teams is equal

(f=.5), the bookmakers gross profit simplifies to v/2. In either of these instances, the bookmaker

is indifferent about the outcome of the game and earns a profit proportional to the size of the

commission charged. As noted in the introduction, therefore, the bookmaker does not need to be

able to predict the outcome of the games more accurately than the bettors to ensure a profit. The

bookmaker just needs to be able to predict better preferences so as to balance out the money on

each side of the wager.

       Equations (1) and (2) take f and p as given. Of course, the fraction of money bet on the

favorite will be a function of the probability the favorite actually wins, i.e. f=f(p), with Mf/Mp>0.12

Taking the derivative of (2) with respect to p, an optimizing bookmaker will set p such that



(3)    [1-2f(p)] + (1-2p)Mf/Mp = 0



The term in square brackets is the benefit the bookmaker would achieve from distorting the odds

if gamblers did not respond to changes in prices. The remaining term captures the impact on

profits of the behavioral response of bettors who switch towards the team with bettor odds. Note

that if bettors preferences are unbiased in the sense that f(p=.5)=.5, then the bookmaker’s

optimum is to choose p=.5, which implies f=.5 as well.



       12
          Throughout this analysis, I treat v (the commission charged by the bookmaker) as a
parameter rather than a decision variable for the bookmaker. Commissions are virtually always
10 percent. Gaining a better understanding of the reasons for the uniformity of commissions
across bookmakers and over time presents an interesting puzzle for future research.

                                                   8
       If, on the other hand, bettors preferences are biased so that f(p=.5)>.5, as is true

empirically in the data set, then the bookmaker can increase profits by reducing p below .5

(Kuypers 2000 makes this same point).13 Intuitively, if bettors prefer favorites at fair odds, the

bookmaker can offer odds slightly worse than fair on favorites and still attract more than half of

the wagers on the favorite, yielding profits that are strictly higher than is the case at p=.5.

Mathematically, at p=.5, the term in square brackets in equation (3) is negative, but the other

term on the left-hand-side is equal to zero, demonstrating that the bookmaker is not at an

optimum. The bookmaker will not want to push p too far away from .5 for two reasons,

however. First, as p diverges from .5, it becomes increasingly costly to the bookmaker when a

bettor switches from the favorite to the underdog. This is because the bet on the favorite is at

(increasingly) unfair odds, whereas the bet on the underdog is at (increasingly) better than fair

odds. Note that when p is lowered to the point where f(p)=.5, gross profits are back to the level

attained when p=.5. Thus, the bookmaker would never want to distort prices to that point. The

second reason that the bookmaker cannot distort prices too much is that if some subset of bettors

do not have biased preferences, those bettors can exploit the distorted prices. With the standard

vig, a bettor must win 52.4 percent of bets to make profit.14 One could imagine that the volume

of capital available to bettors with positive expected profits could be enormous, both because

their bankrolls would grow over time and because the availability of such profits would attract

new investors. Thus, it would be surprising to observe price distortions so large that simple


       13
           Although I use the term “bias” to describe bettor preferences, I do not necessarily
imply irrationality on their part. If there is more consumption value associated with betting on
favorites, then bettor preferences for favorites could be completely rational.
       14
            A bettor breaks even when p-(1+v)(1-p)=0. The solution to that expression is p=.5238.

                                                   9
strategies (e.g. always bet the underdog) could yield a positive profit.



III. The data set

       The data used in this paper are wagers placed by bettors as part of a handicapping contest

offered at an online sportsbook during the 2001-2002 NFL season. In the contest, bettors were

required to pick five games per week against the spread for each of the seventeen weeks of the

NFL regular season (a total of 85 games). Bettors could choose those five games from any of the

13-15 games being played in a given week. One point was given for each correct pick, and one-

half point if a game ended exactly on the spread. The entry fee was $250 per person, and there

were 285 entrants. All of the entry fees were returned as prize money, so participants were

competing for a total pool of $71,250.15 Sixty percent (or $42,750) went to the bettor with the

most correct picks. Second through fifth place finishers received declining shares of the pool.

The last-place finisher (conditional on making 85 picks) received five percent of the pool. In the

data, I observe the ID number of each bettor, all wagers placed as part of this contest, the spread

at which the bet was placed, and the outcome of the game.

       There are a number of potential shortcomings with these data. First, these are not wagers

in the traditional sense. The bettor does not receive a direct payoff from winning any particular

game; the payoff is only based on the cumulative number of wins. Nonetheless, the presence of

large monetary rewards to the winners provides strong incentives to the participants.

Presumably, the picks made by bettors in the contest closely parallel the actual betting wagers


       15
          The apparent purpose of the contest was to ensure that the bettors had a reason to visit
the website each week. The fact that the worst-place finisher (conditional on having bet each
week) received a payoff, reinforces this point.

                                                 10
they were making; anecdotally that is true among the contest participants known to the author.16

Second, the nature of the data make it impossible to ascertain the intensity of preferences across

games since all selections receive equal weighting. Bettors may have much stronger preferences

for their most favored pick of the week than would be the case for the fifth-favorite pick. Third,

there is substantial attrition in the sample. Of the 285 bettors who entered the contest, 100 (a

little more than one-third) made their entries all 17 weeks of the season. More than 60 percent

participated in at least 15 of the 17 weeks of the season. Less than 10 percent of the contestants

recorded data for fewer than eight weeks. For bettors in the middle of the pack as the season

progresses, the incentive to continue participating decreases substantially. Bettors who miss a

week receive zero points, greatly reducing their likelihood of winning the contest, and

disqualifying themselves from eligibility for the last-place prize. It should be noted, however,

that attrition in this context adversely affects my ability to test only one of the hypotheses: what

the overall distribution of bettor success rates looks like. Because attrition is non-random, the set

of bettors who continue to the end will be skewed. Fourth, the spreads used in the handicapping

contest are fixed on the Tuesday preceding the game and do not fluctuate with the actual spread,

even though a bettor’s contest picks are not due until the Friday before the game. As a

consequence, in some games, the actual spread and the contest spread differ at the time an entry

is made. All of the results of the paper, however, are robust to dropping games in which there

are substantial fluctuations in the spread between Tuesday and Friday. Finally, these data are not


       16
          One important way in which the contest wagers might be expected to differ from actual
wagers placed is that there is an incentive in the contest to pick outcomes that the bettor believes
will be unpopular with other gamblers. That is because of the tournament structure of the contest
in which rewards are great in the extreme right-hand tail, but no differentiation is made
elsewhere in the distribution.

                                                 11
the universe of bets placed at the sportsbook (although they are the universe of bets in this

contest), much less at sportsbooks in general. Nor, as discussed below, are the bettors who

participated in the contest likely to be a random subset of all bettors.

        On the other hand, these data do offer enormous advantages over that which is typically

available. Virtually all previous analyses of sports wagering have focused exclusively on prices,

but have not had access to any information about the quantity of bets on each side of the wager

(see, for example, Avery and Chevalier 1999, Golec and Tamarkin 1991, Gray and Gray 1997,

Kuypers 2000).17 In my sample, there are a total of 19,770 bets in the data set covering 242

different games. An average of 80.5 different bettors make a selection on a game, with the

minimum and maximum number of bets on a game ranging from 28 to 146. Although the bettors

included in my sample are not a random selection of all gamblers, they represent a particularly

interesting subset. These bettors are likely to be relatively sophisticated, serious bettors.

Because they are betting at an online sportsbook, they are likely to be geographically quite

diverse. In signing up for the contest, they are indicating an expectation that they plan to visit

(and presumably bet at) the internet sports book every week of the season. In addition, to the

extent there are differences in skill across bettors, this contest should attract the most skillful

players because it rewards exceptional long-run performance.



Section IV: Empirical Results



        17
           In his innovative work, Strumpf (2002) does have actual bets based on seized
bookmaker records. Although his data are extremely informative on a number of questions, they
are less than ideal for the questions posed in this paper both because they cover a short time
period and are geographically localized.

                                                  12
       I begin the analysis by addressing the issue of whether the spread is set so as to equalize

the wagers on either side, as well as testing the predictions of a model of profit-maximizing

bookmakers who exploit biases on the part of bettors. The analysis then turns to the question of

whether bettors differ in their skill at picking winners. Finally, I examine whether aggregating

information across bettors provides any valuable information.

       How do bookmakers set prices?

       The first question addressed is whether bookmakers set prices so as to equalize the

amount of money on either side of the wager. Figure I presents a histogram of the fraction of the

total wagers placed on the team that bettors most prefer. By definition, this fraction must lie

between .5 and 1. If the bookmaker balances bets, these values will be concentrated near .50. In

the data, however, this is clearly not the case. In only twenty percent of the games are 50-55

percent of the wagers placed on the preferred team. In the median game, almost two-thirds of the

bets fall on one side. In almost 10 percent of the games, more than 80 percent of the bets go one

direction.

       The dispersion in Figure I is not simply the result of sampling error due to the fact that I

observe only 80 bets per game on average. If bettor choices were independent and each bettor

had a fifty percent chance of picking either team, than one would expect the preferred team to

garner between 50 and 55 percent of the wagers in nearly two-thirds of the games, compared to

only twenty percent in the data. Furthermore, if the sample is divided in half based on the

number of bets placed, the dispersion of the fraction of wagers placed on the preferred team is




                                                13
actually greater in the games with more total bets.18

       Two alternative hypotheses could explain the failure of the bookmaker to equalize wagers

on the two sides of the spread. The first possibility is that the bookmaker would like to balance

the bets, but is unable to do so because it is difficult to accurately predict what team bettors will

prefer. The second hypothesis is that balancing the wagers is not the objective of the bookmaker.

Indeed, as demonstrated earlier, if bettors exhibit systematic biases, a profit maximizing

bookmaker does not want to equalize the money bet on both sides. Rather, the bookmaker

intentionally skews the odds such that the preferred team attracts more wagers, but wins less than

half of the time.

       If bookmakers are attempting to balance the money bet on each side of the wager, one

would expect that observable characteristics of a team or game would have no power in

predicting the fraction of bettors preferring that team. Otherwise, the bookmaker could have

used that information to set a spread that would have better equalized the distribution of bets. If

the bookmaker is attempting to exploit bettor biases by setting skewed odds, however, the

opposite is true. Dimensions along which bettors exhibit bias should be systematically positively

related to bet shares (and as demonstrated below, will also be systematically negatively related to

win percentages).

       Figures II and III provide some initial evidence on the question of whether observable

characteristics are correlated with the distribution of wagers on a game. Figure II presents a



       18
           Further confirmation of the patterns in Figure I come from data available at
www.wagerline.com. At that website, visitors make hypothetical wagers on game outcomes as
part of small-payoff contests. The breakdown of bets on each team is available. The patterns in
that data are strikingly similar.

                                                  14
histogram of the fraction of bets placed on the home team for the subset of games in which the

home team is the favorite.19 Since the identity of the home team is readily observable, the

histogram in Figure II should be centered around 50 percent if the bookmaker is attempting to

equalize bets on either side of the wager. The distribution is clearly skewed to the right,

implying that home teams systematically attract more than half of the bets in games in which they

are favored. In almost three-quarters of the games, more bets are placed on home favorites than

on their opponents. In the median game, roughly 58 percent of the bets go to the home favorite.

Figure III is identical to Figure II, except that the sample is games in which the visiting team is

favored, and the values in the figure are the fraction of bets placed on the visiting team. In these

games, the distribution of bets is even more skewed. In more than 90 percent of games with a

visiting favorite, more bets are placed on the visitor than the home team. In the median game in

Figure III, two-thirds of the money is wagered on the visitor. Thus, Figures II and III

demonstrate quite definitively that the spreads are set such that substantially more than half of the

bets are placed on favorites.

       Table I further explores the issue of whether observable characteristics are correlated with

betting patterns. The dependent variable in Table I is the percent of bettors who choose the

favorite. The unit of observation is a game. The method of estimation is weighted least squares,

with the weights proportional to the total number of bets placed on the game. The first column



       19
           Note that despite the similarity in the word “favorite” and the phrase “bettors’
preferred team,” these are two completely different concepts. “ Favorite” refers to the team
judged most likely to win the game by the bookmaker. The “bettors’ preferred team,” on the
other hand, is the team that the bettors think is most likely to cover the spread. In other words,
the bettors are making their choices conditional on the bookmaker already setting a spread that
ostensibly equalizes the chance of the favorite and the underdog covering.

                                                 15
of the table demonstrates that, not controlling for anything else, 60.6 percent of the bets accrue to

the favorites. The standard error on that point estimate is .009, so the null hypothesis that 50

percent of the bets are placed on favorites is strongly rejected. Column II adds five indicator

variables corresponding to which team is favored and by how much (the omitted category is

games in which the visitor is favored by more than 6 points). Consistent with the figures

presented earlier, home favorites do not attract as high a fraction of the bets as do visiting

favorites. These five variables capturing the spread are jointly highly statistically significant, as

reported in the bottom of the table. The third column adds dummy variables for each week of the

season. These week dummies are also jointly statistically significant at the .01 level. Although

not shown individually, the dummies suggest that a greater fraction of the bets are placed on

favorites early in the season. Finally, the last column adds thirty-one indicator variables

corresponding to each team in the league. These variables take the value of one if a team is

favored and -1 if the team is an underdog. Once again, the team variables are highly statistically

significant.20 The R2 in the final column of the table is .483, implying that these observable

characteristics explain a great deal of the variation in the fraction of money bet on the favorite.

       The results in Table I uniformly argue against the hypothesis that bookmakers are doing

the best they can to even out the bets on each game, suggesting instead that the imbalance is

intentional. If that is true, then the model presented earlier makes strong predictions about the

expected pattern of winning percentages for bets of different kinds. In particular, teams with

attributes that attract a disproportionate share of the money from bettors (e.g., being the favorite)


       20
           Based on these estimates, the five teams that attracted the most bettors, controlling for
other factors, were Green Bay, Kansas City, New Orleans, Oakland, and San Francisco. The
least popular teams were Baltimore, Chicago, Jacksonville, Pittsburgh, and Saint Louis.

                                                  16
should cover the spread less than fifty percent of the time. But, the deviation from 50-50 cannot

be too large (more than a few percentage points), or bettors who do not suffer from biases can

profitably exploit the price distortion.

        Table II presents evidence consistent with those predictions. The unit of observation in

the table is an individual bet. The first three columns captures the fraction of the bets placed on a

team; columns 4-6 are the percentage of those wagers in which the bettor correctly picks the

winners. Bets are categorized according to whether they are placed on games in which the home

team is favored (top row) or the visiting team is favored (second row), and whether the bet is for

the favorite or the underdog (the columns in table). Mirroring the results presented earlier,

visiting favorites attract a disproportionate share of the bets placed in such games: 68.2 percent

of the total.21 To a lesser degree, home favorites also attract excess bets (56.1 percent). Shifting

focus to columns 4 and 5, the model predicts that a high fraction of bets in columns 1 and 2 will

be associated with low winning percentages in columns 4 and 5. Indeed, the results confirm the

prediction. Across the four categories considered, the rank-order correlation between the

percentage of bets placed and the win percentage is -1. Bets placed on visiting favorites win only

47.8 percent of the time. Bets on home favorites are successful in 49.1 percent of cases. Bets on

underdogs, which are under-represented in the data, win more than half of the time. Notably,

bets on home underdogs have win rates of 57.7 percent, well above the threshold required for a




        21
           By definition, the sum of the fraction of bets on visiting favorites (row 2, column 1)
and home underdogs (row 1, column 2) must add up to 100 percent. The same holds for home
favorites and visiting underdogs.

                                                 17
bettor to break even.22

       One might be tempted to discount the observed relationship between a high fraction of

bets made and low winning percentages since the results are based on the outcomes of only 236

games of a single season. Although it is impossible to obtain the data on quantities for earlier

years, outcomes of games relative to the spread are readily available. Assuming that the strong

tendencies towards betting on favorites are persistent across years, one would expect the patterns

in winning percentages to also be persistent. Indeed, the winning percentage patterns have

previously been documented by Golec and Tamarkin (1991) and Gray and Gray (1997). They are

also present in Table III, which includes results on game outcomes for twenty-one seasons of data

(1980-2001), covering almost 5,000 games. The first column of the table presents the percentage

of bets made on teams of a particular type in the 2001-02 data; the second column is the win

percentage over the past twenty-one years. The results are quite consistent with those of Table II.

Overall, favorites win less than half their games. The null hypothesis of a 50 percent win rate for

favorites is rejected at roughly the .01 level. As predicted, visiting favorites (who attract a

greater share of the bets) do especially poorly, winning only 46.7 percent, again rejecting the null

of a .50 win percent at approximately the .01 level. Given this win percentage, a naive strategy

of always betting against visiting favorites would actually have yielded positive profits over these

two decades (as was also true in 2001-02).23 In light of the consistent lack of success of


       22
          The win percentages on visiting favorites and home underdogs need not sum to 100
percent because the fraction of the bets on the favorite and the underdog varies across games.
       23
           Although not shown in tabular form, the year-by-year patterns in the data confirm the
overall findings. In only 4 of the last 21 years have favorites covered the spread in as many of 50
percent of the games. The likelihood of that occurring if the true win likelihood is .50 is less
than 1in 300. Only 3 times in 21 years have visiting favorites won against the spread in 50

                                                  18
favorites, especially visiting favorites, it is remarkable that the strong bettor bias towards such

bets persists. The bettor bias is not concentrated among a small fraction of bettors, either.

Three-fourths of the contestants chose favorites more often than underdogs. Only two percent of

bettors chose visiting underdogs for at least half of their picks.

        Just how much do bookmakers increase their profits by exploiting bettor biases?

Assuming that (1) the total distribution of bets in this sample is representative of overall betting,

and (2) there is no information in aggregate bettor preferences (the evidence presented below

cannot reject this), it is straightforward using the values in Table II to calculate that the way

spreads are currently set, bettors should win 49.45 percent of their bets.24 Given the standard

“vig” of bettors risking 110 units to win 100, a bookmaker who wins half his bets has a gross

profit rate of 5.0 percent. If bettors win only 49.45 percent of their bets, the expected gross profit

rate jumps to 6.16 percent (.5055*110-.4945*100). Thus, in expectation, this seemingly minor

distortion of the win rate increases gross profits by 23 percent. It is true, of course, that the

bookmaker must bear some risk when the bets are not balanced on both sides of the wager.

Because game outcomes are likely to be independent, however, the risk is minimized as the

number of games played increases. For instance, in the case where 63 percent of the money is

one side of each wager and that team wins 48 percent of the time, over the course of the NFL

season (roughly 250 games) the bookmaker’s expected gross profit rate is 6.1 percent with a

standard deviation of 2.5 percent. Thus, the bookmaker would be expected to make negative


percent of games.
        24
         The number 49.45 is obtained by multiplying the probability that the home favorite
wins a game times the percent of total bets on home favorites plus the probability that the visiting
underdog wins times the percent of overall bets on visiting underdogs, etc.

                                                  19
gross profits less than once every one hundred seasons. If one looks over a five-year time frame,

the standard deviation drops to 1.1 percent. So the probability of a bookmaker losing over any

given five-year period in this scenario is less than one in 10,000. Relative to a 23 percent

increase in gross profit, the costs associated with bearing this level of risk appear minimal.25

       The last two panels of Table III explore the relationship between other factors and betting

on favorites. In the 2001-02 data, a higher fraction of bets were placed on favorites in the first

half of the season than in the second half (63.4 percent versus 56.3 percent), and the week of the

season was highly statistically significant in predicting bet shares in Table I. Whether this is

simply an idiosyncracy of the 2001-02 season is uncertain. Consistent with the theory, the win

percentages for favorites over twenty-years are higher in the second half of the season (48.5

versus 47.7), although the differences is not statistically significant. Finally, the bottom panel of

the table demonstrates that the size of the spread has little impact on the distribution of bets on

the favorite; correspondingly, there is little apparent difference in win percentages across these

games in column 2.

Is there evidence that some bettors are especially skillful in picking winners?

       In order for the current system of price-setting (in which the bookmakers set a price and

do not adjust that price to equilibrate supply and demand) to survive, there cannot exist a

sufficient number of bettors with an ability to pick winners that exceeds that of the bookmaker.

This is particularly true when the bookmaker distorts prices to exploit the subset of bettors with


       25
          A major puzzle in this industry is the rarity of price competition, i.e. the vig is almost
universally 10 percent. It is possible that the bearing of risk somehow supports this equilibrium.
One website, www.tradesports.com, acts as a traditional financial market-maker, matching
buyers and sellers, but taking no positions on game outcomes. The commission charged for this
match-making service is less than 1 percent of the bet – far smaller than the traditional vig.

                                                 20
biases. In that case, a sophisticated bettor only needs to be slightly better than the bookmaker in

determining the true odds to turn a profit.26 Indeed, Strumpf (2002) argues that much of the

internal structure of bookmaker organizations is designed to protect the bookmaker against

adverse selection by these talented bettors.

       Testing for bettor skill is complicated in my data set by the fact that there is a great deal

of attrition over the course of the sample, and the attrition is not random. Bettors who have

performed poorly up to that point in time are much more likely to leave the sample since the

chances of receiving a prize are very low for these contestants.

       I consider two possible approaches for testing for heterogeneity in skill across bettors.

The first approach is to look at the overall distribution of games won over the course of the

season and to test whether that distribution is consistent with that which would have been

generated by homogeneous bettors.27 Because of attrition, however, these data are incomplete.

Approximately 82 percent of possible bets were actually placed. Under the assumption that the

outcomes of bets on the missing games can be modeled as being generated by independent coin

tosses with probability .5, it is possible to simulate what the distribution of wins would have been

without attrition. This approach has the obvious drawback that the simulated portion of the data

is generated by the process that I have defined as the null hypothesis against which to test. Thus,




       26
           And, as demonstrated above, even a naive strategy of betting against all visiting
favorites has been marginally profitable.
       27
           Because the worst-place finisher gets a payoff, those near the bottom have an incentive
to try to intentionally pick losers. If they have some ability to do this, that will exaggerate the
bottom tail, exacerbating deviations from normality.

                                                 21
such a test is biased against rejecting the null of no heterogeneity.28 Figure IV presents a

representative histogram of the distribution of these simulated final win totals. Superimposed on

the histogram is the corresponding normal distribution which the data would be expected to

approximate if generated by i.i.d. coin tosses with a win probability of .50. Visually, the

observed distribution closely mirrors the normal distribution. P-values for the three generally

applied tests of normality (skew test, Shapiro-Francis, and Shapiro-Wilk) are well within the

acceptable range. Thus, with the caveat that the test is biased against rejection due to the

simulated data, there is no evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no differences in skill across

bettors in the sample.

       The second approach to testing whether there is heterogeneity across bettors in ability to

pick winners is to look for persistence in win rates. A priori, it is not known who the skillful

bettors are. Success early in the season, however, is likely to be a (possibly noisy) signal of

talent. Thus, in the presence of heterogeneity in skill, one would expect those who do better at

the beginning of the season to also outperform later in the season. Like the test of homogeneity

of skill presented above, this approach is not robust to particular sources of attrition. If high-

skilled bettors who have been unlucky in the early part of the season are less likely to quit than

similarly placed low-skilled bettors, than this approach will be biased against finding

heterogeneity in skill across bettors. The poor-performing bettors who persist will be

disproportionately drawn from the high-skilled group and thus will be expected to perform well

on average later in the season.


       28
           In defense of the manner in which the missing data are generated, other results
presented below suggest that there is no evidence of serial correlation across weeks in a given
bettors ability to pick winners.

                                                  22
       Bearing in mind this caveat, I estimate equations of the form

(4)    WINbwg =" + $1Hbw + $2(Hbw)2 + $3(Hbw)3 + $4(Hbw)4 + (Xbw ,bwg



where b, w, and g denote bettors, weeks of the season, and specific games respectively. WIN

is a variable equal to one if the bettor picks the game and covers the spread, .5 if the game is a

push, and zero otherwise. The variable H represents the bettors cumulative historical winning

percentage across all games played thus far in the season. The vector X captures other predictors

of whether or not the bet is won, for example if the team chosen is a visiting favorite. The

quartic in the cumulative winning percentage is designed to non-parametrically capture the serial

correlation across betting performances. The first week of the season is omitted from the

regression because there is no bettor history. The equation is estimated using weighted least

squares, with weights determined by the number of games making up the history. The reported

standard errors have been corrected through clustering to account for the fact that H is correlated

across games for a given contestant.

       Table IV reports results of the estimation. In the first column, the cumulative betting

success rate is constrained to enter linearly. Although not statistically significant, the point

estimate implies that bettors who have been more successful up until that point in the season are

predicted to do slightly worse in the current week. This argues against heterogeneity in skill

across bettors, which would lead to a positive coefficient. The bottom panel of the table reports

the predicted success rate for bettors with varying win percentages up to this point in the season.

Bettors across the entire range are predicted to get slightly more than fifty percent of the bets

correct. The second equation adds the quartic in betting history. Although the history variables


                                                  23
are jointly statistically significant, the R2 is very low (.0004). Bettors averaging 40 or 50 percent

correct up to this point are predicted to perform right around 50 percent, bettors who have won

60 percent of games prior to this week are projected to win only 48.7 percent of games. Once

again, these results argue against persistent differences in skill. Adding covariates in column 3

has little impact on the conclusions. Columns 4 and 5 restrict the sample to exclude the first five

and ten weeks respectively, on the rationale that cumulative win percentages early in the season

may not be very informative. The results provide no evidence that strong past performance

predicts wins today.

       In summary, there is little in the data to suggest that, at least in this particular sample,

there is heterogeneity in skill across bettors. This result may be due partially to the relative

sophistication of bettors in the sample – perhaps the most naive bettors are unlikely to frequent

internet bookmakers. 29

Does pooling information across bettor preferences help in predicting the outcome of games?

       In other contexts, it has been argued that aggregating information across agents provides

valuable information in predicting future outcomes. For example, Clemen and Winkler (1986)

and Fomby and Samant (1991) find that the consensus estimate of future GNP growth is a better

predictor than any one individual’s estimate. One might also expect such a pattern to be present

in sports betting, especially because price is set unilaterally by the bookmaker. To the extent that

the bookmaker sometimes makes mistakes, one would expect that many bettors will

simultaneously recognize the presence of the mistake and disproportionately pick one team.


       29
          Strumpf (2002), for instance, reports the existence of a fraction of New York bettors
who always bet on the Yankees, even though the bookmakers, knowing their preferences,
systematically offer these bettors substantially worse odds than other clients.

                                                  24
       There is one simple result in my data which suggests that aggregating opinions across

bettors may carry valuable information: despite the fact that more than half the money is bet on

favorites and the bookmaker set the odds so that favorites win less than half the games, the

overall winning percentage for bets placed is 50.1 percent. As noted earlier, based on the odds

offered by the bookmaker and the distribution of money bet, one would expect 49.45 percent of

all bets to win if there was no correlation between the percentage of bettors choosing a game and

the game’s outcome. The difference between 50.1 percent and 49.45 percent implies that games

in which a greater fraction of bettors choose the favorite (or alternatively the underdog) are more

likely to be won by the favorite (underdog). Thus, in principle one might believe that knowledge

of aggregate bettor preferences might be useful in prediction, making access to quantity data

(which is in general very difficult to obtain, but is available prior to the start of the games

through this contest) valuable.30

       Table V provides additional suggestive evidence on this issue. Bets are divided into four

categories: home favorites, visiting favorites, home underdogs, and visiting underdogs. Within

each category, bets are divided into quartiles according to how popular that team was with

bettors. For instance, the top quartile of bets on home favorites would capture those bets in

which an especially high share of the people making selections in that game chose the favorite.

Results presented in the table show the total for all games (the first column) and then broken

down by quartile (columns 2-5). If aggregating bettor preferences is valuable in predicting


       30
           Interestingly, the win percentage for mock bets placed at www.wagerline.com were
49.5 percent in 2001 – precisely what would be expected if aggregate bettor preferences
contained no information. One possible explanation for the difference in win rates between the
bettors in my sample and those at wagerline is that my sample contains a more sophisticated set
of gamblers who have much more money at risk.

                                                  25
performance against the spread, then one would expect to observe a monotonic, declining win

percentage moving from the top quartile to the bottom quartile of bets by popularity. In practice,

bets in the second quartile yield the highest winning percentage (52.9 percent). The top and third

quartiles also win more than 50 percent of bets. The worst performance by far (46.6 percent) is

for those selections that are least popular with bettors. Thus, while the evidence is mixed, there is

at least a suggestion in the data of the possibility that popular bets fare better, at least relative to

the least popular choices in the bottom quartile.

        Table VI tackles this question more rigorously in a regression framework that estimates

the impact of a bet’s popularity non-parametrically using a fourth-order polynomial and

controlling for other factors such as week of the season dummies and team-fixed effects. In

addition, Table VI reports standard errors corrected for the fact that although there are over

19,000 bets made, there are only a few hundred game outcomes; for a given game, the bet

outcomes will be perfectly correlated, so effectively there are only a few hundred degrees of

freedom. The results of the table provide suggestive, but ultimately quite weak, evidence in

support of the value of aggregating preferences. In columns 1 and 2, a bet’s popularity among

bettors enters linearly. The coefficient is .11, implying that a ten percentage point increase in the

number of bettors favoring a particular gamble is associated with a 1.1 percentage point increase

in the likelihood that team wins. While substantively large, the estimate is not statistically

significant. When allowing the coefficient on a bet’s popularity to vary in a non-linear fashion,

the individual coefficients are no longer readily interpretable, so I report average win percents by

quartile in the bottom panel of the table. The patterns observed in columns 3-5 are similar to

those in the raw data, with the bets in the top half of the distribution winning more than fifty


                                                    26
percent and bets in the bottom quartile doing especially poorly. It is important to note, however,

that the coefficients on bet popularity are in all cases jointly insignificant (as reflected in the P-

values reported near the bottom of the table). Thus, great caution must be exercised in drawing

any conclusions from these regressions.



Section V: Conclusions

        This paper utilizes a unique data set that includes information on both the prices and

quantities of bets placed to analyze the workings of the market for gambling on NFL football.

The results provide an answer to the apparent puzzle of why these markets do not look much like

markets at all, characterized by small and infrequent price changes. The answer is that the

bookmakers are better at predicting game outcomes than the typical bettor. As a consequence,

the bookmakers are able to set prices in order to exploit their greater talent, and apparently

yielding greater profits than could be obtained if the bookmakers acted like traditional market

makers and attempted to equilibrate supply and demand, avoiding taking large stakes in the

outcomes of games. In the presence of some bettors who are as skillful in picking games as are

the bookmakers, there are limits to how much prices can be distorted without creating profit

opportunities. It appears that the bookmakers have distorted prices to the point where they bump

up against this limit.

        In order to support this mode of price-setting, it cannot be the case that a significant

fraction of bettors (or more precisely dollars bet) have better information than the bookmaker. In

that case, it would be the bookmaker who would be exploited by this system. At least within my

sample of bettors, I see little evidence of heterogeneity in ability to pick winners, suggesting that


                                                   27
the bookmaker might be as good or better at picking game outcomes than any of the bettors.

Given the incentives for the bookmaker to get the spread right, it is hardly surprising that the

most talented individuals would be employed as the odds makers.

       Perhaps, then, a fundamental difference between gambling and financial markets is that it

is possible in gambling to find and hire a small set of individuals (the odds makers) who can

systematically do better in predicting game outcomes than can bettors overall. In financial

markets, on the other hand, the flow of inside information or the inherent complexity in valuing

companies may make it impossible for one individual to do better than the market, meaning that

a market maker who acted like a bookmaker would do worse than one who simply equilibrated

supply and demand and took advantage of the bid-ask spread.31 Notably, betting on horse racing

and dog racing, which is characterized by extreme insider information on the part of those who

own and train the animals, is typically (though not always) done in a parimutuel framework that

ensures the market maker a fixed profit.




       31
          Certainly, the weight of the evidence regarding the inability of fund managers to
systematically beat the market indexes is consistent with this idea.

Notes: The dependent variable in all regressions is equal to one if the bettor wins the bet, zero otherwise. The unit of
observation is a bet. A bettor’s cumulative ranking on win percentage is calculated by taking an unweighted average
of that bettor’s win percentage on all bets up to that point in time, and then computing the bettor’s rank among all
bettors. The method of estimation is weighted least squares, with the weights proportional to the total number of
games making up the year-to-date history. Standard errors (in parentheses) are corrected to take into account
correlation in the cumulative rank variable across bets for a given bettor.
