Equity Concerns are Narrowly Framed

                                         ABSTRACT

Distributional decisions regularly involve multiple payoﬀ components. In a series of experiments
involving over 3,300 subjects and 81,000 decisions, we ﬁnd that—even when payoﬀ components
can be easily aggregated—many subjects exhibit narrow equity concerns, applying fairness
preferences to a single component of payoﬀs. This behavior leads to preference reversals;
subjects make diﬀerent choices depending on which payoﬀ component is used to denominate
their decision. In our simplest setting, in which the two payoﬀ components are small and large
tokens, displaying narrow equity concerns is 63%–83% as prevalent as achieving equity in total
payoﬀs and just as prevalent as applying the well-documented norm of a 50/50-split. Subjects
also exhibit narrowly equity concerns over payoﬀs of time and money.

1    Introduction
    Economists have generated a significant and growing body of research about how individuals
choose to distribute resources between parties. How individual make such distributional decisions
directly informs the types of tax policies and social welfare programs policy makers propose and
constituents support; how employers allocate work, resources, and rewards among employees;
how parties negotiate; how parents invest in their multiple children; and how individuals make
payoff decisions in myriad other settings.
    Central to this work is the role of fairness attitudes. Guided by a rich body of theoretical work
(see, e.g., Rabin (1993), Fehr and Schmidt (1999), and Bolton and Ockenfels (2000)), economists
have identified the empirical relevance of different notions of fairness and have investigated the
underlying drivers of these fairness attitudes. This empirical work has taken a variety of forms.
Some has focused on the tradeoff between equality and selfishness (see, e.g., results from the
dictator game reviewed in Engel (2011)). Some has focused on the tradeoff between equality and
efficiency (see, e.g., Engelmann and Strobel (2004) and Fehr, Naef and Schmidt (2006)). Some
has focused on the source of inequities, such as luck versus one’s own performance (see, e.g.,
Mollerstrom, Reme and Sørensen (2015), and Gee, Migueis and Parsa (2017)). More generally,
this empirical work considers a variety of fairness principles, such as those involving “equality
of opportunity,” “equality of outcomes,” and “equity” (see, e.g., Konow (2000) and Cappelen
et al. (2007)). As evidence of the careful control employed by the experimental work on these
topics, one common feature of these studies is a focus on a simplified decision environment that
considers payoffs comprised of a single component (e.g., cash payoffs).
    This focus on a single payoff component is key to many of the insights gleaned in this prior
work. However, it leaves open many questions about how individuals make distributional deci-
sions when outcomes depend on multiple payoff components. Since policy makers and individuals
regularly make distributional decisions in settings with multiple payoff components (e.g., income,
wealth, leisure time, access to resources such as healthcare and education), we want to develop
an understanding of how they make choices in these settings.
    We design an experiment in which subjects decide how to distribute payoffs in the presence
of full information on two payoff components (i.e., small tokens and large tokens) with a clear,
simple exchange rate between them (i.e., large tokens are worth twice as much as small tokens).
The clear, simple exchange rate allows subjects to collapse the two payoff components into a
single measure of total payoff value. One might hypothesize that this is exactly what subjects
will do. If subjects were to do this consistently, prior work on a single payoff component might be
sufficient to explain distributional decisions in settings with multiple payoff components, since it
would suggest that individuals determine the total value of multiple components and apply their
fairness preferences to that total payoff. For example, equity concerned subjects could choose to
aggregate across small and large tokens to calculate the total payoffs and then achieve “overall

                                                 1
equity” by equalizing total payoffs, accounting for both types of tokens. While some subjects
behave in this way, we find robust evidence that this is not the whole story.
    Across a series of experiments involving more than 3,300 subjects making more than 81,000 de-
cisions, we document that distributional decisions are not fully driven by overall equity concerns.
Rather, subjects regularly choose to equalize payoffs on the component they are considering—
achieving what we call “narrow equity”—even though this leads them to make systematic rever-
sals in their distributional decisions when facing the same choice multiple times.
    All of our study versions involve a subject deciding how to affect the payoffs of two study
participants whose payoffs are comprised of two components. In our main study versions, payoffs
are comprised of the small and large tokens described above, which are converted to cash at
the end of the study. Subjects play in the role of third-party social planners. In each decision,
they face a pair of study participants with randomly determined endowments of small and large
tokens, and they choose one of three allocation options that adjust these endowments, generating
final participant earnings. The endowment sets vary the participants’ number of small and large
tokens—and thus total monetary value—before the subject chooses an allocation. The allocation
options remain the same across decisions in terms of how they affect participant earnings, but
they are sometimes denominated in small tokens and sometimes denominated in large tokens.
    Consistent with the “overall equity” hypothesis raised above, subjects often choose the allo-
cation that equalizes participants’ total payoffs, so that they end up with an equal amount of
money (i.e., aggregating across both small and large tokens). In 28% to 48% of decisions, how-
ever, subjects forgo achieving overall equity to instead achieve narrow equity: equalizing only the
component of payoffs they are asked to allocate (i.e., equalizing small tokens when their decision
is denominated in small tokens and equalizing large tokens when their decision is denominated
in large tokens). This pattern leads subjects to make different distributional decisions depending
on the type of token they are asked to allocate. That is, we observe the same subject, facing
the same endowment set, making different choices depending on whether their impact on payoffs
is denominated in small tokens or large tokens. While the exact percentage of subjects who
achieve narrow equity changes across endowment sets, we find that achieving narrow equity is
63%–83% as prevalent as achieving overall equity. We also find that achieving narrow equity is
just as prevalent as the well-documented phenomenon of achieving a “50/50-split,” choosing an
allocation that affects both participants equally, ignoring any existing endowment differences.
    Additional study versions document the robustness of narrow equity concerns by showing that
narrow equity concerns persist in a study version with a cognitive screen, persist in settings with
higher stakes, persist when subjects’ choices affect their own payoffs, do not depend on whether
allocations add to or subtract from endowments, and persist in environments without endow-
ments. Along with the many design features we implement to bolster subject comprehension (see
Section 2.4), all of these results point to subjects exhibiting narrow equity concerns even though


                                                2
they are cognitively capable of determining which of the three allocation options achieves overall
equity. While we are therefore confident that narrow equity is not chosen because subjects are
cognitively incapable of achieving overall equity, this need not imply that narrow equity arises
due to a preference for making only one payoff component equal. There is no reason for subjects
to differentially care about cash payoffs resulting from small tokens rather than large tokens in
our study, a design feature that is key to our identification strategy.1 Instead of being a prefer-
ence, narrow equity concerns may arise because focusing on the payoff component that one can
influence allows individuals to apply notions of fairness to a slightly simplified decision-making
environment.2 More generally, the idea that people focus more on the dimension that they can
influence is loosely related to the idea—explored by models like salience (Bordalo, Gennaioli and
Shleifer, 2012, 2013), focusing (Kőszegi and Szeidl, 2013), and relative thinking (Bushong, Rabin
and Schwartzstein, 2017)—that the variability along a dimension influences the degree to which
people focus on that dimension.
    Another set of study versions show that narrow equity concerns also arise when the payoff
components are money and time (i.e., rather than small and large tokens). These study versions
confirm the robustness of our results to considering payoff components that comprise budgets in
practice. They also reveal that subjects are more likely to achieve narrow equity when considering
time than when considering money, leading us to say that subjects are more inequity averse in
time than in money.
    The main contribution of this paper is in improving our understanding of how individuals
make distributional decisions. Many distributional decisions involve multiple payoff components.
In these settings, decisions cannot be fully explained by individuals aggregating across multiple
relevant components of payoffs to achieve overall equity. Nor can they be fully explained by
individuals ignoring differences in endowed components of payoffs and implementing 50/50-splits.
By identifying the relevance of narrow equity concerns, we show that many individuals gravitate
   1
     This distinguishes our findings from prior work in which subjects display differential fairness attitudes towards
cash payments that might have come from different sources. For example, and as detailed in our discussion of
future work, subjects may appear to care more about inequity arising from one source (e.g., effort) relative to
another source (e.g., luck), but this need not be reflective of narrow equity. It could be that subjects differentially
care about cash earned from effort relative to cash earned from luck.
   2
     Much of the recent work on cognitive biases relates to how individuals update in environments with uncertainty
(see, e.g., Enke and Zimmermann (2019) and Enke (2020)), and more closely related to some of our results, see
the recent work in Ellis and Freeman (2020). We also note that the contribution of our paper is not to show
the narrow bracketing exists, but rather to provide insight into how distributional decisions are influenced by
multiple payoff components, which uncovers the role of narrow bracketing of equity concerns. Moreover, we show
how it operates (i.e., individuals aim to achieve equity on the payoff component they can influence) and pursue
an identification strategy that allows us to separately identify narrow equity from other fairness principles. For
examples of work on narrow bracketing and aggregation failures in other contexts, often involving uncertainty or
a series of choices, see Kahneman and Tversky (1979); Gneezy and Potters (1997); Read et al. (1999); Hsee et al.
(2003); Barberis and Huang (2006); Barberis, Huang and Thaler (2006); Gottlieb and Mitchell (2015); Rabin and
Weizsäcker (2009); Hayashi (2011); Ding (2012); Andreoni and Yan (2018); Davis and Leider (2018); Ellis and
Freeman (2020).

towards achieving equity on the component of payoffs they are considering. That individuals
choose to achieve narrow equity rather than overall equity in an exceedingly simple environment
suggests that individuals may engage in similar patterns in more complex environments as well.
    Our results make clear the importance of more work that directly examines how distributional
decisions are influenced by multiple payoff components. Indeed, we think there are many rich,
open avenues for future work, three of which we speak to with our results and detail below. The
first relates to the potential role of simple “deontological” decision rules—which may complement
the various fairness principles carefully examined by prior literature—in driving distributional
decisions.3 The second and third relate to the potential for narrow equity—and the extent to
which individuals achieve narrow equity across different payoff components—to help explain
other behavioral phenomena.
    First, our results point to a need for more work on rules that individuals use to make distri-
butional decisions. Part of what makes the prior literature on fairness rich is its focus on how
individuals are guided by various deeply held principles of fairness (e.g., such as those that relate
to equality of outcomes versus equality of opportunity or equality-efficiency tradeoffs). However,
there is much less work on the rules that individuals develop to help them make distributional
decisions in complex environments. Our paper suggests that, rather than implementing fairness
rules that aggregate over payoffs, such as overall equity, or that ignore endowments, such as
a 50/50-split, many individuals focus on the component of payoffs they are asked to allocate.
Building off of the deontological notions of fairness discussed in Andreoni et al. (2019), we note
that a simple rule could explain choice reversals in our paradigm and in other paradigms where
individuals adhere to one fairness principle in one setting but another fairness principle in an-
other setting. Namely, individuals may follow a deontological rule: “Apply principles of fairness
on dimensions you can easily control in a given decision environment.”4 Due to the complex-
ity inherent in many distributional decisions, investigating the predictive power of such decision
rules may be a particularly fruitful avenue for future work. We also stress that individuals do not
appear to simply implement whichever rule is cognitively “easiest.” Even in our setting, there is a
cognitively easier decision-rule—appeal to the well-documented fairness principle of a 50/50-split
and ignore endowments altogether—and yet evidence of narrow equity concerns persists.
    Second, by employing identification strategies similar to ours, future work may pinpoint the
extent to which narrow equity can help explain behavioral phenomena observed in the liter-
   3
     Deontological ethics judge an action according to whether it adheres to a simple rule (or set of rules) rather
than the ultimate consequences of an action (e.g.,“do not lie”).
   4
     Such a deontological rule could explain the prevalence of the 50/50-split across a range of contexts. If
individuals focus on how they directly influence outcomes and ignore other factors, such as endowments and
deservingness considerations, achieving a 50/50-split of available resources satisfies this rule. This rule is also
consistent with individuals applying ex-ante fairness in ex-ante decisions and ex-post fairness in ex-post decisions
(see Krawczyk and Lec (2010); Brock, Lange and Ozbay (2013); Cappelen et al. (2013); Trautmann and Wakker
(2010); Trautmann and van de Kuilen (2016); Andreoni et al. (2019) for related findings).



                                                         4
ature. For example, it has long been hypothesized that some form of narrow bracketing may
explain why individuals appear to care more about inequity in payoffs within an experiment than
potential inequities in payoffs outside of the lab. However, other explanations—such as there
being more uncertainty in payoffs outside of the lab—have prevented the prior literature from
conclusively documenting narrow equity concerns.5 That we document clear evidence of narrow
equity concerns lends—in our view—long-awaited credence to this important hypothesis. It also
makes clear the potential benefit of more work on narrow equity and whether it can explain the
malleability of decisions as environments and reference groups change.6
    Third, our results open up questions for future work related to whether narrow equity concerns
differ across payoff components. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we find that subjects are equally likely
to achieve narrow equity in small tokens as they are to achieve narrow equity in large tokens.
However, in our additional experiments considering time and money, subjects are significantly
more likely to achieve narrow equity in time than in money, which leads us to say that they
are more inequity averse in time than in money. This last finding, as detailed in Section 5.3,
could prove particularly helpful in unifying some findings about how choices differ across the
domains of time and money. Relatedly, we hope future work examines the relative size of narrow
equity concerns of many payoff components, particularly those considered to reflect measures of
wellbeing, such as income, assets, education, and healthcare. In light of the compelling recent
work on the relationship between fairness preferences and the acceptance of different types of
inequality across societies (e.g., see Almås, Cappelen and Tungodden (Forthcoming)), identifying
differential concerns for achieving narrow equity across these payoff components may help explain
policy preferences and help us understand potential barriers to achieving broader societal equity.
    The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the experimental design
of the main study version, the Tokens version, and Section 3 presents the corresponding results.
Section 4 presents the design of six additional study versions in the same paradigm and presents
their results. Section 5 presents the design and results of three additional study versions in which
payoff components are money and time. Section 6 concludes with a broader discussion of how
our results speak to a variety of behavior phenomena and empirical findings.

2       Design of the Tokens version
2.1     Design Overview
   In the Tokens version, each subject faces decisions as a social planner. In each decision,
the subject can influence the payoffs of two other study participants—called the first partici-
pant and the second participant—by making an allocation choice. Payoffs are comprised of two
    5

    6
    For example, narrow bracketing of equity concerns may speak to prior work on the malleability of reference
groups over which individuals apply their fairness preferences (McDonald et al., 2013; Schumacher et al., 2017;
Fisman, Kuziemko and Vannutell, 2018; Bolton, Dimant and Schmidt, 2019).


                                                      5
components: “small tokens” (worth 1 cent) and “large tokens” (worth 2 cents).
    In all decisions, the first participant is endowed with 140 small tokens and 70 large tokens,
worth a total of $2.80 (i.e., $1.40 in small tokens and $1.40 in large tokens). The second partici-
pant is randomly endowed with one of 13 combinations of small and large tokens, worth between
$2.00 and $3.60. The possible endowment sets for the two participants are shown in Table 1 and
Table B.1. We refer to each endowment set as a “scenario.”7 For reasons that will become clear
in what follows, we pay particular attention to the endowment sets shown in Table 1, which we
call our “main scenarios.”
    Each subject faces each scenario twice, once when making a small-token allocation decision
and once when making a large-token allocation decision. In each small-token decision (see Ap-
pendix Figure D.3 for an example screenshot), the subject chooses between three options for
taking away a total of 80 small tokens (i.e., $0.80) from the two participants.8 The options are
to take away:

   1. 20 small tokens from the first participant and 60 small tokens from the second participant
      (the “Favors1” allocation)

   2. 40 small tokens from each (the “Equal” allocation)

   3. 60 small tokens from the first participant and 20 small tokens from the second participant
      (the “Favors2” allocation)

   Similarly, in each large-token decision (see Appendix Figure D.4 for an example screenshot),
the subject chooses between three options for taking away a total of 40 large tokens (i.e., $0.80)
from the two participants. The options are to take away:

   1. 10 small tokens from the first participant and 30 small tokens from the second participant
      (the “Favors1” allocation)

   2. 20 small tokens from each (the “Equal” allocation)

   3. 30 small tokens from the first participant and 10 small tokens from the second participant
      (the “Favors2” allocation)

   Looking across the small-token and large-token decisions, we see that the three options are
parallel in terms of their effects on payoffs. In both small-token and large-token decisions, the
   7
      As shown in the final column of these tables, we label each scenario according to the extent to which the
endowment favors the first or second participant. Relative to the first participant, the second participant is
endowed fewer small tokens in “S-favors1” scenarios, more small tokens in “S-favors2” scenarios, an equal number
of small tokens in “S-equal” scenarios, fewer large tokens in “L-favors1” scenarios, more large tokens in “L-favors2”
scenarios, and an equal number of large tokens in “L-equal” scenarios.
    8
      The options are named based on who they favor: the “Favors1” allocation takes away less money from the
first participant, the “Equal” allocation takes away the same amount of money from both participants, and the
“Favors2” allocation takes away less money from the second participant.

       The table displays the endowments for the first participant and for the second participant as well as
       the resulting endowment differences in each main scenario. Each small token is worth 1 cent, and each
       large token is worth 2 cents. In each small token decision, subjects choose between taking away from
       the first/second participant either: 20/60 small tokens, 40/40 small tokens, or 60/20 small tokens. In
       each large token decision, subjects choose between taking away from the first/second participant either:
       10/30 large tokens, 20/20 large tokens, or 30/10 large tokens.



“Favors1” allocation takes away $0.20 from the first participant and $0.60 from the second
participant; the “Equal” allocation takes away $0.40 from each; and the “Favors2” allocation
takes away $0.60 from the first participant and $0.20 from the second participant. As is explained
in detail in what follows, we identify preferences for narrow equity by looking at a given scenario
and examining how subjects’ allocation choices change based on whether the allocation choice is
denominated in small or large tokens.

2.2       Identification of Equity Concerns
    To explore narrow equity, we need to formally define it, and it is also useful to define two
other types of equity that subjects may aim to achieve in the experiment. In this section, we
define Overall Equity, a 50/50-split, and Narrow Equity and describe how we identify narrow
equity concerns in our experiment.
    An allocation choice achieves Overall Equity (O-equity) if both participants end up with
equal monetary payoffs (i.e., aggregating over small and large tokens). Overall equity can be
achieved in all of our “main scenarios,” listed in Table 1. When the endowment set gives both
participants $2.80 (i.e., Scenarios A, F, and G), achieving overall equity requires choosing the
“Equal” allocation. When endowments initially favor the first participant by $0.40 (Scenarios
B and D), achieving overall equity requires choosing the “Favors2” allocation, which offsets the


                                                        7
endowment inequity. When endowments initially favor the second participant by $0.40 (Scenarios
C and E), achieving overall equity requires choosing the “Favors1” allocation, which offsets the
endowment inequity. Social planners motivated by outcome-based fairness would be drawn to
overall equity in our setting, since it equalizes participants’ earnings from the experiment.
    We define a 50/50-split as choosing the “Equal” allocation, which takes away the same amount
of money (i.e., the same number of tokens) from both participants. It is always possible to
achieve a 50/50-split in our experiment, since it does not depend on—and, as an equity concept,
ignores—endowments. As in other work, subjects may be drawn to a 50/50-split.9 However,
subjects who always adhere to a 50/50-split would not exhibit narrow equity concerns since a
50/50-split involves choosing the Equal allocation, regardless of whether it is a small-token or
large-token decision. Thus, for evidence of narrow equity concerns to arise in our environment,
subjects must have both the desire and ability to account for—to some degree—inequities in
endowments.
    An allocation choice achieves Narrow Equity (N-equity) if it achieves equity on the component
of payoffs the social planner can control with their allocation choice. That is, an allocation
achieves narrow equity if the two participants end up with the same number of small tokens when
a subject makes a small-token decision or if the two participants end up with the same number
of large tokens when a subject makes a large-token decision. Narrow equity can be achieved in
all of our main scenarios, listed in Table 1, and in some of our additional scenarios.10 While
narrow equity is not an equity concept directly explored by prior literature—indeed, identifying
it is what motivated our current study—we posit that individuals might be drawn to narrow
equity as a way of simplifying their decision-making process while still countering some inequity
in endowments. Subjects who choose to achieve narrow equity account for endowments but focus
primarily on achieving equity on the component being asked about in their allocation decision.
This reflects a narrow focus on (or an overweighting of) small-tokens when making small-token
decisions and large-tokens when making large-token decisions.
    Table 2 shows which of these three types of equity result from each of the three allocation
options available to subjects in our main scenarios. The table also makes transparent our strategy
for identifying evidence of narrow equity.
   9
      In our design, the “Equal” allocation is always the middle option of a subjects’ three choices. This means that
we do not separate a preference for a 50/50-split from a preference for the middle option that might arise for other
reasons. If subjects choose the middle option for other reasons, it may look like they care more about achieving
a 50/50-split than they actually do. (That said, only 10% of subjects always choose the “Equal” allocation in all
their decisions of our Tokens version). Importantly, however, we are not interested in a choice of a 50/50-split per
se, as our focus is on identifying choices for narrow equity, defined next. Nevertheless, the potential preference
for a 50/50-split motivates some of our experimental design choices, highlighted in what follows.
   10
      We can also define narrow equity and overall equity as follows. If, after the allocation decision has been made,
Ti is the total payoff of participant i, Si is the number of small tokens held by participant i, and Li is the number
of large tokens held by participant i, then the difference in final payoffs is: T1 −T2 = (S1 −S2 )∗1 cent+(L1 −L2 )*2
cents. We say that T1 − T2 = 0 implies overall equity, S1 − S2 = 0 implies narrow equity in small-token decisions,
and L1 − L2 = 0 implies narrow equity in large-token decisions.

       The table shows the type of equity arising from each possible allocation that a social planner may
       choose in each of the main scenarios (see Table 1 for details on the endowments in each main scenario).
       The Favors1 allocation takes away 20/60 cents from the first/second participant, the Equal allocation
       takes away 40/40 cents from the first/second participant, and the Favors2 allocation takes 60/20 cents
       from the first/second participant. Small-Token allocations take away these cents by taking away the
       corresponding number of small tokens, and Large-Token allocations take away these cents by taking
       away the corresponding number of large tokens. O-equity implies that both participants end up with
       equal total payoffs. N-equity implies that both participants end up with equal numbers of small (large)
       tokens from small-token (large-token) decision. A 50/50-split implies that a small-token (large-token)
       decision takes away an equal number of small (large) tokens from both participants—regardless of how
       many tokens they end up with.



   Consider Scenario A, in which endowments are identical across the two participants. The
“Equal” allocation, which preserves this equity, achieves all three types of equity, and this does
not vary by whether subjects make small-token or large-token decisions. In scenarios B–G,
in contrast, which choice achieves narrow equity depends on whether the subject is making
a small-token or a large-token decision.11 For each of these scenarios, we compare choices in
small-token decisions and large-token decisions to investigate whether the distribution of choices
changes and, in particular, to observe whether subjects gravitate towards the choice that achieves
  11
    The choice that achieves the other types of equity does not change with the type of token. Because each of the
allocations—“Favors1,” “Equal,” and “Favors2”—are monetarily equivalent going from small-token to large-token
decisions, which allocation achieves overall equity in a scenario does not depend on the type of token. Similarly,
a 50/50-split always involves choosing the “Equal” allocation and does not depend on the type of token.


                                                        9
narrow equity. This pattern would involve subjects who face the same endowment set and
allocation options making systematically different choices when they are allocating small-tokens
and allocating large-tokens, despite the two questions being monetarily equivalent.
    For example, consider Scenario B. Subjects who do not exhibit concerns for narrow equity
should be equally likely to choose the Favors2 small-token allocation and the Favors2 large-token
allocation. On the other hand, subjects who display a preference for narrow equity would be
more likely to choose the Favors2 small-token allocation than the Favors2 large-token allocation,
since the former achieves narrow equity and the latter does not. Similarly, these subjects would
be less likely to choose the Equal small-token allocation than the Equal large-token allocation,
since the latter achieves narrow equity and the former does not. More generally, for each of the
main scenarios B–G, we can examine whether subjects’ choices gravitate toward the allocation
that achieves narrow equity when they make small-token and large-token allocation decisions.

2.3     Design Rationales Related to Identification
    A few features of our design are of note, as they help to separate our results from alternative
explanations. First, we focus our primary analysis on our main scenarios (Scenarios A–G) so
that we can observe whether subjects choose to achieve narrow equity in settings where it is
possible to achieve overall equity. Subjects who care primarily about achieving overall equity
should not respond to which choice achieves narrow equity when overall equity is possible. That
said, we show the robustness of our results to the additional scenarios in which overall equity
cannot be achieved.12
    Second, we place subjects in the role of social planners, both to explore how individuals
make distributional decisions from a social planner perspective (e.g., such as when policy makers
design social programs or when employers decide how to distribute rewards or resources among
employees) and to avoid confounds introduced by the well-documented role of self-serving motives
on fairness attitudes (Konow, 2000, 2009; Croson and Gneezy, 2009; Haisley and Weber, 2010;
Karadja, Mollerstrom and Seim, 2017). That said, we confirm the robustness of our results to
environments where subjects make decisions from the first-party perspective, as shown in Section
4.7.
    Third, to exclude other fairness considerations that may come into play once individuals have
some control over their outcomes (Krawczyk, 2010; Cappelen et al., 2013; Mollerstrom, Reme
and Sørensen, 2015; Akbaş, Ariely and Yuksel, 2016; Gee, Migueis and Parsa, 2017), subjects
know that the endowments given to the participants are chosen randomly in each decision.13
  12
     We note, however, that showing the prevalence of narrow equity concerns when overall equity cannot be
achieved could be viewed as a weaker test of the prevalence of narrow equity concerns.
  13
     See, also, the related literature that examines how “earning the right” to be a dictator in the dictator game
influences generosity (i.e., the entitlement effect; see Hoffman et al. (1994) for early evidence and Engel (2011)
for a review) as well as work where such an entitlement effect is absent (e.g., see the ultimatum game in Demiral
and Mollerstrom (2018)).



                                                       10
    Fourth, given the compelling literature on ex-ante versus ex-post principles of fairness (Krawczyk
and Lec, 2010; Brock, Lange and Ozbay, 2013; Cappelen et al., 2013; Trautmann and Wakker,
2010; Trautmann and van de Kuilen, 2016; Andreoni et al., 2019) as well as work on the role of
uncertainty in distributional decisions (Roth and Murnighan, 1982), subjects make all decisions
in the ex-post frame and are provided with full information that allows them to equalize—with
certainty—total payoffs between the two participants.
    Fifth, one could imagine an alternative definition of “overall equity” that includes components
of payoffs from outside of the laboratory, such as differences in income, wealth, or access to
health care and other resources. In this case, it would be infeasible to identify narrow equity
concerns versus overall equity concerns, since we cannot elicit beliefs and preferences over all
possible components in a way that would allow us to identify what overall equity concerns
should imply for distributional preferences in our experiment. Consequently, we instead test
whether individuals have narrow equity concerns (over small tokens when making small-token
decisions or large tokens when making large-token decisions) relative to broader equity concerns
that would take into account participants’ final earnings determined by the number of small and
large tokens.
    Sixth, payoffs in our experiment are comprised of two components, but we only allow subjects
to influence one component of payoffs in each decision. One reason for this is to match settings
outside of the laboratory in which individuals are rarely able to achieve equity on all dimensions
that influence utility simultaneously.14 Moreover, allowing subjects to influence both payoff
components in a single decision would make it hard to separately identify narrow equity concerns
from a preference for overall equity. To see this, consider an alternative design in which social
planners could choose a small-token allocation and a large-token allocation in each decision. In
this alternative design, subjects could avoid ever facing a tradeoff between overall equity and
narrow equity by always choosing the small-token allocation that equalizes small tokens and
the large-token allocation that equalizes large tokens, which would in turn guarantee that total
payoffs are equal. In contrast, many of our scenarios force subjects to choose between achieving
narrow equity and achieving overall equity.15
    Seventh, to be able to separately identify a desire to achieve narrow equity from the well-
documented preference for a 50/50-split (see, e.g., Andreoni and Bernheim (2009) and Jakiela
(2013)), subjects’ decisions involve making adjustments to existing endowments.16 By contrast,
  14
      For example, employers may determine the equity in pay among their workers but not the equity in wealth or
even equity in income when accounting for secondary income streams such as from stocks or a family member’s
job.
   15
      For example, consider a small-token decision in Scenario G. A subject who wants to achieve overall equity
(or a 50/50-split) should choose the Equal small-token allocation, since there is no endowment difference in total
payoffs. However, a subject who desires to achieve narrow equity should choose the Favors1 small-token allocation
to offset the endowment of small tokens that favors the second participant. More generally, as evident in Table
2, which allocation achieves narrow equity is frequently different from the allocation that achieves overall equity.
   16
      For example, consider a small-token decision in Scenario B. While a subject who wants to achieve narrow


                                                        11
consider an alternative design in which subjects chose small-token outcomes directly in a setting
without existing endowments of small tokens. In this alternative design, choosing a 50/50-split
would always achieve narrow equity and vice versa, rendering it infeasible to separate a preference
for a 50/50-split from narrow equity concerns. That said, we consider settings without existing
endowments as well, as discussed in Section 4.8.

2.4     Design Rationales Relating to Simplicity
    Our decision environment is not free of complexity, and it does not intend to be. The purpose
of our investigation is to understand how individuals make decisions in the presence of multiple
payoffs, and thus in the presence of any complexity introduced by the existence of multiple payoff
components. We also note that some complexity, such as having existing endowments of each
payoff component, is required to separate narrow equity concerns from other explanations.
    Despite the need for some complexity, we sought to construct a relatively simple decision
environment to provide a conservative, clean test of the potential relevance of narrow equity
concerns in the complex decision environments that individuals face outside of the laboratory.
This goal informed the following five design decisions.
    First, while multiple payoff components are necessary, we choose the minimal number that
satisfies this criteria: two. Second, as described in Appendix D.1, social planners receive de-
tailed instructions and have to correctly answer several understanding questions about how their
choices influenced the payments for the pair of participants before proceeding with the study.
Third, as evident in the examples shown in Appendix Figures D.3 and D.4, decision screens
clearly display the endowment differences across participants. Fourth, each social planner was
randomized to face 13 small-token allocation decisions first or 13 large-token allocation decisions
first, which helps to ensure that subjects notice when they are making small-token decisions
and when they are making large-token decisions.17 Fifth, subjects choose between the same
three predetermined allocation options for each decision, dramatically simplifying the decisions
for subjects. In particular, they do not have to calculate the exact difference between the two
participants’ endowments in order to achieve overall equity in the main scenarios. Rather, to
achieve overall equity, the subject simply has to: choose the allocation that favors the participant
who is at a disadvantage in endowments or choose the Equal allocation if the monetary value of
the endowments is initially equal. While we do not highlight this feature to subjects—to mit-
igate against potential experimenter demand effects—the allocation options do not vary across
decisions, making this design feature more apparent. This choice also guards against subjects
failing to achieve overall equity or narrow equity due to small estimation errors.
equity should choose the Favors2 allocation to offset the endowment favoring the first participant, a social planner
who wants to achieve a 50/50-split should choose the Equal Allocation. More generally, as evident in Table 2,
which allocation achieves narrow equity frequently differs from the Equal allocation that achieves a 50/50-split.
  17
     In Section 4.2, we show that our results are robust to the considering only the first set of decisions.



                                                        12
2.5    Implementation
    In February 2018, 400 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers completed the Tokens version of
our study (see Appendix D.1 for screenshots). As noted above, prior to making their choices,
social planners had to correctly answer several understanding questions about how their choices
influenced the payments for the pair of participants. Each social planner was then randomized to
face 13 small-token allocation decisions first or 13 large-token allocation decisions first. Within
each set of 13 decisions, the order of the endowments for the second participant was also ran-
domized. After making all 26 decisions, social planners filled out a short demographic survey.
Social planners received $4 for completing the study, and additional payments were distributed
from the choice that was randomly selected to count for two future study participants. Prior to
making their decisions, social planners were informed of this payment procedure.

3     Results of the Tokens version
   Section 3.1 explores whether individuals have narrow equity concerns by comparing small-
token and large-token decisions within each main scenario. To examine the strength of these
narrow equity concerns, and to show how they compare to the strength of concerns for other
forms of equity, Section 3.2 explores how often subjects achieve each of these equity concepts.

3.1    Identifying narrow equity concerns
    Figure 1 displays distributions of allocation choices in each main scenario. The three bars
on the left of each panel display the distribution of small-token allocation choices while the
three bars on the right of each panel display the distribution of large-token allocation choices.
The allocation that achieves overall equity (O-equity) is indicated on the horizontal axis of each
histogram. The allocation that achieves narrow equity (N-equity) is shaded in black.
    We start by considering scenario A (S-equal, L-equal) where the first and second participants
have identical endowments of small tokens and identical endowments of large tokens. This is the
only main scenario in which the allocation that achieves narrow equity does not differ between
small-token and large-token allocations. Results from this scenario show that subjects favor
equity: subjects choose the Equal allocation 91% of the time, both when making small-token
decisions and when making large-tokens decisions. Put differently, nearly all subjects choose the
allocation that achieves all three types of equity (i.e., overall equity, the 50/50-split, and narrow
equity) over the other allocation options (i.e., the Favors1 or Favors2 allocations) that do not
achieve any of these types of equity.

    In scenarios B–G, the allocation choice that achieves narrow equity differs across small and
large token decisions. In scenarios B and C, the endowments of large tokens are equal and the
endowments of small tokens differ, implying that the Equal allocation achieves narrow equity
in large-token but not in small-token decisions. In scenarios D and E, the endowments of small
tokens are equal and the endowments of large tokens differ, implying that the Equal allocation
achieves narrow equity in small-token but not in large-token decisions. In scenarios F and
G, the endowments of small and large tokens differ, with one payoff component favoring the
first participant and the other favoring the second participant, implying that when the Favors1
allocation achieves narrow equity in one payoff component the Favors2 allocation achieves narrow
equity in the other payoff component. These scenarios allow us to test for narrow equity concerns
by examining whether—within each of these scenario—subjects are more likely to choose an
allocation when it achieves narrow equity than when it does not, even though its implications
on total payoffs are equivalent in both cases. If subjects do not respond to narrow equity, the
distribution of choices should be the same for small and large tokens in each these scenarios.
    Comparing across the small-token and large-token decisions within each scenario B–G, we see
that subjects’ choices systematically gravitate towards the option that achieves narrow equity.
For each type of token in each scenario, the bar shared in black is substantially higher than its
counterpart in the distribution of choices for the other type of token. Subjects systematically
choose to achieve narrow equity.
    Consider, for example, scenario B (S-favors1, L-equal), in which both participants are en-
dowed with the same number of large tokens but the first participant is endowed with more
small tokens. The Favors1 allocation, which does not achieve any of the three types of equity in
this scenario, is chosen 6%–7% of time, regardless of the type of token. We see a divergence in
the frequency that the Favors2 and Equal allocations are chosen, however, based on the type of
token. For both small and large tokens, the Favors2 allocation achieves overall equity (because
it offsets the existing inequity in payoffs) and the Equal allocation achieves a 50/50-split. For
subjects making a small-token decision, Favors2 also achieves narrow equity—offsetting the ex-
isting inequity in small tokens—and is chosen 66% of the time. For subjects making a large-token
decision, however, Favors2 does not achieve narrow equity—since it introduces inequity in large
tokens—and is only chosen 47% of the time. For subjects making a small-token decision, the
Equal allocation only achieves a 50/50-split and is chosen 28% of the time. For subjects making
a large-token decision, the Equal allocation also achieves narrow equity—preserving the initial
equity in large tokens—and is chosen 47% of the time. This pattern of choices reflects a desire
to achieve narrow equity and also arises in all of the other scenarios C–G.
    Table 3 shows that these changes in allocation choices are statistically significant. It presents
regression results from linear probability models of the likelihood an allocation is chosen on
whether that allocation achieves narrow equity (i.e., equalizes small tokens when making small-


                                                 15
token decisions or large-tokens when making large-token decisions). The first three columns show
the likelihood that the subject chooses Favors1, Equal, and Favors2, and the fourth column shows
the likelihood that the subject chooses the allocation that achieves overall equity. All regressions
include scenario fixed effects, so that we identify concern for narrow equity holding fixed the
endowments of the participants, and cluster standard errors at the subject level to account for
the fact that subjects make multiple decisions. Subjects clearly display narrow equity concerns:
allocations are 15–18 percentage points more likely to be chosen when they achieve narrow equity
as compared to allocations with identical payoff consequences that do not achieve narrow equity.

3.2       Measuring the strength of narrow equity concerns
    Results in Section 3.1 show that narrow equity concerns substantially and significantly influ-
ence which allocations subjects choose. These results compare how subjects make choices within
a scenario, holding fixed the particular endowments of both participants. In this subsection, we
group similar decisions together to gain further insight into the extent to which subjects favor
narrow equity relative to overall equity and a 50/50-split.
    In particular, we reorganize the decisions subjects make according to the types of equity
tradeoffs involved in each decision. This generates four groups of decisions. The frequency with
which subjects choose to achieve the various forms of equity in each group of decisions is shown
in Figure 2. Results are shown separately for small-token and large-token allocation decisions.
    The first group of decisions involves no tradeoffs between any of the three types of equity.
These are the decisions in scenario A. The “Group 1” panel restates the result noted above:

                                                        16
Regardless of the type of token, subjects choose the Equal allocation, achieving all three forms
of equity, 91% of the time.
    The second group of decisions involves choosing between achieving a 50/50-split with one
allocation choice or achieving both narrow equity and overall equity with a different allocation
choice. This includes the small-token decision in scenarios B and C and the large-token decisions
in scenarios D and E. In each of these decisions, there is an inequity in endowments, and subjects
are choosing to allocate the type of token that is unequal. They can choose the Equal allocation
that achieves a 50/50-split but maintains the inequity; choose to undo that inequity, achieving
both narrow equity and overall equity; or they can compound the inequity. The “Group 2” panel
shows that subjects choose the 50/50-split 26–33% of the time and choose to achieve narrow and
overall equity 60–67% of the time. That a quarter to a third of choices choose to achieve the
50/50-split is consistent with prior literature.18
    The third group of decisions involves choosing between achieving narrow equity with one
allocation choice and achieving both a 50/50-split and overall equity with a different allocation
choice. This includes all of the decisions in scenarios F and G. In these decisions, there is no
endowment difference in total payoffs because of offsetting inequities in small and large tokens.
Subjects can achieve a 50/50-split and overall equity by choosing the Equal allocation; they can
introduce inequity in overall payoffs by equalizing the number of small tokens or large tokens that
subjects end up with, achieving narrow equity; or they can introduce inequity by compounding
the inequity on the component of payoffs they can control. The “Group 3” panel shows that
subjects choose narrow equity 28–29% of the time and choose to achieve a 50/50-split and overall
equity 56–58% of the time.
    The fourth group of decisions involves choosing between achieving overall equity with one
allocation choice and achieving both a 50/50-split and narrow equity with a different allocation
choice. This includes the large-token decision in scenarios B and C and the small-token decision
in scenarios D and E. In each of these decisions, there is an inequity in one type of token, but
subjects are choosing to allocate the type of token that is initially equal. Subjects can achieve a
50/50-split and narrow equity by choosing the Equal allocation; achieve overall equity by creating
inequity on the component they can control to offset the inequity in the other component; or
generate a compounding inequity on the component they can control. The “Group 4” panel
shows that subjects choose the 50/50-split and narrow equity 47–48% of the time and choose to
achieve overall equity 45–46% of the time.



  18
     Related to our earlier discussion in the Introduction, but not emphasized in what follows, one could consider
this evidence for 50/50-split as evidence for another form of very narrow bracketing of equity concerns in which
subjects bracket around the impact their choice has on payoffs (i.e., bracketing around what they control) and
ignore endowments altogether. As noted above, however, the 50/50-split is also the middle choice, so to the extent
that subjects gravitate towards that choice for other reasons, this form of narrow bracketing might be overstated.

                                              50/50-split                                                    O-equity




    Taken together, these results help to benchmark the prevalence of narrow equity concerns
relative to the prevalence of choosing a 50/50-split and overall equity. First, comparing results
from Group 2 to those from Group 3, we see that subjects choose to achieve narrow equity on
its own just as often as they choose to achieve a 50/50-split on its own (28–29% versus 26–33%).
Second, comparing results from Group 3 to those from Group 4, we see that subjects choose
to achieve narrow equity on its own roughly 63% as often as they achieve overall equity alone
(28–29% versus 45–46%) and to achieve narrow equity with a 50/50-split roughly 83% as often


                                                                 18
as they achieve overall equity with a 50/50-split (47–48% versus 56–58%). Third, subjects favor
narrow equity over overall equity anywhere from 28% to 48% of the time. This interpretation
relies on a “lower-bound” estimate of the extent to which subjects favor narrow equity over
overall equity in Group 3 (since any preference for a 50/50-split pushes towards choosing overall
equity rather than narrow equity) and an “upper bound” estimate of the extent to which subjects
favor narrow equity over overall equity in Group 4 (since any preference for a 50/50-split pushes
towards choosing narrow equity rather than overall equity).
    These results are also evident on the subject-level. The percentage of subjects who choose
narrow equity at least once is 95% in the Group 1 decisions, 84% in the Group 2 decisions, 58%
in the Group 3 decisions, and 72% in the Group 4 decisions.
    Together these results highlight that the prevalence of narrow equity is substantial, even
when benchmarked against a 50/50-split (one of the most well-documented fairness norms or
heuristics) or against overall equity.

4     Additional Results
    In this section, we present: robustness tests of the results discussed above, results from
additional scenarios of our Tokens version, and the design and results from six additional versions
of our study built off of the Tokens version. All of these additional results display the robustness
of narrow equity concerns.
    The first set of additional results are robustness tests, exploring the same scenarios from
the Tokens version discussed above. They show narrow equity concerns among subjects who
appear more attentive (see Section 4.1) and among the first set of decisions subjects see, relying
on between-subject variation only (see Section 4.2). The second set of additional results show
narrow equity concerns in the additional scenarios that do not allow subjects to achieve overall
equity (see Section 4.3). The third set of additional results come from six new study versions. The
first four new study versions document the persistence of narrow equity concerns in environments:
with cognitive screening questions at the beginning of the study (see results from the Tokens,
Cognitive Screen version in Section 4.4), with higher stakes (see results from the Tokens, High
Stakes version in Section 4.5), where subjects add rather than subtract from existing endowments
(see results from the Tokens, Addition version in Section 4.6), and where subjects’ choices affect
their own payoffs rather than just others’ payoffs (see results from the Tokens, First Person
version in Section 4.7). The last two new study versions explore narrow equity when it is conflated
with a 50/50-split in environments without endowments (see a discussion of the Tokens, Final
Allocations 1 version and the Tokens, Final Allocations 2 version in Section 4.8).

4.1    Do narrow equity concerns persist among attentive subjects?
   To examine whether narrow equity concerns persist among “attentive” subjects, we reproduce
the specifications shown in Table 3 when considering sample restrictions.

                                                19
     In the follow-up survey that subjects complete after making all decisions, they are asked
to indicate their agreement on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) with
the following three statements: (i) “I made each decision in this study carefully,” (ii) “I made
each decision in this study randomly,” and (iii) “I understood what my decisions meant for my
payment and the payments of my participants.” First, in Panel 1 of Appendix Table A.1, we
exclude the 6.75% of subjects who appear inattentive because they indicate disagreement when
asked whether they were careful in (i), agreement when asked whether they were random in
(ii), or disagreement when asked about their understanding in (iii). Evidence for narrow equity
concerns remain substantial and significant when excluding these subjects.
     Second, in Panel 2 of Appendix Table A.1, we consider the set of subjects who always choose
the Equal allocation in Scenario A (i.e., both when making small-token large-token decisions).
Scenario A is similar to an attention check because—unless participants have preferences against
equity—they should always choose the Equal allocation in Scenario A. Narrow equity concerns
remain just as significant—and if anything are slightly stronger—when we exclude the 12.5% of
participants who do not always choose the Equal allocation in Scenario A.
     Finally, Panel 3 confirms that narrow equity concerns again remain just as significant—and
if anything are slightly stronger—when we exclude the 15% of the subjects who were excluded
in either Panel A or in Panel B.

4.2    Do narrow equity concerns persist when identified between sub-
       jects?
    Recall that subjects are randomly assigned to make all 13 small-token decisions and then make
all 13 large-token decisions or vice versa. This procedure allows us to look for narrow equity
concerns in a between-subjects analysis by focusing on the first set of 13 decisions subjects face.
Panel 4 of Appendix Table A.1 shows that narrow equity concerns remain just as significant—and
if anything are slightly stronger—when only considering this first set of decisions.

4.3    Do narrow equity concerns persist in the additional scenarios
       that do not allow overall equity to be achieved?
   When considering the additional scenarios, detailed in Appendix Table B.1 and Appendix
Table B.2, our previous approach for identifying narrow equity concerns is not tractable. In
these scenarios, there is no variation between small and large token decisions in whether the
Favors1 allocation or the Favors2 allocation achieves narrow equity within a scenario, so we
cannot ask whether subjects are more likely to choose those allocations when they are associated
with narrow equity. Similarly, overall equity can never be achieved in the additional scenarios, so
we cannot ask whether participants are more likely to choose overall equity when it is associated
with narrow equity.
   That said, the additional scenarios allow us to provide some additional evidence for narrow

                                                20
equity. First, as shown in Appendix Figure A.1, across all scenarios, the most commonly chosen
allocation is always the one that achieves narrow equity. Second, for Scenarios H–M, narrow
equity is associated with the Equal allocation when making decisions involving one payoff com-
ponent but not the other (e.g., when making small-token decisions but not large token decisions,
or vice versa). This allows us to ask whether the Equal allocation is more likely to be chosen in
these scenarios when it is associated with narrow equity. Regression results from a specification
that matches Column 2 of Table 3 reveals that the Equal allocation is 6 percentage points more
likely to be chosen when it is associated with N-equity (p < 0.01).

4.4     Do narrow equity concerns persist after a cognitive screen?
    As detailed in Section 2.3, to identify narrow equity, some complexity in the decision environ-
ment is required, such as having more than one component of payoffs (by definition) and having
initial endowments (to separate narrow equity concerns from a preference for a 50/50-split).
Individuals may gravitate towards narrow equity because of a desire or need to simplify the
decision environment. Whether our results reflect a “desire” (e.g., because thinking is costly and
individuals are happy to avoid those costs) or a “need” (e.g., because individuals are cognitively
incapable of understanding how to achieve overall equity) may thus be of interest.
    On one hand, regardless of whether our results reflect a desire or need, it is interesting
that individuals achieve narrow equity, even when a simpler option (i.e., the 50/50-split) is also
available to subjects. On the other hand, as detailed in Section 2.4, we designed our experiment
to be as simple as possible to mitigate the possibility that individuals achieve narrow equity
because they are cognitively incapable of achieving overall equity.
    Nevertheless, to further investigate the possibility that subjects were cognitively incapable
of achieving overall equity, we designed the Tokens, Cognitive Screen version. Full design and
implementation details are described in Appendix D.2, but the overview is as follows. The
Tokens, Cognitive Screen version asks subjects to make exactly the same small-token and large-
token decisions as in the Tokens version only if they first pass a cognitive screen. In particular,
prior to making choices in Tokens, Cognitive Screen, subjects are asked three screening questions
that require them to correctly report the monetary value of: (1) 50 small tokens, (2) 100 large
tokens, and (3) the sum of 140 small tokens and 40 large tokens. Subjects who answer any of
these questions incorrectly are screened out of our study and do not participate.19
    While 2,677 of the 3,359 subjects discussed in this paper (including those recruited for our
main Tokens version and six of our other study versions) were recruited before the COVID-
19 pandemic, we ran the Tokens, Cognitive Screen version in July 2020, during the pandemic.
During the pandemic, researchers have become increasingly concerned about the quality of data
  19
    Subjects who are screened out receive a $3.00 completion payment; subjects who answer all of these questions
correctly make 26 choices and receive a $4.00 completion payment. The difference in completion payments is
known to subjects when they are answering the screening questions.



                                                      21
from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We observe evidence that is consistent with these concerns.
First, only 71% of 400 participants recruited for the Tokens, Cognitive Screen version correctly
answered all three screening questions; in two versions run before the pandemic that utilized
the same cognitive screening questions (see Section 4.8 and Appendix C.1), 84% of 400 subjects
recruited for one version and 85% of 400 subjects recruited for another version correctly answered
all three screening questions. Second, while 85% of participants in our main Tokens version
remained after we excluded subjects who failed either of our attention checks (see discussion in
Section 4.1), and while similar percentages are observed to pass these attention checks in our
other study versions run before the pandemic, only 41% of the 284 participants who correctly
answered all three screening questions in our Tokens, Cognitive Screen version also passed both
of our attention checks.
     While the clearly lower-quality sample in the pandemic period might be worrisome if our main
results relied on the post-pandemic data (which they do not), it also serves as a natural stress test
of our results. First, in our Tokens, Cognitive Screen version run during the pandemic, it is clear
that both our screening questions and attention checks have “bite.” Second, we can examine if
and how evidence for narrow equity changes as the noise in the data changes (which might be of
particular interest if one speculated that our main results were driven by noise). Third, we can
still ask whether evidence for narrow equity concerns arise when we confirm that participants
are cognitively capable of achieving overall equity, the main goal of this study version.
     Panel 1 of Appendix Table A.2 makes clear that evidence for narrow equity concerns re-
main statistically significant and substantial, with effect sizes of 9–13 percentage points, among
subjects in the Tokens, Cognitive Screen version who answered all of the cognitive screening ques-
tions correctly. Panel 1 of Appendix Table A.3 further shows that our results remain statistically
significant and substantial, with even larger effect sizes of 18–21 percentage points, when we
mitigate noise by restricting to the set of subjects who also passed both of our attention checks.
As a reference, recall that, in our main Tokens study version, we observe effect sizes of 15–18
percentage points when considering all subjects (see Table 3) and effect sizes of 17–20 percentage
points when considering the subjects who passed both attention checks (See Appendix Table
A.1). Thus, not only do our results persist across all of these sample restrictions, the magnitudes
of our results for narrow equity concerns increase when we restrict to subjects who appear more
attentive and cognitively capable. This is the opposite of what one would expect if our results
were instead driven by noise or cognitive incapability.

4.5    Do narrow equity concerns persist with higher stakes?
   In the Tokens version, each decision—when taking into account endowments and allocations—
determines how to distribute anywhere from $4 to $5.60 between two participants. Both when
comparing to the completion fee of $4 from the Tokens version and when comparing to the
typical hourly wage on MTurk of $6 an hour, we view these decisions as having meaningful

                                                 22
payoff consequences.20 Nonetheless, to further investigate whether evidence for Narrow Equity
concerns persists in decisions in which the payoff consequences are larger, we designed the Tokens,
High Stakes version.
    Design and implementation details are fully described in Appendix D.3 (see Appendix Table
B.3 for the scenario details), but we outline the two important features of this new study version
here. First, just as in the Tokens version, subjects make many decisions involving small tokens
worth 1 cent and large tokens worth 2 cents. We refer to these decisions as the “baseline”
decisions. Second, unlike the Tokens version, subjects also make many decisions with stakes that
are five times higher: small tokens are worth 5 cents and large tokens are worth 10 cents, and
thus subjects determine how to distribute anywhere from $20 to $28. We refer to these as the
“high stakes” decisions.
    More specifically, subjects face Scenarios B–G (i.e., all the main scenarios except Scenario A)
four times: once when making a small-token baseline decision, once when making a large-token
baseline decision, once when making a small-token high-stakes decision, and once when making
a large-token high-stakes decision. The value of the tokens is always highlighted in high-stakes
decisions to help ensure that participants notice that their decisions are over tokens five times
as valuable (see Appendix Figure D.11). Subjects also face Scenario A two times: once when
making a small-token baseline decision and once when making a large-token baseline decision.
We do not have subjects make high-stakes decisions involving Scenario A so that—like the Tokens
version—subjects make a total of 26 allocation decisions.
    Panels 1 and 2 of Appendix Table A.2 present the results for the high-stakes decisions and
the baseline decisions, respectively. First, as seen in Panel 1, evidence for narrow equity concerns
persists with stakes that are five-times larger. Second, as seen in Panel 2, evidence for narrow
equity concerns again persist with decisions that most closely mirror those in our Tokens version.
Third, comparing across Panel 1 and Panel 2, the extent of concern for narrow equity does not
statistically significantly differ with stakes. Fourth, Panels 1 and 2 of Appendix Table A.3
show that evidence for narrow equity persists—and strengthens—when we focus on the set of
participants who pass both our attention checks.21
  20
     See Hara et al. (2018) for a detailed discussion. They reference prior literature that estimates average hourly
wages on MTurk ranging from $1–$6, and they note that estimates are very sensitive to whether one accounts
for unpaid work on MTurk (e.g., time searching for tasks and the completion of tasks that are rejected). Their
average estimates are $6 per hour average when ignoring unpaid work time and only $3 per hour when accounting
for unpaid work time.
  21
     The latter results may be of particular interest since the Tokens, High Stakes version (and the Tokens, Adding
version discussed next) were run in April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and thus (as detailed in Section
4.4) may reflect more noise than our main Tokens study and our other six study versions run before the pandemic.
We also note that given the goal of the Tokens, High Stakes version and the Tokens, Adding version were to show
robustness, and given the substantially higher subject payments required by the design of these two studies, we
only recruited half as many subjects for these versions as we did in our other studies. The smaller samples could
lead to noisier data as well.




                                                        23
4.6     Do narrow equity concerns persist when social planners add to
        endowments?
    Many distributional decisions (e.g., taxation) involve “taking away” money from individuals,
as we have social planners do in our studies described thus far. Of course, not all decisions in-
volve taking away—other distributional decisions (e.g., giving end-of-year bonuses to employees)
involve “giving” additional money to individuals. One might wonder if narrow equity concerns
persist in “giving” decisions. To investigate this, we designed and ran the Tokens, Adding version.
    Design and implementation details are fully described in Appendix D.4 (see Appendix Table
B.4 for the scenario details), but we note that the Tokens, Adding version follows the same
structure as the Tokens, High Stakes version described above except that the “high stakes”
decisions are replaced with “adding” decisions. The six small-token and six large-token adding
decisions involve the same endowments as in Scenarios B–G detailed in Table 1. All that varies is
that the allocation decisions now involve giving participants—rather than taking away—80 small
tokens (in small-token decisions) and 40 large tokens (in large-token decisions). In particular, the
options are to give: (1) $0.20 to the first participant and $0.60 to the second participant in the
Favors2 allocation; (2) $0.40 to each in the Equal allocation; or (3) $0.60 to the first participant
and $0.20 to the second participant in the Favors1 allocation.
    Panels 3 and 4 of Appendix Table A.2 present the results for the adding decisions and the
baseline decisions from this study, respectively. First, as seen in Panel 3, evidence for narrow
equity concerns persists in the adding decisions. Second, as seen in Panel 4, evidence for narrow
equity concerns again persists with decisions that most closely mirror those in our Tokens version.
Third, comparing across Panel 3 and Panel 4, the extent of concern for narrow equity does not
systematically differ with whether subjects add to or subtract from endowments. Fourth, Panels
3 and 4 of Appendix Table A.3 show that evidence for narrow equity persists—and strengthens—
when we focus on the set of participants who pass both our attention checks.22

4.7     Do narrow equity concerns persist in first-person decisions?
    Many distributional decisions occur from the perspective of a third-party social planner (e.g.,
policy makers deciding how to tax their constituents, employers distributing bonus payments
between their employees). Of course, other distributional decisions occur from a first-party
perspective. To investigate whether narrow equity concerns persist when subjects have direct
financial incentives to choose certain options, we designed the Tokens, First Person version.
    Design and implementation details are described in Appendix D.5 (see Appendix Table B.5
for the scenario details), but we note that the Tokens, First Person version is nearly identical
to the Tokens version except that the decision-making subject is assigned the role of the first
  22
     Again, these last results may be of particular interest given that the comments about the timing and sample
size of the Tokens, High Stakes version, described in Footnote 21, also apply for the Tokens, Adding version.



                                                      24
participant rather than to the role of a third-party social planner. Thus choosing the Favors1
allocation is the most privately beneficial, choosing the Favors2 is the least privately beneficial,
and choosing the Equal allocation is always in-between.
    Panel 5 of Appendix Table A.2 presents the corresponding results. From the (suppressed)
scenario fixed effects, subjects clearly favor the more selfish allocations, consistent with the
vast literature on self-serving views of fairness mentioned earlier.23 We nonetheless observe
substantial evidence for narrow equity concerns. Moreover, Panel 5 of Appendix Table A.3
shows that evidence for narrow equity persists—and that the effect sizes approximately doubles
and become comparable to the effect sizes from our main Tokens version—when we focus on the
set of participants who pass both our attention checks. This latter finding in part reflects the fact
that our second attention check—which restricts to the set of participants who always choose
the Equal allocation in Scenario A—should not be interpreted as an attention check here. This
is because it screens out the most selfish subjects in the Tokens, First Person version, since they
would choose the Favors1 allocation in Scenario A (and, indeed, in all scenarios). Consequently,
these results show that the prevalence of narrow equity in first-party decisions among subjects
who are willing to make a private sacrifice to achieve equity is similar to the prevalence for narrow
equity in the decisions of third-party social planners.

4.8     Do narrow equity concerns persist in environments without en-
        dowments?
    Many distributional decisions occur in settings in which endowments are explicitly relevant
(e.g., the provision of public goods and tax policy often take into account individuals’ exist-
ing endowments of time and money), and all distributional decisions occur in settings in which
endowments are at least implicitly relevant (i.e., individuals vary in terms of their wealth, avail-
able time, access to resources, etc.) In addition, as noted in Section 2.3 and shown in Section
3.1, endowments are necessary to our identification strategy of narrow equity concerns and for
separating narrow equity concerns from a desire to achieve a 50/50-split.24
    That said, for those interested in examining whether narrow equity concerns—even if con-
founded with a 50/50-split—persist in environments without endowments, please see two ad-
ditional study versions (run due to the interest others expressed in seeing them) in Appendix
C.1. We observe evidence for narrow equity concerns in these environments, across a range of
decisions from both the social planner and first-party perspectives.
  23
     The scenario fixed effects range from 0.41–0.63 when considering the Favors1 allocation, from 0.21–0.46 when
considering the Equal allocation, and from 0.03–0.16 when considering the Favors2 allocation, highlighting that
subjects are more likely to choose an allocation when it benefits them more.
  24
     Absent existing endowments of small (large) tokens, achieving a 50/50-split of small (large) tokens guarantees
an equal number of small (large) tokens across participants and thus guarantees that narrow equity is achieved.




                                                        25
5     Do narrow equity concerns arise over money and time?
    The Tokens versions of our study allow us to investigate distribution decisions in a setting
with a clear, simple exchange rate between the two payoff components: large tokens are worth
twice as much as small tokens. This exchange rate allows us to easily aggregate to overall payoffs
so we know which allocation choice achieves overall equity.
    An alternative approach to defining the exchange rate between multiple payoff components is
to elicit the exchange rate. While this obviously introduces more noise and makes corresponding
inferences more challenging, it serves as useful way to test for narrow equity concerns among other
payoff components, while still assessing the extent to which individuals favor narrow equity to
overall equity.
    We use this alternative approach to examine whether evidence for narrow equity concerns
arise over two important components of payoffs that are particularly relevant outside of the
laboratory: money and time. In particular, we ran three Money & Time versions of our study.
In Section 5.1, we provide overviews of these designs. In Section 5.2, we highlight the results of
these versions, which confirm the relevance of narrow equity concerns over money and time and
show that narrow equity concerns are greater in time than in money. In Section 5.3, we discuss
how these results may help to explain myriad behavioral phenomenon related to time and money
and highlight related avenues for future work.

5.1    Design Overview
    The Money & Time version is very similar to the Tokens version, with subjects in the role of
a social planner making decisions that affect two study participants with exogenously determined
endowments. Rather than endowments and allocation decisions involving small tokens and large
tokens, however, subjects decide how much money to take away from participants’ endowments
of money and how much time to take away from participants’ endowments of time.
    Thus, going from the Tokens version to the Money & Time version requires two fundamental
experimental design changes. First, to use time as one of the components of payoffs, we need
a way to control the time of participants. Second, we need to elicit an exchange rate between
money and time so that subjects are able to aggregate them into total payoffs, and so we can
be confident that total payoffs aggregated in this way can be set equal to each other to achieve
overall equity.
    To manipulate the amount of time participants have in our study, we require participants to
complete a particular number of “time-burning” tasks to receive any payment from participating
in the study. Completing one time-burning task requires correctly counting how many times
“0” appears in a string of 15 numbers that are each either a “0” or a “1” (see Figure 3 for an
example task). We see this task as an ideal way of imposing a time cost as these tasks: (i) take
time, (ii) must be done to complete the study, and (iii) do not allow participants to engage in


                                                26
other activities while they are being completed. Moreover, just as we can take away money from
endowments, we can take away time by increasing the number of tasks participants must do to
complete the study. That taking away time in our study is achieved by having participants do
tasks means that one could interpret time in our study as “time spent working” or, alternatively,
just “work.” We welcome the reader to view our results about time as instead being about work.
Many of the phenomena that we believe narrow equity concerns can help explain, discussed in
depth in Section 5.3, are explicitly about money and work, and work is a major use of time and
an important one in contributing to overall budgets.

                         Figure 3: Screenshot of example time-burning task




    To establish an exchange rate between money and time, we ask each social planner—using
three incentivized multiple price lists—the monetary sacrifice that is equivalent to having to
complete additional time-burning tasks. These price lists mirror those used in our prior work in
which we establish exchange rates between money for self and money for charity (Exley, 2016,
2020; Exley and Kessler, 2020). In eliciting subject-specific exchange rates between money and
time, we make a number of assumptions that are discussed in Appendix C.2. That discussion
aims to reassure the reader that it is reasonable to treat each subject’s elicited exchange rate as
consistent across decisions and thus that we can view the choices in the Money & Time versions
as having similar features as the Tokens versions (with the personalized exchange rate replacing
the 2-to-1 exchange rate imposed between small and large tokens). While readers could still
have concerns about the exchange rate that are related to the notion that trading-off units of
money and units of time is just generally difficult (for any number of reasons), it is worth noting
that this difficulty is likely to be an important—and possibly unavoidable—feature of decisions
involving money and time outside of our laboratory paradigm. More generally, we view the
elicitation of exchange rates as an important way to improve our understanding of differences in
decisions involving money and time.25
    In the Money & Time versions, the first participant is always endowed with 200 cents in
money and T − 60t in time, where T − 60t units of time refers to the total amount of the time
  25
    Absent the attempt to measure exchange rates, a natural explanation for differences between money and time
decisions could be that participants value the available amounts of money and time differently. Consequently,
despite any potential downsides of eliciting exchanging rates, we view it as clearly superior to simply making
assumptions about the exchange rate, or ignoring the need for an exchange rate (e.g., implicitly assuming an
exchange rate of 1), across multiple payoff components.

                                                     27
first participant has available (denoted as T ) minus the amount of time that associated with
having to complete 60 time-burning tasks (denoted as 60t). As in the Tokens version, the second
participant is randomly endowed with one of 13 combinations of money and time. As shown in
Appendix Table B.6, the structure of these scenarios mirror those in the Tokens version.
    Subjects make decisions in each scenario twice: once when making a time decision and once
when making a money decision. In each time decision, subjects chose how to take away time
from the two participants by choosing between three allocation options. The options are to take
away:

   1. 10t from the first participant, requiring the first participant to complete an additional 10
      time-burning tasks, and 50t from the second participant, requiring the second participant
      to complete an additional 50 time-burning tasks (the “Favors1” allocation)

   2. 30t from each, requiring each to complete an additional 30 time-burning tasks (the “Equal”
      allocation)

   3. 50t from the first participant, requiring the first participant to complete an additional 50
      time-burning tasks, and 10t from the second participant, requiring the second participant
      to complete an additional 10 time-burning tasks (the “Favors2” allocation)

   Similarly, in each money decision, subjects chose how to take away money from the two
participants by choosing between three options. The options are to take away:

   1. M10 cents from the first participant and M50 cents from second participant (the “Favors1”
      allocation)

   2. M30 cents from each (the “Equal” allocation)

   3. M50 cents from the first participant and M10 cents from second participant (the “Favors2”
      allocation)

    As described in Appendix C.2, the parameters M10 , M30 , and M50 are identified at the subject
level using multiple price lists to make the allocation choices in the money decisions equivalent
to the allocation choices in the time decisions from the perspective of the social planner.26
    One final design feature of our Money & Time version is of note. In addition to choosing how
much money or time to take from each participant, subjects were asked to indicate the social
appropriateness of making each choice on a 4-point scale from “very socially inappropriate” to
“very socially appropriate” (see Appendix Figure D.45 for an example of this decision screen).
  26
    When eliciting these personal exchange rates, we require M10 + M50 = 2 ∗ M30 and M10 < M30 < M50 , so
that the three allocation require the same total amount of money to be taken away across all three allocation
options and for the three allocation options to be different.


                                                     28
Following the procedure in Krupka and Weber (2013), subjects were told that one potential
choice from one decision would randomly be selected for payment and that they would receive a
$1.00 bonus for correctly reporting the modal social appropriateness response for that choice.
    In total, we ran three study versions involving money and time. The second is the Money &
Time, First Person version. Its scenarios are the same as in the Money & Time version of our
study, but subjects make the decisions in these scenarios from the first-person rather than social
planner perspective. See Appendix Table B.7 for details of the scenarios and see Appendix D.9
for design and implementation details.
    The third version is the Money & Time, Uncertain Endowments version. Its scenarios are
similar, but not identical to those in the Money & Time version. More specifically, the endow-
ments in this study build off of the set of endowments in the Money & Time version in which
endowments are equal for one or more components of payoffs. Endowments that were equal in the
Money & Time version are equal in expectation in the Money & Time, Uncertain Endowments
versions. See Appendix Table B.8 for details of the scenarios and see Appendix D.10 for design
and implementation details.

5.2    Results
    Starting with the Money & Time version, Appendix Figure A.2 shows the distribution of
money and time decisions in each of the main scenarios. As with Figure 1, the black bars indicate
which allocations achieve narrow equity in each scenario. Not only do the money allocations and
time allocations differ quite substantially, this difference is in line with narrow equity concerns.
    Within a scenario, each allocation (i.e., the Favors1, Equal, or Favors2 allocation) is more
likely to be chosen when it achieves narrow equity. Panel 1 of Appendix Table A.4 also con-
firms that this evidence for narrow equity over money and time is statistically significant and
corresponds to effect sizes of 14 to 18 percentage points in the Money & Time version.
    The evidence for narrow equity concerns over money and time is robust. Similar and statisti-
cally significant findings arise when we instead consider: the social appropriateness ratings that
subjects assign to each allocation (see Panel 2 of Appendix Table A.4), the allocations chosen
by subjects who make decisions from the first-person perspective in the Money & Time, First
Person version (see Panel 3 of Appendix Table A.4), the allocations chosen by subjects who
make decisions when the endowments are uncertain in the Money & Time, Uncertain Endow-
ments version (see Panel 4 of Appendix Table A.4), and the social appropriateness ratings that
subjects assign to each allocation in that version (see Panel 5 of Table A.4).
    These results from the Money & Time version are very similar to what we observed in the
Tokens version. When considering money and time, we see similarly sized evidence for narrow
equity concerns as in the small and large tokens decisions that were analyzed in Section 3.1.
    However, while narrow equity is equally likely to be chosen in small-token and large-token
decisions, narrow equity is substantially more likely to be chosen in time decisions than in money

                                                29
decisions. This can be seen most clearly by considering the results shown in Figure 4, which
groups scenarios according to the types of equity tradeoffs subjects faced (in an identical manner
as detailed in Section 3.2 and presented in Figure 2). Narrow equity is 12 percentage points more
likely to be chosen in time than in money in Group 2 (p < 0.01), 17 percentage points more
likely to be chosen in time than in money in Group 3 (p < 0.01), and 20 percentage points more
likely to be chosen in time than in money in Group 4 (p < 0.01).

   The evidence for narrow equity being stronger in time than in money is also robust. Fol-

lowing the same structure as Figure 4, Appendix Figure A.3 presents the results from Money &
Time, First Person version, and Appendix Figure A.4 presents the results from Money & Time,
Uncertain Endowments version. Regardless of which set of decisions we consider, narrow equity
is always chosen more often in time decisions than in money decisions, suggesting that subjects
are systematically more inequity averse in time than in money.

5.3     Discussion of Money-Time Results
    There is a growing literature on decisions involving time and how choices differ across the
domains of money and time. Much of this work shows that individuals make different decisions
and exhibit different preferences in time and money domains due to prosocial motivations (Reed,
Aquino and Levy, 2007; Liu and Aaker, 2008; Gino and Mogilner, 2014; Lilley and Slonim, 2014;
Davis et al., 2015; Macdonnell and White, 2015; Brown, Meer and Williams, 2016), the use of
heuristics (Saini and Monga, 2008), the acceptability of different mediums of exchange (DeVoe
and Iyengar, 2010), and signaling preferences (Shaddy and Shah, 2018).27 Our results contribute
to this literature by showing that—even when we elicit exchange rates between time and money
to help ensure units of time are comparable to units of money—differences in decisions emerge,
and these differences are consistent with stronger narrow equity concerns in time than money.
    Our results also contribute to this literature by pointing toward a potential explanation that—
in conjunction with the many reasons nicely documented by prior literature—could help unify
these empirical findings and help explain other behavioral phenomena. We see high potential
returns to future work exploring whether narrow equity concerns can help to improve our under-
standing of: (i) labor market outcomes, (ii) the structure of public good provision, and (iii) why
some transactions that turn money into time may be deemed repugnant.
    In terms of labor market outcomes, we note that a 40-hour work week is a well-established
norm across workers and across industries.28 Inside the ivory tower, teaching loads are likely very
similar, if not identical, across faculty whose salaries differ. Even committee responsibilities are
viewed more favorably when equally distributed. These norms further extend to the household,
where—despite any differences in contributions towards the household’s financial budgets—equal
contributions of household chores are believed to be appropriate if both partners spend equal
amounts of time working outside the home.29 Could more inequity aversion in time than in
  27
     See also differences between time and money that emerge in contexts related to pain (Story et al., 2015),
bargaining (Ellingsen and Johannesson, 2009), sunk costs (Soman, 2001), loss aversion and risk-seeking behavior
(Leclerc, Schmitt and Dube, 1995; Okada and Hoch, 2004; Abdellaoui and Kemel, 2014; Festjens et al., 2015),
and discount functions (Olivola and Wang, 2016).
  28
     Historically, unions fought for fixed, equal hours for their members or effectively discouraged firms from
variation by demanding high rates for overtime pay (Earle and Pencavel, 1990). In tough economic times, unions
use work-sharing rules (e.g., cutting hours equally) so that all workers would suffer the same consequences in
hours, even if their hourly wages differ.
  29
     We ran a Google Consumer Survey (March 2017, n = 211) that asked: “Imagine a married couple where both
individuals work the same number of hours outside of the household. Should the spouse who earns less money
have to do more housework?” 83% responded “no” and 17% responded “yes.” However, unequal contribution


                                                      31
money help to explain these labor market norms?
    In terms of the provision of public goods, we note that solicitations often call for equal
contributions of time but unequal contributions of money. Citizens are equally likely to be
called for jury duty and must spend equal amounts of time going to the polls, but taxes differ
dramatically. Schools and churches might ask richer parents or congregants for larger monetary
donations but still ask for equal volunteering hours.30 There is even the “volunteering puzzle” of
many high-income individuals spending time volunteering for tasks that generate less value than
the money they could earn in the labor market and subsequently donate (Handy and Katz, 2008;
Lilley and Slonim, 2014). Could more inequity aversion in time than in money help to explain
these phenomena?
    In terms of repugnance, individuals frequently deem repugnant, and protest against, transac-
tions that allow others to turn inequity in money into inequity in time.31 A prominent example
of turning inequity in money into inequity in time, paying for a place in line—common at amuse-
ment parks, public events, hospitals, the airport, and even U.S. Supreme Court hearings—is
often met with outrage. Similarly, it is the “thought that counts” in gift giving, and social mores
frequently deem cash gifts inappropriate (Tuttle, 2011). Some transactions that would allow
individuals to turn inequity in money into inequity in time are even prohibited, such as an organ
transplant that could add years to a recipient’s life but cannot be legally purchased.32 Could
more inequity aversion in time than money help to explain these attitudes, rules, and regulations
that relate to repugnance around turning inequity in money into inequity in time?
    Another interesting question for future work relates to why equity concerns differ across the
domains of time and money. On this point, we speculate that part of the effect might be driven
by differential beliefs in the existing levels of inequity of money and time. Inequity in money
of household work is reported as appropriate if one partner does not work outside the home and thus has more
time to work inside the house. We ran a Google Consumer Survey (March 2017, n = 201) that asked “Imagine a
married couple where only one individual works outside of the household. Should the spouse who does not work
outside of the household have to do more housework?” 64% responded “yes” and 36% responded “no.”
  30
     In 2008, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints began asking congregants to clean the church
buildings, sometimes assigning individuals to volunteer in alphabetical order, even though it previously used
congregant donations to pay janitorial staff to do the same job (Evans, Curtis and Cnaan, 2013).
  31
     Negative attitudes towards such transactions are relatively widespread (Leider and Roth, 2010) even though
they have been shown to be correlated with happiness (Mogilner, 2010; Mogilner and Norton, 2016; Whillans,
Weidman and Dunn, 2016; Whillans et al., 2017). Repugnance arises when a third party prefers that a transaction
between others not occur and may thus place a constraint on markets (Roth, 2007). See Roth (2015) for a popular
discussion and see a growing literature on what causes transactions to be repugnant (Leider and Roth, 2010; Falk
and Szech, 2013; Slonim, Wang and Garbarino, 2014; Ambuehl, Niederle and Roth, 2015; Elias, Lacetera and
Macis, 2015a,b; Ambuehl, 2016). Of particular relevance here is also the literature on “taboo tradeoffs” in
Psychology (Fiske and Tetlock, 1997), the discussion of the “ethic of the queue” versus the “ethic of the market”
in Philosophy (Sandel, 2012), and the discussion of “sacred values” in economics (Elias, Lacetera and Macis,
2015b).

     Living donors cannot be compensated for kidneys and the allocation of deceased donor organs is heavily reg-
ulated through waiting lists that do not include a price mechanism. Substantial research is devoted to attempting
to increase the supply of organs (see, e.g., Kessler and Roth (2014)).

is more obvious and observable than inequity in time.33 It is very clear that some people are
born rich and others are born poor, and the persistence of socio-economic status from birth to
adulthood is a well-established empirical fact (Chetty et al., Forthcoming). Meanwhile, inequity
in time is less obvious (e.g., everyone has 24 hours in a day), less observable (e.g., life length is
unknowable), and, perhaps correspondingly, less acceptable.

6      Conclusion
    A large set of components influence our payoffs and, ultimately, our utility. Exploring how
individuals make distributional decisions in these multi-dimensional settings is essential to under-
standing what types of choices are likely to arise in practice. This paper identifies a potentially
broadly relevant pattern in how individuals make distributional decisions in the presence of mul-
tiple payoff components. Subjects in our studies frequently forgo overall equity, which accounts
for multiple payoff components, to instead achieve narrow equity that only considers one. Indi-
viduals make these choices when considering arbitrary components of payoffs (i.e., small and large
tokens) and when considering important and common components of budgets (i.e., money and
time). Results from the latter setting additionally document that individuals are more inequity
averse in time than in money.
    As discussed in detail in our Introduction and in Section 5.3, we believe many important and
promising avenues for future work relate to investigating the extent to which narrow bracketing
of equity concerns contribute to various behavioral phenomena and patterns observed in prior
work: from contextual effects observed in experiments, to the provision of public goods, to
societal norms around repugnance. The potential to identify and compare the extent of narrow
equity concerns over different components of payoffs—such as we explored in our money and time
results—opens up many new questions about the relative strength of equity concerns across other
payoff components. Indeed, recent work in Berry, Dizon-Ross and Jagnani (2020) documents the
important insights that can be gleaned by considering how parents may narrowly bracket their
equity concerns about investments in their children’s education.
    Finally, we note that given the complexity inherent to aggregating across dimensions of
payoffs outside of simplified laboratory settings (see, e.g., Jones and Klenow (2016)), more work
on the role of decision rules, including how such rules may interact with the various principles of
fairness studied in the rich prior literature, may prove key to our understanding of distributional
decisions.

    While the opportunity cost of time, available leisure time, and life expectancy may vary widely across indi-
viduals, these differences may be harder to observe. Individuals may believe that time is more equally distributed
than money, which may contribute to why individuals deem contributions of time as a better signal of preferences
than contributions of money (Shaddy and Shah, 2018).
