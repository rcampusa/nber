The Foreign Service and Foreign Trade: Embassies as Export Promotion

                                           ABSTRACT

As communication costs fall, foreign embassies and consulates have lost much of their role in
decision-making and information-gathering. Accordingly, foreign services are increasingly marketing
themselves as agents of export promotion. I investigate whether exports are in fact systematically
associated with diplomatic representation abroad. I use a recent cross-section of data covering
twenty-two large exporters and two-hundred import destinations. Bilateral exports rise by
approximately 6-10% for each additional consulate abroad, controlling for a host of other features
including reverse causality. The effect varies by exporter, and is non-linear; consulates have smaller
effects than the creation of an embassy.

1. Introduction

       What does the Foreign Service do? More generally, why do countries spend so many

resources on embassies, consulates, and the Foreign Service?

       In times gone by, embassies, consulates, and the like – hereafter “foreign missions” –

were important sources of information and were empowered to make significant decisions. But

as communication costs have fallen, much information about foreign countries has become

quickly and cheaply available through alternate sources. Key decisions about foreign affairs are

increasingly made at home and simply communicated abroad. Consular affairs – passports,

visas, and the like – do not seem to justify the expense and prestige of a Foreign Service. In the

age of the internet, is there a raison d’être for the Foreign Service?

       One answer increasingly given is that the Foreign Service promotes exports.

Ambassadors, commercial attaches, and other members of the diplomatic corps are said to pay a

key role in developing and maintaining export markets. This short paper asks the question: are

foreign missions in fact systematically linked to exports? To be more concrete, consider the fact

that in 2003, both Brazil and Belgium exported $17 billion of goods to the United States, despite

the fact that Belgium’s economy is over twice as big as Brazil’s. Brazil maintains seven

consulates (and an embassy) in the United States, while Belgium only has four consulates (and

an embassy). Is Brazil’s larger network a material advantage to its exporters, and a reason why it

maintains its export presence in the American market?

       To answer this question, I link exports from twenty-two important countries to two-

hundred destination countries. I take advantage of the fact that countries have varying number of

foreign missions abroad. Some embassies cover multiple countries, while some countries host

an embassy and a number of consulates. For instance, in December 2004 the United States had




                                                  1
an embassy and two consulates in Canada, an embassy in Cape Verde, and no official presence

in the Central African Republic (it is covered from Chad and Cameroon). The Netherlands has

over four-hundred foreign missions, while Sweden has less than a hundred. I use such

differences to ask whether there is a measurable link between the size of the Foreign Service and

exports.

       I use annual data averaged over 2002-03, and control for other determinants of trade

through a standard “gravity” model. I estimate my cross-section using least-squares, and show

my results are robust to inclusion of different types of country-specific fixed effect intercepts. I

also account for reverse causality; as instrumental variables I employ variables that are correlated

with the importance of countries (e.g., proven oil reserves) and the desirability of living there as

a Foreign Service officer (e.g., the number of Condé-Nast top 100 destinations in a country).

       I find that the presence of foreign missions is indeed positively correlated with exports.

Holding other things constant, I find that each additional consulate is associated with slightly

higher exports; my point estimate is around 6-10%. This result is statistically significant, and

economically plausible in magnitude. It varies by exporter, and also seems to be non-linear; the

first foreign mission has a larger effect on exports than successive missions. Still, the Foreign

Service does indeed seem to promote exports at the margin.



2. Motivation

      Foreign Services are expensive. For instance, the 2004 fiscal year budget request for the

US Department of State included $4.2 billion for diplomatic and consular programs, and $1.5

billion for embassy security, construction and maintenance.1 Foreign Services are also

glamorous. For instance, ambassadors rank eighth in the American protocol precedence list, just



                                                  2
after the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and former presidents, and just before the Secretary

of State and the President of the UN General Assembly.2 Entry into the Foreign Service is

typically quite competitive, and the diplomatic corps is among the most prestigious parts of the

civil service. This paper asks whether this use of financial and human resources is justified, at

least in part, by export promotion.

       It seems clear that the Foreign Services of most countries believe that they are agents of

export promotion. For instance, the US State Department describes itself as attempting to

promote and protect the interests of the United States by (italics added):


   •   “Promoting peace and stability in regions of vital interest;

   •   Creating jobs at home by opening markets abroad;

   •   Helping developing nations establish stable economic environments that provide investment and
       export opportunities …

       The services the Department provides include:
   •   Protecting and assisting U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad;

   •   Assisting U.S. businesses in the international marketplace…”3



       The US Commercial Service (part of the Department of Commerce which operates out of

American foreign missions) describes its role in a typical trading partner (the UK) as being:



       “…part of a global network of trade specialists dedicated to supporting US commercial interests
       around the world. We offer a variety of services to US exporters and UK importers and our trade
       specialists are available to help with your enquiries. If you are a US company, we can assist in
       promoting your goods and services into the UK market by:
   •   finding suitable UK business partners

   •   identifying UK trade opportunities

   •   advising on the UK market potential for your product

   •   offering UK market research reports and

   •   helping to launch your company into one of the biggest markets in the world …”4


                                                         3
       Other countries also use their Foreign Services to promote exports. For instance, the role

of the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office is to provide (italics added); “… a range of

essential services to the public – from advising British travellers to issuing UK visas and

promoting trade and investment opportunities overseas.”5 Further, “The UK is the fifth largest

trading nation: our exports are vital to our national prosperity. One in four jobs in the UK is

linked to business overseas. So the FCO has a key role in promoting our companies and

products abroad. Nearly 1,500 FCO staff equivalents are engaged in commercial and investment

work (about 350 UK-based and just over 1,100 locally-engaged).”6


       Similarly, the mandate of the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and

International Trade is to:


   •   “conduct all diplomatic and consular relations on behalf of Canada;

   •   conduct all official communication between the Government of Canada and the government of any other
       country and between the Government of Canada and any international organization; …

   •   foster the expansion of Canada's international trade;…”7



       This is also true of other large countries. For instance, the German Missions abroad

                 “can be called Germany's eyes, ears and voice abroad. On instructions from the Federal Foreign
       Office, they represent our country, defend its interests and protect its citizens in the host country. They
       negotiate with the government of the host country and promote political relations as well as economic,
       cultural and scientific cooperation. The essential tasks of the missions include:

   •   collecting information,

   •   reporting on issues which are of relevance to the various authorities of the Federation and the Länder,

   •   helping German citizens in emergencies,

   •   assisting German companies with their activities in the host country and generally enhancing mutual trade,
       …”8




                                                        4
   Similarly, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade describes their own

objectives as:

     “The department’s aim is to advance the interests of Australia and Australians internationally. This aim is the
     driving force behind our work and underpins all the department’s goals, priorities, values and culture.

     The department’s goals are to:

         • enhance Australia’s security

         • contribute to growth in Australia’s economy, employment and standard of living…”9



         The relevant question is not whether Foreign Services believe they are in the business of

export promotion (at least in part), but whether they are effective at it. I now investigate that

issue.




3. Methodology


          I am interested in estimating the effect of a country’s Foreign Service on its exports,

allowing for other determinants of trade. To accomplish the latter, I use a conventional bilateral

“gravity” model of trade, which links exports positively to economic mass (proxied by

population and income), and negatively to economic distance. The gravity model has a long

history in international and regional economics; Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) provide a

good recent treatment. The gravity model takes into account more traditional economic reasons

for international trade; I ask below whether there is any room left over in the residual for the

presence and number of foreign missions.


          I estimate the following cross-sectional equation:




                                                         5
ln(Xij) = β0 + β1lnDij + β2ln(Yi) + β3ln(Yj) + β4ln(Popi) + β5ln(Popj) + β6Langij + β7Contij

        + β7Landlij + β8Islandij +β9ln(AreaiAreaj) + β10Colij + β11CUij + β12FTAij

        + γEmbConij + εij



where i denotes the exporter, j denotes the importer, ln(.) denotes the natural logarithm operator,

and the variables are defined as:


•   Xij denotes annual real exports from i to j in dollars, averaged between 2002 and 2003,
•   EmbConij is the number of embassies, consulates, and official foreign missions that i has in j,
•   D is the distance between i and j,
•   Y is annual real GDP per capita in dollars, averaged between 2002 and 2003,
•   Pop is average population,
•   Lang is a binary “dummy” variable which is unity if i and j have a common language and
    zero otherwise,
•   Cont is a binary variable which is unity if i and j share a land border,
•   Landl is the number of landlocked countries in the country-pair (0, 1, or 2).
•   Island is the number of island nations in the pair (0, 1, or 2),
•   Area is the area of the country (in square kilometers),
•   Col is a binary variable which is unity if i and j are colonies at time t,
•   CU is a binary variable which is unity if i and j use the same currency at time t,
•   FTA is a binary variable that is unity if i and j both belong to the same regional trade
    agreement,
•   β is a vector of nuisance coefficients, and
•   εij represents the omitted other influences on bilateral exports, assumed to be well behaved.


The coefficient of interest to me is γ, which represents the marginal effect of an additional

foreign mission on exports.




                                                   6
       I estimate this equation in a number of different ways. I begin with conventional OLS,

using a robust covariance estimator to handle heteroskedasticity. I also account for the panel

nature of the data set by allowing for exporter fixed effect intercepts, importer fixed effects, or

both. Heavy trade may induce countries to set up more consulates, so that there may be reverse

causality from exports to foreign missions. Accordingly, I also estimate the equation with

instrumental variables.


       I use a two-pronged strategy to choose my instrumental variables. First, I use variables

that measure the potential geo-political importance of a country. The relevant variables I

consider include: a) proven oil reserves (in bbl); b) proven gas reserves (in cu m); and c) military

spending (in $). The preferences of the diplomatic corps may also help determine the location

and number of foreign missions. Accordingly, I also use variables that measure the desirability

of residing in a particular country. The relevant variables I consider in this category include the

number (in an import destination country) of: a) Condé-Nast top 100 destinations; b) Zagat

surveys; c) Ritz hotels; d) Four Seasons hotels; e) Luxury hotels (Westin, Sheraton, St. Regis,

and W hotels, all owned by Starwood hotels); f) Baedeker guides; g) Blue guides; h) Lonely

Planet guides; i) Michelin guides; j) Economist city guides; k) whether the country experiences

monsoonal rains; and l) the number of Google hits for the search ‘ +“Travel Destination” +“city”

+”x” ’ where x is the name of the capital city.10

       The series for the regressand comes from the August 2004 “Direction of Trade” (DoT)

CD-ROM data set developed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It records bilateral

merchandise exports in $ between IMF trading entities; I average 2002 and 2003 exports

(deflating 2003 exports by the relevant American CPI inflation rate.11 I include data for 22 large

exporters (listed in Appendix Table A1) and 200 destination countries that the IMF includes



                                                    7
(listed in Appendix Table A2). (Not all the trading entities are “countries” in the traditional

sense of the word; for instance, most countries have consulates in Hong Kong, SAR China. I use

the word simply for convenience.)12

       I gather data on the location of foreign missions from the export countries’ Foreign

Services. (I count an embassy and a separate chancery or consulate in the same city as a single

foreign mission; I also exclude honorary consulates.13) Unfortunately, it is only possible to

identify the exact number of individuals in a given embassy/consulate that are actively engaged

in export promotion for a small number of countries.14 Since there is no easy way to measure the

importance of different foreign missions, I am forced to treat them all as equal.15

       Population and real GDP data per capita (in constant 1995 American dollars) have been

obtained from the online version of the World Bank’s World Development Indicators; holes were

filled with data from the online CIA World Factbook. 16 I also exploit the Factbook for a number

of country-specific variables. These include: latitude and longitude, land area, landlocked and

island status, physically contiguous neighbors, language, colonizers, climate, and dates of

independence. I use these to create great-circle distance and the other controls. I add

information on whether the pair of countries was involved in a currency union, using Glick-Rose

(2002). I obtain data from the World Trade Organization to create an indicator of regional trade

agreements, and include sixteen RTAs, including: ASEAN, EEC/EC/EU; US-Israel FTA;

NAFTA; CARICOM; PATCRA; ANZCERTA; CACM, SPARTECA, Mercosur, Canada-Costa

Rica, US-Jordan, and Japan-Singapore.17 I initially assume that all RTA’s have the same effect

on trade, but check the sensitivity of this assumption.

       Descriptive statistics are provided in Appendix Table A3. I also tabulate the simple

correlation between the number of foreign missions and the other variables. The strongest



                                                 8
correlation between the number of foreign missions and other regressors (in particular, the log of

importer population) is only .39, indicating that multicollinearity is not likely to be a serious

problem.




4. Results


       My benchmark results are tabulated in Table 1. This presents coefficients estimated in

five different ways: a) OLS; b)-d) adding exporter fixed effects, importer fixed effects, and both;

and e) using instrumental variables to account for reverse causality between exports and

embassies/consulates. The default instrumental variables I use for the number of

embassies/consulates in an importer include: a) the number of Zagat’s guides in an importer; b)

the number of Condé-Nast Top 100 destinations; c) the number of Lonely Planet guides; d) the

number of Economist city guides/importer; and e) proven oil reserves.


       The gravity model of exports that underlies the estimation works well in two senses.

First, the model fits the data well, explaining over three quarters of the variation in bilateral

exports. Second, the coefficients are, on the whole, intuitive in sign and size, and both

economically and statistically significant. For instance, countries export less to destinations that

are further away; the elasticity is about -.75 and highly statistically significant. Richer and larger

exporters and importers do more business, as do countries linked by regional trade agreements, a

land border, or a common language. Landlocked and physically large countries do less trade;

colonies trade more with their colonizers. All this is conventional, reasonable, and bolsters

confidence in the underlying framework.




                                                   9
        Above and beyond these effects, there is still a role for the Foreign Service. In particular,

each additional consulate placed abroad is associated with a rise of bilateral exports of between

6% and 10%. This estimate seems economically plausible, but is small compared to the effects

of e.g., a common language, land border, or regional trade agreement. The effect differs only a

little across estimation techniques. Least squares gives an estimate of about 10%, with little

variation depending on whether fixed effects are added or not. Instrumental variables delivers a

lower estimate, but one that is still statistically significant (the associated t-statistic is 3.1); I

consider this in further detail below.


        Table 2 provides sensitivity analysis. I tabulate the benchmark pooled OLS result at the

top for convenience, and ten additional perturbations of the basic estimation. First, I loosen the

constraint that all (sixteen) different regional trade agreements have a common effect by

allowing for RTA-specific slopes. Next I drop all industrial countries from the sample, then all

developing countries.18 I then drop all countries with populations of less than one million, then

all countries with annual GDP per capita of less than $1,000. I consider two regional checks,

dropping all African countries, then all countries from Latin America or the Caribbean. Finally I

use random effects (instead of fixed effects) for exporters, importers, and both. None of these

robustness checks has any substantial effect on the slope except the (somewhat contrived)

exercise of dropping all industrial countries. The effect remains positive and statistically

significant throughout, though it is typically modest in size.


        The issue of reverse causality is potentially serious, one that deserves further attention.

In Table 3, I provide eight different sets of instrumental variable estimates. First, I reproduce the

IV estimate of γ tabulated in Table 1. I then add exporter-specific fixed effect intercepts, the

importer analogues, and then both together. In the lower half of the table, I use a larger set of


                                                    10
instrumental variables, adding an additional five to the original set of five IVs; again, I report the

results for four different combinations of fixed effects. I consistently estimate the effect of

foreign missions on exports to be positive. Without any fixed effects the effect is about half that

of least squares (5%-6%), and statistically distinguishable from zero. It is somewhat smaller and

statistically marginal when I include exporter intercepts. However, the effect is much more

significant (in both the economic and statistical senses) when destination fixed effects are

included, with or without exporter intercepts. The exact choice of instrumental variables does

not seem to matter greatly. I conclude that accounting for reverse causality does not destroy my

results.19


        The results in Tables 1-3 pool all the data across both exporters and destination countries.

However, they may disguise cross-country heterogeneity in the effect of foreign missions on

exports. Table 4 takes account of country-specific coefficients in three different ways. At the

left is a set of estimate of γ – the effect of foreign missions on exports – when I estimate the

equation country by country. Most of the effects are positive, and they differ dramatically across

countries. Still, the coefficient is usually estimated without precision. Accordingly, in the

middle column I pool the data again, but allow for country-specific slopes. Thus, the nuisance

coefficients are constrained to be common across countries, but each country is allowed its own

slope for the effect of foreign missions on trade (country-specific γ’s). There is still evidence of

substantial heterogeneity (and indeed the hypothesis of a common γ slope is rejected by the

data), though estimation precision remains typically poor. This is also true of the last column on

the right, which pools nuisance coefficients across countries (as with the middle column), but

adds exporter- and importer-specific intercepts. The effect of foreign missions on trade seems to

vary considerably across exporters.



                                                 11
       In Table 5 I investigate whether the first foreign mission in a country – almost always the

embassy – has a different effect on exports from additional missions.20 I test for a non-linear

effect of foreign missions on exports in two different ways. First, I include in the equation a

binary dummy variable for the first foreign mission in a country (denoted “Embassy”), as well as

a separate variable for the number of missions after the first, if any (denoted “Consulates”). I

estimate this equation with pooled OLS, and then successively add exporter-fixed effects,

importer intercepts, and both together. Then I re-estimate the equations in the same four ways,

adding the square of the number of foreign missions after the first (“Square of Consulates”).


       The results show strong evidence of a non-linear effect of the number of foreign missions

on exports. The establishment of a first foreign mission is associated with a substantial effect on

trade. While the exact estimate of γ varies somewhat depending on which econometric

specification is preferred, the creation of an embassy is associated with at least an increase in

exports of [exp(.79)-1≈] 120%. Some of this is undoubtedly the result of reverse causality, but

the size of the effect is striking. Additional consulates, by way of comparison, have a much

smaller export effect, on the order of 5%-11%. Even this effect seems to fall as consulates are

added, as shown by the fact that the square of the number of consulates is significantly negative.

Succinctly, the effect of the first foreign mission on exports is large, but the effect from

additional consulates seems to diminish rapidly.




5. Conclusion


       In this short paper, I ask a simple question: is the presence of foreign missions

systematically linked to a country’s exports? Using a bilateral gravity model of trade, the answer



                                                 12
is positive; holding other factors constant, exports seems to rise between 6%-10% for each

additional consulate.


       I find evidence that the creation of the embassy has a substantially larger impact on

exports than additional consulates. This non-linearity, along with the cross-country

heterogeneity, and reverse causality I have found are all technical issues that merit further

research. There is also an interesting economic issue that I have not attempted to address.

Embassies, consulates and the like purport to do a host of functions; this paper has considered

only one. Are the benefits of any trade creation sufficient to justify any reasonable fraction of

the costs of the Foreign Service? I leave such question for others to address in future research.

Further, “UK Trade & Investment is represented in over 200 FCO posts overseas, providing market information and
advice on local issues to companies visiting from the UK. UK Trade & Investment is the Government organisation
that supports both companies in the UK trading internationally and overseas enterprises seeking to locate in the UK.
UK Trade & Investment has the following targets:
      •    To develop 5,000 new exporters by 2004, with at least 15% improving their business performance
           within two years

      •    To assist 18,000 established exporters into markets new to them

      •    To assist 50% of established exporters to improve their business performance within two years

           UK Trade & Investment has recruited, mainly from the private sector, nine International Trade
           Directors, one for each English region. The directors and their International Trade Teams have
           been strategically located in the Regional Development Agencies to ensure they play a full role in
           drawing up regional trade strategies. The first point of contact for inquiries by companies in the
           UK is their International Trade Advisor, located at their local Business Link.

           UK Trade & Investment services include:

      •    Your Passport to Export Success- UK Trade & Investment’s flagship assessment and skills-based
           programme that provides new and inexperienced exporters with the training, planning and on-
           going support they need to succeed overseas.

      •    Export Explorer, an integrated package of help and advice that enables small and medium size
           firms to experience new and accessible export markets at minimal cost…

           Teams of commercial officers at British Diplomatic posts overseas work to understand the local
           business environment and match opportunities to the capabilities of UK firms. Help for existing
           exporters takes a variety of forms aimed at meeting a wide range of customer needs. It ranges from
           the straightforward provision of information, through detailed advice in response to specific
           enquiries, to lobbying overseas on behalf of UK companies.”6

   I exclude a number of small entities because of data difficulties, including: Andorra, East Timor, Marshall Islands,
Micronesia, Monaco, Palestine, Puerto Rico, San Marino, and the Vatican. I also exclude international
organizations, and Taiwan, province of China.
13
   I also exclude French “agence consulaires.’

   Belgium, Canada, the UK, and the USA provide this information for my sample.
15
   Over 40% of potential exporter-destination pairs do not have any foreign missions. Thus, the 22 exporters I
consider simply do not maintain foreign missions in a significant fraction of (mostly small) foreign countries. At the
other end of the spectrum, Mexico maintains an embassy and 42 consulates inside the United States, while the
Netherlands and Switzerland each maintain 27 foreign missions to the USA.

   I follow the IMF in equating industrial countries with those whose IFS code is less than two hundred. Thus my
sample of industrial countries is: USA; UK; Austria; Belgium; Denmark; France; Germany; Italy; Luxembourg;
Netherlands; Norway; Sweden; Switzerland; Canada; Japan; Finland; Greece; Iceland; Ireland; Malta; Portugal;
Spain; Turkey; Australia; New Zealand; and South Africa.
19
   In Appendix Table A4 I present the estimates of the first stage estimation (without fixed effects). These show that
the most successful plausibly exogenous determinants of the number of foreign missions are: a) the number of top-
100 Condé-Nast destinations in a country; b) the number of Economist city-guides; c) proven oil reserves; d)
military spending; and e) the presence of a monsoonal climate.

   While some countries (e.g., Indonesia) have consulates (e.g., in Ecuador) where there is no embassy, this is rare.
