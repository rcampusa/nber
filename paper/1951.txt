          On the Size Distribution of Employment and Establishments




                                   ABSTRACT



     Recent arguments that employment growth occurs disproportionately at

small establishments are fundamentally misleading because they confuse

regression to the mean with structural shifts in the size distribution of

establishments and with an aging effect within cohorts. The net growth

usually observed in aggregate studies hides the gross flows; 13 percent of the

jobs in existence in 1974 had disappeared by 1980, while 18 percent of the

1980 jobs had not existed six years previously. The variation observed here

in labor demand over time within individual establishments may help to explain

unemployment.

      What are the sources of employment and unemployment? In a sparsely

 travelled approach to this most fundamental question in economics, a few

 recent studies have analyzed employment growth across establishments of

 various sizes. These studies generally conclude that employment growth has

 been disproportionately concentrated in small establishments. This in turn

 has given rise to the folk wisdom that small establishments are the only

vibrant part of the economy. To some concerned with a public policy in favor

of job creation, such studies have suggested that employment policies be

targeted toward the smaller establishments that appear to be the wellsprings

of growth. Such an investment in jobs at small establishments may be

unnecessary or short-lived because in many cases the Horatio Alger-like rise

of the small firm may just be regression to the mean. This paper will present

new evidence of a large transient component in the level of employment within

individual establishments over time. This instability of jobs lends itself

to a regression fallacy, but may also help to explain unemployment.

     A stochastic model that resolves the paradox raised by previous studies

that small establishments grow faster than large but the distribution of

establishments by size remains unchanged is developed in section I. An

analysis of the size distribution of establishments and employment is

presented in section II. Section III uses a new longitudinal sample of

establishments to analyze changes in the distribution of employment within

cohorts. A set of regressions with controls for industry region, corporate

structure, and other determinants of size is presented in section IV.

Conclusions are presented in section V.

I.    SMALL IS RANDOMLY BEAUTIFUL: THE DYNAMICS OF ESTABLISHMENT SIZE


      Optimum establishment size is largely determined by economies of scale,

or economies of scope. Economies of scale will depend on technology and the

size of the market, which will vary by industry and region.              In modeling the

process of employment (size) change in a longitudinal sample of

establishments, I seek to embody the following characteristics:                    (1) a time

invariant distribution, (2) a transient random error, and (3) a partial

adjustment toward the mean.              It is useful to start with a time invariant

distribution of establishment size to show that random fluctuations and

regression to the mean will easily yield a situation in which small

establishments account for a disproportionate share of employment growth even

though the size distribution of employment is unchanged over time.

      The simplest process embodying the first two characteristics is:

                              +
(1)        5i,t =       XB         e1
where:

                  -is   the       logarithm of the size of establishment i   -in   period   t

           X      -is   the       vector of establishment characteristics giving optimal

                  scale

           e -is        a random error that may include measurement error,

                i.i.d               2
           e.            N(O,a).

      This transparently embodies the essential characteristics of regression

to the mean (Galton, 1886) in a time invariant distribution:



(2)        E(St —
                        5it         5i,t—1 =   — e,_1
                                                  —3—


 For excellent earlier discussions of this triumph of mediocrity and the

 attendent regression fallacy, see Prais (1958) and the articles cited therein.

 Compared to their expected sizes, large firms are expected to shrink and small

 firms are expected to grow. However, this process assumes complete

 requilibrium within one period, an assumption that is relaxed in the following

 stochastic process.

                    = X.B + A(S.       -              e.
 (3)         S.
              i,t      1       i,t—1       X.B)
                                            1
                                                  +
                                                        it
        Equation (3) says that the logarithm of establishment size is determined

by exogenous characteristics X1 which are expected to vary by industry and

region, by the deviation of last period1s size from expected size, and by a

random error term. This process includes as special cases both the random

walk (=O, A=1) and the fixed effect model                    A=O).

       For earlier developments of related stochastic models see Gibrat (1930),

Steindi (1965), and Ijiri and Simon (1977, p. 156). These analysis typically

derive a log-normal distribution of firm size from a random walk in logarithms

(Gibrat's Law). Undesirably, such random walk models also imply an exploding

variance of size. Empirical evidence that size follows a random walk in

logarithms (growth is independent of size) can be found in Hart and Prais

(1956), Simon and Bonn (1958), and Hymer and Pashigian (1962).

       Foflowing the process in equation (3) then, the logarithm of

establishment size is normally distributed with mean X1B and variance

(1/(1—A2) a2), or



(4)         Si — N(X.B, (1/1—A')a)


       The assumption that this distribution is time invariant implies that

relative factor prices are fixed over time so employment is in fixed
                                             —4—



proportion to scale, however measured.             is a measure of our ignorance of

the determinants of establishment size. In part, it may be due to random

shocks in product demand or to tipping in product market share in response to

unobserved technological innovations. If some factors of production are

specialized to individual establishments, or if economies of diseconomies of

scale are negligible, then optimal scale is not fully determined by the

observable X's. This would result in persistent deviations from expected size.

Although not developed here, it could be modelled by including an individual

specific time-invariant unobserved error component.

        Conditional on last period's size and delaying the discussion of

measurement error, the expectation of this period's size is:

                                         +
(5)
             E(SI S,t_1) =    (1—A)X1B       s1
and the expected change in establishment size is:

(6)                                                 —
             E(S,_ s1,_1J St_1) = (1_A)(XB              S,_1)
It is now clear that in a regression of logarithmic growth rates on the

logarithm of lagged size, controlling for other characteristics, the

coefficient on lagged size lies between zero and -1. At casual inspection it

will appear as though size has a direct detrimental effect on growth, although

nothing more need be at work than regression to the mean. In theory then, all

of the job growth among the small could be accounted for by regression to the

mean.

        The probability that size will increase is given by:

(7)          Prob(S>S1...1) =    1 —
                                       F{(1_A)(S1,..1 _XB)}
where F is the cumulative normal distribution function. On average, small

establishments are expected to grow.
                                       —5—


      In general, the greater the deviation of establishment size from its

 mean, the greater the expected subsequent movement toward the mean. In

 particular, the smaller the establishment, the larger its expected increase in

 size. Similarly, establishments found in the tails of the distribution are

 expected to have recently experienced the greatest random perturbation, and

 relatively few establishments are expected to experience great size changes.

All of these patterns have been observed without explanation in the earlier

 literature, and follow directly from the model just presented.

     Consider how a direct effect of size on growth can be distinguished from

regression to the mean. Choose a period long enough that adjustment
                                                                    may be
assumed to be almost complete (A-.O). The coefficient on lagged size is

expected to be -1 even if there were no direct negative effect of size on

growth, and will likely be negative even with a positive direct effect of
                                                                          size
on growth.   A test of the hypothesis that size slows growth is then that the

coefficient on lagged size be less than -1. A coefficient greater than
                                                                       —1
could arise because of (1) a positive direct effect of size on
                                                               growth, (2)
incomplete adjustment (A>O) or (3) positive autocorrelat-jon of errors.   The
role played by each of these possible factors is not identified without extra

information -if the observed coefficient -is greater than —1. Of
                                                                 course, if

growth rates do increase with size, the distribution explodes -- which should

be easily detectable. On the other hand, since the last two factors would both

give a coefficient greater than -1, a result less than —1 would be strong

evidence that size slows growth. Previous studies then have to some degree

been an exercise in demonstrating regression to the mean.3

 II. THE DISTRIBUTION OF EMPLOYMENT AND ESTABLISHMENTS BY ESTABLISHMENT SIZE


      If one is interested in determining whether growth is favored in

 establishments of a certain size for structural as opposed to purely random

 reasons, it is fruitful to start by looking at changes in the distribution

over time..4 If small establishments grow faster than do large, it follows

that; absent births and deaths, the proportion of all establishments that are

small decreases and their average size increases.

     There is some evidence that the size distribution of U.S. employment

shifted toward small establishments between 1974 and 1980, but the patterns are

not overwhelming and the shifts are less than those implied by previous studies.

Table 1 shows the size distribution of establishments and employment in 1974

and 1980 from the U.S. Census Bureau's County Business Patterns reports. The

sample is not fixed, but rather includes births and deaths. Of all 1974

employment, 52.5 percent was in establishments with fewer than 100 employees,

so such establishments' 78 to 81 percent share of employment growth as

measured by Birch (SBA, p. 85) or Armington and Odle (1982) is indeed greater

than their share of employment.5 However, by 1980 the share of total

employment in such establishments has increased only slightly to 54.3. In the

Census data, small establishments actually accounted for 64.496 of the net

increase in jobs. This is less than might have been expected from previous

studies. However, this in itself tells us nothing about the optimal scale of

establishments, or about the relative economic performance of various

establishments, or about which establishments should be the focus of a public

policy to promote job creation.6

    One cannot tell from the census statistics in Table 1 how much of the change
                                         —7—


 in the size distribution of establishments is due to changes in the

 industrial or regional composition of employment or the births of small

establishments and deaths of large ones. These problems of interpretation are

eliminated in Table 2. This gives the distribution of establishments and

employment by size class for a longitudinal sample of 68,690 establishments

with more than 16 million employees. The sample is based on Equal Employment

Opportunity (EEO) data,7 and is discussed at length in other work (Leonard,

1984). The tradeoff in using a longitudinal data set, of course, is that in

focusing on the health of the living, one no longer pays great attention to

births and deaths.     In particular, growth rates estimated here are over-

estimates in the sense that the worst cases, establishments that shut down

completely, are absent from the sample.

     In the moving cross sections of the longitudinal EEO sample the average

number of employees in the small size (< 100) class did not increase as fast

as in the large. Net employment fell in the small class size and grew in the

large, so all net employment growth by size class is found in the large class,

contrary to what might have been expected on the basis of previous studies.



III. COHORT ANALYSIS


     A substantial advantage of the EEO sample is that it allows us to follow

a cohort through time and see differential growth rates by size class. Column

5 of Table 2 stratifies 1980 employment by 1974 establishment size class.

What has previously been the standard analysis in this area amounts to com-

paring column 5 with column 4, both of which stratify by initial state. It is

immediately apparent that growth is concentrated in smaller establishments
                                          -8-


with less than 100 employees.   These establishments accounted for 10.8 percent

of all employees in 1974.   By 1980, the same establishments accounted for 12.7

percent of all employees. In other words, employment grew by 23.5 percent

among these establishments compared to 5.1 percent overall and 2.8 percent

among the establishments with 100 or more employees. These small establish-

ments, which comprise 48 percent of all establishments, then account for 50.3

percent of total net job growth.   I   f one includes establishments with less

than 250 employees among the small, the result is more striking: more than

100 percent of total net job growth occurs in such establishments.

     The contribution made by small (<100) establishments which stayed small

compared to those which grew (over 100) can be deduced by comparing the cohort

in column 5 with the cross section in column 3. Establishments that are no

longer small by 1980 can account for all of the net job creation in the small

class.

     Are small establishments then really the fountainheads of growth? Column

6 of Table 2 stratifies 1974 employment by end state: establishment size

class in 1980. The obvious pattern, and one that has been largely ignored in

previous studies, is that small establishments account for most net job loss

just as surely as they account for most net job gain. Establishments with

less than 100 employees in 1980 included 10.2 percent of all 1980 employees.

The simplest way to see a central point of this paper is to compare column 6

with column 3, both of which stratify by terminal size. Six years earlier,

these same establishments employed 12.2 percent of the work force. This

simple finding is important: the small have shrunk. Comparing columns 6 and

4 shows that many of these establishments must have become small since 1974.

     It is just as meaningful and valid to analyze the dynamics of size change
                                         -9-


 classifythg by end of period rather than beginning of period size. Think of a

 stochastic process that acted the same running backward or forward in time.

 In the process of equation 1, if       but not S1 is known, the expectation
of past change in size is:



 (8)
             E(S1t    S1,_1j 5it =


Here, it is expected that a large firm will have recently experienced a

positive random shock. The results in this case appear to be the opposite,

but this is simply an illustration of regression to the mean. Just as

establishments that are small tend to grow (eq. 2), establishments that are

small tend to have shrunk (eq. 8). There is no greater implication for policy

in the former phrase than in the latter, but either taken by itself is

intrinsically misleading.



IV. REGRESSION ANALYSIS


       Table 3 presents estimates of regressions of the logarithm of employment

growth between 1974 and 1980 controlling for industry, region, size, corporate

structure, occupational structure and federal contractor status, using the

longitudinal EEO sample of 68,690 establishments. Do establishments of

different sizes have different growth rates once industry, region, etc., are

controlled for?

       The evidence in regression 1 of Table 3, which controls for initial size,

only seems to give a clear answer. The elasticity of growth rate with respect

to size in 1974 is —.124. As initial size increases by 10 percent, growth
                                      -10-


rate declines by 1.2 percent. Growth rates appear to fall significantly with

initial size.

     The sample is longitudinal, so none of these differences can be due to

differential birth or death rates, or to differences in the composition of the

sample over time. Moreover, industry and region are controlled for, so these

differences cannot be attributed to different efficient scales in various

industries or regions. These estimates, with a more extensive set of

controls, may appear on casual inspection to confirm recent findings

(Armington and Odle, 1982; Birch, 1979; Teitz et al., 1981) that employment

growth is concentrated in small establishments.

     The stochastic model of change in establishment size presented in section

I shows why such an interpretation of the distribution of growth by

establishment size can be misleading. With regression to the mean a negative

coefficient on lagged size is likely even if the direct effect of size on

growth is positive. Strong evidence that size hinders growth would be a

coefficient less than -1. Since the estimated coefficient s significantly

greater than - we cannot accept the hypothesis that size hinders growth. It

is possible then that all of the apparent size differential in growth rates

could be accounted for by regression to the mean.

     Regression 2 of Table 3 is identical in specification to regression 1

with the exception that it controls for 1980 size rather than 1974 size, and

is so a logical extension of Table 2. Now it appears that growth rates are

significantly higher in estabUshments that end up large. Again, in light of

the stochastic model of section I, there is no contradiction between observing

that small establishments are more likely than small to have grown while the

small are more likely to have shrunk. The near identity of standard errors
                                                         —11—


    across regressions merely reflects the high correlation of size across years.

          There are several possible interpretations of regression 2. Multiplying

 both sides by -1, it is a bivariate regression of shrinkage rates on terminal

size. It then says that the small in 1980 shrunk more since 1974 than the

small in 1974 grew by 1980, although the difference (between —.126 and -.124)

 is insubstantial. In a measurement error context, regression 2 can also be

read as a reverse regression. From equation 3 it follows that:




(9)              sit —
                           S1 =               + [1—JSjt       +
                                                                  it
The coefficients on the X variables are so expected to be                           times greater in

the reverse regression. As is well known in the case of measurement error

affecting the dependent variable and one independent variable, the forward and

reverse regressions can be used to bound the true parameter. As a reverse

regression, regression 2 implies A =                 1.144, which would be upward biased by
measurement error. If we add the stability constraint, A is bounded by .876

(=1-.124) and 1.             This seems a slow adjustment to optimal size, in which case

positive serial correlation of the errors may be suspected. In either case,

there is no compelling evidence here that size has a negative effect on growth

beyond what would be expected from regression to the mean.

          To see how easily the estimates of size effects in Table 3 could arise,

consider the following simplified case. Let y be the 1980 logarithm of

size, x the 1974 logarithm of size, S   and Sxx the respective variances, and
                                     yy
                                                                                2
ry their correlation. Now in simple regressions,                            =        •         and

b     =   r2    •   S                Since the model in this paper assumes constant variances
                        xx/5yy
                                 .

xy         yx
over time, 5yy =
                            S,<, and so
                                               =
                                                   byx
                                                         =   r2.   For illustration, suppose           =

.885.      Now the expected coefficient from a simple regression of y-x on x is
                                      —12—


b-1. or -.125. The expected coefficient from a simple regression of y-x on

y is 1-b   or .125. This illustrates that the size effects estimated in Table

3 can arise quite easily without any true direct effect of size on growth.

     Regression 2 of Table 3 read in conjunction with regression 1 also shows

other interesting shifts in the distribution of establishment size.   In most

economic models, corporate structure is a veil. With competitive capital and

product markets, there is little reason to expect establishments to differ

depending on whether or not they are owned by a larger enterprise. But this

is an empirically testable proposition. Single establishments -- those that

are not part of multiplant companies -- appear to have significantly greater

growth rates, ceteris paribus (regression 1).   In general, single

establishments are subject to greater variations in employment, so we also see

(regression 2) that they appear to have shrunk more, as well. The net effect,

however, is greater growth.8 Similar evidence is found on the relationship

between growth and being a 1974 federal contractor. In both cases, employment

is relatively more volatile in such establishments.

     Occupational structure does have a significant and consistent effect.

Establishments that are nonclerical, white-collar intensive exhibit

significantly greater growth rates, and significantly lower shrinkage rates

within industry and region. This may reflect pervasive technological change

favoring white-collar intensive establishments. In other words, optimal scale

appears to have increased for such establishments.

     Optimal establishment size is a function of both the technology of

production and the size of the market, so we allow growth patterns to differ

across industries and regions. Concerning industry specific effects, the

signs of the largest effects are not always the same across equations, so the
                                       —13—


bounded estimates include zero. Mining, Chemicals, Machinery, Instruments,

and Services have been the most consistent growth sectors. Across regions,

establishments have grown significantly less in the Mid-Atlantic and East

North-Central regions, and significantly more in the West.



VI. CONCLUSIONS


     The large transient component of establishment size that gives rise to

the regression to the mean phenomena analyzed above can also be of potential

use in explaining unemployment. At least 13.2 percent of the EEO sample jobs

in existence in 1974 no longer existed by 198O. Of the sample

establishments, 43.4 percent experienced an employment decline between 1974

and 1980, losing an average of 72 jobs. Over the same period, at least 18.2

percent new jobs were created. 54.7 percent of the establishments grew, by

an average of 79 jobs.   In other words the 5.1 percent net job growth observed

in this sample is the result of two much larger partially offsetting but

typically unobserved flows. Labor demand is more volatile than is apparent

from the usual aggregate net statistics. This volatility suggests that some

unemployment could be explained by unstable jobs rather than unstable

workers.1° It also raises two questions for future research: 1) to what extent

are low tenure workers sorted into low tenure jobs? and 2) to what extent

can the life expectancy of jobs be anticipated by workers and so enter into

job security, contracting and compensation decisions?

     Longitudinal of data with large transient components are subject to the

misinterpretation of what could simply be regression to the mean.   In the case

of the size distribution of employment, previous studies have pointed to the
                                      -14-


disproportionate share of employment growth accounted for by small

establishments and argued that these small establishments are the wellspr-ings

of growth.   I have argued here that part of the phenomenon these analysts have

described may be regression to the mean. None of the previously observed

patterns need tell us anything more than that establishment size is subject to

transient shocks, from which it then requilibrates. Size is better thought of

as an endogenous than as an exogenous variable. The size distribution of

establishments is a less dangerous guide to how economic conditions favor

establishments of any given size.

     This study has begun to point out the large variations in employment

levels within individual establishments during a brief six-year period.11 This

suggests that part of the problem of unemployment is to be found not just in

people, or in the match of people and jobs, but also fundamentally -in the

volatility of jobs themselves.

                                      Footnotes

 1.   The response received by the most publicized study of the small business
 share of job creation has been described by Bluestone and Harrison (1982, p.
 221):

         Thus it would be hard to exaggerate the excitement that has been
         generated ... by the most recently published research of David L. Birch
             Birch has written that: 'of the all net new jobs created in our
         sample of 5.6 million [establishments] between 1969 and 1976, two-thirds
         were created by firms with twenty or fewer employees, and about 80
         percent were created by firms with 100 or fewer employees'. This has
         been picked up by the media in the United States, Canada, and Great
         Britain and repeated endlessly by advocates of a policy of switching the
         focus of publicly-subsidized development programs from large corporations
         to the 'small business community'.

2.   One of the earliest demonstrations of the importance of transient
components is found -in Friedman (1957).

3.   Birch does note the volatility of jobs and seems to have given this more
attention in recent work. He observes that small establishments have higher
death rates, and that "establishments with the greatest odds of experiencing a
big loss are the ones that have have just grown the most" (Birch, 1979, p.
39). In later work he struggles with the paradox of reconciling
disproportionate job growth among small establishments with a stable
distribution over time, and in his "pulsation" analogy (Birch, 1981, p. 20)
comes close to the idea of regression to the mean. Armington and Odle find
that much of the growth observed by Birch using Dun and Bradstreet data takes
place among small establishments that are part of large companies. Teitz et
al. add the qualification that growth is concentrated in just 12 to 15 percent
of small establishments, and that the half-life of most new jobs is probably
well under four years (p. 61). Fothergill and Gudgin present a comparative
analysis of British manufacturing job growth and evidence of a much smaller
decline in growth with size among both young and old establishments. Previous
work suffers mostly from the lack of a statistical model to guide the
interpretation of the observed patterns.

4.   For related arguments comparing static analysis and survivor technique,
see Caves, et al. (1975) and Stigler (1958).

5.   The direct job creation by small firms may be distinguished from their
indirect effect. See Meller and Marfan (1981) for evidence that employment
multipliers are larger for large than small industries, based on input—output
data for Chilean manufacturing.

6.   There are some basic patterns in Table 1 that deserve mention before
passing on. More than half of all establishments have less than five
employees, but more than half of all employees are in establishments with 50
or more employees, and 14.3 percent of all workers are employed in the
one-tenth of 1 percent of all establishments with 1,000 employees or more,
down from 16 percent in 1974. Average establishment size did increase from
15.5 to 16.5, or by 6 percent, which is less than the 12 percent growth in
                                      —16—


total employment. At the same time, the average size of a small (<100)
establishment did increase.

7.   The EEO sample -is not directly comparable to the Census sample. Small
establishments that are part of small companies are not required to report.
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires annual reports on work
force demographics from all private employers with 100 or more employees, or
50 or more employees and a federal contract or first—tier subcontract or
purchase order worth $50,000 or more, with special provisions for financial
institutions. In the case of multi—establishment enterprises, all
establishments with more than 24 employees that belong to enterprises that
fulfill the above conditions must report individually. So while the
longitudinal EEO sample contains 25.7 percent of Census-reported employment in
1974, it contains only 1.7 percent of Census—reported establishments.
Nevertheless, the EEO sample has enough size variation to support the
regression analysis that follows. Note that temporary or casual employees are
not counted, according to regulations, among employees in the EEO sample. The
results reported here do not depend on a sample that overrepresents large
establishments. See Leonard (1986) for a related study of a population,
including the smallest establishments.

8.   The differences in growth rates and employment variability between single
establishments and those that are part of larger companies are complex. When
terms interacting single and size are added to the right hand side, these
interaction terms are positive -in both regressions. Growth rates appear lower
for small single establishments than for non-single, but this relationship
reverses at larger size.

9.   It is doubtful that much of what I interpret here as permanent job losses
are really temporary layoffs or temporarilly unfilled vacancies. Lill-ien
(1984) finds an average temporary layoff duration of 6 to 8 weeks. Abraham
(1983) reports vacancy rates during the 1970's of 1.7 to 3.7 percent. The
first is much shorter and the second much smaller than the 13.2 percent job
loss over 6 years calculated here.

10. Of course, there is a great deal of evidence that unemployment is not
randomly distributed across people; blacks and teenagers in particular are more
likely to be unemployed. Short employment spells also appear to be more
common early in working life (Hall) and to be disproportionately borne by
relatively few people. For example, Akerlof and Main (1981, p. 1007) estimate
that while the mean unemployment year of a white male is spent in an 18-year
job, the mean length of all jobs held by white males -is only 4 years. Most
workers appear to eventually find their way into stable jobs.

11. A number of important questions cannot be answered with the limited panel
of data examined here, but will be explored in further work. How fast is job
turnover taking place, and is the rate stable over time? The six-year changes
can only be a lower bound of total changes in the distribution of jobs during
the intervening years. If jobs flicker on and off faster, and are not all
associated with known temporary layoffs, then the potential for unemployment
-is greater, as is the difficulty of distinguishing bad jobs from bad people.
If the duration of jobs -- not of an individual's employment, but the lifetime
of the position itself -— has decreased over time, the "natural" rate of
                                     —17--



unemployment will rise. It would be interesting to observe how the
variability of firm size changed over the business cycle and with changes in
government policy. In addition, we lack studies of the birth and death of
establishments and firms, and of how optimum size and the equilibrium
distribution of size vary with factor prices, regulations, and market
conditions.
