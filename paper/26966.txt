This paper presents new estimates of the level and persistence of poverty among U.S. households
since the Great Recession. We build annual household data files using U.S. income tax filings
between 2007 and 2018. These data allow us to track individuals over time and measure how tax
policies affect poverty trends. Using an after-tax household income measure, we estimate that
while roughly 1 in 10 people are in poverty in any given year, over 4 in 10 people spent at least
one year in poverty between 2007 and 2018. This implies substantial mobility in and out of
poverty--for example, 41 percent of those in poverty in 2007 were out of poverty in the
following year. Others spend multiple years in poverty or escape poverty only to fall back into it.
Of those in poverty in 2007, one-third were in poverty for at least half of the years through 2018.

I.      Introduction

        Over 38 million people, or 11.8 percent of United States residents, were living in poverty

in 2018 based on the Census Bureau's official poverty statistics (Semega et al., 2019). For some

poverty represents a temporary setback; for others poverty persists for years or decades.

Understanding the persistence of poverty, along with the poverty level at any point in time, is

essential for designing and evaluating anti-poverty programs. 1 This paper produces new estimates

of the level and persistence of poverty in the United States between 2007 and 2018 using a new

panel of household-level incomes in tax record data.

        To explore the persistence of poverty, we build a population panel of household-level tax

records to evaluate poverty dynamics from 2007 to 2018. By aggregating tax data to the household

level and incorporating non-filers using income data from their information returns--such as Form

W-2 and the 1099 series--we estimate household-level incomes, income distributions, and poverty

levels in each year. Additionally, since the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) receives tax records

annually for almost all adults, these data provide a naturally occurring population-level panel. We

use the panel nature of these data to evaluate the persistence of poverty and analyze the

characteristics of individuals experiencing short-term poverty compared to those experiencing

persistent poverty.

        We first compare the levels and trends in cross-sectional poverty in the tax data--both pre-

tax and after-tax--with the Census Bureau's Official Poverty Measure based on the Current

Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS). The levels of poverty differ

across the two sources due to differences in income concepts and reporting accuracy. To avoid

having these inherent differences in levels affect the trend estimates, we anchor poverty rates in

 For example, the effects of time limits on social welfare programs (e.g., Temporary Assistance for Needy Families)
will depend greatly on whether most poverty is transitory or persistent in nature.

                                                        1
the tax data at the level estimated using the CPS in 2007. Next, we estimate poverty persistence as

the number of years an individual is in poverty conditional on being in poverty in a given base

year. Finally, we estimate the share of people experiencing poverty at some point over a multi-year

period.

          In doing so, we build off the extensive survey-based literature considering these topics

based on data such as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the Survey of Income and

Program Participation (SIPP), which re-interview the same individuals over time. This survey-

based research has typically found that most poverty spells are relatively short, with approximately

half of poverty spells lasting just one year (see e.g., Duncan et al., 1984; Bane & Ellwood, 1986;

Stevens, 1999). Nevertheless, those in chronic poverty make up a substantial share of those in

poverty at any point in time. For example, Stevens (1999) observes that over one-third of people

who experience poverty in a given year will be poor for at least 5 years over the subsequent decade.

However, survey-based estimates of income dynamics have measurement error in income

(Gottschalk & Huynh, 2010) and non-representative attrition (Fitzgerald, Gottschalk, & Moffit,

1998; Dynan, Elemendorf, & Sichel, 2012; Jenkins & Van Kerm, 2017), each of which could

potentially bias estimates of mobility and poverty persistence.

          The administrative tax records data we use generally do not have the same concerns. Since

nearly all individuals are listed on tax returns or have income have information sent to the IRS on

their behalf (Cilke, 2014; Larrimore, Mortenson, & Splinter, 2019), results based on these data

generally do not suffer from survey attrition bias. Similarly, since there is a potential financial

penalty for misreporting income on tax records, these data are frequently considered to provide

more comprehensive reporting of income from taxable sources (Bee & Rothbaum, 2019).

Although administrative survey data are not without error and miss some earnings captured in



                                                  2
surveys (Abowd & Stinson, 2013), these data are likely less prone to measurement error than

survey records. Consequently, we are able to provide more robust estimates of the persistence of

poverty in the U.S. than can be achieved using survey data alone. Nevertheless, despite their

substantial advantages in coverage and income reporting, these data lack important demographic

information such as race and ethnicity (Akee, Jones, & Porter, 2019; Chetty et al., 2019).

       Several papers have used U.S. tax data to measure income volatility (see e.g., Auten &

Gee, 2009; Larrimore, Mortenson, & Splinter, 2016; Splinter, 2019) or persistence of program

receipt (Dowd & Horowitz, 2011). Additionally, outside of the U.S., Finnie and Sweetman (2003)

used tax records to explore poverty rates in Canada. To our knowledge, however, this paper is the

first to consider poverty rates or the persistence of poverty directly in U.S. tax data.

       In general, our results on poverty dynamics are consistent with previous findings from

survey data, although the levels and trends of poverty rates differ from those measured using the

CPS. We observe somewhat greater stability in poverty rates using pre-tax income over the period

from 2007 to 2018 than is found using CPS data. This is in part due to underreporting of

unemployment insurance benefits in the CPS data at the height of the Great Recession. When

measuring poverty on an after-tax basis, we similarly observe that the substantial temporary tax

reductions implemented to combat the recession largely alleviated the increases in poverty that are

evident between 2007 and 2011 in the pre-tax data.

       A large share of the population will experience poverty at some point. While just over 1 in

10 people are in poverty in any single year based on after-tax income, 4 in 10 spent at least one

year in poverty over the 12-year period from 2007 through 2018. Among those who were in

poverty at any point during this period, the average time spent in poverty is about 3 years (not

necessarily continuously), or one fourth of the time.



                                                  3
         Although some poverty is transitory, we also find substantial levels of persistent poverty,

consistent with Stevens (1999). Fifty-seven percent of people in poverty in the 2007 tax data

remained in poverty one year later and 28 percent were in poverty ten years later. However, for

many this includes an intervening period where they were not poor, as only 9 percent were poor

for at least 10 of the 12 years through 2018. One-third of people who were in poverty in 2007 are

subsequently poor for at least half of the 12-year period through 2018. These findings suggest that

despite substantial mobility in and out of poverty, many who experience poverty either spend

several consecutive years in poverty or escape poverty only to return in a future year.



II.      Data and Methods

A. Data

         This paper uses a one percent sample, based on individual taxpayer identification endings,

from the Tax Household Data, which is built from Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax records.

Larrimore, Mortenson and Splinter (2019) developed the Tax Household Data for tax year 2010.

We extend these data to cover the 12-year period from 2007 through 2018. Prior to 2007, address

data is less complete in the IRS data, which currently limits our ability to extend the panel to earlier

years.

         The Tax Household Data starts with the universe of IRS tax data for individual taxpayers,

including annual tax returns (such as Form 1040) and information return forms that are submitted

to the IRS by third parties (such as Forms W-2, 1099-SSA, and 1099-INT for various income

sources and Form 1098-T for college attendance, see appendix for details). Using the address fields

that appear on IRS tax forms, the Tax Household Data links individuals residing at the same

address, even if they are not listed on the same tax return. By doing so, we treat all individuals

living together as a joint economic unit.

                                                   4
         Recognizing that extremely low-income individuals are not required to file a tax return, a

crucial question in using tax data for the purpose of poverty measurement is whether they

systematically miss low-income individuals. Were we to only include people who file tax returns,

this would be a substantial concern, as almost 15 percent of adults do not appear on annual tax

returns (Auten & Gee, 2009; Molloy, Smith, & Wozniak, 2011). However, the IRS also receives

information returns, which include address data along with income information, from almost all

major taxable sources of income for both filers and non-filers. Additionally, Larrimore, Mortenson,

and Splinter (2019) show that the distribution of information return income closely mirrors that

for tax return income among filers in the lower half of the income distribution. Consequently, tax

data can capture nearly the entire U.S. population and observe incomes from taxable income

sources (and some non-taxable sources) even among non-filers. 2 Nevertheless, as described further

below, we incorporate an adjustment to incorporate people who have zero incomes into the data.

         The first three columns of Table 1 show the annual population count in our data, in the

American Community Survey (ACS) data, and in the Current Population Survey (CPS). The ACS

data is our preferred comparison for the overall population, as it includes institutionalized

populations, those on military bases, and those living in group quarters. In all years before 2018,

the population count in the IRS data is within 2 percent of that seen in the ACS. The population

count in the tax records data is lower in 2017 and 2018 (between 2.0 and 2.5 percent below ACS

estimates), consistent with dependents of some late filers not yet appearing in the data. The CPS

data used for the Official Poverty Measure excludes institutionalized populations and those living

on military bases. Hence, the CPS estimates a smaller population than the ACS.


2
  For ease of exposition, we collectively refer to all sources that appear on tax returns as taxable income, although
some, such as the non-taxable portion of Social Security income and non-taxable interest, are not always taxed.
Hence, discussions of taxable income should not be confused with individual-level taxable income amounts as
reported on Form 1040.

                                                           5
           The high coverage rate of tax data confirms that while there are some people who do not

appear in the IRS data, in general these data are nearly as comprehensive as the CPS used for the

Official Poverty Measure. However, we recognize that the IRS data will miss those who have no

reportable income or activity generating an information return, while the CPS will miss homeless

populations not captured by the survey's household-based sampling frame, as well as

institutionalized populations who are also excluded from the sample. 3 As a result, both the IRS

and CPS data represent an undercount of the overall U.S. population.

Household Data.
Notes: As described in Semega et al. (2019), the CPS updated their population benchmark in 2010 and updated their
questionnaire in 2013 and 2017. We report results using the revised questionnaire and updated processing system,
excluding those living in group quarters. CPS results are provided for the income year, which are based on the survey
collected in March of the following year. ACS results are based on the year in which the survey is conducted. IRS
population estimates exclude individuals living outside the United States and those without a valid address. Group
quarters in the IRS data include any household with 11 or more individuals. The 2017 and 2018 IRS populations are
based on late-2019 data availability and therefore miss the dependents of late filers.



3
  Each year since 2007 the Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates the homeless population on a
single night of the year. Their estimate of the homeless population over this period has ranged from 550,000 to
647,000 people (HUD 2018). This reflects approximately 0.2 percent of the overall U.S. population.

                                                         6
        The Official Poverty Measure's approach using CPS data excludes institutional and group

quarters populations from poverty estimates. These groups are not comparable to the rest of the

population: they share resources differently with those at the same address and they receive

substantial in-kind services (which can substitute for the income used in determining poverty). To

provide more consistent measures, we follow this approach in our poverty estimates, excluding

from the IRS data the approximately 8 million people each year who appear to live in households

with 11 or more individuals (who we expect are frequently living in group quarters). This results

in between 7 and 12 million fewer people in the data in each year than is estimated by the CPS

(comparing column 2 and column 5 of Table 1).

        One reason that the IRS population counts are likely lower than those in the ACS and CPS

is that individuals who have zero income and do not appear on a tax return will not appear in IRS

data. Although non-response and underreporting of some income sources (see e.g. Bee & Mitchell,

2017; Bee & Rothbaum, 2019; Bollinger et al., 2019; Meyer et al., 2019) likely results in the CPS

overstating the number of people in households with zero income, the lack of tax reporting

requirements for those with zero income also suggests that the IRS data understate the zero-income

population. To address this concern, for our main estimates we take an upper bound by adding to

our population the difference between the number of people in households with zero incomes (from

income sources appearing on tax forms) in the CPS data and the number observed in the IRS data. 4

This is consistent with the approach by Chetty and Hendren (2018), who assumed that missing

observations in tax data were true zeros. Including these imputed individuals in households with

no income adds about 4 to 6 million people to our IRS population estimate--with the largest

increases occurring between 2010 and 2012 in the aftermath of the Great Recession. After the


4
 Poverty estimates without the imputation of missing individuals living in zero income households are available in
Appendix Figures A1 and A2.

adjustment for group quarters, and adding imputed zeros, we estimate a population that is

approximately 1 percent below the CPS population in most years.

Sources: Semega et al. (2019), DeNavas-Watt, Proctor, and Smith (2011), IPUMS USA (Ruggles et al., 2019),
Emmanuel Saez's website for counts of tax units, and Authors' calculations using the IRS Tax Household Data.
Notes: The CPS re-benchmarked their household count for the 2010 income year, increasing the number of households
by 1.3 million (DeNavas-Watt, Proctor, & Smith, 2011) based on the 2010 Decennial Census.



        In addition to reasonably well approximating the population estimates in these two Census

surveys, the Tax Household Data also well approximates the number of households in these

surveys. In all years since 2007, the Tax Household Data estimate of the number of households is

between the household count estimated in the CPS and that estimated by the ACS (Figure 1). Each

of these are well below the count of tax units in the IRS data. For example, in 2018, we estimate

using the Tax Household Data that there are 124 million households in the United States (not


                                                       8
including the additional imputed zero income households) compared to 172 million tax units. This

is about 2 percent above the 122 million households estimated in the ACS and less than 4 percent

below the 129 million households estimated in the CPS. These estimates are consistent with the

suggestion by McCue, Masnick, and Herbert (2015) that the CPS overestimates the number of

households while the ACS underestimates the number of households.



B. Income and sharing unit differences from the Official Poverty Measure

         Although CPS and IRS data both collect annual incomes, there are several notable

differences in income concepts between these data sources that prevent us from directly replicating

the Official Poverty Measure using IRS data. Three major income measurement differences are

the coverage of transfer income for low-income individuals in the CPS (and lack of coverage in

tax data), tax credits for low-income individuals in the tax data (and lack of coverage in the CPS),

and private retirement income in the tax data (and limited coverage in the CPS). The first two are

most relevant for this analysis.

         The CPS income measure used for the Official Poverty Measure includes all pre-tax cash

income. This includes cash transfers from workers' compensation, cash welfare programs such as

TANF, veterans' benefits, child support, financial assistance from friends or family, and

educational assistance. All of these are untaxed and do not appear on IRS tax forms. 5 On the other

hand, the CPS does not ask about, and the Census Bureau excludes from the Official Poverty

Measure, tax liabilities and tax credits that IRS records accurately capture. 6 Henry and Day (2005)




5
  Educational assistance may be taxable in limited circumstances, such as scholarship income used for expenses
other than tuition and fees, although we assume that this income is typically untaxed and not reported on tax forms.
6
  Although tax liabilities and credits are excluded from the Official Poverty Measure, they are imputed in the CPS
for alternative income measures and for constructing the Supplemental Poverty Measure.

                                                          9
provide a broader discussion of differences between CPS and IRS income concepts, including how

specific sources are captured in the two datasets.

         When using the IRS data to estimate poverty trends, we first consider pre-tax income in the

IRS data, defined as all taxable income plus non-taxable income that is observable on IRS tax

forms (primarily Social Security income, Disability Insurance, and tax-exempt interest). Although

this is narrower than the Official Poverty Measure's income definition because it misses certain

cash transfers not reported in tax data, it is directly comparable to pre-tax income from the same

sources captured in the CPS and can therefore isolate how changing data source affects poverty

estimates. For our main estimates, however, we focus on after-tax income, which deducts federal

individual income taxes and payroll taxes, and includes refundable tax credits such as the Earned

Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit (see appendix for details). These tax credits, which

are refundable subject to various earned income requirements, represent some of the largest anti-

poverty programs in the United States. The shift over time in social welfare programs from direct

cash-based transfers to transfers administered through the tax code means that, despite their

exclusion from the Official Poverty Measure, tax-based programs are extremely important for

understanding poverty trends. 7

         Our other deviation from Official Poverty Measure's income definitions is the choice of

sharing unit and the equivalence scale. The Official Poverty Measure uses a family sharing unit

concept, which includes all people "related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together"

(Census Bureau, 2019). 8 But the information needed to replicate the Census Bureau's family


7
  As discussed by Burkhauser et al. (2019), there also has been an increase in in-kind (non-cash) transfers since the
inception of the Official Poverty Measure in the 1960s. Despite the importance of these programs to the financial
resources of low-income families, we do not attempt to include in-kind transfers in our poverty measures since these
transfers are not captured in the tax data. For an analysis of state-level heterogeneity of the effect of taxes and
transfers on poverty, see Bruch, Gornick, and van der Naald (forthcoming).
8
  The Census Bureau only refers to individuals as part of a family if at least two relatives are residing together,
referring to individuals living with no other relatives as "unrelated individuals." While technically Census does not

                                                         10
definition is not available in the tax data. Instead, we aggregate income to the household level.

This includes all individuals living in the same household, even if not related by blood or marriage,

and usually combines cohabiting partners and roommates into the same sharing unit. 9

Consequently, in 2010 there were approximately 14 million fewer households in the U.S. than

Census families and unrelated individuals: 120 million versus 134 million (Semega et al., 2019).

While we would prefer to estimate poverty dynamics using both sharing unit concepts, using

households is common among researchers considering the duration of poverty and not unique to

this study (e.g., Bane & Ellwood, 1986; Stevens, 1999; McKernan & Ratcliffe, 2005; Burkhauser

et al., 2019). Moreover, the household is the recommended sharing unit of the Canberra Group

(2011), which sets international standards for income measurement, and is frequently used as the

sharing unit in international poverty estimates, including those by the OECD (Forster & D'Ercole,

2012). Previous research has also suggested that households provide a better approximation of the

actual sharing of resources (Atkinson, Rainwater, & Smeeding, 1995; Smeeding & Weinberg,

2001; Congressional Budget Office, 2018; Aladangady, Feiveson, & Paciorek, 2019). 10

         In all calculations, we adjust household incomes for household size by dividing by the

square root of the number of household members. The square root equivalence scale nearly

replicates the average equivalence scales embedded in the official poverty thresholds. The use of

the equivalence scale avoids the mechanical relationship between poverty rates and household size



consider single individuals as families, for ease of exposition, we collectively refer to Census families and unrelated
individuals as families.
9
  The Tax Household Data assigns individuals claimed as dependents to the address of the return claiming them
because dependents provide less than half of their own expenses and hence are not fully independent economic
units. For many college students living away from home, this assigns them to the address of their parent. Individuals
living in group housing are removed in both the CPS and Tax Household Data. See Larrimore, Mortenson, and
Splinter (2019) for details.
10
   A third potential sharing unit is the tax unit, which generally includes all individuals filing a tax return together
and is narrower than either the household or Census family. In 2010, there were over 157 million tax units in the
U.S. However, we are unaware of research suggesting that the tax unit is a preferable sharing unit to either the
household or the Census family.

                                                          11
that would occur if estimating poverty rates without regard to household size. 11 Since poverty

measures are often focused on families of four, in Figure 2 and Table 2 below, we rescale size-

adjusted values to reflect four-person households.



III.     Results

A. Annual poverty rates

         We begin our analysis by comparing annual poverty rates in the CPS and the IRS data.

Even after constructing an analogous measure of income in both data sets, we expect the levels of

poverty to differ because the IRS data captures a larger amount of taxable income among low-

income populations. This is likely because the CPS is comprised of survey responses while the

IRS data is based on a combination of third-party reporting and self-reporting (with potential

penalties for misreporting). Due to underreporting of income in the CPS, we observe higher

source-specific (and overall) taxable incomes in the IRS data. This is consistent with that seen by

Larrimore, Mortenson, and Splinter (2019) and observations about underreporting from Bee and

Mitchell (2017), Bee and Rothbaum (2019), and Bollinger et al. (2019).

         Figure 2 shows the bottom quartile of the size-adjusted household income distribution in

2007 (the first year of our sample). The income definition for all series only includes taxable

sources observed in the CPS. The figure displays the CPS series as well as the IRS data with and

without imputed individuals in zero-income households. At all percentiles of the income

distribution, the IRS income without imputed zeros is to the right of the CPS distribution--

reflecting the higher levels of income observed in the IRS data. When imputing zeros and assuming


11
   The inclusion of an equivalency scale for the size of the sharing unit in poverty calculations was a key innovation
of Orshansky (1965). In the earlier poverty estimates by the Council of Economic Advisers (1964), poverty
thresholds only differentiated between single individuals, for whom the poverty threshold was $1,500, and those in
families with two or more people, for whom the threshold was $3,000. See Fisher (1992) for additional details on
the history of the poverty thresholds.

that the CPS accurately captures the number of households with zero taxable incomes, the gap

between the two datasets closes, although the IRS distribution remains to the right of that observed

in the CPS above the 8th percentile of the distribution (about $15,000 for a four-person household).

          As previously discussed, the taxable income definition used here is narrower than that used

by the Official Poverty Measure, although the sharing unit is broader. Given the National

Academies of Sciences report recommendation that "any significant change in the definition of

family resources should be accompanied by a consistent adjustment of the poverty threshold"

(Citro & Michael, 1995, p. 11), it would therefore be inappropriate to estimate poverty using the

Official Poverty Measure's thresholds. Instead, we upwardly adjust the thresholds to match the




                                                      13
12.5 percent Official Poverty Rate in 2007. 12 This is similar to the approach of Bane and Elwood

(1986), which was later adopted by Iceland (1997), Grieger, Schoeni, and Danziger (2009), and

others using the PSID to measure poverty. They found that the PSID also captured substantially

more income than the CPS, and increased poverty thresholds by 25 percent for their calculations

using PSID data, which resulted in similar poverty estimates to those from the Official Poverty

Measure.

         In doing so, the household-income poverty rate for taxable income in the CPS data that

produces a 12.5 percent poverty rate in 2007 is $20,994, as shown in Figure 2. This is slightly

below the $21,203 threshold used for the Official Poverty Measure in 2007. Were we to use the

same $20,994 poverty threshold to measure poverty in the IRS data (against the recommendation

of Citro & Michael, 1995), the greater levels of reported income would result in lower poverty

rates. In 2007, 11.9 percent of people would be considered in poverty based on taxable income

when including the imputed zero-income households (where the vertical CPS poverty threshold

crosses the dashed blue distribution line in Figure 2). Excluding the imputed zeros would be an

even lower 10.7 percent (where the CPS poverty threshold crosses the solid IRS distribution line).

Recognizing that poverty thresholds reflect a policy decision, rather than an objective amount, it

is not obvious whether better income reporting in the IRS should change the poverty rate in our

base year. 13 We take the approach that the poverty rate in the CPS data at the start of our analysis

period reflects policymakers views on poverty even if the CPS data measures taxable income



12
   In their initial discussion of poverty rates, the Council of Economic Advisers (1964) similarly indicated that
thresholds should be set in a manner consistent with the sources of income included. Our approach adopted here is
similar to the anchoring approach that Burkhauser et al. (2019) use to match poverty rates using broader income
definitions to the Official Poverty Rate in 1963, although we do so for 2007 which is the first year of our data.
13
   Suppose, for example, that the CPS data underreported income for individuals near the poverty threshold in all
years back to the 1960s when the War on Poverty began. In that case, based on the description of the initial poverty
thresholds from President Johnson's Council of Economic Advisers (1964), poverty thresholds would likely have
been higher to maintain the same poverty rate.

incompletely for low-income families. Hence, we use a pre-tax threshold of $21,884 (blue dotted

line in Figure 2), which maintains the same 12.5 percent 2007 poverty rate from the Official

Measure. 14

         The precise poverty thresholds for a family of four that preserve the 12.5 percent poverty

rate in 2007 are shown in Table 2. In that year, the Official Poverty Threshold was $21,203.

  Poverty trends without re-anchoring the thresholds are available in Appendix Figures A1 and A2. Between 2007
and 2018, the pre-tax income measures average 2.9 percentage points less than the Official Poverty Rate (1.4
percentage points when imputing zeros). The after-tax income measure average 4.4 percentage points less than the
Official Poverty Rate (3.0 percentage points when imputing zeros). In 2010, these gaps peak at 4.0 and 6.0
percentage points for pre-tax and after-tax income (2.3 and 4.3 percentage points when imputing zeros).

slightly higher poverty threshold to maintain the 12.5 percent poverty rate. Shifting from pre-tax

cash income to pre-tax taxable income (row 3), which removes all non-social insurance transfers,

results in the slightly lower $20,994 poverty threshold shown above in Figure 2.

        Row 4 uses the same household sharing unit and taxable income definitions as row 3, but

uses IRS data rather than the CPS. This increases the poverty threshold necessary to maintain the

12.5 percent poverty rate to $21,884. 15 The $890 (four percent) increase in the poverty threshold

needed to maintain the same poverty rate is due to additional income reporting in tax records data

relative to the CPS.

        For individuals near the poverty threshold, the combination of tax credits, including the

Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, frequently result in a net refund from income

taxes (nearly always for those claiming children and with earned income). Additionally, this refund

commonly exceeds payroll tax liabilities. Consequently, the after-tax household income for those

near the poverty threshold is above the pre-tax income, so to continue maintaining the 12.5 percent

poverty rate in 2007 when using after-tax data requires a further upward adjustment to the poverty

threshold. This can be seen in Row 5 of Table 2, which incorporates federal tax liabilities and

credits. Taken together, the after-tax household-income poverty threshold in 2007 that maintained

the same 12.5 percent poverty rate as in the official measure is $23,008. This is approximately

$1,800 above the 2007 Official Poverty Threshold. For years since 2007, we adjust these poverty

thresholds for inflation using the CPI-U. We recognize that the CPI-U likely overstates inflation

(see e.g. Meyer and Sullivan, 2012), although this is the inflation measure used for adjusting the

official poverty threshold over time so we use it here for consistency with this measure.



15
  Throughout this paper, we use the thresholds that maintains the 12.5 percent poverty rate in 2007 with the imputed
zero income households. Were we to use IRS data without the imputation of missing zero income households, the
threshold would be higher: $23,508 for pre-tax income and $24,500 for after-tax income in the IRS data.

Notes: The break in the official poverty rate reflects the change in the CPS questionnaire with a split sample partially
receiving the original questions, as described in Semega et al. (2019). For the after-tax IRS series, imputed zero pre-
tax incomes are also zero income after-tax.

                            Using these poverty thresholds, Figure 3 shows the trend in annual poverty rates for the

U.S. population using tax data compared to the trends observed in the CPS. As discussed above,

by construction the poverty rate in 2007 was 12.5 percent, matching the Official Poverty Rate.

Using the CPS data but switching to a pre-tax taxable income measure and tracking household

income, rather than family income, results in nearly the same poverty trend as that seen in the

official measure. In fact, this measure observed a 2018 poverty rate of 11.9 percent--almost the

same as the 11.8 percent poverty rate from the official measure. The similarity of these two CPS-

based trends indicates that while non-taxable income sources are important for households in

poverty (as evidenced by the change in the anchored poverty threshold when excluding them in




                                                                   17
Table 2), income receipt from these sources for those near the poverty threshold has not sufficiently

changed since 2007 to substantially affect poverty trends.

       Using tax data anchored to the 2007 Official Poverty Rate, we observe a similar level of

poverty in 2018 as the official measure (11.5 percent in the IRS data versus 11.8 percent) although

there were notable differences in the intervening years. We observe a smaller increase in poverty

during the Great Recession, but also a smaller decline in poverty in the years since the recession

ended. From 2007 through 2011, our tax-based poverty rate increased by 1.5 percentage points

from 12.5 percent to 14.0 percent. This is about three-fifths of the 2.5 percentage point increase in

poverty seen when using the same pre-tax household income definition in the CPS data over this

period. Conversely, from 2011 through 2018 our tax-based poverty rate fell by 2.5 percentage

points compared to a 3.1 percentage point decline seen in the CPS data during this period.

       A notable departure between the two series, however, is evident between 2009 and 2010.

In that year, the poverty rate for pre-tax household income in the CPS rose from 14.3 to 15.1

percent (and the Official Poverty Rate rose by a similar amount), while the poverty rate for a

matching income definition in the IRS data only rose from 13.4 to 13.6 percent, a fifth of the CPS

increase. About one-quarter of the divergence in this year appears to result from better coverage

of unemployment insurance benefits in IRS data in that year. While the IRS information return

totals from Form 1099-G, which we use as part of the income definition for non-filers, increased

from $140.5 billion in 2009 to $149.1 billion in 2010, the CPS observes a lower level of benefits

in all years and a decline from $98.7 billion in 2009 to $97.1 billion in 2010. When removing

unemployment insurance benefits from both the CPS and IRS income definitions, the poverty rate

increased in the IRS data by 0.3 percentage points in 2010 compared to a 0.8 percentage point

increase in the CPS data. Hence, the 0.7 percentage point growth in the gap between CPS and IRS



                                                 18
pre-tax poverty rates in that year shrinks by one-quarter (from 0.7 percentage points to 0.5

percentage points) once accounting for differences in unemployment insurance reporting.

         Comparing the pre-tax poverty rate and the after-tax poverty rate, the effect of taxes is

largest between 2009 and 2012. This likely reflects temporary tax reductions enacted during those

years. Larrimore, Burkhauser, and Armour (2015) summarize these tax provisions and show that

they increased after-tax median incomes. These results suggest that they also increased after-tax

incomes for those in or near poverty. 16 When measuring poverty in the tax data on an after-tax

basis, the 12.8 percent poverty rate in 2011 was just 0.3 percentage points above the poverty rate

in 2007 before the start of the recession. As temporary tax provisions enacted during the recession

expired, the pre-tax and after-tax poverty trends re-converged. The after-tax poverty rate was 1.2

percentage points below pre-tax poverty rate in 2009, but by 2018 it was only 0.4 percentage points

below.

         The divergent trends in the pre-tax and after-tax poverty lines during the Great Recession

and its aftermath is an indication of the importance of incorporating tax liabilities and tax credits

in our measure of poverty. Switching from a pre-tax to an after-tax poverty measure has a notable

effect on poverty trends during the recession, whereas removing non-taxable income sources does

not (comparing the two CPS-based lines). This suggests that the exclusion of tax credits from the

Official Poverty Measure is likely far more impactful for our understanding of poverty trends

(although not necessarily levels) than is missing non-taxable income from the tax-based poverty

measure.

   Our after-tax income definition excludes, however, the 2008 recovery payments that were distributed based on
information from tax returns. Including these amounts would cause a temporary decrease in poverty in 2008 at the
beginning of the Great Recession. While the tax code also provides an automatic stabilization effect for most
individuals, due to progressive income tax rates, this does not apply to those near the poverty threshold because
many have non-positive income tax burdens (Splinter, 2019) and for those in the phase-in ranges of tax credits there
can be an automatic destabilization effect (Larrimore, Mortenson, & Splinter, 2016).

                               Incorporating tax credits and liabilities also has implications for annual poverty rates by

age. Based on the Official Poverty Measure, the poverty rate among children is substantially higher

than among working-age or elderly adults. This observation is confirmed when looking at pre-tax

household income poverty rates in the tax records data. In 2018, for example, the pre-tax poverty

rate in the tax data is 17.0 percent for children under age 18, compared to 12.0 percent for working

age adults (ages 18 to 64) and 8.9 percent for elderly adults (Figure 4). These poverty rates by age

are similar to the official poverty rates by age, which in 2018 were 17.5 percent for children under

age 18, 11.2 percent for working-age adults, and 9.2 percent for elderly adults. 17


17
  Pre-tax poverty rates by age relative to the Official Poverty Measure are available in Appendix Figure A3. Note
that the poverty rates by age in the IRS data are substantially closer to the Official Poverty Rates by age than they
are to the pre-tax taxable household income poverty rates in CPS data. However, the standard household size
adjustment we use does not account for age, whereas the Official Poverty Measure uses a lower threshold for the

                                                                       20
        This gap in poverty rates across age cohorts shrinks after including taxes and tax credits.

Shifting from pre-tax to after-tax income lowers the 2018 poverty rates for children from 17.0

percent to 14.1 percent. Conversely, pre-tax and after-tax poverty rates are nearly the same for

working-age adults and the after-tax poverty rates are slightly higher for the elderly. Consequently,

while after-tax child poverty remains above that seen for older age groups, incorporating the effects

of the tax system reduces the spread in poverty rates across age groups. This is consistent with the

Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credits targeting households with children.


B. Poverty Persistence in IRS Data

        In addition to better incorporating tax credits and tax liabilities into poverty estimates, the

Tax Household Data is particularly advantageous for tracking transitions into and out of poverty.

This is because tax records provide a naturally occurring population-level panel, so nearly all

individuals in the data are observed year-after-year if they remain within the United States. Given

the importance of tax credits in mitigating poverty during the Great Recession (seen in the previous

section), in all subsequent results we use after-tax income as our measure of income.

        Figure 5 shows the share of people who are in poverty in a base year (e.g., 2007) that are

in poverty in subsequent years. Recognizing that people who at least occasionally struggle with

poverty over an extended period may have annual incomes above the poverty threshold in certain

years, we do not require poverty spells to be continuous. Instead, reflecting Stevens' (1999)

recommendation to focus on "person-centric" rather than "spell-centric" measures, we start with

the share of individuals in poverty in the base year and ask what share are poor in each subsequent


elderly. Comparing anchored pre-tax taxable household income poverty rates across the two datasets (without the
age adjustment used for the OPM thresholds), we observe 29 percent fewer elderly people in poverty in the IRS data
in 2018 (8.9 percent in the IRS data vs. 12.6 percent in the CPS). For comparison, Bee and Mitchell (2017) observe
24 percent fewer elderly people in poverty using matched administrative-survey data than they observe using survey
data alone (6.9 percent versus 9.1 percent).

year, even if they were not in poverty for one or more intervening years. For example, if someone

is in poverty in 2007, not in poverty in 2008, but returns to poverty in 2009, we include them as

part of the share in poverty in 2007 and 2009, but not 2008.

                                 When tracking persistence of poverty, we cannot use the cross-sectional approach to impute

zeros. This is because an individual may not appear in tax data either because they have zero

income or because they were not living in the United States at the time. Consequently, here and in

subsequent figures we exclude from the calculations individuals who do not appear in the tax data

in a given year, either because they died, emigrated, or did not appear on any tax forms in that




                                                                                22
year. 18 We acknowledge, however, that doing so excludes from persistence estimates those

individuals who have no household income in one or more years.

         The persistence of poverty is remarkably similar when considering different years of the

business cycle. For those in poverty in 2007, the top of the economic expansion, 57 percent were

in poverty one year later and 31 percent were in poverty 8 years later--although this can include

intervening years where they were not poor. For those in poverty in 2009, the depth of the Great

Recession, 56 percent were in poverty one year later and 30 percent were in poverty 8 years later.

Similar patterns of poverty persistence are also seen for 2011 and 2013. We emphasize, however,

that this does not necessarily mean that nearly 40 percent of spells only last one year since the base

year of this analysis will frequently be in the middle of a poverty spell (Bane & Elwell, 1986).

Given the robustness of these persistence patterns by starting year, in subsequent analysis we only

consider those in poverty in 2007 or 2008, the first years of our data, to show the longest trend

possible (estimates for other initial years are available in the online data).

         Poverty persistence among those who spend at least one year in poverty differs greatly by

age. While the poverty rate in 2007 was highest among young adults aged 18­24 (16.0 percent),

this age group had the least persistent poverty (Figure 6). Just under fifty percent of young adults

in poverty in 2007 remained in poverty one year later and a smaller 31 percent were in poverty

four years later (although they were not necessarily in poverty during the interim years). This is

consistent with substantial life transitions occurring during these ages, as many poor young adults

are students who exit poverty upon entering the full-time workforce. Nevertheless, even among


18
   This approach is broadly consistent with the treatment of non-respondents in panel-based survey data considering
similar questions. An alternate approach is to assume that individuals are in poverty if they are alive in a given year
(based on showing up in the initial 2007 tax files and not subsequently appearing in the Death Master File) and have
no associated tax records. However, according to estimates from the Social Security Administration (2019), between
2010 and 2018 an average of 582,000 people emigrated each year from the United States, of whom 267,000 were
citizens or lawful permanent residents (LPRs). Consequently, this approach would treat all emigrants as in poverty
and will overstate poverty persistence.

young adults there is a sizeable minority who appear to experience persistent poverty for extended

periods, as one out of five people in this age range who were in poverty in 2007 were also in

poverty ten years later.

                                                                In contrast to young adults, annual poverty rates are the lowest among elderly adults over

age 65 and poverty is the most persistent. Approximately 9.5 percent of elderly adults were in

poverty in the tax data in 2007. Seventy-three percent of them remained in poverty one year later

and 62 percent remained in poverty four years later. This high persistence of poverty among the

elderly is consistent with many living on fixed income sources.

Notes: For each year, missing observations (due to death, emigration, or a lack of tax records) and imputed zeros are

thresholds. "Independent of spell start and end" is the non-spell approach of Figures 5 and 6.



        One reason for the relatively high persistence rates seen in Figures 5 and 6 is that some

people who escape poverty will, in future years, fall back into poverty. This is apparent in Figure

7, which displays continuous poverty spells (dashed blue line) along with the share of people who

are (non-continuously) in poverty in later years as presented in Figure 5 (solid red line). While

approximately half of people in poverty in 2008 were also in poverty in 2010 (including those not

in poverty in 2009), roughly one-third were in a continuous poverty spell over the three years.




                                                                             25
Similarly, while approximately one-quarter of people in poverty in 2008 were also in poverty 10

years later, roughly one in twenty were in a continuous poverty spell in all 11 years through 2018.19

          Of course, when considering the length of the poverty spell, some in poverty in 2008 are

at the middle, rather than the beginning, of a poverty spell. We therefore also consider the full

duration of poverty spells by considering only those who entered poverty in 2008 after being out

of poverty in 2007 (solid black line). When doing so, we observe that continuous poverty spells

that just began are shortest. Only one-quarter of spells that started in 2008 lasted two years and

only two percent lasted through 2018.

          Given that some people cycle in and out of poverty, our preferred approach to track chronic

poverty is to consider the number of years people spend in poverty over a period. This approach

reflects that a one-year exit from poverty does not mean that the individual is permanently non-

poor, while also acknowledging that re-entering poverty years later for a single year is far different

than spending many years in poverty. In Table 3, we find that of those in poverty in 2007, four out

of five spent at least one additional year in poverty and nine percent were in poverty for at least 10

of the 12 years in this period. 20 On average, people in poverty in 2007 spent 4.5 out of the 12 years

between 2007 and 2018 in poverty. One-third of this group was in poverty for at least half of the

period.

          Consistent with the previous persistence results by age, the number of years spent in

poverty differs for the young and old. On average, individuals aged 18 to 24 had the least persistent

poverty, spending an average of 3.9 years in poverty between 2007 and 2018 (conditional on being


19
   We focus on 2008, rather than 2007, as the base year in this figure to ensure we are considering spells that started
in 2008. Were we to start in 2007, we could not distinguish between people who have newly started spells and those

   Since this measure tracks the number of years in poverty for individuals, rather than the share who are poor in any
given year, individuals who do not appear in the data for one or more years are not counted as poor in those years.
Consequently, to the extent that individuals are poor (not poor) in years that they do not appear in the data, these
statistics slightly understate (overstate) the true level of poverty persistence.

in poverty in 2007). Young adults have lower rates of persistent poverty because they are less likely

to end up in the right tail of the years-in-poverty distribution. Young adults are more likely to spend

2 to 5 years in poverty than are older age cohorts, but less likely to experience poverty for 10 or

more years of the 12-year period. However, apart from children, the share of individuals for whom

2007 was their only year in poverty does not vary much across age ranges.

C. Multi-Year Frequency of Poverty in IRS Data

        In addition to the persistence of poverty, we are also interested in the share of people ever

experiencing poverty. We do so by considering the share of people who spend at least one year in

poverty over the 12-year period from 2007 to 2018. This approach, which has long been used in

the survey-based literature on poverty dynamics, provides an intuitive measure (Coe, 1978;

Rainwater, 1982; Gottschalk & Danziger, 1993; Cellini, McKernan, & Ratcliffe, 2008).

        The share of individuals who experience poverty at least once over these dozen years is

substantially higher than the share in poverty in any given year. Over the 12-year period from 2007

through 2018, 42 percent of people were in poverty for at least one year (Table 4). 21,22 On average,


21
   This includes all individuals who appear in the dataset for at least one year from 2007 through 2018. Among those
observed in all 12 years, a lower 30 percent spent at least one year in poverty. This alternate sample construction
necessarily results in a sample with fewer children (since they must have been born by 2007), fewer elderly
individuals (since they must not have died prior to 2018), no individuals who had years without any records
submitted to the IRS, and no new immigrants or emigrants over this period.
22
   These results are based on an entire year of income, reflecting the annual nature of IRS income reporting. If
measured on a monthly level, the frequency of ever experiencing poverty would likely be even higher. For example,
Proctor, Semega, and Kollar (2016) estimated that 35 percent of individuals were in poverty for at least two months

                                                        28
those who are poor at any point during the 12-year period spend three years during the period in

poverty. This is lower than the average years in poverty seen among those who were poor in 2007

because focusing on people who are poor in any single year increases the weight given to longer

spells of poverty (Cellini, McKernan, & Ratcliffe, 2008).

        Consistent with both the higher rates of annual poverty among children and young adults,

and the lower rates of poverty persistence among young adults, higher shares of children and young

adults are in poverty for at least one year over the 12-year period relative to older adults. There are

also substantial differences in the likelihood of ever experiencing poverty by marital and parental

status. Among people living in single-parent households in 2007, 57 percent spent at least one year

in poverty between 2007 and 2018. This exceeds the poverty rates for those living in households

without children or in households with one or more married couples.


IV.     Conclusion
        This paper provides insight into poverty trends and persistence of poverty among U.S.

households since the Great Recession. We construct a new panel of households using the

population of individual income tax returns and information returns. These data extend the

usefulness of tax data to the bottom tail of the income distribution, which had previously been

neglected due to the high prevalence of non-filing (almost 15 percent of adults) and the inability

to link non-filers and tax units into households. We produce tax-based estimates of poverty trends

from 2007 through 2018, taking advantage of the high-quality income reporting in the tax data and

the accurate reporting of tax liabilities and credits. Additionally, utilizing of the panel nature of

these data, we estimate the individual-level persistence of poverty over this period.



between 2009 and 2012, which is similar to the 42 percent experiencing poverty over 12 years that we observe.
Meanwhile, they observe that only 3 percent of people were in poverty every month for the entire four years.



                                                       29
       When looking at annual poverty rates, the household-level tax data confirm observations

from the CPS that poverty rates based on pre-tax income are substantially higher for children than

for older age cohorts. On an after-tax basis, while poverty rates remain higher for children, the

age-gap closes substantially. This reflects the substantial child-based tax credits available,

including the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit. Moreover, we find that federal tax

policy mitigated nearly all of the increase in pre-tax poverty during the Great Recession.

       We also observe that despite the onset of the Great Recession in 2008, there remained high

rates of mobility out of (and into) poverty in that year. Of people who were in poverty in 2007,

more than 40 percent were no longer below the poverty line the following year. This transition rate

out of poverty is nearly the same as the rate of transition out of poverty in subsequent years,

indicating that the Great Recession did not dramatically change the likelihood that those in poverty

in one year would exit poverty the next year.

       Recognizing that many people move in and out of poverty each year, the share of people

in poverty at any point over several years far exceeds the share in poverty in any single year. While

annual after-tax poverty rates range from about 11 to 13 percent, three to four times more people

(42 percent) spent at least one year between 2007 and 2018 in poverty. Those who were poor at

any point during this 12-year period spent an average of 3 years in poverty during this time. The

share who were poor at any point between 2007 and 2018 varies by demographic characteristics.

One-quarter of people living in married households with no children in 2007 were ever in poverty

during this period, while over half of those living in single-parent households spent at least one

year in poverty.

       While many people experience transitory poverty, we also find high rates of more persistent

poverty. Of those who were in poverty in 2007, almost one-third of those in poverty in 2007 were

also in poverty eight years later, and over one-fourth were in poverty ten years later--although



                                                 30
they may have escaped poverty for one or more years in between. Hence, many who experience

poverty either spend several consecutive years in poverty or escape poverty only to fall back into

it in a future year. Consequently, while there are substantial benefits to policies that alleviate

economic hardships from short transitory poverty spells, many individuals still experience chronic

poverty over many years.

Data Appendix

A.I. Sample Construction
This appendix describes the sample construction and income definitions. The data used in this
paper is based on the Tax Household Data, whose target population is the annual resident
population of the U.S. Currently, these data are available from 2007 to 2018. Because these are
population-level files (not samples), individuals can be linked over time (even if they move
between households). Individuals not in the data in all years might enter the data because they are
born, immigrate to the United States, or have a tax record for the first time. Similarly, individuals
might exit the panel due to death, emigration, or not having a tax record in a given year. Birth
(death) and immigration (emigration) are much more likely causes for entrance (exit) than a first-
time tax record. For example, Cilke (2014) and others find that roughly 99 percent of all individuals
appear on a tax filing in a given year.
However, we make different adjustments based on our estimate of the reason an individual entered
(exited). If the cause was birth (death), we do not adjust, and the panel is naturally unbalanced to
remain representative of the U.S. population in a given year (which also has births and deaths).
However, we make a special adjustment for individuals entering (exiting) the United States. To
identify individuals missing in a given year because they are non-residents, we append non-
resident individuals that are observed in the tax data, including excluded dependents with
Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs). Note that all non-residents are removed for
the analysis in this paper. For each year, we then extract an individual-level sample based on the
last four digits of Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN), mostly Social Security Numbers. This
is a standard approach for selecting a random sample of individuals in the tax data. Our sample
includes 100 of 9,999 of these TIN endings, as none end in all zeros, resulting in a 1 percent sample
that includes about 3 million individuals each year. These samples include household level income
sources and some individual and household level characteristics.
Pre-tax income is mostly defined as in Larrimore, Mortenson, and Splinter (2019):
       For annual tax returns, this definition starts with the total income from line 22 of IRS Form 1040--
       which includes income from wages, salaries, taxable interest, dividends, alimony, business income,
       rents and royalties, taxable Social Security, taxable private retirement income, and unemployment
       compensation. Five adjustments are made to this income from the Form 1040: (1) non-taxable
       interest reported on Form 1040 is added, (2) realized capital gains (from Schedule D) are removed,
       (3) taxable Social Security benefits are replaced by total Social Security benefits reported on Form
       SSA-1099, (4) taxable private retirement income is replaced with gross private retirement income,
       which reflects retirement savings distributions less rollovers from Forms 5498 and 1099-R, and (5)
       incomes are bottom-coded at zero to limit the effect of business losses. This income measure is
       broader than the tax return income definition used by Piketty and Saez (2003), since it includes
       Social Security income and unemployment compensation. It also comes as close as possible to the
       pretax income measure from the CPS and used by the Census Bureau for their official income
       statistics. The primary difference between our income measure and the income measures used by
       the Census Bureau for their official income statistics is that we are not able to observe nontaxable
       cash transfer income such as public assistance and supplemental security income...these non-


                                                   39
       taxable cash transfers represent approximately 2.5 percent of income reported by the Census
       Bureau...
       For non-filers, pre-tax cash income is calculated as the sum of income reported on information
       returns that would be included in the income definition for filers were they to file a tax return.
       Following Mortenson et al. (2009), who also derive income for non-filers based on information
       returns, we include income from wages and salaries reported on Form W-2, unemployment benefits
       from Form 1099-G, Social Security and disability benefits from Form SSA-1099, interest income
       from Form 1099-INT, dividends from Form 1099-DIV, gross private retirement income as
       retirement savings distributions less rollovers from Forms 5498 and 1099-R, and self-employment
       income from Form 1099-MISC...However, for Form 1099-MISC we offset reported income by 70
       percent to reflect that gross income from self-employment activities appear on the 1099-MISC
       information returns but the associated business expenses do not. This offset is necessary to convert
       gross self-employment income to net self-employment income.

We broaden the income sources for non-filers, adding income from Forms 1099-K (reduced by 70
percent to convert to net income and excluded if net greater than $10,000) and Schedule K-1 for
Forms 1065 and 1120S to capture partnership and S-corporation shares of income, as well as
accounting for unemployment income excluded from 2009 tax returns.
After-tax income deducts federal individual income tax and deducts federal payroll taxes. Federal
refundable credits are added, including the EITC, the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), and
small amounts of other refundable credits (excluding 2008 recovery payments). Income taxes for
filers are the total tax amount (line 60 on the 2010 Form 1040) less self-employment taxes and for
non-filers the amounts withheld on Forms W-2 and 1099-MISC. Federal payroll taxes include
Social Security and Medicare taxes withheld on Form W-2 and self-employment taxes less excess
Social Security taxes withheld as reported on Form 1040.
