                                         ABSTRACT

At some point in the first half of the 19th century per capita GDP in the United Kingdom and the
United States began to grow at something like one to two percent per year and have continued to
do so up to the present. Now incomes in many economies routinely grow at 2 percent per year
and some grow at much higher “catch-up” rates. These events surely represent a historical
watershed, separating a traditional world in which incomes of ordinary working people remained
low and fairly stable over the centuries from a modern world where incomes increase for every
new generation. This paper uses Gary Becker’s theory of a “quantity/quality trade-off,” consistent
both with Malthusian population dynamics (quantity) and with demographic transition (quality),
to identify a limited set of forces that were central to this revolution.

         The characteristic which distinguishes the modern period in world his-
      tory from all past periods is the fact of economic growth. It began in
      western Europe and spread first to the overseas countries settled from
      Europe....For the first time in human history it was possible to envisage a
      sustained increase in the volume of goods and services produced per unit
      of human eﬀort or per unit of accessible resources.
              W.A. Cole and Phyllis Deane, introductory essay in the 1966 Cam-
      bridge Economic History of Europe.


   At some point in the first half of the 19th century average real incomes–per capita
GDP–in the United Kingdom and the United States began to grow at something
like one to two percent per year and have continued to do so up to the present. Two
percent growth means real incomes that multiply 7-fold every century. It does not
take very good data to see that nothing like this could ever have been seen before
the 19th century. Now incomes in many economies routinely grow at 2 percent per
year and some grow at much higher rates. But these “catch-up” economies eventually
slow down and so far no economy has attained income levels that surpass the current
levels of the original English speaking countries.
  These events surely represent a historical watershed, separating a traditional world
in which incomes of ordinary working people remained low and fairly stable over the
centuries from a modern world where incomes increase for every new generation. I
will take these facts as a definition of the Industrial Revolution and try to think about
the choices in individual behavior that brought these changes about.
  It will be useful to begin with two sets of figures. The first of these–Figures 1-
3–illustrate the universal decline of what Theodore Schultz (1974) called traditional
agriculture. The second–Figures 4-9–illustrate the demographic transition: the fact
that the onset of productivity growth in a country initially leads to larger families

                                           2
and population growth, followed by reduced fertility and smaller families.
  Figure 1 is a cross-section of 112 countries, plotting the fraction of the labor force
engaged in agriculture in each against that country’s per capita GDP. These data
are World Bank numbers for 1980. The income figures are in logs: 6 means $400
1990 U.S. dollars and 10 means $22,000. Almost the same figure can be obtained for
other years, except that with each increase in a year most countries will have moved
down the curve, away from agriculture and with increased GDP. We should think of
the people in the large agriculture sectors–80 or 90 percent of the work force–as
largely illiterate, living on subsistence incomes, using the methods employed by their
grandparents.
  Figures 2 and 3 show time series for four countries. Figure 2 plots the fraction
of workers in agriculture against calendar time. The data are from Kuznets’ (1971)
monograph, which I have updated to 2004, using the 2004 Pocket World in Figures
put out by the Economist magazine. In Figure 3 I replace calendar time with the
corresponding income figures from Maddison, so that Figure 3 is in the same units
as Figure 1. Thus calendar time is absent from Figures 1 and 3. One can see that
the cross-section of countries in 1980 also closely matches the time-series over two
centuries in a selection of four countries.
  The poorest countries in the 1980 cross-sections are about exp(64) = $600 U.S.
1990 per capita per year. The U.S. in 1810 was about exp(66) = $735 U.S. 1990.
These are averages of rich and poor, so working people in the 18th century must have
averaged something like $500 or $550. These figures require a good deal of guess work,
but the term “subsistence” is hard to avoid. Modern national product accounting
involves many subtleties but in 1800, even in the richest countries, for most people
income was a matter of having enough food to keep oneself alive and bring up a family.
This is also the case for many people in Africa and South Asia today. At the rich end
of the figures, the fitted curve begins to flatten out. The successful economies have

two percent or less of their labor force in agriculture yet many of these are exporters
of agricultural goods. These economies have settled down to or capita growth rates
of 1.5 or 2 percent annually.
  Figures 1-3 do not show population growth, but we know that human population
has grown quite steadily and expanded geographically since pre-historic times. Popu-
lation growth as a whole has changed dramatically during the industrial revolution–
just as Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo would have predicted–but it is a more
puzzling fact that in the wealthier economies population growth has been declining.
These economies have gone through a “demographic transition.” Figures 4-9, all based
on the Maddison data, are time-series plots of population and production per person
superimposed.2 Figure 4 shows the demographic transition in full steam in the U.K.
in the first half of the 19th century and possibly visible earlier. For France, the timing
is similar but the transition was more sudden. For the U.S. one can see a mixture
of the transition combined with a large immigrant flow. For Japan, both sustained
growth and the transition came much later. For Mexico, the transition came as late
as the 1960s, if then. For the data from Nigeria, beginning with independence, it is
hard to see anything but Malthusian growth.
  The processes illustrated in these figures–the onset of sustained growth following
centuries of subsistence labor, the gradual migration away from traditional agriculture
toward urban living and working, the demographic transition–are all at the center
of the industrial revolution. And all of them are still underway.
  What were the decisions taken by individual families that led to these changes?
What motivated these decisions? There are surely many ways to approach these broad
questions but I will begin with Gary Becker’s idea of a “quantity/quality tradeoﬀ” in
fertility. Becker first addressed the fertility decision in a (1960) paper that accepted
the view that more children are desirable, other things equal, but then added a second

dimension that he called child quality to account for the fact that increases in wealth
are sometimes associated with smaller family sizes. This original application was de-
signed to account for cross-sectional evidence, but over the years the quantity/quality
idea has been developed in many directions, including time series. Important later
developments include Becker and Lewis (1974), Becker and Barro (1988), Barro and
Becker (1989), and Becker, Murphy and Tamura (1990). The more recent of these
papers are directly focused on the demographic transition. I do not see how any
account of the industrial revolution can succeed without including some form of this
two-dimensional quantity/quality tradeoﬀ.
  My strategy for this paper will be built on the observed correlation of sustained
growth and the decline of traditional agriculture. Section 1 outlines a Malthusian
model of an economy without sustained growth, with a quantity-quality tradeoﬀ that
is based most closely on the joint work by Becker and Barro. Many of the details are
taken from Lucas (2002). Sections 2 and 3 then describe a pure human capital model
which encompasses both stagnation and sustained growth as possibilities.
  I will treat these two model types as though they existed in separate, unrelated
worlds. This is a device–certainly artificial–to establish some important features
of both stagnation and sustained growth at their simplest levels. In Sections 4 and
5 I put the pieces together by admitting migration of labor between the two worlds.
Again there are many possibilities. In Section 4 some of the illiterate farm workers
move to the city and work as servants to the increasingly wealthy urban population.
In Section 5 farm workers invest in enough schooling for their children who then
migrate and join the urban population as equals. Section 6 discusses some of the
implications of these two models and others.

  1. A Quantity/Quality Tradeoﬀ: Traditional
  Modern growth theory has mostly followed Robert Solow (1956) in treating fertility


                                          5
and population as externally fixed features of the environment. This simplification
has facilitated progress in many directions, but it obviously will not help in under-
standing the demographic transition. For the classical economists–notably Adam
Smith, Thomas Malthus, and David Ricardo–fertility decisions and population were
central to explaining production and incomes. For my purposes, Ricardo’s work is a
good place to start.
  In each of the examples below, I begin with the fertility decision of a newly-formed
family, endowed with a stream of resources . The parents value three things: the
goods they consume themselves, the number of children they will have, and the re-
sources (if any) that they pass on to their children. We can express this as a Bellman
equation
                                  () = max  (   ())
                                           

based on the recursive assumption that parents value resources passed on to each of
their children as they value their own.3 As in Becker’s (1960) original formulation,
this family values both “quantity”  and “quality”  per child. The Bellman
approach is based on Becker and Barro (1988). This general set-up has a lot of
possibilities, depending on the family’s abilities to transfer goods  to their children.
In illustrations below, I will use the more specific log-linear preferences

                                   () = max 1−   ()                                 (1.1)
                                            

  Suppose, to begin with, that this family is part of a hunter-gatherer economy
without ownership of land or anything else, so there is nothing tangible to pass on to
the children. The family has available  units of a non-storable consumption good,
which it divides into  units of children’s goods and  units of adult consumption:

                                             +  ≤                                         (1.2)

      Of course there are enormous diﬀerences in many aspects of family life that are abstracted from
here. See Clark and Cummins (2016).

The child-raising cost  is taken as given. This family will choose the fertility level 

These parents take pleasure in their children and are happier the larger is the utility
level  per child, but in this society there is nothing they can do that aﬀects the well-
being of their children beyond the basic child-raising cost . The first order condition
for this problem thus implies
                                               
                                      =                                           (1.3)
                                           1−+
  To get the equilibrium of the economy as a whole we add the assumption that
total available goods,  when the population is , is a Cobb-Douglas function of
population  and the richness of the hunting territory, :

                                    =   1−                                  (1.4)

If all families are treated equally, (1.3) and (1.4) together imply
                                                  µ ¶

                                      1−+  
Since at any date ,  = +1  (1.3) implies the dynamics
                                              1−

                                       1−+ 
Population thus converges for any initial size 0 to the constant level

and at this level per capita income is given by

                                           1−+
  Note that none of the production-side parameters   and  appear in this steady
state expression for . If the available land  were to double so would the population,

                                             7
though this would take some time. This is the most basic form of the Malthusian
model.
  As a second example, consider a settled agriculture economy in which land is pri-
vately owned. Preferences remain as in (1.1). Each household now has  units of
privately owned land (not goods) and one unit of labor. Land and labor can be
combined to produce the consumption good, according to the production function
() =  . Each child requires  units of goods, so

                                       +  ≤                                 (1.6)

Each family allocates an equal share of land to each child.
  These assumptions lead to the Bellman equation

                                                       
                         () = max ( − )1−  ( )                         (1.7)
                                                      

where () is the adult utility of a family with land holdings  that behaves optimally.
It can be shown that (1.7) has the unique solution

                                           −   
                                 =                                              (1.8)
                                         1−+ 

(Of course all this makes sense only if   ) Note that the fertility function
(1.8) implies lower fertility at each income level than does the function (1.5) for the
hunter-gatherer economy. The private ownership of non-labor resources–land, in this
case–permits adults to aﬀect the utility () of their children. They understand
that increases in  dilute the bequests to each child. Here the quantity-quality tradeoﬀ
is made explicit as a parental choice.
  Now consider equilibrium in an economy with  units of land and  such families,
each with  =  units of land. In this economy, the implied the populaton
dynamics are
                                        −    1−

                                            8
In the steady-state to which (1.9) converges, population is
                                     µ               ¶1

                                         1−+ 

Additional land or technologies that enhance productivity induce proportional pop-
ulation increases but have no other long run eﬀects.
  I think these two models, the hunter-gatherers and the land owners, pretty well
cover the possibilities of traditional societies. The situation of hunter-gatherers car-
ries over to any family without land to pass on to its children. The models encom-
pass egalitarian societies of family farms as well as the vastly unequal Egypt of the
Pharoahs and many possibilities in between. There are, of course, enormous dif-
ferences among these societies but all share the common feature that increases in
the available land or exogenous technical progress that makes land more productive
ultimately result in population growth alone.
  This is not a model of a species breeding itself into starvation or extinction. It
describes a population settling down to a sustainable steady state, determined by
available resources on the one hand and standards of child care on the other. The
predicted zero population growth does not rest on the availability of modern contra-
ceptive technology. The model applies to traditional human societies, and indeed is
routinely and successfully applied to animal populations every day.
  Ricardo put this striking prediction at the center of classical economics. It places
the determination of the living standards of working people–the real wage, if you
like–entirely on the standards people have about child raising, on what they accept as
“subsistence.” Once these attitudes are set, no improvement in technology or resources
will improve living standards: Only the population reacts to such changes.
  The Malthusian prediction that populations will vary in proportion to available
resources but that living standards will not was successful empirical social science.
Pre-industrial societies in the lush environments of Java or South China had about

                                            9
the same average living standards as societies on the fringes of the Sahara desert or
the Arctic ocean, and this continues to be largely the case for traditional agricultural
societies today. The per capita income estimates reported for 1700 by Maddison
range from about $1000 for western Europe to $500 for the rest of the world, and
this factor of two diﬀerence is at the high end of available figures. Compared to the
cross-economy income inequality we see today, these diﬀerences are minor.

  2. A Human Capital Economy
  What have we learned since Ricardo’s time that helps us understand the onset
of sustained growth in living standards? We now have a theory of physical capital
which serves as a centerpiece of most growth theories. This is a big step forward but
as Solow showed in 1956, diminishing returns prevents physical capital accumulation
from generating sustained growth by itself. The substantial growth residual has been
called technology, total factor productivity, and human capital. Some economists
view these terms as describing distinct forces, operating in concert, but to me they
are just diﬀerent labels for the same thing. I will include them all under the term
human capital because it invites inquiry into the actions of individual people that
bring about increases in productivity.
  Who inhabits this human capital economy? Here we focus on educated, literate
people, urban, possibly landless, living in cities. Scientists, of course, but this group is
much too narrow. Think of terms like bourgeoisie, intelligentsia, traders, merchants,
middlemen: the people we read about in Landes (1969), Mokyr (1990, 2016), Greif
(2006), Botticini and Eckstein (2012), McCloskey (2016), others. Where did these
people come from and how did they create an ongoing revolution? Something beyond
new technology is needed to account for this. We need an explanation of what went
wrong with the theory of fertility that had worked so well over earlier centuries.4

      See for example E.A. Wrigley (2004).



                                             10
  The increased spending of high income families on children that stimulated Becker’s
(1960) paper was not limited to, or even primarily focused on, bequests of land or
other tangible capital. The “quality” aspect of spending on children also involves
education and other forms of investment in human capital. But in contrast to the
straightfoward inheritance of land or other given resources in the previous examples,
a bequest of human capital can take many forms and the returns it yields can vary
depending on the actions of others.
  In this section I will develop a model of individual earnings, dividing agents’ time
into the usual categories of schooling and on-the-job learning. A distinctive feature
of the model, as of reality, is the social character of work and creativity. The higher
the skill levels of the people around you the more you improve your own skills. In
this section all of the discoveries, new technology, anything that aﬀects anyone’s
productivity are assumed to result from some individual’s on-the-job activity. Growth
is generated only through the stimulus of others.
  We begin by describing a very diﬀerent environment from the land-based world
described in the last section. Think of a city consisting of agents who produce con-
sumption goods with labor only. (Throughout this section and the next we set land
wealth aside.) Identify each agent by the triple (  ) where  is his skill or produc-
tivity,  is his age, and  is calendar time. Let (  ) be the fraction of agents at a
given date  who are of age  and have skill less than  Assume a constant demogra-
phy, where pdf () denotes the number of people of age . It will be convenient to
assume that the cdf  has the Frechet distribution
                                            ¡               ¢
                            (  ) = exp −( ) −1                          (2.1)

where ( ) is an endogenous location parameter that traces changes in skill levels
and  is a constant that measures both the variance of skill levels and the size of the
Pareto tail.

                                            11
  There is a learning technology: each agent continuously meets others at a rate
(), where  is years of schooling. At each meeting an agent compares his own
productivity  to the productivity  0 of person he meets and emerges with max(  0 ).
An agent of age  has been meeting others throughout his working years  = ( )
and at each date along the way he meets other working people of all ages with equal
probability. An agent begins at  =  with no knowledge at all. Schooling enables
him to learn from others who are already working at a rate (). His knowledge by
age  ≥  is then given by
                                       Z  µZ      ∞                                        ¶

                                              

The inner bracket describes the best match at each age  and the outer bracket sums
up the best match over the career to date.5 . Combining (2.1) and (2.2) and cancelling
the terms  −1 gives
                                       Z  µZ       ∞                             ¶

  In this context, consider a balanced growth path (BGP) along which all quantiles
grow at a common, constant rate  to be determined. In this case ( ) takes the
form
                                            ( ) = ()

for some () and in place of (2.3) we have

Integrating both sides against 0 () and cancelling gives

  One solution  for (2.5) is  = 0, which implies stagnation. The right side of (2.5)
is concave in  so there is a second solution that can be either negative or positive.
(See Figure 10.) In the case   0 zero is the only steady state. In the case   0,
stagnation and sustained growth are both solutions. For positive growth we need
                                        Z ∞
                          ()

Sustained growth requires some combination of a high frequency of search, (), or
a high level of longevity. The learning process involves young learning from elders. It
is limited by low schooling levels, early death, or retirement.6
  The distinctive feature of this model is the social character of work and creativ-
ity: learning from others. The role of schooling here serves only to prepare people
for actual work, improving their ability to process new ideas. The class of literate
merchants, traders, shippers–the “bourgeosie”–can co-exist with either traditional
Malthusian societies or with modern, sustained growth societies. The model here
thus admits both stagnation and growth as possible equililibria. It has the feature–
promising for understanding the industrial revolution–that small or gradual changes
in individual behavior can transform a stagnating economy into an economy of sus-
tained growth.

  3. A Schooling Choice Problem
  To this point we have specified a role for schooling but we have not given parents any
control over the schooling their children receive. Now we introduce a quantity/quality
tradeoﬀ for urban parents that is analogous to the land-owning parents described in
Section 1. Instead of a decision on the number of children  and the land  each child
inherits, the urban parent chooses  and a schooling level  for his children. Just
as in Section 1 we assume that parents have exactly one choice to make per lifetime,
  6
      A similar theoretical connection of growth rates and longevity can be traced back to Ehrlich
and Lui (1991) and Ehrlich and Kim (2014).

                                                13
a single quantity/quality choice that determines the number of children they have
and the utility level available to each child. We restrict the analysis to a balanced
growth path where everyone has a common schooling level  That is, we maintain
the assumption that (2.5) holds for some . Within this framework we will spell out
the options parents have, the choices they make, and the implications for equilibrium.
  Suppose that each child born at calendar date  and with  years of schooling will
have the expected present value

We maintain the assumptions of balanced growth and a Frechet distribution with
parameter  On a BGP, income grows at rate  and everything else is constant, so
the expected present value of the earnings stream is

 The next generation’s goods production capacity relative to their parents’ is  ,
which adds  to parents’ utility.
  The Bellman equation for this problem can be written in logs as

                      log () = (1 − ) log(() − ) + 

Along the BGP,  =  and the first order conditions imply that  and  must satisfy

                                        ()    

  Here  (·) (and thus 0 (·)) is a given function that describes the eﬀect of schooling
 on a person’s ability to learn from others. If, for example, () takes the form
  , where  and  are known parameters, the optimal schooling level is

                                            − 
                                      =           
                                             

A higher level  or  means increased benefit from schooling on the margin and a
higher  means higher opportunity cost of schooling. The constant implied fertility
rate on the BGP, which can be on either side of one, is

                                              

                                       (1 + ) ( − )

Here we need to assume that    The product of altruism  toward children,
quality  of interaction with others, and eﬃcacy  of schooling must be enough to

                                            15
override the desire  for more children. In practice, child quality involves not simply
a wish for better life for children but also an environment that enables a parent to
bring this about.

  4 . Migration dynamics - 1
  We have set out descriptions of two distinct economies: a land-based Malthusian
economy with landless people living at subsistence levels, and a human capital-based
economy, undergoing sustained productivity growth at a constant rate. Now we will
view these types–an urban population  at , and an unskilled rural population
  –as co-existing in the same economy. The dynamics will involve migration from
the rural to the urban economy and the fertility choices of each type. We need to
spell out what the options are for agents of each type.
  Assume to begin with that  =  (a constant, assuming  = 1 and no new
entry) and that productivity in the urban sector grows as in the last section

                                        () = 0 () 

We next modify the utility function of urban people to include a demand for low-
skilled services and let rural people migrate to the city. Retaining the log utility used
above, this demand function for low-skilled services  will take the form
                                 ³                              ´
                   0 () max [1 −  − ]1−    () 
                               

The first order condition for  is
                                                 
                          =  0 ()           = 
                                              1−++
where  is a constant,  is hours of service and  is the wage rate. In this situation,
the low-skilled   now have two sources of employment: services  and farm work
  −   Markets will clear when both

                               = 1− (  −  )−1

                                                16
and
                                                
                                          =
                                                
hold.
   These are three equations in    and  , given the populations  and    We
can solve for
                                                 
                                            1− =     
                               (  −  )
It follows that  →   (unskilled labor becomes increasingly urban) as  → ∞ and
that  → ∞ and  →    as  → ∞ This is all we need to get the emptying-out
of traditional agriculture.
   But in this scenario landless farmers are still Malthusians, even after moving to
city. They still have nothing to pass on to their children and so their fertility choice
is still
                                          1 
                                    =
                                          1−+
just as in Section 1. The implied evolution of   is just

                                    +1 =   

and since  → ∞ it follows that

                                      +1
                                   lim       → ∞
                                   →∞  


A proletariat blindly multiplying itself toward subsistence income levels: impossible?
Well, sooner or later, yes, but we are familiar with cities where educated and unedu-
cated co-exist with the latter still expanding. Think of Mumbai or Rio de Janeiro or
the Pakistani population in the Emirates.

   5. Migration dynamics - 2
   Let us then go to an opposite extreme, drop the possibility of unskilled urban jobs,
admit people to cities only if they match up to city standards. And what are they?

                                            17
Consider an unskilled parent, earning wage   If he chooses to raise  unskilled
children he solves
                                   max [ − ]1−  +1  
                                     

He has no control of the childrens’ wages next period, though he is pleased if they do
well. The chosen number of children is
                                                   
                                         =                 
                                              (1 −  + ) 
The parent’s utility (including altruistic pleasure) is
                   µ          ¶1− µ             ¶
                       1−                 
                                                    − +1  1−+                 (5.1)
                     1−+            1−+
  Alternatively, this same unskilled parent can decide to put his children through
school. If so, we assume that he is required to meet the school costs

                                      () =  () −                           (5.2)

and so ensure that each child attains  =  years of school.8 Then the only choice
left is  so he solves


                             max [ −  ()]1−    () 
                              

The first order condition in this case is
                                                      
                                      () =          
                                                    1−+
The implied utility is
          µ            ¶1− µ       ¶ µ          ¶
              1−                           1
                                                       () 1−+               (5.3)
            1−+             1−+       ()
Everyone has both options so the equality of (5.1) and (5.3) must hold:
                                 µ ¶
                                    
                         +1 =              ()1−                              (5.4)
                                   
  8
      The only reason for this assumption is to keep the number of types down to two.

                                                 18
  Now  is just the marginal value of unskilled labor:

                                      = 1− −1
                                                   


so (5.4) implies
                                              µ        ¶
                                                   
                         1−    −1
                                 +1   =                     ()1−
                                                  
which using (5.2) reduces to

                                 = −[(1−)(1−)]

where  is a constant. We assume that    (“quality”  “quantity”) which ensures
that   → 0
  In this model, as in the previous one, the population engaged in traditional agri-
culture shrinks toward zero while the urban sector continues to grow in wealth and,
possibly, in numbers. In the first case, urban growth consists of unskilled workers
providing services to the ever-wealthier bourgeoisie. In the second, migration to the
city is motivated by the possibility of raising educated, high human capital children
who then become full members of the bourgeoisie. In fact, both these migration
models–based on employment opportunities for the unskilled or on the possibility of
educating children–can operate at the same time, even in the same family.

  6. Conclusion
  This paper began with two kinds of evidence. The first is the strong negative
correlation of an economy’s real income levels with the fraction of its workforce that is
engaged in agriculture. The second, less clear, is the demographic transition–the fact
that migration out of traditional agriculture typically induces increases in population
later followed by reduced growth. I have interpreted the movements out of traditional
agriculture as a transition toward literacy and education more generally and the onset
of an urban class that generates sustained productivity growth. A version of Becker’s
quantity/quality tradeoﬀ then unites the two.

                                                  19
  The role of schooling in my interpretation is quite diﬀerent from more familiar
growth models where the contribution of schooling is measured by years in school
and where on-the-job learning is viewed as an age-specific fixed eﬀect.9 In this paper,
schooling prepares people to take advantage of the ideas of others and the knowledge
they gain throughout their careers depends in part on the quality of those with whom
they interact. It is the quality of these people–parents, teachers, fellow students,
supervisors, co-workers, people we meet at work or at parties, people we observe from
a distance, see on television, read about in books–that determines the direction and
quality of our lives.
  In the model I have outlined here there are educated, urban families who put their
children in schools. These children, interacting with others, continue to learn on
their jobs. These are the people who discover new ways of doing things and get the
rewards of success. There are also illiterate families raising illiterate children who will
earn their living as farm workers or as unskilled servants to the wealthy urbanites.
These families too benefit from the productivity growth generated by others, and that
enables them to have more children than their parents had. Some of these families
choose to sacrifice some of their own consumption and the number of their children
in order to give their children the quality of schooling that they themselves did not
have. I have kept these people in just two types, but only for clarity. In any actual
society, many in-between types are also represented.
  In such an economy, market forces do not give the right signals. Parents choose
fertility and schooling levels that maximize their own well-being but place no value
on the benefits that accrue to others with whom their children will interact. This
ineﬃciency could be corrected by government-financed universal education (though
finding the right level is not easy). All of the wealthy economies have done this,
  9
      See, for one example out of many, Hall and Jones (1999). My position here is closer to Manuelli
and Seshadri (2014).



                                                  20
if imperfectly. When all economies have done so, the industrial revolution will be
complete.
