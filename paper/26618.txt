Does the Marginal Hospitalization Save Lives? The Case of Respiratory Admissions for the
Elderly
Janet Currie and David Slusky
NBER Working Paper No. 26618
January 2020
JEL No. I1

                                           ABSTRACT

Some commentators estimate that up to a third of U.S. medical spending may be wasted. This
study focuses on the decision to hospitalize elderly Medicare patients who present at the
emergency room (ER) with respiratory conditions. Failing to hospitalize sick patients could have
dire consequences. However, in addition to generating higher costs, unnecessary hospitalization
puts patients at risk of hospital acquired conditions and disrupts their lives. We use variation in
the patient's nearest hospital's propensity to admit patients with similar observable characteristics
as an instrument for the admission decision. While OLS estimates suggest that admitted patients
are more likely to die, when we instrument for patient admission we find that the marginal
hospital admission increases the number of hospital days by seven days and increases charges by
$42,000 but has no effect on the risk of death in the course of the next year. The marginal
hospitalization also reduces the risk of another emergency department visit in the next 30 days
but increases outpatient visits over the same time horizon with no overall impact on charges.
Longer term effects also include increased outpatient visits but effects on patient costs and health
outcomes over the next year are minimal. Overall, these results lend support to the argument that
in many cases the marginal hospitalization is unnecessary.

       Some commentators estimate that up to a third of U.S. medical spending may be wasteful

in the sense that it produces no health benefit and may at times even harm patients (Chandra and

Skinner, 2012; Baicker, Chandra, Skinner, 2012; Berwick and Hackbarth 2012). Yet identifying

wasteful spending and the factors that lead to it is difficult. Sheiner (2014) argues that approaches

based on identifying high-spending areas are not a useful way to find inefficiencies. Similarly,

Einav et al. (2018) argue that focusing on health care costs at the end of life is not helpful in

identifying waste and suggest that researchers should focus on specific spending margins and on

heterogeneity in the effects of spending across patients of different types.

       This study focuses on the decision to hospitalize elderly Medicare patients who present at

the emergency room (ER) with respiratory conditions and is one of the first to focus on the decision

to hospitalize itself as an important margin for potentially wasteful medical care. We examine

individuals aged 66 to 70 using hospital discharge records for New York State. Respiratory

conditions are one of the most common classes of illnesses affecting these patients: 28 percent of

all ER visits list a respiratory diagnosis as do 42 percent of hospitalizations. A little over half of

these patients are admitted to hospital, meaning that clinicians are frequently called on differentiate

between cases that require expensive hospital services and those that do not. Failing to hospitalize

someone who needs to be admitted could lead to dire consequences, even death. But in addition

to generating higher costs, unnecessary hospitalization puts patients at risk. McIntyre (2013) notes

that patients who have been hospitalized experience "a period of generalized risk for a range of

adverse health events" such as infection, metabolic disturbances, and falls. He describes a period

of vulnerability due to sleep deprivation, poor nutrition, and pain that has been characterized as

"post-hospital syndrome," and suggests that "admission to hospital could be considered a disease."

Hospitalization often also has negative financial impacts (Dobkin et al. 2018).




                                                  2
          The ideal setting for measuring the effect of the marginal hospitalization on outcomes

would involve randomly assigning patients with symptoms around the severity threshold for

admission to hospital either to hospital or to home care. We attempt to approximate this research

design by using variation in the patient's nearest hospital's propensity to admit patients with

similar observable characteristics as an instrument for the admission decision. 1

          We find, first, that there is considerable variation even within hospital in the probability of

admission which seems unlikely to be explainable by purely medical risk factors. For example,

conditional on observable diagnoses and comorbidities, women are less likely to be admitted than

men; African-Americans and Hispanics are less likely to be admitted that non-Hispanic whites;

and there is a sharp spike in admission probabilities at age 70.

          Second, we find that there is considerable variation across hospitals in the probability that

patients with different estimated severity levels will be admitted. Not surprisingly, this variation

is greatest for patients in the middle of the severity distribution: For patients in the fifth decile of

estimated severity, the probability of admission varies from 20 to 80 percent. These probabilities

are calculated excluding small hospitals with fewer than 100 beds. The admission rate at the

nearest large hospital for patients in the individual's predicted admission decile is a strong

instrument for the individual's own admission to hospital. Since this instrument is based on the

hospital's other patients, it is not affected by the patient's own health status. Simply put, if you

live in some places, you are more likely to be hospitalized than others. We use the nearest large

hospital to get around the endogeneity of hospital choice, and the instrument works because many

people (45%) do in fact use the nearest large hospital.




1
    Card, Fenizia, and Silver (2019) employ a similar identification strategy.


                                                    3
       Third, ordinary least squares estimates of the consequences of hospital admission suggest

that admitted patients are more likely to die--the probability of death is one percentage point

higher in the next week, rising to three percentage points higher over the next year. These

estimates demonstrate the difficulty involved with trying to identify unnecessary hospitalizations

given the data that is observable in administrative hospital records. On average clinicians are

clearly choosing to admit the sicker patients among those presenting at the ER, indicating that they

have additional information about the patient's condition that is superior to that available to us.

           Finally, when we instrument for patient admission, we find that the marginal hospital

admission increases the number of hospital days by seven days and increases charges by $42,240,

but has no effect on the risk of death. The marginal hospitalization also reduces the risk of

returning to the emergency department in the next 30 days, and increases the probability that care

is received in an outpatient setting. It has minimal impacts on costs and health outcomes beyond

30 days.

       The rest of this paper is laid out as follows. We first discuss some of the background

literature related to unnecessary hospitalization. We then discuss the data and estimation strategy

in the paper. Section V presents our main results, and several robustness checks are discussed in

Section VI. Section VII concludes.



II. Background

       A day in the hospital is expensive relative to other ways to deliver care and may have

negative effects on patients, making the decision to hospitalize a patient a potentially important

margin affecting health care costs and health outcomes.            Yet, it is difficult to identify

hospitalizations that may have been ex ante unnecessary even with detailed administrative data




                                                  4
(Einav et al, 2018). Some researchers have attempted to directly assess the extent to which

hospitalizations were unnecessary.       For example, Kemper (1988) conducted a retroactive

evaluation of pediatric visits to the University of Wisconsin Hospital and deemed 21.4% of

admissions inappropriate. These findings suggest that many hospital admissions may not be

beneficial to patients, but detailed chart review is not feasible on a large-scale basis.

          Other studies have examined the effect of additional hospital spending on patient health

after patients are hospitalized. For example, Kaestner and Silber (2010) find a negative association

between inpatient hospital spending and 30-day mortality for Medicare patients. Doyle (2005,

2011) and Doyle et al. (2015) examine patients with emergencies who end up being admitted to

higher and lower spending hospitals. They find that patient outcomes are better in hospitals with

higher average levels of in-patient spending. Almond, Doyle, and Kowalski (2010) and look at

rules that mandate greater spending on newborns just above a birthweight threshold compared to

newborns just below it, and again find that higher spending improves outcomes. However, using

a similar design, Almond and Doyle (2011) find no impact of additional hospital days for maternity

patients. More broadly, Alalouf, Miller, and Wherry (2019) study the impact of a marginal

diagnosis of diabetes and find it leads to more spending on drugs and care but no improvement in

health.

          Few papers examine the decision to admit the marginal patient in the first place, even

though this is a particularly important margin in terms of treatment and spending. In principal, we

would like to compare two identical patients, one of whom was hospitalized and the other of whom

was not. Because we cannot perfectly assess patient condition, we need to find an instrumental

variable that predicts hospitalization but has no independent effect on outcomes.

          Several previous papers have suggested that hospitals with empty beds are more likely to




                                                   5
admit patients, other things being equal. In one of the earlier papers to address this phenomena,

Fisher et al. (1994) examined future probabilities of hospital admission in Medicare patients in

Boston and New Haven who had all been initially admitted for myocardial infarction, stroke, hip

fracture, gastrointestinal bleeding, or potentially curative surgery for cancer. They found that the

Boston patients had a 64 percent higher average readmission rate over the next three years

compared to New Haven patients, but experienced no difference in mortality rates. They argue

that this higher rate of future admissions cannot be explained by differences in severity of illness

or differential use of nursing home care or Veterans Administration hospitals. They conclude that

the most likely explanation is that a greater availability of beds per capita in Boston led to the

higher admission rates and that the marginal admissions had little impact on health outcomes.

These findings are echoed by Fisher et al. (2000) who look at a broader sample of Medicare

patients. Similarly, Goodman et al. (1994) found that pediatric patients in zip codes with high per

capita bed supply had 9% more admissions than children in areas with lower per capita bed supply.

       More recently, Sharma, Stano and Gehrig (2008) study responses to short run variation in

hospital demand in Oregon. They find that when demand for beds is relatively high, hospitals

discharge patients earlier, but they do not find any effect on hospital admissions. Evans and Kim

(2006) similarly find that hospitals respond to short run demand shocks by reducing length of stay

rather than by altering admissions. Alexander and Currie (2017) show that flu prevalence is related

to the probability that publicly insured children are admitted to hospital, but has relatively little

effect on admissions of the privately insured.

       These findings suggest that measures of demand relative to bed capacity may be of limited

predictive value as instrumental variables for hospital admission in the Medicare population.

Moreover, arguably, utilization rates could have independent effects on outcomes by, for example,




                                                 6
affecting the quality of nursing care received (Evans and Kim, 2006). In his analysis of the effects

of the availability of neonatal intensive care unit beds on admission to the NICU and patient

outcomes, Freedman (2016) explicitly rejects the use of bed availability as an instrument on these

grounds.

         This brief review of the literature suggests that the decision to hospitalize a patient is an

important, yet relatively unexplored margin affecting hospital costs and patient outcomes, and that

one of the main limitations on research is the difficulty in finding an appropriate instrument for

hospital admission.


III. Data

         The primary data source used in this paper is a restricted version of the hospital discharge

data from the New York State Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative

System (SPARCS). 2 These data contain records for every hospital inpatient stay, hospital

outpatient (emergency department, ambulatory surgery, and outpatient services) visit, and each

ambulatory surgery and outpatient services visit to a hospital extension clinic and diagnostic and

treatment center for the years 2005-2014. It has numerous advantages over the more commonly

used Health Care Utilization Project (HCUP) data, including having information on the exact dates

of arrival, admission, and discharge. These data include the zip code of the patients' residence, and

an encrypted ID variable that makes it possible to link patients across discharges.

         Since our project studies the decision to admit a patient from the emergency department,

we rely on a key piece of information: an "emergency department indicator" variable. This enables

us to identify inpatients who were admitted from the ER as well as patients who were treated in

                                                  7
the ER and discharged without being admitted.

         The SPARCS data also includes mortality variables which are derived from an internal

match with state vital records. These variables tell us whether a particular patient died within a

certain time frame. These data include all deaths (not only those in hospital) and so are a complete

census of future mortality within the relevant time window. 3

         We combine the SPARCS data with time series data from the New York State Department

of Health on the number of beds in each hospital. While current information on beds is freely

available, 4 we had to request quarterly historical bed information, which was provided for the first

quarter of 2008 through the second quarter of 2014, excluding the fourth quarter of 2011 which is

unavailable for administrative reasons unrelated to our project. 5 To maintain a balanced panel of

months, we use data from 2008-2013 as our primary sample.

         We define our primary analysis sample as follows. First, we limit to individuals with the

emergency department indicator. Second, we focus on individuals between the ages of 66 and 70.

This is an age range that is sufficiently old to be at substantial risk for respiratory problems, but

young enough that most people are expected to recover from an additional hospitalization. We

start at age 66 rather than age 65 to ensure that all individuals have been eligible for Medicare for

at least a year. In this way, we avoid changes in the propensity to be admitted and in the intensity

of care that are associated with initial receipt of Medicare (see Card, Dobkin, and Maestas, 2008,

2009).

         We then limit the sample to individuals with at least one respiratory diagnosis, using the

  We were told in an email from our contact: "Note there was no update done in the 4th quarter
of 2011 for, as I recall, bureaucratic reasons."

Clinical Classification Software's grouping of ICD-9 diagnosis codes. 6 Focusing on one specific

category of diagnoses is one way to try to narrow the comparison of admitted and not admitted

patients to those who are similar to each other without placing undue weight on the exact diagnosis

code given. Respiratory diagnoses are common, and there is also often uncertainty about the

appropriate exact diagnosis within that general category (Chan and Gentzkow, 2019).

       For each individual with at least one respiratory diagnosis, we create indicators for whether

each condition was present on arrival at the hospital. 7 We also use the diagnosis variables to create

indicators for comorbidities. 8 Note that only co-morbidities that were present when the patient

initially presented at the ER are included in this index.

       We then link these individuals to all of their past and future discharge records, regardless

of the diagnoses in these records. With these linked records, we create variables indicating whether

an individual had a respiratory diagnosis in the past year (past 365 days), in an inpatient or

outpatient setting, and the number of days in the past year that they spent in the hospital as an

inpatient or in ambulatory surgery for any reason. We also identify any hospital acquired

  See: https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccs/ccs.jsp, http://www.nber.org/data/icd-ccs-
crosswalk.html. Specifically, we include codes 122-134, which correspond to pneumonia,
influenza, tonsillitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, asthma, aspiration pneumonitis from food or vomiting, pleurisy; pneumothorax;
pulmonary collapse, respiratory failure; lung disease due to external agents, lower respiratory
disease, and upper respiratory disease.

  We assume all diagnoses on an emergency discharge record were present on arrival. For
diagnoses on an inpatient file, there are separate variables indicating if the diagnosis was present
on arrival.

  We do this by applying identifying the components of the composite comorbidity Charlson
Index (Charlson et al. 1987), using the Stata function "charlson." Comorbidities include: acute
myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular
disease, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid disease, peptic ulcer
disease, liver disease (minor and moderate/severe), diabetes (with and without complications),
hemiplegia or paraplegia, renal disease, and cancer (local and metastatic).

conditions (HACs) that an individual suffered from after admission. 9 These are conditions that

the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services believes could have been prevented through the

application of evidence-based guidelines.

       Table 1 provides an initial overview of these data. Overall, 56.5 percent of the patients in

our sample were admitted, suggesting that doctors have considerable discretion in who is admitted

and who is not for these diagnoses as a class. Once admitted, the average length of stay is about

four days. About 0.5 percent of patients suffer from a hospital acquired condition (though since

hospitals are self-reporting these data and may suffer financial penalties in consequence, these data

may be under-reported). Aside from the current episode of care, patients in our sample have an

average of 11.1 additional hospital days in the next year. Death rates are high relative to the overall

population in this age group: 4.3 percent of these patients die within the next week, and 17.8

percent die within the next year compared to a mortality rate of 1788.6 per 100,000 people 65 to

74 in the U.S. as a whole in 2016. 10


IV: Methods

       We seek to exploit variation in New York state's hospitals propensity to admit patients in

similar condition to hospital. Hence, the first step in our analysis is to try to group patients with

similar levels of morbidity. To do so, we first estimate the propensity that a patient will be admitted

using all of the patients in our sample independent of what hospital they went to: 11

(2017).

       ( = 1) =  ( +  +  + -1 +

-1 +  +  +  +  +  +  ),                                                                       (1)


where admitted for individual i is equal to one if the discharge record was in the inpatient discharge

file, and is equal to zero if the record is in the outpatient file. RespDiag are indicators for

respiratory diagnoses present at the current visit (as defined by the 13 CCS codes listed above) and

Comorbidities are the categories from the Charlson index discussed above, also for the current

visit. Together these variables provide an indication of the patient's current health condition.

       The vector PastDiag includes indicators for respiratory diagnoses present on discharge

records in the past year (i.e. past 365 days), while  is the total number of inpatient

hospital days in the past year. Together these variables summarize information about past health

conditions of the patient that may be relevant to the current case. For example, if the patient has a

history of asthma and some knowledge of how to manage it, they may be less likely to be

hospitalized than if they have an asthma attack without such a history.

       We also control for DayOfWeek (i.e., Sunday, Monday...) and Month indicators given

previous evidence that admissions are sensitive to timing within the week and year (Lew, 1966;

Barry, 2004), as well as calendar Year indicators in order to control for possible longer-term time

trends in admissions.

        Finally, we control for X, a vector of individual-level controls including as sex, indicators

for race and ethnicity, and single-year-of-age fixed effects as well as for zip code fixed effects.12

These variables may proxy for underlying differences in health status that could affect both the

probability of hospital admission and outcomes. However, to the extent that estimated effects of


12
  Given that our primary specification for our admission propensity model is a logit, we drop
any individuals from ZIP codes or hospitals where everyone or no one was admitted. This
applies to less than 0.3% of the sample.


                                                 11
variables like race do not reflect underlying health, they arguably do not belong in this model.

Hence, we discuss estimates computed without these variables in the robustness section below.

       Robust standard errors () are clustered at the zip code level in order to allow for

correlations in unobservable factors among patients within zip codes. In what follows, we use a

logit specification for F, though in the robustness section, we also report results computed using

alternative approaches to developing an index, including machine learning techniques.

       Estimation of equation (1) tells us how the variables included in the model are treated, on

average, by hospitals in New York state. Hence, we can use the admission propensity computed

in equation (1) to ask whether a particular hospital is more or less likely than the average hospital

to admit patients with a given vector of observable characteristics. In what follows, we use the

estimated admission propensity index to divide patients into deciles. For each patient, we match

the patient to the nearest general service hospital with over 99 beds which saw emergency

respiratory patients age 66-70 in that person's decile in that year. 13 We then ask how likely that

hospital is to admit a patient in that year in each admission probability decile. For this exercise,

we use hospitals with over 99 beds because small hospitals can have small cell sizes that cause

noise in their estimated propensities to admit patients from a particular decile. When computing

the hospital's probability of admitting patients in a particular decile, we also exclude the index

patient from the calculation. We therefore also exclude hospitals that only had 1 emergency

respiratory patient age 66-70 in a given decile in a given year, as we wouldn't be able to calculate

this leave-out index.

       This exercise seeks to isolate variation in the probability of admission that stems from the



13
  An alternative specification that matches each ZIP code to the nearest hospital with over 99
beds and then drops any patients for whom that hospital had no patients in that year and decile
yields very similar results, albeit with only 93% of the sample.


                                                 12
fact that a patient of a given type went to a hospital with a high or low probability of admitting

other similar patients. We use the admission propensity for the nearest large hospital, whether or

not the patient actually went there, because some patients might actively seek hospitals with high

or low admission probabilities. Because most patients do in fact use the nearest hospital, the

nearest hospital's propensity to admit patients of the index patient's type is predictive of the index

patient's admission probability, without having been directly chosen by the index patient.

        The first stage model that we estimate is given by:


         =  + _ +  +  +  +   +

 +  +  +  ,                                                                                   (2)


        Here, admitted is an indicator equal to one if patient i from predicted admission decile d is

admitted at time t to hospital h. The variable _ is the instrument discussed above,

that is, the probability that a patient in the same decile of admission probabilities as the index

patient was admitted to the nearest hospital with over 99 beds (where this probability is computed

excluding the index patient). The variable  is the predicted probability of admission for the

index patient from equation (1). Note that we obtain much the same thing if we just include all of

the variables from (1), but using  instead improves the fit of the first stage, which makes sense

because it incorporates additional information. Decile and Hosp are decile and hospital fixed

effects, respectively.

        Including decile fixed effects allows the patient's condition to have a flexible piecewise

linear impact on both admission probabilities and outcomes, rather than being strictly linear in the

admission index. Including hospital fixed effects means that we are identifying the effects of

admission using within-hospital variations in the probability of admitting a patient in different

deciles of the admission probability distribution. For example, as we show below, most hospitals


                                                 13
admit patients in the highest decile of the distribution, but there is a wide range of responses to

patients in the middle of the distribution. In the context of our model it is this within hospital gap

in the probabilities of admission between deciles that identifies the effect of admission.

       We then estimate the impact of an admission on health outcomes by estimating the

following equation:


        =  +  +  +  +  +  +

 +  +  +  ,                                                                                   (3)


using both ordinary least squares (OLS) and the instrumental variables procedure described above.

The outcomes we examine include length of stay, future hospital inpatient days, hospital acquired

conditions, and mortality. Robust standard errors are clustered at the zip code level, to allow for

unobserved correlations between patients residing in the same zip code..

       OLS estimates of the coefficient of interest, , will likely suffer from omitted variables bias

given that the physician deciding whether to admit the patient has access to information that is not

on the discharge record. If physicians are likely to admit the sickest patients, then one might expect

a positive relationship between admission and outcomes such as mortality and readmission.

       To proxy for the costs of care, we will use the total charges variable in the SPARCS data.

While for patients with private insurance total charges may not always be strongly correlated with

actual costs or reimbursements, virtually all of the individuals in our sample are on Medicare, so

costs and reimbursements should be substantially correlated with charges.



V. Estimation Results

       Table 2 shows the means and standard deviations of the variables included in the predicted

admission model (1), as well as the average marginal effects of each variable, in both a logit


                                                 14
specification and for comparison, in a linear probability model. The first section of the table shows

that women are less likely to be admitted than men, conditional on all of the other information

included in the model. Similarly, African Americans and Hispanics are less likely to be admitted

than non-Hispanic whites. Because the models include zip code fixed effects, these results cannot

be explained by where people live. The probability of admission rises with each year of age, but

not smoothly: After increasing slightly from age 67 to 69, there is a sharp jump at age 70,

suggesting that doctors may treat those in their 70s differently than those in their 60s.

       Turning to current respiratory diagnoses and comorbidities, it appears that some diagnoses

are much more likely than others to result in admittance. Specifically, pneumonia, pleurisy,

respiratory failure, lung disease due to external agents, and other lower respiratory disease are

strongly predictive of admission, while other upper respiratory disease and acute bronchitis are

strongly negatively related to admission. Patients with serious comorbidities such as congestive

heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, disease, diabetes with complications, renal

disease, and cancer are much more likely to be admitted, while previous respiratory admissions in

the past year generally have small effects that tend to be negative when they are statistically

significant. Overall, the model predicts about 80 percent of admission decisions correctly (that is,

the predicted probability of admission is less than 50 percent when the person was not admitted,

and over 50 percent when they were admitted).

       Panel A of Figure 1 shows the distribution of actual admission rates for patients across

hospitals. There is one sub-figure for each decile, starting with the lowest decile of admission

probabilities. Starting at the top left the figure shows for example, that the modal New York

hospital admits no patients from the lowest decile of predicted admission probabilities, while a

few hospitals admit more than 20 percent of such patients. The mass gradually shifts to the right




                                                 15
as we move to higher predicted probability of admission deciles. Most hospitals admit all patients

in the highest decile, though a few admit fewer than 90 percent of these patients. Not surprisingly,

the greatest spread in admission probabilities occurs in the middle of the predicted probability of

admission deciles. For example, at the fifth decile, the actual admission probabilities vary from

less than 20 percent to almost 80 percent. Recall that we have eliminated the smallest hospitals

from the figure. While some of the outliers in the figure may be attributable to noise due to small

cell sizes, Figure 1 suggests that there is real variation across hospitals in their probabilities of

admitting patients with similar observable characteristics.

       Panel B shows the same data for the earliest (2008) and latest (2013) years in our sample.

Here we see that while there is more variation over all (as the sample size is smaller), the two years

are reasonably but not exactly consistent within deciles.

       Table 3 shows estimates of the first stage of the instrumental variables regression, equation

(2). The admission rate at the nearest large hospital for patients in individual i's predicted

admission decile is a strong predictor of an individual's own admission with a t-statistic of 8.27.14

Overall the model explains about 45 percent of the variation in individual admission probabilities,

and the fraction explained rises with the addition of the instrument.

       Table 4 shows OLS estimates of the effects of hospital admission on outcomes. Not

surprisingly, admission is associated with an increase in length of stay of 5.2 days and an additional

$26,000 of charges. Admission also appears to increase the probabilities of future hospital days,

hospital acquired conditions, and death in each of the time windows examined. The probability of




14
  We have also estimated similar equations treating empty beds and an index of flu prevalence
as potential instruments. Consistent with past work, these variables are predictive of hospital
admissions, but have t-statistics around 3.4, and adding them to the model does not increase the
overall fraction of variation in admission probabilities that is explained.


                                                 16
death rises from an increase of about one percentage point in the next seven days to an increase of

3.5 percentage points in the next year. As discussed above, these estimates are likely to be driven

by omitted variables bias since hospital personnel have information that does not appear in the

administrative hospital records and are likely to be admitting the sickest patients. It is also possible

that sicker patients choose to present at hospitals with higher admission probabilities.

       Table 5 shows that when we account for omitted variables bias and endogenous hospital

selection using our instrument, most results are quite different. Reassuringly, we find a similar

effect on length of stay and total charges ­ it should be the case that admitting someone increases

the length of stay in the current episode of care and the total charges.

       Column (2) of Table 5 shows, however, that the instrumental variables estimates of the

effect of admission on future hospital days, i.e. those not associated with the current episode of

care, is strongly positive. Thus, as we saw in Table 2, being admitted is strongly predictive of

future hospital admissions. Since equation (3) includes hospital fixed effects, this result cannot be

explained by persistence in the patient's choice of hospital. Instead, the estimate suggests that

even within hospital, a past hospitalization increases the probability of a future one.

       This phenomenon might reflect a negative effect of hospitalization itself on people's health.

Column (3) shows that while the estimated effect of admission on hospital acquired conditions is

not statistically significant, it is four times larger than the OLS estimate in Table 4. Alternatively,

doctors may take previous hospitalizations as a signal about the underlying health status of the

patient that makes it more likely for them to decide on hospitalization in marginal cases. It is

important to distinguish between these two hypotheses since the "hospitalization as disease" model

suggests that the marginal hospitalization may be not only unnecessary but actively harming

people, while in the signaling model, there is no necessary effect of a marginal hospitalization on




                                                  17
health, and it could even be positive. The remaining columns of Table 5 show that the estimated

effects of admission on the probability of death become negative but statistically insignificant once

omitted variables bias and the endogeneity of hospital choice are accounted for.

           Tables 6-9 study the impact of a marginal hospital admission on future health care. We

utilize the claim type and emergency department indicator variables to construct dummy variables

for several different types of future health care: Emergency Department (including patients that

eventually ended up in ambulatory surgery or as inpatients), Inpatient (whether emergencies or

not), and Non-Emergency Outpatient (including ambulatory surgery). 15 For each of these

categories, we look at the probability of having at least one discharge in the 30 days post discharge,

and in the 31 to 365 days post discharge.

           Given the likely bias in the OLS results due to patient characteristics unobservable to us,

we will focus on the IV results in Tables 7 and 9. In the first 30 days after discharge from the ER,

we find that a marginal admission lowers the probability of another emergency department visit

and increases the probability of a non-emergency outpatient visit but has minimal impact on future

inpatient stays or charges. In the subsequent rest of the year, the IV results (in Table 9), still only

show marginally statistically significant results, except that there is evidence of an increase in

outpatient visits suggesting that the patient may be getting more follow up care in an outpatient

setting.




15
  These categories are not quite mutually exclusive (as Emergency Department visitors that
ended up as inpatients are counted in both of the first two categories). Still, we believe these are
the most intuitive outcomes to consider.


                                                   18
VI. Robustness

        The appendices contains three robustness checks on our main specification: 1) omitting

race controls from the calculation of our admission propensity index; 2) using county fixed effects

instead of zip code fixed effects in the calculation of the index; and 3) using LASSO for prediction

instead of logit, also with county fixed effects. The use of county fixed effects instead of zip code

fixed effects is for tractability with the LASSO procedure.

        Our results are broadly consistent across our main specification and these three alternate

specifications suggesting that they are not affected by small differences in procedures for

predicting hospitalization.



VI. Conclusions

        We examine hospital admission decisions using a sample of elderly Medicare patients from

New York state. The previous literature has focused mainly on the intensive margin, i.e. on the

marginal effect of additional days of hospitalization or more intensive spending on already

hospitalized patients. Few previous authors have examined the impact of the hospitalization

decision itself.

        It is difficult to study the impact of hospitalization because of omitted variables bias and

endogeneity in the hospitals that patients select. We propose an instrumental variables strategy to

overcome these obstacles. Our instrument focuses on the nearest large hospital's propensity to

admit patients who have observable characteristics similar to those of the index patient. Because

we include zip code in all of our models and hospital fixed effects in our first stage and main

equation, the identifying variation we use cannot be attributed to overall mean differences between




                                                 19
hospitals, but can be thought of as an interaction between a hospital's propensity to admit and

patient severity.

       We find that there is considerable variation in the probability of admission for patients with

similar observable medical risk factors. Conditional on observable diagnoses and comorbidities,

women are less likely to be admitted than men; African-Americans and Hispanics are less likely

to be admitted that non-Hispanic whites; and there is a sharp spike in admission probabilities at

age 70. We also find that there is considerable variation across hospitals in the probability that

patients in a particular decile of the predicted probability of admission will actually be admitted.

The probability that the nearest large hospital's propensity to admit other patients in the patient's

severity decile to hospital is a powerful instrument for the index patient's own admission.

       While OLS estimates suggest that admitted patients are more likely to die, using our

instrument we find that for the marginal patient a current hospital admission increases the number

of hospital days by seven days and increases charges by $42,000. However it has no effect on the

risk of death in the course of the next year. The marginal hospitalization also reduces the risk of

another emergency department visit in the next 30 days but increases outpatient visits over the

same time horizon with no overall impact on charges. Longer term effects on patient costs and

health outcomes over the next year are minimal though the increase in outpatient visits appears to

be maintained. Overall then our findings support the argument that in many cases the marginal

hospitalization may be unwarranted, creating unnecessary costs for both the patient and the health

care system.

Notes: Robust standard errors are clustered at the zip code level *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.
The individual's predicted probability of admission is computed using the estimates in Table 2.
The instrument is the admission rate for patients in the individual's predicted admission decile at
the closest general service hospital with over 99 beds, excluding the patient if he or she went to
that hospital. Closest is measured using the patient's residential zip code centroid. All
regressions contain decile, hospital, year, month, weekday, and zip code fixed effects.
