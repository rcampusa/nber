                                                ABSTRACT

In an economy with identical infinitely-lived households that obtain utility from leisure as well as
consumption, Chamley (1986) and Judd (1985) have shown that the optimal tax system to pay for
an exogenous stream of government purchases involves a zero tax rate on capital in the long run, with
tax revenue collected by a distortionary tax on labor income. Extending the results of Hall and Jorgenson
(1971) to general equilibrium, I show that if purchasers of capital are permitted to deduct capital expenditures
from taxable capital income, then a constant tax rate on capital income is non-distortionary. Importantly,
even though this specification of the capital income tax imposes a zero effective tax rate on capital,
the capital income tax can collect substantial revenue. Provided that government purchases do not
exceed gross capital income less gross investment, the optimal tax system will consist of a positive
tax rate on capital income and a zero tax rate on labor income--just the opposite of the results of Chamley
and Judd.

   The optimal way for a government to collect revenue to pay for its purchases of
goods and services is to levy lump-sum taxes. However, lump-sum taxes generally
are not available, so some form of economic activity, such as labor income, capital
income, cigarette purchases, etc., must be taxed. Because the taxation of economic
activities is distortionary, a basic problem of public finance is how to use such taxes to
collect revenue in the least distortionary way. A classic problem of this sort analyzes
the optimal use of taxes on labor income and capital income to finance an exoge-
nous stream of government purchases in a Ramsey framework with a representative
infinitely-lived household. The celebrated result of Chamley (1986) and Judd (1985)
is that in the long run, the optimal tax rate on capital income is zero.
   The Chamley-Judd result might be particularly puzzling to readers of an older
literature on the conditions for the neutrality of capital income taxation. The older
literature focused on the capital investment decision of a single firm, and did not
embed the firm in a general equilibrium model. Hall and Jorgenson (1971) showed
that for a firm that cannot deduct its cost of financing (for example, under U.S. tax
law, a firm financed entirely by equity), a tax on capital income that provides for
immediate expensing of capital expenditures will be neutral with respect to capital;
that is, it will have no eﬀect on a firm’s optimal capital accumulation. Tax codes
generally allow purchasers of capital to reduce their calculated taxable income by some
amount to reflect the cost of acquiring capital. This reduction in taxable income is
usually implemented through a schedule of depreciation allowances, which may or may
not be accelerated relative to the economic depreciation of the capital asset.       The
most accelerated version of depreciation allowances is immediate expensing, which
leads to tax rate neutrality, as described above. A second neutrality result applies to
the case in which a firm can deduct its cost of financing, as would be the case, under
U.S. tax law, for a firm financed entirely by debt. In this case, Hall and Jorgenson



                                            1
show, and an earlier result of Samuelson (1964) implies, that allowing firms to deduct
true economic depreciation will lead to tax rate neutrality with respect to capital
investment.
   The existence of neutral forms of capital income taxation, i.e., forms of capital
income taxation that do not aﬀect the capital investment decision of a firm, suggests
that these forms of capital taxation may provide the elusive lump-sum tax that can
allow the government to finance its expenditures without distortions.        To explore
whether such capital income tax schemes can provide non-distortionary sources of
revenue, two major questions need to be addressed. First, does the neutrality of a
capital income tax scheme in the context of a single firm’s decision carry over to a
general equilibrium framework? Second, can a capital income tax that is neutral in
general equilibrium collect a nontrivial amount of revenue? The answer to the first
question is diﬀerent for the two neutral tax schemes mentioned above. Specifically,
for a firm that cannot deduct the cost of financing, a capital income tax system that
specifies a constant tax rate and includes immediate expensing is neutral in general
equilibrium as well as in the context of a single firm. However, the neutrality of allow-
ing firms that can deduct financing costs also to deduct economic depreciation does
not carry over to general equilibrium. Therefore, the body of this paper focuses on
the case with immediate expensing; the Appendix examines the case with economic
depreciation.   I will show that for immediate expensing the answer to the second
question is also positive: a capital income tax with immediate expensing can collect
a substantial amount of revenue. Because a constant capital income tax rate with
immediate expensing does not aﬀect the accumulation of capital optimally chosen by
purchasers of capital, and can collect substantial revenue, it can be used to finance
government spending in a non-distortionary manner.          Provided that the amount
of government spending does not exceed gross capital income less gross investment,



                                           2
there is no need to use distortionary labor income taxation.
   The finding that a capital income tax with immediate expensing can collect a
nontrivial amount of revenue in a non-distortionary manner turns the Chamley-Judd
result on its head.    Instead of setting the capital income tax rate equal to zero
and using a distortionary labor income tax to collect revenue as in Chamley-Judd,
the results in this paper indicate that the optimal configuration of taxes is to set
the labor income tax rate equal to zero and to use a constant tax rate on capital
income, combined with immediate expensing, to collect revenue. The optimal capital
income tax scheme I present here leads to a higher level of utility of the representative
household than does the Chamley-Judd prescription because the tax system presented
here is non-distortionary, while Chamley-Judd requires the use of distortionary taxes.
   The optimal tax scheme I present here holds in every period, not just in the long
run. The zero capital income tax rate prescribed by Chamley and Judd holds only in
the long run. Chamley also derives the optimal tax rate on capital income at every
point in time for the special case in which utility is separable over time, additively
separable in consumption and leisure, isoelastic in consumption, and linear in leisure.
In this special case, he shows that the optimal tax rate on capital income is initially
100% and remains equal to 100% until some point in time at which it abruptly jumps
to zero, and remains zero forever. However, I show that in a tax system that includes
immediate expensing, the optimal tax rate is constant over time.
   Because the optimal tax policy in this paper stands in sharp contrast to the
celebrated zero tax rate on capital income derived by Chamley and Judd for the
long run, it is important to explain the source of the diﬀerence in the results. The
diﬀerence is due entirely to the treatment of capital expenditures in calculating capital
income. In actual tax codes, depreciation allowances permit firms to amortize the
cost of purchasing capital over time, and the present value of depreciation allowances



                                           3
– Hall and Jorgenson’s (1967) famous “z”– is generally between zero and one.1
Chamley has (implicitly) chosen to set z equal to zero. Judd specifies depreciation
allowances equal to economic depreciation, so the implied value of z in his model is
between zero and one. As mentioned earlier, in the context of a single firm that can
deduct the cost of financing, economic depreciation will make the capital income tax
neutral with respect to capital.        However, as I demonstrate in the Appendix, this
result does not carry over to general equilibrium, so the capital income tax analyzed
by Judd is distortionary in a general equilibrium framework.
       To illustrate the importance of the value of z, it is simplest to consider the class
of capital income tax policies characterized by a constant capital income tax rate,
τ K , and a constant present value of depreciation deductions, z. The search for an
optimal capital income tax policy within this class of policies can be described as a
search for the optimal values of τ K and z. Chamley and Judd each chose values of z
without considering the optimal value of z. However, in this context, the eﬀective tax
                                        1−z
rate on capital is (see Section 7)     1−zτ K
                                              τK,   so if 0 ≤ z < 1, and τ K > 0, the eﬀective
tax rate on capital is positive; that is, the capital income tax is distortionary. To
achieve a zero eﬀective tax rate with z < 1—and thus avoid distortions—Chamley and
Judd each set τ K = 0, which destroys the ability to collect tax revenue from capital
income. In this paper, I introduce immediate expensing, which implies z = 1, so that
the eﬀective tax rate on capital is zero, even with a positive capital income tax rate,
τ K . As I discuss in Section 6.1, this tax scheme is equivalent to a one-time seizure of
capital. Surprisingly, however, even if the initial capital stock available for seizure is
very small, the non-distortionary capital income tax with immediate expensing can
collect a sizable amount of revenue along balanced growth paths.2

    A more formal definition of z and a brief discussion are presented in Section 7.

    Lucas (1990), in discussing the results of Chamley and Judd, points out that a proportional tax
on gross capital income combined with an appropriate investment tax credit is non-distortionary,
but he does not address the question of how much revenue such a scheme can collect.



                                                4
   The allocation that would prevail under lump-sum taxation can also be attained in
a competitive economy with a constant tax rate on the consumption good combined
with a subsidy to labor at the same rate. The constant tax rate on the consumption
good does not distort the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution. To avoid an
intratemporal distortion between the consumption good and contemporaneous leisure,
leisure must be taxed at the same rate as the consumption good.         That is, labor
supply must be subsidized. Although a tax on the consumption good accompanied
by a subsidy to labor can achieve the same allocation as a capital income tax with
immediate expensing, I will focus mostly on the capital income tax because my results
concerning the optimal capital income tax diﬀer so sharply from the well-known
Chamley-Judd result.
   I develop a general equilibrium model with a capital income tax and immediate
expensing in the first three sections of the paper. Section 1 provides a brief descrip-
tion of firms, which carry out production in the economy. Section 2 describes the
government’s purchases and its means of financing these purchases with taxes and
debt. The household’s decision problem is described in Section 3, which also derives
a characterization of the equilibrium allocation of goods and leisure, and the evolu-
tion of rates of return.    Section 4 describes the competitive equilibrium when the
capital income tax is replaced by lump-sum taxes. This equilibrium represents the
first-best allocation, given the exogenous path of government purchases. It serves as
a benchmark to show that a capital income tax with immediate expensing will achieve
the first-best equilibrium, which I do in Section 5. Then in Section 6, I calculate the
amount of tax revenue that can be collected with a capital income tax that includes
immediate expensing.       I derive a simple expression for capital income tax revenue
in a steady state, as well an expression that holds along balanced growth paths. In
Section 7, I derive the eﬀective tax rate on capital. I show that the Chamley-Judd



                                            5
prescription for optimal tax policy in the long run and my prescription are both
characterized by a zero eﬀective tax rate on capital. However, a zero eﬀective tax
rate on capital does not mean that capital income tax revenue is zero. Indeed, my
formulation of the capital income tax can collect a potentially substantial amount of
revenue, though the capital income tax collects zero revenue in the long run in the
Chamley-Judd formulation. In Section 8, I demonstrate that a constant tax rate on
the consumption good combined with a subsidy to labor at the same rate can achieve
the same allocation as can be achieved by a constant capital income tax rate with
immediate expensing. I also derive the tax rate on the consumption good that will, in
a closed economy, collect the same amount of tax revenue as a given capital income
tax rate, and show that the tax rate on the consumption good is higher than the
equivalent tax rate on capital income. Concluding remarks are presented in Section
9.



1    Firms

Consider a closed economy in which production is carried out by competitive firms
that rent the services of capital and labor in competitive markets. Labor is supplied
by a continuum of identical infinitely-lived households. I normalize the measure of
households to be one. Each household works Ht hours in period t. The production
function is
                                  Yt = F (Kt , Lt ) ,                              (1)

where Yt is output, Kt is the capital stock, and Lt ≡ At Ht is the amount of eﬀective
hours of labor input, where At is an index of labor-augmenting technical progress that
evolves deterministically over time.   The production function F (Kt , Lt ) is linearly
homogeneous in Kt and Lt , with FK > 0, FKK < 0, FL > 0, and FLL < 0.


                                          6
    The equilibrium wage rate per eﬀective hour of labor is


                                   wt = FL (Kt , Lt ) .                             (2)


Since an hour of labor by a household generates At eﬀective hours of labor, the wage
per hour of labor is wt At .
    The gross rental earned by a unit of capital in period t is


                                   rt = FK (Kt , Lt ) .                             (3)


The capital stock depreciates at a constant proportional rate δ, so the evolution of
capital over time is given by


                                Kt+1 = (1 − δ) Kt + It ,                            (4)


where It is gross investment in period t.



2     Government

The government purchases and consumes Gt units of output in period t. The value
of Gt evolves exogenously and deterministically over time. The government finances
its purchases of output by levying taxes on labor income and capital income and by
issuing bonds. Specifically, the government levies a tax at rate τ Lt on labor income
in period t and a tax at rate τ K
                                t on capital income in period t.      Most actual tax
systems compute taxable capital income by deducting some allowance for the cost of
purchasing capital. Here I adopt a particularly simple form of depreciation allowance.
I allow purchasers of capital to immediately expense capital expenditures. Therefore,
taxable capital income in period t is Kt FK (Kt , Lt ) − It . Capital income tax revenue

                                            7
in period t equals taxable capital income multiplied by the capital income tax rate,
τK
 t .   Therefore, the tax revenue collected from the capital income tax in period t,
TtK , is
                              TtK = τ K
                                      t [Kt FK (Kt , Lt ) − It ] .                      (5)

If investment, It , exceeds gross capital income, Kt FK (Kt , Lt )−It , then taxable capital
income is negative, and the owners of capital receive a payment from the government.
Alternatively, but equivalently, if taxable capital income is negative, the owners of
capital could receive a tax credit that accrues interest and can be used to pay future
capital income tax liabilities.    In the long run, however, the dynamic eﬃciency of
the aggregate economy implies that gross capital income exceeds investment, so that
taxable capital income is positive.
    Let Tt be total tax revenue from the labor income tax and the capital income tax
in period t. Using equation (4) to substitute Kt+1 − (1 − δ) Kt for gross investment
in equation (5) yields


             Tt = τ Lt wt At Ht + τ K
                                    t [Kt FK (Kt , At Ht ) + (1 − δ) Kt − Kt+1 ] .      (6)


    Let Bt be the value of one-period government bonds issued at the end of period
t − 1. In period t, these bonds pay a gross interest rate Rt so that the gross payment
to bondholders, including interest and repayment of principal, is Rt Bt . Therefore,
the government’s budget constraint can be written as


                                  Gt + Rt Bt = Tt + Bt+1 ,                              (7)


where the left hand side of equation (7) is the government’s expenditure on goods
plus the interest and repayment of principal on outstanding bonds, and the right
hand side of equation (7) is the sum of tax revenue and the funds raised by selling

                                               8
new bonds in period t. Substituting equation (6) into equation (7) yields


    Gt + Rt Bt = τ Lt wt At Ht + τ K
                                   t [Kt FK (Kt , At Ht ) + (1 − δ) Kt − Kt+1 ] + Bt+1 .   (8)



3     Households

The representative household supplies labor, consumes goods and leisure, holds gov-
ernment bonds and the economy’s capital stock, and pays taxes. The household rents
the capital stock to firms during period t at a rental price of rt per unit of capital, and
pays taxes on capital income, net of the immediate expensing of capital expenditures.
    The representative household maximizes the infinite-horizon utility function

                                        X
                                        ∞

                                        t=0


where Ct is the household’s consumption of goods in period t and lt is the household’s
leisure in period t. I assume that the household is endowed with one hour of time
per period, so lt = 1 − Ht .        I also assume that β < 1, uc > 0, ucc < 0, ul > 0,
and ull < 0.       The utility function in equation (9) does not depend on the level
of government purchases.          Strictly speaking, this exclusion of Gt from the utility
function (and from the production function) means that government purchases are
purely wasteful.     More generally, the inclusion of Gt in the utility function would
have no eﬀect on household decisions, provided that the utility function is additively
separable in Gt and (Ct , lt ).
    The budget constraint of the household is


           Ct + [Kt+1 − (1 − δ) Kt ] + Bt+1                                          (10)

                                                   9
       The left hand side of the budget constraint in equation (10) contains the house-
hold’s expenditure on consumption in period t, Ct , the expenditure on new capital
goods in period t, It = Kt+1 − (1 − δ) Kt , and the purchase of new one-period govern-
ment bonds in period t, Bt+1 . The four terms on the right hand side of the budget
constraint in equation (10) are, respectively, the household’s after-tax wage income,
¡        ¢
 1 − τ Lt wt At Ht , the household’s after-tax capital income (before taking account of
                                 ¡        ¢
the expensing of investment), 1 − τ K   t   rt Kt , the value of the reduction in period t
taxes resulting from the expensing of capital expenditures, τ K
                                                              t [Kt+1 − (1 − δ) Kt ],

and the interest and principal received from maturing one-period bonds in period t.
       The household chooses the sequences of consumption, Ct , hours of work, Ht ,
capital, Kt+1 , and bonds, Bt+1 , to maximize utility in equation (9) subject to the
budget constraint in equation (10).3 The lagrangian for this problem is

     Equation (16) equates the loss in utility from working an additional hour, and
thus reducing leisure by an hour, in period t to the increase in utility that can be
achieved by working an additional hour, earning an additional after-tax income of
¡        ¢
 1 − τ Lt At FL (Kt , At Ht ), and using this income to increase consumption in period
t.    Equations (17) and (18) are both illustrations of the standard intertemporal
optimization condition that requires the product of the intertemporal marginal rate
of substitution and the gross rate of return on an asset to be equal to one. In both
equations, the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution is given by the term in the
first set of square brackets on the left hand side.          In the case of capital, the gross
rate of return is the term in the second set of square brackets on the left hand side of

                                                 11
equation (17). In the presence of immediate expensing of capital expenditures, the
eﬀective price of capital in period t is 1 − τ K
                                               t . The after-tax payoﬀ in period t + 1

to a unit of capital purchased in period t is the after-tax marginal product of capital,
¡         ¢
 1 − τK
      t+1 FK (Kt+1 , At+1 Ht+1 ), plus the value of the remaining fraction 1 − δ of the

unit of capital, which has an after-tax price of 1−τ K
                                                     t+1 in period t+1. Thus, the gross

rate of return on capital is the ratio of the after-tax payoﬀ in period t + 1 accruing
to a unit of capital purchased in period t to the eﬀective purchase price of capital in
period t. In the case of bonds, the gross rate of return is simply Rt+1 , so equation
(18) shows that the product of the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution and
the gross rate of return on bonds equals one.



4    Allocation with Lump-sum Taxes

If the government can levy lump-sum taxes, then it can achieve the optimal allocation
by setting the tax rates on labor income and capital income equal to zero.            With
τK     L
 t = τ t = 0, the household’s first-order conditions in equations (16) - (18) become

Equations (19) - (21) characterize the optimal allocation of Ct , Ht , Kt+1 , and Bt+1
that would prevail under lump-sum taxes.

5     Taxes that Satisfy Optimality Conditions

Now return to the case in which there are no lump-sum taxes.                 The government
has available only taxes on labor income and on capital income, as described earlier.
Let τ Lt = 0 for all t, and let the capital income tax rate τ K
                                                              t be constant for all

t. Observe that with a zero tax on labor income and a constant tax rate on capital
income, with immediate expensing of capital expenditures, the household’s first-order
conditions in equations (16) - (18) are identical to the first-order conditions describing
the optimal allocation in equations (19) - (21). This equivalence reflects the fact that
with full expensing, the capital income tax is neutral, i.e., that it does not distort
the optimal choice of the capital stock. Notice that the replication of the optimal
allocation with a constant capital income tax rate is not just a steady-state result. It
holds for arbitrary (deterministic) paths of labor-augmenting technical progress, At ,
and arbitrary (deterministic) paths of government purchases, Gt , provided that the
capital income tax can raise suﬃcient revenue to pay for government purchases.
    Lucas (1990, p. 300) pointed out that “a tax on capital income combined with
an investment tax credit can imitate a capital levy perfectly” and thus is non-
distortionary.    Though he did not state the magnitude of the appropriate invest-
ment tax credit, inspection of equation (5) reveals that the investment tax credit
rate must equal the capital income tax rate, τ K
                                               t , for the capital income tax to be

non-distortionary. That is, if gross capital income is taxed at rate τ K
                                                                       t , and if there is

an investment tax credit at rate ν t in period t, capital income tax revenue in period
t is TtK = τ K
             t Kt FK (Kt , Lt ) − ν t It . If the investment tax credit rate, ν t , is set equal

to the capital income tax rate, τ K
                                  t , this expression for capital income tax revenue is

identical to equation (5), and the capital income tax is non-distortionary.
    Now that we have shown that a constant capital income tax rate combined with
immediate expensing (or the equivalent investment tax credit) is non-distortionary,


                                              13
we turn to the second major, and less well explored, question in this paper: Can a
non-distortionary tax on capital income collect enough revenue to pay for government
purchases, without having to resort to additional (distortionary) taxes?



6     How Much Revenue Can be Collected by a Non-

      distortionary Tax on Capital Income?

In this section, I will analyze the amount of revenue that can be collected by a constant
tax rate on capital income with immediate expensing of capital expenditures. I begin
by calculating capital income tax revenue in an arbitrary period t. Next, to illustrate
the size of capital income tax revenue, I will focus on balanced growth paths. First,
I will analyze the special case with constant At and Gt , so that there is a steady
state. Then I will analyze balanced growth paths with non-negative growth rates.
The reason for analyzing the two cases separately is that the utility function must
satisfy some additional restrictions in order for a balanced growth path with positive
growth to exist.    The steady state does not require additional restrictions on the
utility function.


6.1    Capital Income Tax Revenue in an Arbitrary Period

To calculate taxable capital income in the presence of a constant tax rate, set the
left hand side of equation (17) equal to the left hand side of equation (18), and set
τK       K
 t+1 = τ t to obtain

                             FK (Kt , At Ht ) = Rt − 1 + δ.                         (22)

                 Kt+1
Define γ t+1 ≡    Kt
                        to be the gross growth rate of the capital stock from period t to
period t + 1. Substituting γ t+1 Kt for Kt+1 in equation (4) and rearranging yields

                                          ¡             ¢
                                      It = γ t+1 − 1 + δ Kt .                                     (23)


   Define Xt to be taxable capital income, with immediate expensing, in period t, so


                                   Xt ≡ Kt FK (Kt , At Ht ) − It .                                (24)


Substituting equations (22) and (23) into equation (24) yields

                                              ¡          ¢
                                          Xt = Rt − γ t+1 Kt .                                    (25)


   To express taxable capital income as a share of output, Yt , multiply both sides of
                    Kt                    Kt FK (Kt ,At Ht )
equation (22) by    Yt
                       ,   define η t ≡          Yt
                                                               as the capital share in income in period
t, and rearrange to obtain
                                                      ηt
                                          Kt =               Yt .                                 (26)
                                                  Rt − 1 + δ

Substitute equation (26) into equation (25) to obtain

                                                 Rt − γ t+1
                                          Xt =              η Yt .                                (27)
                                                 Rt − 1 + δ t

   Equation (27) shows the value of taxable capital income in an arbitrary period t.

back to period t,                                  Ã j             !

It can be shown that4,5
                                               Pt = Rt Kt .                                            (29)

       Equation (29) implies that if capital income is taxed at rate τ K from period t
onward, the present value of capital income tax revenue is τ K Rt Kt . Thus, in terms
of its eﬀects on tax revenue, this policy is equivalent to a one-time government seizure
of a fraction τ K Rt of the capital stock in period t. In other contexts, governments
that can seize capital once may face a temptation to seize capital again. This is the
nature of the classic time-consistency problem. However, with the capital income tax
analyzed here, there is no time-consistency problem, provided that the capital income
tax—or the equivalent one-time capital levy—can collect suﬃcient revenue to fund gov-
ernment purchases. The capital income tax in this economy is non-distortionary and
the economy achieves the first-best allocation, so there is no incentive for the govern-
ment to try to set a lower tax rate initially to entice additional capital accumulation
only to seize it later.
       For an economy that is in a very early stage of development with a very low level
of the capital stock, Kt , equation (29) might appear to imply that the opportunity
to finance government purchases with the capital income tax described here is very
limited. However, it is important to recognize that a very low value of Kt implies

      This result is based on the assumption that there exists a t∗ > 0 and ε > 0 such that for all

that Rt = FK (Kt , At Ht ) + 1 − δ is very high. The high value of Rt implies that Pt
can be substantially larger than Kt . In addition, the high value of Rt means that
future taxable capital income is discounted at a very high rate, which would make
the value of Pt appear small relative to the future flows of taxable capital income. A
more appropriate way to gauge the size of taxable capital income and the possibility
of financing government purchases with a capital income tax is to compare flows over
long periods of time, such as in a steady state or along a balanced growth path. I
now turn to these cases.


6.2    Steady State

Suppose that the index of labor-augmenting technical progress, At , and government
purchases, Gt , are both constant and that the economy is in a steady state with
constant capital, K, investment, I = δK, consumption, C, hours, H, and tax rate
                                                         Kt+j
τ K . Because the capital stock is constant, γ t+j ≡    Kt+j−1
                                                                 = 1, for j = 0, 1, 2, .... In
this case, equation (18) implies


                                   Rt = β −1 ≡ 1 + ρ,                                    (30)


where ρ > 0 is defined to be the rate of time preference. Substituting equation (30)
into equation (25) and setting γ t+1 = 1 yields steady-state taxable capital income
(where I have omitted the time subscripts because these variables are constant in a
steady state)
                                       X = ρK.                                           (31)

Multiplying steady-state taxable capital income in equation (31) by the tax rate on
capital income, τ K , yields
                                     T K = τ K ρK.                                       (32)


                                          17
   Taxable capital income in the steady state is the product of the rate of time
preference, ρ, and the capital stock, K.               Because the constant tax rate τ K is not
distortionary, tax revenue is proportional to τ K for 0 ≤ τ K < 1. That is, there is
no Laﬀer curve for τ K . By setting τ K arbitrarily close to one, the government can
collect capital income tax revenue that is arbitrarily close to taxable capital income,
which is ρK in the steady state.
   The steady-state capital-output ratio is obtained by substituting equation (30)
into equation (26), which yields

                                                    η
                                            Kt =       Yt .                                                (33)

To relate steady-state tax revenue to steady-state output, substitute equation (33)
into equation (32) to obtain
                                                     ρ

suppose that the rate of time preference is ρ = 0.01, the depreciation rate is δ = 0.08,
and the capital share is η = 0.33.            In this case, taxable capital income is 3.67%
of total income. In the next subsection, I will show that along a balanced growth

substantially higher.


6.3    Balanced Growth Path

In this subsection, I consider balanced growth paths along which the capital stock,
consumption, and eﬀective hours of work all grow at the same constant gross rate
γ ≥ 1, which is the exogenous growth rate of the index of labor-augmenting technical
                                 Kt+1       Ct+1        At+1
progress, At .   Specifically,    Kt
                                        =    Ct
                                                   =     At
                                                               = γ.    In order for the economy to


                                                   18
be able to attain such a balanced growth path, I assume that the utility function
u (Ct , lt ) has a constant elasticity with respect to Ct and is multiplicatively separable
in Ct and lt . Specifically,

                                                  1
                                u (Ct , lt ) =       Ct1−α v (lt )                    (35)
                                                 1−α

where α > 0 is the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, v () > 0,
v0 () has the same sign as 1 − α, and v00 () has the opposite sign of 1 − α. I assume
that βγ 1−α < 1, so that along a balanced growth path the present value of the stream
of current and future utility in equation (9) is finite.
   Using the utility function in equation (35), along with τ Lt = 0 and τ K
                                                                          t = τ
                                                                                K
                                                                                  for
all t, the household’s first-order conditions in equations (16) - (18) can be written as


                          1
             (Ht ) :         Ct v0 (1 − Ht ) = At (FL (Kt , At Ht )) v (1 − Ht )      (36)
                         1−α

                       ∙ −α                 ¸
                         Ct+1 v (1 − Ht+1 )
          (Kt+1 ) :     β −α                  [FK (Kt+1 , At+1 Ht+1 ) + 1 − δ] = 1    (37)
                          Ct v (1 − Ht )

                                     ∙ −α                 ¸
                                       Ct+1 v (1 − Ht+1 )
                        (Bt+1 ) :     β −α                  Rt+1 = 1.                 (38)
                                        Ct v (1 − Ht )

   Along a balanced growth path, At , Kt and Ct all grow at gross rate γ, while
hours per worker, Ht , the marginal products FL (Kt , At Ht ) and FK (Kt , At Ht ), and
the capital share in income, η t , are constant. Therefore, equation (38) implies


                                         Rt = β −1 γ α .                              (39)


Substituting equation (39) into equation (25) yields taxable capital income as a func-

where the inequality on the right hand side follows from the assumption that βγ 1−α <

fraction of output along a balanced growth path,

Multiplying taxable capital income in equation (41) by the tax rate τ K yields capital
income tax revenue along a balanced growth path

Note that when γ = 1, so that the balanced growth path is a steady state, equation
(42) becomes identical to equation (34).
   Table 1 shows the share of taxable capital income, Xt , in total income, Yt , for

various values of α, the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, and γ,
the exogenous growth rate of At . The calculations in this table are based on a capital
income share η = 0.33, a rate of time preference ρ = 0.01, and a depreciation rate
δ = 0.08. The first column of results in Table 1 shows that in a steady state, i.e., with
γ = 1, taxable capital income is 3.7% of total income, as shown in subsection 6.2,
regardless of the value of α. Table 1 shows that with modest growth and a modest
value of α, the share of taxable capital income in total income can be substantially
higher. For instance, with growth of one percent per year, i.e., γ = 1.01, and α = 5,
taxable capital income is 12.0% of total income, which is more than triple the value
in the absence of growth. With growth of two percent per year and α = 5, taxable
capital income is 16.1% of total income.



7     Eﬀective Tax Rate on Capital

The taxation of capital income in actual tax codes generally depends on an array of
tax parameters including the tax rate on taxable capital income, the specification of
depreciation allowances used to compute taxable capital income, and possibly also
an investment tax credit rate and the extent to which financing costs are deductible.
The concept of the eﬀective tax rate on capital provides a scalar measure of the degree
to which all of the relevant aspects of the tax code together aﬀect a firm’s optimal
capital stock. In this section, I derive the eﬀective tax rate on capital in the special
case in which there is no investment tax credit and in which financing costs are not
deductible by purchasers of capital. I will then use the eﬀective tax rate on capital in
this case to show the relationship between the results of this paper and the findings
of Chamley (1986) and Judd (1985).
    As a prelude to calculating the eﬀective tax rate on capital, I will briefly review
the calculation of the present value of depreciation deductions, z, introduced by Hall

                                           21
and Jorgenson (1967). Consider a unit of capital that is purchased in period t for
a price of $1, and let D (a) ≥ 0 be the depreciation allowance in period t + a when
the unit of capital has age a ≥ 0. If nominal cash flows are discounted at rate i,
         P                          P∞
then z = ∞  a=0 (1 + i)−a
                          D (a). If  a=0 D (a) = 1 and i > 0, then z ≤ 1, with strict

inequality if D (0) < 1. With immediate expensing, D (0) = 1 and D (a) = 0, for
a = 1, 2, 3..., so z = 1.
   Consider a firm that pays a capital income tax at constant rate τ K on taxable
income, which is calculated as gross capital income minus a specified depreciation
allowance. Let Mt be the present value of the stream of pre-tax marginal products of
capital accruing to the undepreciated portion of a unit of capital purchased in period
t. Suppose that Mt is a decreasing function of (1 − δ) Kt + It = Kt+1 . Let χt be
the price of acquiring a unit of capital in period t, and let zχt be the present value
of depreciation deductions over the life of the capital good.     The optimal value of
investment in period t, It , satisfies

                              ¡       ¢    ¡         ¢
                               1 − τ K Mt = 1 − τ K z χt ,                          (43)


where the left hand side of equation (43) is the present value of the stream of after-tax
marginal products of capital accruing to the undepreciated portion of a unit of capital
acquired in period t, and the right hand side of equation (43) is the cost of acquiring
a unit of capital in period t, net of the present value of the depreciation tax shield
associated with capital.
   The eﬀective tax rate on capital, b
                                     τ , is the value of the tax rate on gross capital
income, i.e., capital income without deducting any allowance for depreciation, from
period t onward such that the optimal capital stock is the same as implied by equation




                                           22
(43). Therefore, the eﬀective tax rate satisfies


                                   (1 − b  ct = χ
                                        τ) M    bt ,                              (44)


      ct is the present value of the stream of pre-tax marginal products of capital
where M
accruing to the undepreciated portion of a unit of capital purchased in period t, and
bt is the marginal cost of investment in period t when gross capital income is taxed at
χ
rate b
     τ . The value of b
                      τ is chosen so that the path of the capital stock under the gross
capital income tax at rate b
                           τ is identical to the path of the capital stock associated
with equation (43) when capital income, net of depreciation allowances, is taxed at
rate τ K . Since the financing cost is not deductible in either case, the discount rate
                              ct = Mt and χ
is the same in both cases, so M           b = χt . Therefore, dividing each side of
equation (44) by the corresponding side of equation (43) yields

                                            1 − τK
                                  1−b
                                    τ=             .                              (45)
                                           1 − τKz

Equation (45) can be rearranged to obtain the following expression for the eﬀective
tax rate on capital
                                          1−z K
                                   b
                                   τ=            τ .                              (46)
                                        1 − τ Kz

   In the prescription for optimal tax policy that I have described in this paper,
as well as in the Chamley-Judd prescription for the long run, the eﬀective tax rate
on capital is zero.   However, my prescription and the Chamley-Judd prescription
obtain zero eﬀective tax rates in diﬀerent ways that have fundamentally diﬀerent
implications for the amount of revenue collected by the optimal capital income tax.
The Chamley-Judd prescription sets τ K equal to zero, which according to equation
(46), achieves a zero eﬀective tax rate on capital. However, with τ K = 0, the capital
income tax does not collect any revenue, so it becomes necessary to use distortionary

                                          23
labor income taxation to collect revenue. My prescription for the optimal taxation
of capital income, which includes immediate expensing, implies z = 1.          Equation
(46) shows that with z = 1 the eﬀective tax rate on capital is zero for any non-
negative tax rate τ K less than 1. Thus, unlike the Chamley-Judd prescription, my
prescription attains a zero eﬀective tax rate on capital, while retaining the ability to
collect revenue using the capital income tax, by setting τ K greater than zero. As I
have shown in Section 6, a substantial amount of capital income tax revenue can be
collected with this prescription. If the capital income tax can collect enough revenue
to pay for government purchases, there is no need to use distortionary labor income
taxation.



8     Consumption Goods Tax with a Labor Subsidy

In this section, I illustrate an alternative tax system that can achieve the same allo-
cation of consumption, leisure, and capital that can be achieved by lump-sum taxes.
This alternative system combines a tax on consumption goods, levied at a constant
rate over time, with a subsidy to labor. A consumption goods tax levied at a con-
stant rate over time does not distort intertemporal margins, so it would not distort
capital accumulation. If labor supply were perfectly inelastic, i.e., if leisure were not
in the utility function, a constant tax rate on consumption goods would not aﬀect
the equilibrium allocation. However, when utility depends on leisure, a tax on the
consumption good reduces the price of leisure relative to the taxed consumption good
and thus eﬀectively subsidizes leisure. To counteract this eﬀect, leisure must also be
taxed, which eﬀectively subsidizes labor, to replicate the allocation with lump-sum
taxes.
    To examine the eﬀects of a tax on the consumption good combined with a labor
subsidy, I modify the model presented in Sections 1 - 3 by eliminating the capital

                                           24
income tax and replacing it with a tax on consumption. Specifically, letting τ C
                                                                               t > −1

be the tax rate on the consumption good in period t,6 total tax revenue in period t is


                                        Tt = τ Lt wt At Ht + τ C
                                                               t Ct .                              (47)


With the capital income tax replaced by a tax on the consumption good, the budget
constraint of the household in equation (10) is modified to

  ¡       ¢                                 ¡        ¢
   1 + τC                                          L

    The tax rate on the consumption good can be larger than 100%, but (to keep the subsidized
price of the consumption good positive) any subsidy to the consumption good must be smaller than
100%.

(51) and (52) equals one, so these equations are identical to equations (20) and (21),
respectively, for an economy with lump-sum taxation. However, a tax on the con-
sumption good alone will not fully reproduce the allocation in an economy with
lump-sum taxes because the tax on the consumption good distorts the labor-leisure
choice, as is evident in equation (50). If labor income is subsidized to the same extent
                                                                                  1−τ L

tion (50) equals one, and this equation is identical to equation (19) for the economy
with lump-sum taxes. Therefore, the allocation that would prevail under lump-sum
taxes can be achieved by taxing the consumption good at a constant rate τ C while
subsidizing labor with a negative labor income tax rate τ L = −τ C .
   To calculate the amount of tax revenue that can be collected with τ L = −τ C ,
substitute Yt − It − Gt for Ct (since the economy is a closed economy) in equation
(47), and use τ L = −τ C to obtain


                               Tt = τ C (Yt − It − Gt − wt At Ht ) .                          (53)


Use the facts that Yt = Kt FK (Kt , At Ht )+At Ht FL (Kt , At Ht ) and wt = FL (Kt , At Ht ),
to rewrite equation (53) as


                             Tt = τ C [Kt FK (Kt , At Ht ) − It − Gt ] .                      (54)


Use the expression for taxable capital income with immediate expensing, Xt , in equa-




                                                 26
tion (24) to rewrite equation (54) as


                                  Tt = τ C (Xt − Gt ) .                            (55)


Henceforth, I will confine attention to cases in which τ C > 0 and the tax revenue
in equation (55) is positive, so I assume that Gt < Xt . Thus, as shown formally in
equation (56) below, to collect a given amount of tax revenue in any period in which
Gt > 0, τ C would be higher than the capital income tax rate τ K that would lead to
the same optimal allocation, even though (as in the United States), consumption can
be far larger than capital income net of investment expenditure.      The reason that
τ C exceeds τ K is that in order for the consumption tax system to be optimal it must
include a subsidy to labor income, which essentially gives back much of the revenue
collected by the tax on the consumption good.
   To derive the relation between the value of τ C in an optimal consumption tax
system and the value of τ K in an optimal capital income tax system that would collect
the same amount of revenue, I will now focus on balanced growth paths for which Gt
and Bt both grow at the gross rate γ, which is the growth rate of At , Kt , Ct , and
Yt . I have shown that the optimal allocation can be attained either by taxing capital
income, with immediate expensing, at rate τ K or by taxing the consumption good
at rate τ C and subsidizing labor income at rate τ C . Equating τ K Xt , the tax revenue
collected by the capital income tax and τ C (Xt − Gt ), the tax revenue collected by
the consumption goods tax and labor income subsidy in equation (55), yields

                                          Xt
                               τC =             τK ≥ τK.                           (56)
                                        Xt − Gt

Thus, as discussed above, if Gt > 0, the consumption tax rate τ C must exceed the
capital income tax rate τ K that collects the same total revenue.


                                            27
   In order for the amount of government bonds to grow at rate γ, the amount of
tax revenue, Tt , collected in period t must satisfy


                      Tt = Gt + Rt Bt − Bt+1 = Gt + (R − γ) Bt ,                   (57)


where the second equality follows from the fact that γ t+1 and Rt+1 are constant along
balanced growth paths.     Under the capital income tax with immediate expensing,
the amount of tax revenue, τ K Xt , must equal the right hand side of equation (57),
which implies that
                               Gt = τ K Xt − (R − γ) Bt .                          (58)

Substituting equation (58) into equation (56) and simplifying yields


                                               τK
                              τC =                      Bt
                                                           .                       (59)
                                     1 − τK   + (R − γ) Xt


   Along a balanced growth path with no government debt outstanding, equation
(59) implies
                                                τK
                                     τC =            .                             (60)
                                              1 − τK

Equation (60) indicates that the amount by which τ C exceeds τ K can be substantial.
For instance, if τ K = 50%, then an optimal consumption tax system would have to
set τ C = 100% to collect the same amount of revenue.
   The tax rate τ C is levied directly on the consumption good, represented by Ct .
However, the consumption bundle in period t consists of both leisure and the con-
sumption good, so a true consumption tax would tax leisure at rate τ C as well.
Taxing leisure at rate τ C is the same as subsidizing labor income at rate τ C .    In
the absence of any tax (positive or negative) on labor income, a household can in-
crease its consumption of leisure in period t by reducing its labor by one hour and



                                            28
foregoing the hourly wage At wt . However, if labor income is subsidized at rate τ C ,
                                    ¡       ¢
so that the after-tax hourly wage is 1 + τ C wt At , then the after-tax price of leisure
   ¡      ¢
is 1 + τ C wt At . Thus, a subsidy to labor income at rate τ C is a tax on leisure at
rate τ C .
    I have shown that a constant tax rate on the entire consumption bundle, which
can be implemented by a constant tax rate on the consumption good together with
a constant subsidy to labor income at the same rate, is equivalent to the optimal
capital income tax with immediate expensing.         It is important to note, however,
that some tax proposals that purport to be consumption taxes are actually taxes on
consumption goods that fail to tax leisure. For instance, the Hall-Rabushka (1995)
proposal for a “flat tax” is described by its originators as a consumption tax. Hall
and Rabushka proposed to implement their consumption goods tax by taxing both
capital income and labor income. They define taxable capital income to be the same
as I have discussed in this paper.     That is, they propose immediate expensing of
capital expenditures. However, their proposed tax system also levies a tax on labor,
and thus is distortionary if leisure enters the utility function in a nontrivial way.
    To summarize, if the optimal tax system is to be implemented by taxing income,
then taxable capital income should be calculated with immediate expensing and labor
income should not be taxed at all. Hall and Rabushka specify taxation of capital in-
come that includes immediate expensing, but their proposed taxation of labor income
is distortionary. Alternatively, if the optimal tax system is to be implemented as a
consumption tax, it must tax the entire consumption bundle by taxing the consump-
tion good and taxing leisure by subsidizing labor income. Hall and Rabushka propose
to tax only the consumption good, and thus their proposed system is distortionary.

9     Concluding Remarks

A classic problem in public finance is to determine how the government can collect
revenue in the least distortionary way possible, given that lump-sum taxes are not
available.   In a general equilibrium Ramsey framework with infinitely-lived house-
holds, Chamley (1986) and Judd (1985) have shown that in the long run it is optimal
for the tax rate on capital to be zero.     In their analyses, the government would
collect tax revenue in the long run by taxing labor income.      In this paper, I have
re-examined the conditions, previously derived without general equilibrium consider-
ations, under which the tax rate on capital income does not aﬀect the optimal capital
stock of a firm.   The possibility that a capital income tax can be levied in a way
that does not aﬀect the capital investment decision is tantalizing because it may pro-
vide the government with a non-distortionary means to collect revenue. To examine
this possibility, I addressed two questions. First, does the invariance of the capital
investment choice to the tax rate on capital income, under appropriate assumptions
about the deductibility of capital expenditures, carry over to a general equilibrium
framework? Second, if the answer to the first question is aﬃrmative, can a capital
income tax that is non-distortionary collect a substantial amount of revenue?
    In response to the first question, I have shown that if purchasers of capital are
permitted to immediately expense capital expenditures, then in a Ramsey framework
with a representative infinitely-lived household, the accumulation of capital is invari-
ant to a tax rate on capital income that is constant over time. That is, a constant
capital income tax rate with immediate expensing is a non-distortionary tax in general
equilibrium, as well as in the context of a single firm that cannot deduct its financing
costs. For firms that can deduct financing costs, the situation is diﬀerent. For such
firms, economic depreciation leads to the invariance of capital accumulation to the
tax rate on capital in the context of a single firm; however, as shown in the Appendix,


                                          30
this invariance does not carry over to general equilibrium because the after-tax cost
of financing—not the pre-tax cost of financing—is invariant to the tax rate in general
equilibrium. Thus, I focused the body of the paper on the case without deductibility
of financing costs (as for an all-equity firm in the United States) and with immediate
expensing so that the capital income tax is non-distortionary.
   Since the answer to the first question is aﬃrmative with immediate expensing, I
then addressed the second question for the case of immediate expensing.      Taxable
capital income with immediate expensing is equal to capital income (revenue less
wages) minus investment expenditures.     Abel, Mankiw, Summers, and Zeckhauser
(1989) have shown that in a dynamically eﬃcient economy, capital income is larger
than investment, which implies that, even with immediate expensing, there is a posi-
tive amount of capital income to be taxed. Since capital accumulation is unaﬀected
by the level of the constant tax rate on capital income, provided there is immediate
expensing, there is no “Laﬀer curve” for the capital income tax rate. That is, the
amount of tax revenue collected from the capital income tax is proportional to the
tax rate.   The amount of revenue that can be collected is arbitrarily close to the
amount of taxable capital income in the economy. I derive expressions for the share
of taxable capital income in total income, both in a steady state and along a balanced
growth both. Illustrative calculations suggest that this amount could be substantial.
If one looks at U.S. data to judge the size of taxable capital income with immediate
expensing, one could start with gross capital income of about 1/3 of GDP and capital
investment expenditures of about 1/6 of GDP, so that taxable capital income is about
1/6 of GDP. Over the ten-year period ending in 2005, Federal government purchases
of goods and services were about 6.5% of GDP—an amount that could be financed by
a capital income tax rate of 39%. While some may regard this value of the capital
income tax rate as somewhat high, it is important to note that the labor income tax



                                         31
rate would be zero and that capital expenditures would be immediately expensed.

                                        Appendix
           Economic Depreciation with Deductibility of Financing Costs


   Hall and Jorgenson (1971) have shown, and the results of Samuelson (1964) imply,
that in the context of a single firm that takes its pre-tax cost of financing as fixed
and can deduct its cost of financing, the tax rate on capital income does not aﬀect
optimal capital accumulation if the firm is allowed to deduct economic depreciation
from gross capital income when it computes taxable capital income. Thus, it might
seem that economic depreciation and deductibility of financing costs provides another
opportunity for non-distortionary taxation of capital income. However, unlike in the
case of immediate expensing without deductibility of financing costs, the neutrality
result for a single firm does not carry over to a general equilibrium framework. To
illustrate why this neutrality result does not carry over to general equilibrium, I
begin by illustrating the neutrality result for a single firm that takes the pre-tax cost
of financing as fixed.
   Consider an infinitely-lived firm with revenue, net of wages, f (kt ) in period t,
where kt is the capital stock used by the firm in period t.               Suppose that capital
depreciates at rate δ per period, so that kt+1 − (1 − δ) kt is gross investment in period
t. Suppose that the tax rate on capital income in period t is τ K
                                                                t and that the firm

is allowed to deduct economic depreciation from net revenue in computing taxable
capital income. The pre-tax cost of financing is θ per period, and suppose that the
firm can deduct the cost of financing so that its after-tax cost of financing in period
    ¡        ¢
t is 1 − τ K
           t   θ. In this case, given k0 , the firm chooses the path of the capital stock

   Equation (A.3) illustrates the invariance of the firm’s optimal capital stock with
respect to the capital income tax rate. For any value the capital income tax rate,
τK                   K                                           0
 t , such that 0 ≤ τ t < 1, the optimal capital stock satisfies f (kt ) = δ + θ. This

invariance depends importantly on the fact that the pre-tax cost of financing, θ, is
invariant to the tax rate τ K
                            t .       However, in general equilibrium, the pre-tax cost of
financing will not remain invariant to τ K
                                         t , as I will now show.

   Consider the general equilibrium model introduced in Sections 1 - 3, but change
the tax treatment of capital income. Specifically, suppose that instead of immediate

depreciation δKt .    I will write the depreciation deduction in period t as Dt Kt to
include also the alternative depreciation allowance schedule that I introduce at the
end of this Appendix. With this specification of the tax treatment of capital income,

   If the allocation Ct , Ht , and Kt+1 , t = 0, 1, 2, ..., is to be invariant to the tax rate
on capital income, then the left hand side of equation (A.7) indicates that Rt+1 must
be invariant to the tax rate on capital income. The gross rate of return Rt+1 is an
after-tax gross rate of return. The invariance of economic depreciation in the context
of a single firm is predicated on the invariance of the pre-tax cost of financing to the
tax rate on capital income, so that the after-tax cost of financing is a decreasing
function of the tax rate. Because the after-tax cost of financing is invariant to the
tax rate in general equilibrium, economic depreciation does not lead to neutrality
with respect to the tax rate on capital income, as I will show below.

                                                         35
       Setting the left hand sides of equations (A.6) and (A.7) equal to each other yields

                 ¡        ¢

In the case of economic depreciation, Dt = δ, so equation (A.8) can be rewritten as

                                                            Rt+1 − 1
                            FK (Kt+1 , At+1 Ht+1 ) − δ =             .                       (A.9)
                                                            1 − τK
                                                                 t+1



       If the allocation Ct , Ht , and Kt+1 , t = 0, 1, 2, ..., is to be invariant to the tax
rate on capital income, then the left hand side of equation (A.9) must be invariant
to the tax rate on capital income, and, as discussed above, Rt+1 must be invariant
to the tax rate on capital income. However, unless Rt+1 = 1, the right hand side of
equation (A.9) depends on τ K
                            t+1 , which would be inconsistent with the left hand side

being invariant to τ K
                     t+1 . Therefore, economic depreciation will not, in general, make

the capital income tax a non-distortionary tax in general equilibrium.7
       Economic depreciation does not make capital accumulation invariant to the tax
rate on capital income in general equilibrium because the after-tax cost of financing
is invariant to the tax rate. In the context of a single firm, when the after-tax cost
of financing is invariant to the tax rate on capital income, neutrality of the tax rate
requires that the present value of depreciation allowances, z, must equal one. I will
show that it is possible to augment economic depreciation to achieve z = 1, and thus
to achieve neutrality; however, under this alternative neutral tax scheme, taxable
capital income is identically zero.
       Suppose that the depreciation factor, Dt , that is introduced in equation (A.4) is
   7
    If it were to turn out that Rt+1 = 1, then equation (A.9) implies that taxable capital income,
FK (Kt+1 , At+1 Ht+1 ) Kt+1 − δKt+1 , would be zero. Therefore, even if it turned out that Rt+1 = 1,
so that economic depreciation would lead to tax rate neutrality, the capital income tax would not
be able to collect any revenue.

where Rt is the after-tax gross rate of return on bonds in equation (A.7). A unit of
capital purchased in period t increases the capital stock in period t + j, j = 1, 2, 3, ...,

be shown that with the specification of depreciation allowances in equation (A.10),
zt = 1.8 To see that the depreciation allowance specified in equation (A.10) is neutral,
substitute Rt − 1 + δ for Dt in equation (A.8) to obtain

which implies
                              FK (Kt+1 , At+1 Ht+1 ) + 1 − δ = Rt+1                           (A.12)

regardless of the value of τ K
                             t+1 . The amount of taxable income, with the depreciation

allowance specification in equation (A.10) is


         FK (Kt , At Ht ) Kt − Dt Kt = [FK (Kt , At Ht ) − (Rt − 1 + δ)] Kt = 0,              (A.13)


where the second equality follows from equation (A.12). Thus, the neutral tax scheme
in equation (A.10) will generate precisely zero taxable capital income in each period.
