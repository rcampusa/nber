Why Do Americans Work so Much More than Europeans?

JEL No. E6, H3

                                           ABSTRACT

Americans now work 50 percent more than do the Germans, French, and Italians. This was not the

case in the early 1970s when the Western Europeans worked more than Americans. In this paper,

I examine the role of taxes in accounting for the differences in labor supply across time and across

countries, in particular, the effect of the marginal tax rate on labor income. The population of

countries considered is that of the G-7 countries, which are the major advanced industrial countries.

The surprising finding is that this marginal tax rate accounts for the predominance of the differences

at points in time and the large change in relative labor supply over time with the exception of the

Italian labor supply in the early 1970s. This finding has important implications for policy, in

particular for making social security programs solvent.

1. Introduction

   Americans, that is, residents of the United States, now work much more than do

Europeans. Using labor market statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation

and Development (OECD), I find that Americans on a per person aged 15-64 basis work in

the market sector 50 percent more than do the French. This was not always the case. In the

early 1970s, Americans allocated less time to the market than did the French. The

comparisons between Americans and Germans or Italians are the same. Why are there such

large differences in labor supply across these countries? Why did the relative labor supplies

change so much over time? In this lecture, I determine the importance of tax rates in

accounting for these differences in labor supply for the major advanced industrial countries

and find that tax rates alone account for most of these differences in labor supply.

   This finding has important implications for policy in particular for financing social

security retirement programs in Europe. On the pessimistic side, one implication is that

increasing tax rates will not solve the problem of these under funded plans, because

increasing tax rates will not increase revenue. On the positive side, the system can be

reformed in a way that makes the young better off while honoring promises to the old. This

can be accomplished by modifying the tax system so that when an individual works more and

produces more output, the individual gets to consume a larger fraction of this increase output.

   The major advanced industrial countries, which used to be called the G-7 countries, are

the European countries France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, plus Canada,

Japan, and the United States. For these countries comparable and sufficiently good statistics

are available to carry out this investigation. The data sources are the United Nations system

of national accounts (SNA) statistics and the OECD labor market statistics and purchasing
power GDP numbers.1 The periods considered are 1970–74 and 1993–96. The later period

was chosen because it is the most recent period prior to the U.S. telecommunications/dot-

com boom of the late 1990s, a period when the relative size of unmeasured output was

probably significantly larger than normal and there may have been associated problems with

the market hours statistics. The early period was selected because it is the earliest one for

which sufficiently good data are available to carry out the analysis. The relative numbers

subsequent to 2000 are pretty much the same as they were in the pre technology boom period

1993-96.

    I emphasize that my labor supply measure is hours worked per person 15-64 in the taxed

market sector. The two principal margins of work effort are hours actually worked by

employees and the fraction of the working age population that work. Paid vacations, sick

leave, and holidays are hours of non working time. The time of someone working in the

underground economy or in the home sector is not counted. Other things equal, a country

with more weeks of vacations and more holidays will have a lower labor supply in the sense

that I am using the term. I focus only on that part of working time that the resulting labor

income is taxed.




1
  For Italy the gross domestic product (GDP) is reduced by 20 percent because Italy’s GDP statistics include
estimates of the output of the underground untaxed economy. My theory is concerned with the above-ground
taxed economy, and I want GDP for this sector. This is why I do not follow Maddison (1995, pp. 241–50) and
increase the OECD labor supply numbers by 16.0 percent in the 1970–74 period and 17.6 percent in the 1993–
96 period.

   Table 1 reports the G-7 countries’ GDP, labor supply, and productivity statistics for the

1993–96 period relative to the United States. Also reported are GDP per person aged 15-64

and labor productivities also relative to the United States. The important observation is that

labor supply is much higher in Japan and the United States than it is in Germany, France, and

Italy. Canada and the United Kingdom are in the intermediate range. Another observation is

that U.S. per capita output is about 40 percent higher than in the European countries with

most of the differences in output accounted for by differences in hours worked per person

and not by differences in productivity, that is, in output per hour. Indeed, the OECD statistics

indicate that French productivity is 10 percent higher than it is in the United States. In Japan,


                                                3
the per capita output difference is accounted for by lower productivity and not by lower labor

supply.

   Table 2 shows a very different picture in the 1970–74 period. The difference is not in per

capita GDP. Then, European per capita GDP was about 70 percent of the U.S. level, as it was

in 1993–96 and is today. However, the reason for the lower output in Europe was not fewer

market hours, as was the case in the 1993–96 period, but rather lower output per hour. In

1970–74, Europeans worked more than Americans. The exception is Italy. Some change

resulted in these changes in labor supply.




                                              4
      2. Theory Used

         The theory used is standard. It is the theory used in quantitative studies of business

cycles (Cooley (1995)), of depressions (Cole and Ohanian (1999) and Kehoe and Prescott

(2002)), of public finance issues (Christiano and Eichenbaum (1992) and Baxter and King

(1993)), and of the stock market (McGrattan and Prescott (2000, 2003) and Boldrin,

Christiano, and Fisher (2001)). In focusing on labor supply, I am following Lucas and

Rapping (1969), Lucas (1972), Kydland and Prescott (1982), Hansen (1985), and Auerbach

and Kotlikoff (1987).

         This theory has a stand-in household that faces a labor-leisure decision and a

consumption-savings decision. The preferences of this stand-in household are ordered by

                             ∞
(1)                      E{∑ β t ( log ct + α log(100 − ht ) )} .
                            t =0


Variable c denotes consumption, and h denotes hours of labor supplied to the market sector

per person per week. The discount factor 0 < β < 1 specifies the degree of patience, with a

higher value being more patient. The parameter α > 0 specifies the value of nonmarket

productive time to the household. Given that on a per person basis a household has about

100 hours of productive time a week, nonmarket productive time is 100 – h hours per week

per working-age person in the household. Following the tradition in macroeconomics, this

nonmarket productive time will be referred to as leisure even though much of it is time

allocated to working in the nonmarket sector, and in the underground market sector. The

important thing for this analysis is that any production using this time is not taxed.

         In the model economy used, the household owns the capital and rents it to the firm.

This is an assumption of convenience because the findings are identical if the firm owns the




                                                    5
capital and the household owns the firm, or if the firm is partially debt financed. The law of

motion governing the capital stock is

(2)                         kt +1 = (1 − δ ) kt + xt .

        The theory also has a stand-in firm with a Cobb-Douglas production function,

(3)                         yt = ct + xt + gt ≤ Ait ktθ ht1−θ .

Here y denotes output, c consumption, x investment, g pure public consumption, and k the

capital stock. The capital cost share parameter is 0 < θ < 1, and the total factor productivity

parameter of country i at date t is Ait . I will not specify the process on { Ait } because it plays

no role in the inference being drawn, except to implicitly restrict the process governing its

evolution in such a way that results in the existence of a competitive equilibrium.

        The household’s date t budget constraint is

(4)     (1 + τc ) ct + (1 + τ x ) xt = (1 − τh ) wt ht + (1 − τk )(rt − δ) kt + δ kt + Tt ,

where wt is the real wage rate, rt the rental price of capital, τ c the consumption tax rate, τ x

the tax investment tax, τ h the marginal labor tax rate, τ k the capital income tax rate, and Tt

transfers. I emphasize that the marginal and average labor income taxes will be very

different.

        All taxes revenue except for that used to finance the pure public consumption are

given back to the households either as transfer payments or in kind. These transfers are lump

sum being independent of a household income. Most public expenditures are substitutes for

private consumption in the G-7 countries. Here I will assume that they substitute on a one-

to-one basis for private consumption with the exception of military expenditures. The goods

and services in question are mostly publicly provided education, health care, protection




                                                            6
services, and even judiciary services. My estimate of pure government consumption g is two

times military’s share of employment times GDP.

        In having only one consumption good, I am following Christiano and Eichenbaum

(1992). Rogerson (2003) has found that this one consumption good abstraction is not a good

one for studying aggregate labor supply in the Scandinavian countries. One possible reason

for this is that some publicly provided goods, such as child care for working parents, must be

treated as a separate good. Often the receipt of this good is contingent on working, and this

must be taken into account in the household’s constraint set. However, the one consumption

good abstraction used in this study is a reasonable one for the set of countries considered in

this study.

        This is a far simpler tax system than the one employed in any of the G-7 countries.

Introducing accelerated depreciation and investment tax credits would affect the price of the

investment good relative to the consumption good, but would not alter the inference drawn in

this lecture. Similarly, introducing a corporate sector, with dividends not taxed, as is

generally the case in Europe, or taxed as they are in the United Sates as ordinary income,

would not alter any conclusion significantly. For further details on these issues, see

McGrattan and Prescott (2002). What is important is the price of consumption relative to

leisure, and it is determined by the consumption tax rate τ c and the labor income tax rate τ h .

        The most important parameter that will enter the equilibrium relation that I use to

predict the consequence of the tax system is the preference parameter α , which measures the

value of leisure relative to consumption. The capital cost share parameter θ also enters the

relation, but is of less importance.




                                                7
Key equilibrium relation

        The labor and consumption tax rates can be combined into a single tax rate τ , which I

call the effective marginal tax rate on labor income. It is the fraction of additional labor

income that is taken in the form of taxes holding investment, or equivalently savings, fixed.

From the household’s budget constraint,

                       τ h +τ c
(5)               τ=            .
                        1+τ c

        Two first-order conditions are used to construct the key equilibrium relation that is

used to predict labor supply. The first is that the marginal rate of substitution between leisure

and consumption is equal to their price ratio; that is,

                  α (1 − h)
(6)                            = (1 − τ ) w .
                     1/ c

The second is the profit-maximizing condition that the wage equals the marginal product of

labor; that is,

(7)               w = (1 − θ )k θ h −θ = (1 − θ ) y / h .

From (6) and (7), the key relation is obtained, namely,

                               1−θ
(8)               hit =                       .
                                c it α
                          1−θ +
                                y it 1 − τ it

The subscript i denotes the country, and the subscript t denotes the date.

        This equilibrium relation clearly separates the intertemporal and intratemporal factors

affecting labor supply. The intratemporal factor is captured by 1 − τ , which distorts the

relative prices of consumption and leisure at a point in time. The c/y term captures

intertemporal factors. If, for example, the effective tax rate on labor income is expected to be

higher in the future, people will choose a lower current value for c/y, and current labor supply


                                                            8
will be higher. The same is true if the current capital stock is low relative to its balanced

growth path level. More formally, equilibrium c/y is a function of the predictive probability

distribution of future tax rates and productivities and the current capital stock. Knowing the

value of this function and the current effective tax rate on labor income suffices for

predicting current labor income.

         In focusing on the role of taxes in determining aggregate labor supply, I am not

implying that other factors are unimportant. Cole and Ohanian (1999) and Chari, Kehoe, and

McGrattan (2003), using the discipline employed here, present strong evidence that other

factors were important in accounting for the low labor supply in the United States in the

1930s. Similarly, Cole and Ohanian (2002) present evidence that the low labor supply in the

United Kingdom in the interwar period was due to other factors, and Fisher and Hornstein

(2002) find that labor market distortions that increased the real wage significantly above the

competitive level were the major factor in accounting for the huge decline in German output

in the 1928–32 period. In focusing on the role of marginal tax rates on labor income, I want

to determine what role, if any, they play in accounting for the huge differences in labor

supplies across this relatively homogenous set of market economies at a point in time and in

accounting for large changes over time in labor supplies across these countries.2

         The theory abstracts from many features of reality that affect labor supply, in

particular, whether a married household has one or two wage earners. This issue is discussed

briefly in the context of the change in the U.S. labor supply in conjunction with the change in

the nature of the income tax schedule that occurred as a result of the 1986 U.S. Tax Reform

Act.

(2003), Olovsson (2003), and Nickell (2003).

3. Estimating Tax Rates

        The theory has the household paying the taxes. Consequently, it is necessary to

adjust the national income accounts to be consistent with this theoretical framework. The

adjustment, which is a major one, is to treat indirect taxes less subsidies as net taxes on final

product. This means removing net indirect taxes as a cost component of GDP and reducing

final product components.

        In using national accounts (SNA) data to estimate tax rates and making the distinction

between prices facing producers and consumers, I am following Mendoza, Razin, and Tesar

(1994). There are some important differences in the approach with my estimated tax rates

being in greater part model economy dependent. In what follows the capital letters are SNA

statistics. I assumed that two-thirds of these indirect taxes net of subsidies fall directly on

private consumption expenditures and that the remaining one-third is distributed evenly over

private consumption and private investment. Thus, net indirect taxes on consumption, ITc ,

are

                                        C
(9)             ITc = [2 / 3 + 1 / 3       ] IT ,
                                       C+I

where C is SNA private consumption expenditures, I is SNA private investment, and IT is

net indirect taxes.

        The model economy’s consumption c and output y are

(10)            c = C + G − Gmil − ITc and          y = GDP − IT .

The motivation for this assignment of indirect taxes is that most indirect taxes fall on

consumption whether these taxes are a value-added tax, a sales tax, an excise tax, or a

property tax. Some taxes, such as fuel taxes on diesel fuel used by trucks that transport




                                                    10
goods, property taxes on office buildings, and sales taxes on equipment purchases by

businesses, fall on all forms of product. My estimate of the consumption tax rate is

                                  ITc
(11)                    τc =            .
                                C − ITc

       There are two taxes on labor income, the income tax with marginal rate τ inc and the

social security tax with marginal rate τ ss . My estimate of the social security tax rate is simply

                                Social Security Taxes
(12)                   τ ss =                           .
                                 (1 − θ ) (GDP − IT )


The denominator is labor income if labor is paid its marginal product.

       In some countries, some social security taxes are savings because retirement benefits

increase with income. But, this is a marginal tax rate. If someone works an additional year,

typically there are no additional benefits. In the United States the marginal savings factor is

tiny. First, using a 4 percent discount rate and a 2 percent growth rate in the real wage,

which are numbers for the U.S. economy in the twentieth century (McGrattan and Prescott

(2003)), the present value of benefits is only one-quarter of the present value of

contributions. Second, the social security payment benefit scheme is highly progressive.

Third, benefits to married couples typically go up little if both work rather than if only one

works. Fourth, beginning in the early 1990s, a significant part of social security benefits is

subject to income taxes for many people. Fifth, for many older workers their current-year

taxable labor income has little or no consequences for the retirement benefits they receive.

       Social security taxes are listed as an expenditure of the household sector in the SNA.

They include taxes used to finance health care and unemployment payments, and not just

taxes used to finance retirement programs. These taxes are typically proportional taxes on

labor income, and they are treated as such in this analysis. In the SNA these taxes are treated


                                                        11
as part of compensation, as theory says they should be, when they are paid by the employer,

which is typically the case.

        The average, not marginal, income tax rate is

                                     Direct Taxes
(13)                   τ inc =                             .
                                 GDP − IT − Depreciation


Direct taxes are those paid by households and do not include corporate income taxes. Like

social security taxes, they are listed as an expenditure of the household sector in the SNA.

       My estimate of the marginal labor income tax rate is

(14)                   τ h = τ ss + 1.6τ inc .

The most problematic number in my analysis is the 1.6 factor that reflects the fact that the

marginal income tax rates are higher than the average tax rates. The 1.6 number was selected

because it results in the marginal income tax rate obtained using the Feenberg and Coutts

(1993) methodology for the United States in both the 1970–74 and 1993–96 periods.

Feenberg and Coutts’ methodology uses a representative sample of tax records to compute

the marginal tax rate on labor income by determining how much tax revenue increases if

every household’s labor income is changed by 1 percent. The total change in tax receipts

divided by the total change in labor income is the Feenberg-Coutts estimate of the marginal

income tax rate on labor income. I will return to this point later.


4. Predicted and Actual Labor Supplies

       There are two parameters that must be specified before formula (8) can be used to

predict labor supply. The first parameter is the capital share parameter θ in the production

function. In all the countries, in both periods this number is close to the average of 0.3224,

so θ is set equal to this value for all countries in both periods. The second parameter is the



                                                    12
utility of leisure parameter α . This parameter was chosen so that overall the average labor

supply of the non-outlier observations, of which there are two, are close to actual. The value

chosen is 1.54.

   Table 3 reports the actual and predicted labor supplies for the G-7 countries in the 1993–

96 period. The predicted values are surprisingly close to the actual values with the average

difference being only 1.14 hours per week. I say that this number is surprisingly small

because this analysis abstracts from labor market policies and demographics which have

consequences for aggregate labor supply and because there are significant errors in

measuring the labor input.

                                             Table 3

 Germany                     0.59           0.74               19.3                19.5

   The important observation is that the low labor supplies in Germany, France, and Italy

are due to high tax rates. In these countries if someone works more and produces 100



                                              13
additional euros of output, that individual gets to consume only 40 euros of additional

consumption and pays directly or indirectly 60 euros in taxes.

   Table 4 reports the predicted and actual values for the 1970–74 period. For Italy it is

clear that some factor other than taxes depressed labor supply in the early 1970s. This period

was one of political instability in Italy, and quite possibly cartelization policies reduced

equilibrium labor supply as in the Cole and Ohanian (2002) model of the U.S. economy in

the 1935–39 period. The overly high prediction for labor supply for Japan in the 1970–74

period may in significant part be the result of my utility function having too little curvature

with respect to leisure and, as a result, the theory overpredicts when the effective tax rate on

labor income is low. Another possible reason for the overprediction may be a measurement

error. The 1970–74 Japanese labor supply statistics are based on establishment surveys only

because at that time household surveys were not conducted. In Japan the household survey

gives a much bigger estimate of hours worked in the period when both household- and

establishment-based estimates are available. In the other countries household surveys are

used to estimate labor supply.

       An important observation is that when European and U.S. tax rates were comparable,

European and U.S. labor supplies were comparable. At the aggregate level, where

idiosyncratic factors are averaged out, people are remarkably similar across countries. This is

true not only for the G-7 countries, but as shown by Bergoeing et al. (2002) for Chile and

Mexico and by Kydland and Zarazaga (2002) for Argentina as well. Apparently,

idiosyncratic preference differences average out and result in the stand-in household having

almost identical preferences across countries.

    I find it surprising that virtually all the large differences in the U.S. labor supply and

those of Germany and France are due to differences in tax systems. I expected institutional

constraints on the operation of labor markets and the nature of the unemployment benefit



                                                 15
system to be of major importance. They do appear to be important in Italy in the 1970–74

period.


5. Changes in U.S. Labor Supply

        An interesting feature of the data is that U.S. labor supply increased by 10 percent

between 1970–74 and 1993–96, yet the marginal tax rate on labor remained at 0.40. The fact

that all the increase in labor supply was by married women and not by males or by single

females suggests that the appropriate marginal tax rate may have fallen with the flattening of

the income tax rate schedule associated with the tax reforms of the 1980s, in particular, the

1986 tax reform (McGrattan and Rogerson (1998)). The U.S. Department of the Treasury

(1972, 1994) lists the number of married households’ tax returns by adjusted gross income

categories as well as reports the income tax schedule. These data show that the marginal tax

rate for large changes in income such as those that would occur from moving between a one-

earner household to a two-earner household was significantly higher in 1972 than it was in

1994.

        Households switching between having one and two wage earners probably faced

lower marginal tax rates in the 1993–96 period than in the 1970–74 period, even though the

Feenberg-Coutts marginal income tax rates are the same. This possibility is illustrated by the

following example of a two-person household. In the early period, if the working individual

in the household increases hours worked by a small amount, the marginal income tax on the

additional labor income is 20 percent, which is the Feenberg-Coutts estimate for that period.

However, if the household doubles its labor supply by switching from a one-earner to a two-

earner household, the marginal income tax rate on the additional labor income is 40 percent

for this illustrative numerical example.



                                               16
                                       Illustrative Example

            Earners         Earnings          Taxes           Average    “Marginal”
               1               10              1.3            13.0%        20%
               2               20              5.3             26.5        40%

                                       After Tax Reform

            Earners         Earnings          Taxes           Average    “Marginal”
               1               10              1.5             10.0%       20%
               2               20              2.6            13.0%        20%



          The situation is very different in 1993–96, when the household has two earners.

Small changes in labor supply in this case are still subject to a 20 percent tax rate as in the

1970–74 period, which is what the Feenberg-Coutts method finds for that period. However,

the marginal income tax on the labor income associated with switching between a one-earner

and a two-earner household is only 20 percent, not 40 percent as it was in the 1970–74

period.

          This issue of the effect of the nature of the income tax schedule on labor supply for

households with two potential wage earners warrants more attention. Feldstein (1995)

examines the consequences of the 1986 Tax Reform Act using a Treasury Department panel

of more than 4,000 tax forms and finds micro evidence consistent with this hypothesis. It is

further supported in the Feldstein and Feenberg (1993) analysis of the Clinton Tax Plan.

          Some macro evidence is provided by what happened subsequent to the 1998 Spanish

tax reform that flattened the Spanish income tax schedule in much the same way that the

1986 U.S. tax reform flattened the U.S. tax schedule. Subsequently, Spanish labor supply

increased by 12 percent and tax revenue by a few percent. If the change in the factor that



                                                 17
converts the average income tax rate to a marginal tax rate were the same in the United States

and Spain and sufficiently large to increase U.S. labor supply by 10 percent, then the

predicted increase in Spanish labor supply would be the observed 12 percent. More research

is needed to determine whether the hypothesis that the flattening of the tax schedule is the

principal reason for the large increases in labor supply in both the United States and Spain

subsequent to their tax reforms.

           The welfare gains from reducing the effective marginal tax rate on labor income in

the high tax rate countries are large. If France were to reduce its effective tax rate on labor

income from 60 percent to the U.S. 40 percent rate, the welfare of the French people would

increase by 19 percent in terms of lifetime consumption equivalents. This is a large number

for a welfare gain. This estimate of the welfare gain takes into consideration the reduction in

leisure associated with the change in the tax system and the cost of accumulating capital

associated with the higher balanced growth path. The reduction in leisure is from 81.2 hours

a week to 75.8 hours, which is a 6.6 percent decline in leisure. I was surprised to find that

this large tax rate decrease did not lower tax revenues.3

           The welfare gains if the United States reduced its marginal tax rate on labor income

are smaller. If the tax rate is reduced from 40 percent to 30 percent, the gains in terms of

lifetime consumption equivalents are 7 percent.




3
    Mendoza and Tesar (2002) also find that revenue is maximized with a tax rate slightly above 50 percent.

6. Implications of Findings: U.S. Social Security Reform

         If labor supply is fixed, a pay-as-you-go social security system cannot be converted to

a fully funded system in a way that makes every generation better off. If, however, the labor

supply is not fixed, the transition can be made in a way that makes every generation better

off. The only issue is how long the transition will take. Using the elasticity of labor supply

number obtained in the first part of this lecture, I now will explore this issue of how long

such a transition will take.

         The model economy is modified is two respects. First, I follow Auerbach and

Kotlikoff (1987) and use the overlapping generational structure rather than the infinitely

lived family structure employed in Section 1.4 In the modified structure, the key relation

used to forecast labor supply continues to hold. Second, the technology assumed has perfect

substitution between capital and labor. The productivity of labor grows at the rate of 2

percent a year, which implies that the real wage will grow at 2 percent a year as it has on

average throughout the twentieth century. The productivity of capital is constant and is such

that the after-tax return is 4 percent.

         Alternatively, I could have assumed that capital income tax rates, which are not

formally modeled, are adjusted so as to maintain a 4 percent return on capital if the

capital/output ratio changes as a result of the reform. This 4 percent return is the after-tax

real return that has prevailed in the United States in the 1880–2002 period (McGrattan and

Prescott (2003)). Having some dynastic families would also work in the direction of keeping

the interest rate constant.

 See the July 1999 issue of the Review of Economic Dynamics, which is devoted entirely to studies of the U.S.
social security system. These studies are much richer in detail than this one. But they do not use the utility
function used in this study, and as a result my results are different. Conesa and Garriga (2003) address the status
quo problem in social security reform.



                                                        19
       I assume that an equal number of people begin their working career every year at 22,

they work for 41 years, and then they live 19 additional years. The implies they retire at 63

which is the average retirement age. They receive social security benefits equal to 0.319 of

the wage that prevailed when they are 66 beginning when they are 67 and continuing for 14

additional years. In fact, for the U.S. system, the wage base is the one that prevailed when an

individual is 60 years old, so the replacement rate is approximately 36 percent. The effective

tax rate on labor income is 40 percent, as it is in the United States, with 10 percent of this

being social security retirement tax. The reason that 10 percent is used rather than the U.S.

12.4 percent social security tax rate is that some U.S. social security taxes are used to provide

disability and survivors’ insurance in the United States.

       The assumption of no population growth is not realistic and introduces two errors.

These errors, however, are of opposite sign and offsetting, so this illustrative example is still

valid for building good quantitative economic intuition. The first error is that the relative

number of people with social security claims is smaller if population growth is positive. This

reduces the initial implicit liabilities relative to GDP of the pay-as-you-go system. The

second error is that with a growing population the pay-as-you-go system will have higher

levels of benefit payments associated with a given social security retirement tax. This

increases the implicit liabilities of the current system. The pay-as-you-go system that I

consider has the property that social security benefits paid are equal to social security taxes

collected.

       The model economy’s time period is a year. The steady state of a pay-as-you-go

system and a fully funded system are reported in Table 5. With the fully funded system,

steady-state labor supply is 11 percent higher, consumption 17 percent higher, and welfare in




                                                20
lifetime consumption equivalents 9 percent higher. The problem with just switching from the

current pay-as-you-go system to a fully funded system is that the initial old would suffer.

The following reform makes all better off. There are still better reforms than this one, in

particular, plans that have tax rates that depend upon age at the time of reform.

Proposed Reform

       People are given the option to continue with the current system or to shift to a new

system. With the new system, 8.7 percent of wage income is put into an individual account



                                               21
with the government that earns a 4 percent real return. Upon retirement, savings in this

account are annuitized. Effectively, people have the option to have their tax rate on labor

reduced from 40 percent to 31.3 percent and to save 8.7 percent of their labor income in a

government retirement account or to continue with the current social security system. With

the reform, non–social security transfers are left unchanged.

       Steady-state social security liabilities with the pay-as-you-go system are large: 4.62

times gross national income (GNI). With the reform, those aged 37 and younger choose the

new system. The welfare gain to the 22-year-old at the time of the change exceeds 4 percent

in lifetime consumption equivalents. Associated with the change, the capital/annual-output

ratio increases from 2.7 to 3.3, as seen in Table 6. This increase takes 45 years.




                                               22
       Table 6 shows that pension liabilities of the pay-as-you-go system are large, being

2.30 times GDP. With the new system, the decline steadily and becomes zero 35 years after

the reform.


Some equity considerations

       In the model world all individuals earn the same wage when, in fact, some people

earn higher wages than others. Given that earning a 4 percent after-tax real return is an

attractive investment, equity considerations suggest an upper bound on contributions.

Similarly, lower income households should have the right to contribute more than 8.7 percent

of their labor income.

       Still another consideration is how to deal with married couples. An equitable solution

is that each party has an account and household contributions are split equally between the

two accounts with the contribution limit discussed above applying to an individual account

and not to a household account. There will be some who are so unfortunate that the amount

in their account will be insufficient to provide for a minimal acceptable retirement. This

suggests adding means-tested supplementary benefits.

       Some may ask, why force people to save, as this scheme does. The answer is that it

gets around the time inconsistency problem. Some individuals will not save if they know

that others will provide for their consumption whether the others are taxpayers, family

members, or charities.


7. Concluding Remarks

       In this study, in the process of determining the effect of differences in effective

marginal labor tax rates on labor supply across countries and time in the advanced industrial

countries, I have estimated the elasticity of labor supply and have found it to be large, nearly


                                               23
3 when the fraction of time allocated to market is in the neighborhood of the current U.S.

level. This estimate of the elasticity is essentially the same one that is needed to account for

business cycle fluctuations. That this elasticity is large is good news. If labor supply were

inelastic, the advanced industrial countries would face a cruel choice of either increasing

taxes on the young, thereby lowering young people’s welfare, or not honoring the promises

made to the old, making the old worse off.

         The high labor supply elasticity does mean that as populations age, promises of

payments to the current and future old cannot be financed by increasing tax rates. These

promises can be honored by reducing the effective marginal tax rate on labor income and

moving toward retirement systems with the property that benefits on margin increase

proportionally to contributions. Requiring people to save for their retirement years is not a

tax and does not reduce labor supply. As the illustrative example establishes, such a system

benefits the currently young workers and future workers while honoring promises made to

the old.

         One factor that I ignored in my social security reform example was that a larger

capital/labor ratio increases the wages with any reasonably aggregate production function. If

this factor is taken into consideration, the welfare gains are bigger. It is beyond the scope of

this lecture to more than scratch the surface of how best to reform the social security

retirement system and what the resulting welfare gains would be. But it is clear, given the

high responsiveness of labor supply to marginal labor tax rates, that the potential gains are

great.
