          liii s      paper surveys much of modern macroeconomics. The focus        is on the
core   ncr oec onorni c I     uc, of the reasons for macr occonomi c {l uc tuat ions and

sometimes persistent unemployment. To provide continuity and porspectiv on

how pr omi   si rig   resercti leads   of the past turned out, the paper starts by

summarizing developments since the Barro-Fischer (i976) survey             of    monctary

enunc. Sections III arid IV develop in some               detail   the current

representations of the two basic approaches to macroeconomics: the equilibrium

business cycle approach arid new Keynesianism respectively. Brief sketches of

developments in several areas of research in Section V broaden the coverage.

Section VI contains concluding comments.

                          RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN MACROECONOMICS.

           Underlying    the existence of   macroeconomics a; a separate field of
study are the phenomena of economy-wide fluctuation; of output arid prices, and
sometimes persistent high level; of unemployment. Two            basic view; of

macroeconomic behavior have persisted even a; conceptual innovation; and the
application      of more powerful analytic and empirical      technique; have brought
significant change;       in macroeconomic;.

           One   view and school of thought, associated with Keynes5 Keynesian; and
new Keynesian;, is that the private economy is subject to coordination
failures    that   can produce excessive levels    of   unemployment and excessive
fluctuation;       in real activity. The other view, attributed to classical

economists, and espoused by monetarists and equilibrium business cycle

theorists, is that the private economy reaches as good an equilibrium a; is

possible   given government policy.
           Any two—fold division of a complex, large and developing field of

study is inevitably a caricature, which cannot do justice to the subtleties of

the views of different individuals at a moment of time, the intricacies of the

development    of the field over time, and the remarkable range of research
topics that fall     under    the headi rq of macroeconomic;. For instance, al though
the   prot.agonists in the sixties were Keynesians and monetarists.,               in the

e)gtities   are new Keynesians and equilibrium business            cycle theorists, there   is
a clear sense in which the views of Milton Friedman or Karl Brunner and Allan

Meltz er are closer to       those   of Keyriesi arts   than those of equilibrium busi ness
cycle theorists.2 Nonetheless, the caricature captures the essence of

macroeconomic controversies and provide; a useful organizing framework within

which to attempt a survey of a field that is too large for such an enterprise.

            It appears that    macroeconomics as such ha; not been surveyed. The

classic 1962 Harry Johnson survey is of monetary economics.; Barro and Fischer

(1976) also survey monetary economics, though their definition of the               subject
is    sufficiently broad to encompass disequilibrium theory, which is more

macroeconomics than monetary economics. Rotemberg (1987) and Blanchard (1988)

each provide excellent survey; of part of the material discussed in this

paper.

            The focus in this survey is on the           core issue, of the reason; for
macroeconomic fluctuations and sometimes persistent unemployment. To provide
continuity, arid perspective on how promising research lead; of the past turned
out, I start by summarizing in Sections 1               and 11 development; since the Barro—

Fischer survey. The core of the survey Is contained in Section; III and IV


2Niltori Friedman's theoretical framework (1970) is close to the standard
lS—L.M model; Brunner and Meltzer's (1976) basic analytic model is not
dissimilar to Tobin'; (1969) three asset model. Friedman's view of the
macroeconomy as adjusting slowly and unpredictably to monetary policy is
very far from the modern real business cycle view that monetary policy
plays at most a minor role in macroeconomic fluctuations and that markets
are continually in equilibrium.
3Fischer (1987) also contains survey—like material.

          Barro—Fischer (1976, written in 1975) describe their survey as

complementary with Harry Johnsons 1962 paper. This survey in turn can be

regarded as complementary with Barro—Fi scher ,       which classified resear cli nto
seven topics.

LtiTheoro 4     Mo ny_Demand.

          Theoretical    work on the demand for money was a declining industry in

1975, and there has been only a brief subsequent revival. Akerlof and

tilibourne (1980) develop a target—threshhold model of the demand for money,

related to s—S models (Muller—Orr, 1966), in which money balance; adjust

passively to inflows and outflows of cash until they hit a lower bound, at

which point the balance is      restored   to a higher level. Akerlof and Milbourre

show that   the short—run income elasticity of money demand in this model is

very   small, so long as the target and threshhold stay fixed, and argue that

their model accounts for the very small short run income elasticities of

demand found in empirical studies.

         The collapse of the empirical demand for money function in the U.S.

(6oldleld, 1976; Rasche, 1987) led to a largely empirical reexamination of the

basics of money demand. Most attention has been commanded by the work of
                                     4



Barnett and others (e.g. Barnett, Offenbacher and Spirtdt, 1954) creating

Divisia aggregated money stock measure;. The change in the Divisia quantity

ii;dex s equal to a weighted sum of the changes of the component;, with the

weights corresponding to the share of spending on that component of the

aggregate.   In the case of monetary asset;, the spending on a particular

component is priced at user cost, equal to the difference between the maximum

expected holding period yield available in the economy and the expected yield

on the particular asset——It thus corresponds closely to the notion of non—

pecuniary returns. The Divisia aggregates are contrasted with the simple sum

aggregates such as M, which weight components of each measure equally. The

empirical success of the new measures has been mixed. Monetary targetting in

terms of Divisia aggregates is complicated by the fact that the aggregates

themselves depend on interest rates, so that achieving a targetted Divisia

aggregate implies achieving a specific level of a non—linear function of

different asset stock; and interest rates. Poterba and Rotemberg (1987)

develop and estimate a more explicit related approach in which money and other

assets enter the utility function, with differing liquidity characteristics

and risk premia accounting for interest differentials.

        Technical and regulatory changes and induced changes in definitions of

the money stock are responsible for many of the shifts in the demand for money

function (Porter, tlauskopf and Simpson, 1979). Nonetheless, these shifts have

significantly reduced belief in the efficacy of a constant growth rate

monetary rule and in monetarism.

        Even though interest rate control; have been lifted, there is more

deregulation of the United States financial system to come, far instance in
interstate and international banking. Whether stability will return to the

dmard for ncney f uricti on,   for   any   of the   convent   i cinal monetary acigregates   or


sonic Divisia   aggregate,   as deregulation of the banking and financial systems

slow;, recriairis to be seer. Continued deregulation and technical progress in

the payments mechanism——heading in the direction of, but not reaching, the

cashless society——are likely to make for future unpredictable arid significant

changes in velocity.



          In the 1976 survey this    topic    was devoted largely to the question of

the effect of an increase in money growth on capital intensity. Whereas Tobin

(1965) showed in a nor—mai ni i ng tnodel       that a   hi gher   growth rate of money
produced both more inflation and higher capital intensity——and thus a lower
real   interest rate, money in Sidrauski's optimizing model (1967) is

superneutral in the sense that higher rates of inflation do not affect steady

state capital intensity and thus the real interest rate.

         The effect of higher inflation in reducing the real interest rate is

known as the Mundell-Tobin effect. In fact, the mechanisms that produce this

effect in Mundell (1964) and Tobin (1965) are not identical.                In Mundell, a

higher inflation rate reduces real balances and thereby, through a wealth

effect, consumption; the interest rate fall; to ensure goods market

equilibrium.    In Tobin new money is introduced into the economy through

transfer payments, the net real value of which is (g—n)m, where g is the

growth rate of nominal balances, i         the inflation rate, and m is real balances.
In the steady state (g—ii) is equal to the economys growth rate (assuming

unitary income elasticity of money demand) which is independent of the
                                          6



in   latiori rate, whereas m fall; with the ir4lation rte. The real value of

monetary transfer; thus falls with the inflation rate, reducing consumption

demand   arid the real   interest rate.   Back—of —the—envelope cal cul ati ens suggest

that   both these effects    are empirically very small.
          Subsequent analysis showed that dynamic adjustment toward; the steady
state capital stock is typically faster in the Sidrauski model the higher the

growth rate of money, thus reinstating the Mundell—Tobin result in the

Sidrauski model, at least for the adjustment path (Fischer, 1979).           A variety

of results on the relationship between capital intensity and         inflation have
been obtained in other model; of money, including for instance Stockman's

(1981) model with    a Clower constraint in which investment good; have to be

paid for with cash in advance. The cost of investing rise; with the inflation
rate, and inflation therefore reduce; capital intensity. However this result

is not robust to the precise details of the assumed Clower constraint (Abel,

1985). In overlapping generation; model; inflation generally reduces capital

intensity (e.g. Weiss, 1980).

          The most important development in this area is the incorporation of

detail; of the tax system into the analysis of the effects of inflation on

interest rates and capital accumulation (e.g. Feldstein and Summer;, 1978).

Mainly because inflation erode; the value of depreciation allowance;, these

generally indicate that It reduce; capital intensity and capital accumulation.

Tax effect; also disturb the Fisher effect on nominal interest rate;, implying

that   the nominal rate should rise more than one—for—one with inflation i the
after-tax real rate is to remain constant (FEldstein, i976).
                                    7



        The empirical evidence supports the view that inflation adversely

affects capital accumulation; in a cross—section of countries, the predominant

relationship between inflation and the share of investment in GN' is regati ye

(Fischer,   1983).

        Empirical evidence on the Fisher effect has had an unusually checkered

history. After Fama's striking 197 demonstration that, on the assumptions of

a constant real interest rate and rational expectations, the Fisher effect

held one—for-one in the U.S. for the period 191—1973, it soon became clear

that the result was period specific (Begg, 1977). Further, the tax ef4ects

should have produced a greater than one—for—one effect of inflation on nominal

interest rates. Subsequently Summers (1952) showed that cx post decadal

average real interest rates have a strong negative correlation with inflation,

and argued that this implied that ex ante rates are also negatively related to

anticipated inflation.4

        Changes in the real interest rate in the United States in the first

half of the 1980's were in the direction implied by Summers' regressions.

Indeed, it was common to account for the high real rates as a regular feature

of disinflations——which while true is hardly an explanation.   The high real

rates of the early 19B0's made the assumption of a constant ex ante real rate

implausible if the rational expectations hypothesis is maintained.


4However McCallum (1984) has pointed out problems with the Summers
argument. See also the subsequent debate between Summers and licCallum in
the July 1986 Joal of Monetary Economics.
It is always possible and possibly plausible to account for high long
rates as consistent with unchanged real rates at the start of a
disinflation, but high short rates cannot be consistent with an unchanged
ex ante real rate,

       ar   e Cost s o f Inflatin   ptimumQuantity of Pt ony and In{lp
N nance.

              By 1975 the Phelps (1973) analysis of the inflation tax in the context

of   optimal tax analysis was becoming well known. Subsequent work was directed
to answeri rig the questi on of whether there were condi tion; under which the
inflation       tax would not be used, so that the optimum quantity of money
result——that the nominal interest rate should be driven to zero——would still

hold.        Drazen (1979) showed, using a representative family infinite horizon

model       that there was no general   presumption that money should     be taxed, the
result depending       on cross—elasticities of demand between real balances and

other goods. Faig (1985) proved in the case where money is               modelled as an

intermediate good, that it would         be   optimal not to tax it. The question of
how optimally to finance government spending among bonds, money issue arid

taxes received was analyzed by Helpman and Sadka (1979).

             The topic of the welfare cost; of inflation      received    empirical

attention. The conclusion of attempts to enumerate and quantify the costs of

inflation       (Fischer and Modigliani, 1978 Fischer, 19B1) was that the costs of

even    moderate inflation could in practice amount to one         or two percent of 6NP

in   developed economies, but that these cost; were largely the result of

institutional       non—adaptation to inflation.
             As inflations in several countries rose to three digit annual rates in
the 19BOs, monetary financing of budget deficits became             central to the

analysis      of the inflationary process. Seigniorage revenue can amount to
several percent of       6NP for governments      operating at high rates of   inflation,

and could thus be an important factor in the perpetuation o4 high inflation in

countries with rudimentary tax systems.
                                        9



          As a result of the Laffer curve, there may be two inflation      rates at
which a given amount of seigniorage revenue can be collected. The stability

propErties    of the two equilibria differ, the high inflation equilibrium
typically    being stable under rational expectations.     (Bruno arid Fischer, 1987;

Sargent and Wallace, 1987). Governments could then find themselves operating

at an unnecessarily high inflation rate.

          Despite the fact that ;ei gni or age per se can produce si gni i cant

amounts of revenue for the government, the inflation tax analysis that focuses

on seigniorage may be seriously misleading. The eynes-Dlivera—Tanzi (1980)

effect whereby tax revenues decline at high inflation rates6 reduces the          net
revenue effect; of iriflati on on government revenues. Remarkably,      in the
Israeli   case there is evidence that on net inflation reduced government

revenues during parts of the inflationary period, because the government was a

net creditor on nominal terms and debtor on real terms (Sokoler, 1987).           These

considerations strongly suggest that something other than rational revenue

considerations is driving the money—creation process in high inflation

economies; one possibility is that the government ha; put in place a set of

operating rules that leaves money creation a; the residual source of

gover nmerit finance,7

Disequilibrium Theory.

          In 1975 disequilibrium theory was a live area of research that had

already produced insights, particularly into the notion of effective demand,

'The effect is more likely a function of the change than the level of the
inflation rate, for once the inflation level stabilizes tax rates are
usually adjusted.
7Mmnkiw (1987) examines the determination of the inflation rate in the
United States from an optimal tax viewpoint.
                                        10



into   the fact that   behavior in any one market depends on whether other markets
clear, arid into the effect; of charges in the real wage on the macro

equilibiurm. The distinction between classical unemployment, resulting from

too high real wages, arid Keynesian unemployment, resulting from a lack of

aggregate demand, which can be clearly understood from standard disequilibrium

models, also proved useful, for example in empirical analyses of the European

unemployment problem (Bruno and Sach;, 1985).

          Beyond those insights, and despite   the elegant statement of the

approach in Malinvaud (1976) and other contributions reviewed in Drazen
(1980), interest in disequilibrium theory ha; waned. The difficulty, already

evident in 1975, wa that the careful maximi:ing analysis that underlay the

derivation of demand and supply functions at given prices was not extended to

price dynamics itself.      If there is a successor to disequilibrium theory, it

is the new Keynesian analysis to be reviewed in Section IV, where price and

quantity determination are treated symmetrically.

Sen e r a lEgiHbriu m A p p roach toMDnetarTheory.

          The "general   equilibrium" discussed under this heading in the 1976
survey was the equilibrium of the assets markets, with attention focussed on
the Brainard—Tobin supply and demand framework for asset pricing and the

analysis of monetary policy.      That approach has been integrated with the

capital asset pricing model, in an attempt to identify the effects of changes

in asset supplies on risk premia (e.g. B. Friedman, 19B5; Frankel, 1985).

          The modern approach to asset pricing deploys various forms of the

capital asset pricing model, mainly derived through representative consumer

models (e.g. Lucas, 1978; Breeden, 1979; Cox, Ingersoll and Ross, 1985).
                                          11



Asset supplies are exogenous     in the Lucas inode1 it is difficult to obtain

closed   form solutions   for asset   prices   in models in which supplies are

endogerous. The Lucas model ha; been used for ;tudyi ng relative asset returns

(Campbell, 1986) and the size of the equity premium (Mehra and Prescott,

1985); Mehra and Prescott's result; raise the question of whether the

historical size of the equity premium can be rationalized in such models.

          The term structure has continued as an active area of research,, with

the development of rational expectations econometrics making formal testing of

the joint hypothesis of the expectations theory of term structure and rational

expectations possible. The recent literature is surveyed by Shiller (1987)

who   states that there has been much progress in urderstandi ng the term
structure in the last twenty years, but that empirical work has         produced very

little consensus.

The New Microfoundations of Money.

          Covered under this heading was fundamental work attempting to explain

the need for and use of money (e.g. Brunner and Ileltzer, 1971; <urz, 1974;

Starr1 1974). Lucas (1980) and Townsend (1980) have pursued models in which

the   lack of a double coincidence of    wants necessitates the    use of an asset for

making   exchanges, but by and large work      on the reasons for the use of money

has   not gone much further than it had in 1975. Rather the modern trend ha;
been to impose   the use of money on the model, rather than to allow it to
emerge from within the model.

         There are tw approaches: the Clower or cash—in—advance constraint;

and money in the utility function. The Clower constraint imposes the

requirement that money has to be used in making some or all transactions. The
                                       12



usual cash—in-advance   constraint   n discrete time   model; is   that current

income is not available for making current purchases, so that money for this

period; purchases has to be held from the end of the previous period. By

imposing unitary velocity on money holding this rules out the important

systematic effects of inflation and interest rate; on money holding.

        Lucas and Stokey (1987) restore interest elasticity to money holding

in a cast—in—advance constraint model by introducing a distinction between

credit and cash goods, the former of which can be purchased with an interest

free one period loan,   the latter requiring the use of cash.       Shifts   in demand


between cash and credit goods as their relative prices change then make it

possible for in4lation to produce    systematic effects on velocity. However the
distinction   between cash and credit goods is unlikely to be independent of the

inflation rate and interest rates. Svensson (1985) relaxes the unitary

velocity assumption by assuming that individuals face uncertainty about their

spending and have to decide on money holdings before the uncertainty is

resolved.

        The Clower constraint has also been imposed in general equilibrium

continuous time models (Jovanovic, 1982; Romer 1986) where lump sum

transaction; cots generate a demand for money, as in the original partial

equilibrium Baumol—Tobin models. There is a Clower constraint in the

innovative continuous time model of Diamond (1984), in which both multiple and

inefficient equilibria arise from the increase in the efficiency with which

sellers search for buyers when   there are more buyers. The constraint ha; been
used constructively to explain asset pricing anomalies (Svensson, 1985;

Townsend, 1987) and price level determinacy with pegged nominal interest rates

(Woodford, 1985).
                                         13



           The money in the utility or   production    function approach has the

benefit of greater generality in producing a demand for money.            Indeoci as the

theory of revealed preference shows, specifying that a good enters the utility

or production function is merely the assumption that there is a demand for

that good. Restrictions on the demand function emerge from the functional

forn of the utility function and from         the precise way in   which money balances

are put into the utility function (Feenstra, 1986).



           The longest section of the 1976 survey discusses the rational

expectations hypothesis and its applications in monetary models.            i   sample

Phillips curve along Lucas (i973) lines, but more explicitly enphasiing

intertemporal substitution on both the supply and demand sides, is presented

and used both to illustrate the information assumptions needed to generate a

Phillips curve in an equilibrium model and the monetary policy ineffectiveness

theorem.

           The 1976 survey draws a clear distinction between the rational

expectations hypothesis as a theory of expectations, and the type of

equilibrium model in which the hypothesis was typically embodied at the tse.

Rational expectations has indeed become the dominant expectations hypothesis

in nacroecoromics, despite the evidence by I(ahnemari and Tversky (1g83) of

systematic errors in expectations, and repeated failures of Joint tests of

rational expectations and subsidiary hypotheses. The rational expectations

hypothesis is the dominant paradigm because it is the natural benchmark model

of   expectations and because the   technology now exists to do rational

expectations econometri cm.


eor, what is almost the same thing, because there is as yet no clear way

and Phelps (1983). The problem of infinite regress can be cut through by

assuming each agent's expectations of actual outcomes is correct. However in

actions depend on their beliefs is neither conceptually nor in practice

        The   Lucas (1973) Phillips    curve model was the          dominant equilibrium
model for almost a decade.     The distinguishing features           of   the model are that

Lucas (1972) is a more    fully   specified     general      equilibrium model   that
generates a non—exploitable Phillips curve tradeoff.               It is possible that

it builds      the Phillips curve on imperfect information, and   that   the exposition

though not necessarily the structure of the modal emphasizes a monetary cause

of   economic fluctuations.
           A   third feature distinguishes the   model as a prototype equilibrium
models prices move instantly to clear markets which are fully competitive.             By

contrast, Phillips (1958) rationalized his curve as an expression of the

response of wages to labor market disequilibrium.          If the expectations of

individuals in the Lucas model were correct, the equilibrium would be a Pareto

optimum.       More even than the assumption of equilibrium, it is the assumption
of competition that distinguishes the equilibrium business cycle approach from

other analyses of economic fluctuations.1°

           Lucas derived several important results in his 1973 paper. The first

is the Phillips curve—but result; there Is a tradeoff between output and

inflation, but the tradeoff is only with unanticipated inflation. This

implies the policy ineffectiveness results later developed by Sargent and

Wallace (1975), that monetary policy has no real effects in models of this

type. This was the main empirical implication of the model tested by later

researchers.

           The third result is that the slope of the Phillips curve in the Lucas

model   consists of a combination of a structural parameter, the elasticity of
supply in each market, and a      variance ratio that is   affected by policy.      Thus

an   apparently structural parameter, the slope of      the Phillips curve, would

change if policy changed in a      particular way.' Such possibilities are at the

soEquilibrium  theorists frequently rely on the result that a Pareto
optimum can be supported by a competitive equilibrium to analyse quantity
movements in representative agent models without having to examine price
behavior.
111n the 1973 article Lucas attempted to test this implication using
internati anal cross—sectional data.

asserts that b,cau;e apparently structural parameter; may charge when policy

changes, ei;tirig econometric model; cannot be used to ;tudy alternative

policy regimes.

          The   policy   evaluation critique has had a devastating impact on both

econometric policy evaluation and the seriousness with which large scale

nacroeconometric models are treated by researchers, at least in the United

States.    Into the mid—seventies, serious academic researchers were putting

major effort; into large—scale models state—of—the—art empirical versiori; of

major behavioral functions were as likely to be found in the MRS (MIT—Penn—

SSRC) model as anywhere.

          Such model; are now routinely dismissed as 'subject to the Lucas

critique—-though remarkably, that critique has not been shown to be of any

empirical significance in accounting for the failures of the econometric

models in the seventies. Lucas himself (e.g. 1976) has repeatedly referred to

the massive empirical failure of these model; in including a long—run

inflation—unemployment tradeoff that was falsified in the seventie;.t But

that was a failure of      theory,   which was repaired in the late sixties,

following work by Friedman and Phelps, by adding the expected inflation rate

to the Phillips curve. The 1973 supply shock also led to an underprediction

of inflation in the major models, but that has nothing to do with the Lucas

critique——unless the Lucas critique is reduced to the statement that models

are inevitably misspecified.

           From a    theoretical viewpoint, the Lucas (1972 and 1973)                        model is        of

market. The basic result in models in which money would be                             neutral with full

disturbances       in the economy; so long as monetary disturbances (which may come

from the demand as well as the supply of money) cannot be fully identified,

unanticipated changes in money will have real                       effects.
           Despite the elegance and intellectual power of the                         original model,

subsequent intensive theoretical development, and some empirical successes,

the imperfect information about current monetary variables approach to the

monetary business cycle has met with severe difficulties. The basic problem

is that It is difficult to believe that a lack of information about current

nominal variables, particularly the price level, can be the source of monetary

non—neutrality, when the lags in producing money stock and price level data

are    of the order of weeks. Further, if those lags were important, they could
be    reduced to seconds. It would be entirely possible to produce an on—line
estimate of the current price level at                     low   cost by providing terminal; to
businesses, which would enter price changes as they took place. The failure
of the DPI futures market set up in the United States in 19B also sugqests
that short term aggregate price level uncertainty is                          not a significant problem

in    the U.S. economy.
        Geyond this problem, enpiri cal   support for the model was riot robust.
Despite early work by Barro (1978) indicating that    only unanticipated changes

in the money stock affected output, later research by Gordon (1982) arid

Mishkin (19831 suggested that both anticipated and unanticipated money

mattered. Results by Boschen and Grossman (1982) showi rig that output appeared

to be affected by the currently perceived money stock, and related conclusions

reached by Barro and Hercowitz (1980), coming as they did from proponents      of

the equilibrium approach, had a significant impact on supporters of the

approach.

        The Lucas model was set up to model the Phillips curve, or the

apparent association between inflation and output. The non—neutrality of

money is a problem for monetary theory precisely because money is neutral in

most clearly specified models in which markets clear quickly.      If sticky

prices are ruled out on methodological grounds, and the implausibility of the

information assumptions rule out the information—confusion assumption of the

1973 Lucas model, then it becomes difficult (this is an empirical statement)

to provide a convincing theoretical acccount of a causal Phillips curve

relationship.

        The most influential demonstration of the real effects of money on

output is no doubt Friedman and Schwart:'s (1963) account of the Great

Depression; their more systematic attempt to address this issue (1963a) by

working with cyclical average data and timing relationships was less

persuasive because of the evident variability of the timing relationships and

the question of causation.
                                         19



         Confidence in a causal role of money was increased by Sims' (1972)

result in a two variable (nominal GNP and the money         ;toc)   system that money

Granger-tauses output, and by the previously noted results on the e{fct of

unanticipated money on output. However, the disappearance of Oranger

causati or   for money in a vector autoregressi on     to which the nomi nal   interest
rate was added (Sims,      1980) raised doubts about the role of     money, even though
no clear explanation for the latter finding emergecI.1 Combined with the
theoretical difficulties, this 1980 result led to         exploration of the

implication; of endogeneity of the money stock.
         Honey may be endogenous either       because central barks pursue

accommodating policies, or because most of the money stock is inside money,

the real volume of which adjusts to the level of economic activity. Tobin

(1970) showed    in   a model of endogenous money that particular money supply

rules   may generate the appearance that money Branger—causes (a concept that
was not yet used in economics) output even in a context where it has no
effects on real output (Tobin presented this result as an example of the post
hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy).
         One approach to modelling    the     role of inside money is to include
transactions services as a factor of production, and to assume that banks are
involved in the production of such services, using labor, capital, and perhaps
outside money    as factors of production (King and Plosser, 1984).' In the
absence of outside money, it is difficult        to   see why the price level or

138oth Rotemberg (1987) and Blanchard (1988) examine and extend the
evidence, concluding that it supports the view that monetary shocks affect
output.
4However there is no inherent reason that outside money is needed in such
a system.

inflation   rate a; opposed to real activity is procyclical in ;uch models.

Once outside money is introduced, the behavior of the   price   level follows from

the interactions of the real demand for outside money and the nominal supply:

determine the correlation between the price level, the money ;tock, and

          With regard to money, the equilibrium approach appears to be squeezed

between the theoretical difficulty of finding a route through which monetary

policy can affect output and the fact that changes in aggregate demand do

appear in practice to affect output. The real business cycle approach

sidestcps   the money issue and attempts to account for the major
characteristics of   the cycle in a purely non—monetary framework.

          Four sets of stylized facts are the central focus of business cycle

analysis:

.There are fluctuations over time in both employment and unemployment,

correlated across industries, associated with only small changes in the real

wage, and apparently correlated with demand disturbances.

.These fluctuations, along with fluctuations in output, are serially

correlated, which is the essence of the business cycle.

.Cusiness cycle fluctuations appear to be correlated with monetary

disturbances: there is a Phillips curve. The two approaches to building

equilibrium models consistent with this fact have already been described.
                                           21



.Consumption, income, and employment are positively correlated over          the cycle.
         The work of Nelson and Ploscer (1982) and subsequent research by among

others Rose (1986), Cochráre (1986), Campbell and Mankiw (1987), and Ciuah

(1987) has cast doubt on the conventional characterization of the cycle s

consisting of serially correlated divergences of output from a smooth trend.

Rather it is argued there is a unit root in the stochastic process for

output—-and that there is little dynamics other than that.           If there were no

dynamics other than the unit root——that is if output followed a random walk,

then it would not be possible to talk of a business cycle in output. However,

Campbell arid Mankiw cannot reject the characterization of output as a second

order hump-shaped process around a deterministic trend. Further, Cochrane

(1986) finds some evidence that the dominant root is less than one.

         More fundamentally, even if there were a unit root in output, the

business cycle could be defined as consisting of fluc:tuations of the

unemployment rate about a slowly moving trend. There is little evidence of a

unit root in unemployment, except perhaps for some European countries

(Blanchard and Summers, 1986). Thus the ei'tence of the business cycle does

not seem threatened by the finding of a unit root in the          stochastic process
for   output.

         Business cycle theory was a major branch of economics until the

l(eynesian revolution. Early business cycle theorists saw the cycle as largely

self—sustaining, with each boom containing the seeds of the subsequent

recession and slump, the slump in         turn   containing the seeds of the recovery

and boom.        The   business cycle   continued to be a subject of research

re all firmly in the Keynesian tradition. The Keynesian revolution did shift

the focus of macroeconomics from the inevitability of the cycle to methods of

improving macroeconomic performance.

         During the long expansion of the sixties, it was even po ible to

think that the business cycle had been cured.l& Poor economic performance

during the seventies, reflected in the increased frequency and depth of

recessions, together with the forceful advocacy of Robert Lucas (1977) renewed

interest in the business cycle as a specific field of research.      }.Iut modern

approaches are not a continuation of the main line of earlier business cycle

analysis.

         Rather ,   modern tteori ;ts have followed the stochastic approach of

Frisch (1933) and Slutsky (1937), which distinguishes between the shocks that

impinge on the economy, causing variable; to differ from their steady state

values, and the propagation mechanisms that convert the shocks into longer

lived divergences from steady state values.1 The modern approach is

especially convenient for econometric implementation. Further—-and this was

the basic point of Frisch and Slutsky——the time series behavior of economic

variables produced when shocks disturb relatively simple linear difference

equation systems is broadly consistent with business cycle characteristics.

delman and Adelman in 199 showed that the Klein—Goldberger econometric model


No doubt economic fluctuations will always be with us; the cycle would
be cured if deviations from full employment output were small and serially
u n correlated.

the benefit of the latter, which he suggests has become excessively

the fprerunner of the Wharton model) generated output movements similar to

those    observed in   the U. S. busires cycle   heri subjected to tochaEtic
di sturbances.
           Shocks may hit the economy on the demand side, for instance     a


stochastic    change in private sector or government demand for goods, perhaps

resulting from a change in fiscal or monetary policy. Or they can come from

the supply side, as productivity shocks, or shifts in the supply functions of

factors of production. The shocks, for instance productivity shocks, may be

serially correlated.

           A variety of propagation mechanisms can carry the effects of the

shocks    forward through time:
.Because individuals prefer smooth consumption streams, temporarily high

output today generates high saving, thus high investment, and a larger capital

stock    and higher output tomorrow.
.Lags in the investment process may mean that increased investment demand

today increases investment demand and output in future periods as well.

.Firms carry inventories in part to meet unexpected changes in demand. A

demand shock today will cause firms both to draw down inventories and increase

production,    arid in future periods they will increase production   to   restore
inventories.     Thus production will be serially correlated.

.Individuals may work harder when wages are temporarily higher——the

intertemporal substitution of leisure——and thus both magnify the effects of

productivity shocks on current output and tend to produce negative serial

correlation of labor input.
                                        24



.Because it is costly for firms to adjust their labor forces, firms tend to

adjust the   labor   force gradually in response to changes in wages and prices.

.Because individuals may take time to understand the nature of the shocks

hitting them (in particular whether they are permanent or transitory) their

responses to shocks may be distributed over time.

.Because it takes time for individuals to search for and find jobs, shacks to

demand and supply lead to prolonged labor force adjustments.

          Both the shocks   and the propagati or; mechani sms identified in the

preceding    paragraphs can be embodied in either market clearing or non—market

clearing cycle models. Proponents of the g_L__çjLt
.p_proach? are distinguished by their view that virtually all business cycle
phenomena are the result of productivity shocks hitting an economy in which

markets are continuously in equilibrium.

          In general, though, real business cycle theorists do not examine

markets explicitly, rather drawing on the equivalence of market and planning

solutions to deduce the behavior a-F quantities that would be seen if resources

were allocated optimally. They typically also work with representative agent

models.     In the remainder of this section I concentrate on the real business

behavior depends on whether independent evidence can be 4ound for the assumed

formulation (McCallum, 1986)). Research attempting to identify supply and

demand disturbances (Shapiro (1987) and Blanchard and Quah (1987)) is

currently under way.

            I now briefly discuss propagation mechanisms it will turn out that

the key issue is that of the intertemporal substitution of leisure, without

which shifts in aggregate demand have no impact on output and supply shocks

technical regress when monetarism temporarily triumphed in the seventies.

buying capital that is used up in retirement.               positive productivity shock

in the current period raises output and the income of the employed, therefore

saving,   and therefore future capital stocks. This           produces positive serial

correlation    of output, through the supply side.
          However the supply of capital route to serial correlation cannot be
empirically significant.         Suppose that      a shock raises GNP this year by IY. and

that   saving increases by as much as O./. of GWP, With the real return on

capital equal to about IOV., the extra saving would increase output by O.O5 in

the following year, implying very little persistence of the effects of the

productivity shock.

          Long and Plosser (1983) develop a simple multi—sector capital nodel.

With an n—sector input—output structure, and a one—period production lag

between inputs and outputs,        the system has n roots and       is therefore capable of

interesting    dynamic behavior when disturbed by productivity shocks. This
model too    will   not   generate high serial      correlation   of output unless the share
of capital    in output is     high.

          Nonetheless, it      has long been observed that booms in economic activity

are typically accompanied        by investment booms;      the multiplier—accelerator
mechanism has for long been        part of   most account; of the     cycle. Kydland arid
Prescott (1982) emphasize "time to build"——investment projects require inputs

in several earlier periods before they come into operation. However it is not

clear   from their exposition how much        of    their dynamics results from the time
to   build assumption.

Inventories.
                                        27


          it   is well known (see for example Dornbusch—Fischer (1987), Chapter 9)

that inventory decumulation accounts for a significant proportion of the

decline   in   real 6NP in periods following cyclical peaks.   In every post1948

U.S. business cycle except one (198O-Bl), a large part of the decline in

demand during the recession consisted of a decline in inventory accumulation.

          The intuitive explanation for the role of inventories is that a

decline in demand causes an inventory build—up, perhaps slowly if producers do

not notice the demand shift immediately, and that production is then cut back

to work off the excess inventories. In a model with a multiplier, this

cutback in production itself reduces demand further, accentuating the decline

in output.

          Inventory accumulation is usually motivated in equilibrium models by

production smoothing. Increasing marginal costs of production imply that it

is cheaper to meet shifts in demand by changes in production that are

distributed over several periods than by increasing production solely in the

period of the demand shift.21 A shDck to demand causes an increase in

consumption In the current period, which is met in part by increased

production and in part by drawing down inventories. Then in subsequent

periods production stays high as inventories are restored to their target

level. In the case of cost shocks, a temporary cost reduction should lead to

an increase in output and buildup of inventories, followed by lower output

that allows inventories to return to their target level.


The insight goes back at least to Holt, tiodigliani, tiuth, and Simon
(t97). Blinder and Fischer (.1981) embed production—smoothing based
inventory behavior in an equilibrium model.
                                    28



        In the real business cycle approach, which eniphasies productivity

shocks, inventories tend to create negative serial correlation of output. A

favorable temporary productivity shock results in higher output today, pMrt.ly

for consumption and also to build up inventories. Then in future periods

output is lower than normal as the inventories are consumed, creating the

possibility of negative serial correlation of output.

        Although inventory dynamics is not helpful in explaining positive

serial correlation in real business cycle theory, I briefly review recent

work. The production smoothing model implies that if shocks are to dmard,

output is smoother than consumption if shocks are to supply, output is more

variable than consuffiption. Several researchers have found that the

variability of production exceeds that of sales or consumption2? implying

either that the production smoothing model is inappropriate or that cost

shocks play a larger role in explaining inventory behavior than most

researchers are willing to allow.

        At least two other models have been proposed to account for the

cyclical behavior of inventories. One builds on production lags (Abel, iB;

Kahn, 1986).2 Suppose that the sales process takes at least one period, and

that goods have to be in place at the beginning of any period in which they

are to be sold, and that demand is serially correlated. Then high sales this

period imply that inventories have to be restored, and that production has

also to increase to meet higher than average demand next period.


22See for example Blinder (1984) and West (1985).
2Although the Kahn and Abel models are related, Abel examined conditions
under which production smoothing still took place, whereas Kahn was
looking for conditions that explain the 'excess" volatility of
inventories.
                                              29



          A second appr ch, initiated by Blinder (1981), and followed by Caplini

(198) arid Mosser (1986), explores the implications of models           in   which

invertory   policy   is   s—S. The   policy    is to order inventories only when     the

inventory level hits a trigger point, s, and then to order an amount that

restores the inventory level to S.

          If the average order size (S—s) is large relative to sales, then this

ordering policy, which is frequently used in practice, creates the possibility

that production can vary more than sales. Whether it does, depends

significantly on the cost function of ultimate suppliers. If the supplier has

constant costs of production, the s—S policy may well lead to more variable

output. Alternatively, suppose demand for the final good were relatively

constant, and that the s—S orders come in quite regularly to the producing

firm. With concave production costs the producing firm would produce smoothly

to meet expected orders, and the s—S policy would determine only where

inventories were held——by producer or by seller——rather than the production

pattern (Caplir, 198).

Intertemporal Labor Supply Substitution.

         Both capital accumulation and inventory dynamics undoubtedly play a

role   in business cycle dynamics, and        both illustrate that entirely

neoclassical   economies in which      markets are always in equilibrium cart be

expected to produce serially correlated movements in output around trend. But

none of the models we have developed so far accounts explicitly for the first

stylized fact set out above, the pro—cyclical pattern of hours of labor.

         If shocks are assumed not to come from the labor supply function

itself, then the cyclical pattern of labor supply in an equilibrium model is
                                          30


determined    by   the cycli cal behavior of the real wage. The question of whether
the real wage is pro—       or countercyclical has been the subject of research for

at least a half—century, since Keynes assumed in the                _hoy       that       4irms

were always on their demand function for labor.24

           Geary and Kerinan (1982) test and are unable to reject the hypothesis

that the    real    wage and employment are independent across a sample of twelve

industrial countries. They show that results on the cyclical properties of

the real wage depend on. whether the CPI or WPI is used to define the real

wage. However the wei ght of the       evidence by now is that the real wage is

slightly    procyclical. Schor (198) finds evidence of      pro—cyclical wages in

nine industriali:ed countries for the period 1955—70, with less           procyclicality

in the subsequent decade. Basing his argument on overtime premia, Bus (1986)
also finds significantly procyclical real wages.        We shall   in   the   following
discussion    assume that the real wage is mildly procyclical, but that it would

require large elasticities of labor supply for these real wage movements to be

interpreted as movements over the cycle along a simple labor supply curve.

           There have been three approaches to explaining the cyclical behavior
                                                                                      -

of the real wage. One is to argue that the labor market is not in

equilibrium,       that, for instance, there is always excess supply of labor, and

that the business cycle is driven by shifts in aggregate demand. The pattern

of the real wage then depends on assumptions about pricing.             In the ?rJ_
Theory and early Keynesian models, in which firms were assumed to be always on

a stable demand function for labor, the real wage would be counter—cyclical if


241t is well known that Dunlop (1938) showed the real wage was procyclical
in Fact. Tarshis (1939) is often credited with supporting Durilops
results, though as noted by Blanchard (1987) in fact he showed a negative
correlation between changes in manhours and changes in real wages.
aggregate demand disturbances are the predominant cause of the cycle.       In

mark—up pricing model;, in which the price is a mark—up on the wage, the ri

wage may be independent of the state of the cycle.

          The second argues that observed real wage; have very little to do with

the allocation of labor26. The wage is set either to provide insurance to

worker;, or a; part of a long—term bargain between the firm and the worker

and need not vary with employment. Nonetheless, because it is efficient to do

so, work at all times is pushed to the point where the marginal product of

labor is equal to the marginal utility of leisure.

          Proponents of equilibrium business cycles have however largely pursued

a third route, the intertemporal substitution (of leisure)__ap_pgach. The

approach, which can be traced to an influential 1969 paper by Lucas and

Rapping, argues that labor supply responds extremely sensitively to transitory

incipient changes in the real wage, and that this high elasticity reduce;

movements in the real wage. Whatever movements there might be in the real

wage could easily be obscured by small disturbances to the supply of labor

functi on.

          Consider a person who consumes and works in two periods. The utility

function is:

                                                1+p
          U(c1,c2,x1,x)    In c —   (l+)_txi          +


                             (I+$)—tCIn   C2   — Y(1+)tx2   1     (1)




2When in the 1970'; supply disturbances made their entry into standard
macroeconomic models, it became clear that the cyclical pattern of the
real wage depends on the predominant source of disturbances.
26This is implied by Azariadis (1975) and developed in Hall and Lilien
(1979).
                                          32


where c is consumption, and x± is labor; f3 ) 0. The greater is f3 the greater

is the curvature of the di sutility of labor function and the less wil)in are

individuals to substitute labor (and thus leisure) intertemporally. The

individual maximizes (1) subject to the budget constraint

               + c2/R   w1x1 + w2x2/R                                 (2)


where   R   is one plus the interest rate.

            Solving the resultant first order conditions, the ratio of labor

inputs in the two periods is

                                    1/p
            xIx Cw1I(w(1+6)IR)3                                       (3)


The ratio of labor inputs is determined by the relative wages in the two

periods Wi and w2/R, with an elasticity 11)3 that depends on the curvature of

the disutility of labor function, and which for p small (in which case the

marginal disutility of labor is virtually constant) may be extremely large.

Thus depending on the utility 4unction a small increase in the wage in one

period relative to the wage in the other may cause the individual to work much

more in that period relative to the amount of work done in the other period.

            When w1 and W2 change in the same proportion, (3) shows   that there is
rio change in the ratio of work done in the two periods.     It can also be shown

that a proportional increase in wages in the two periods leaves total hours of

work in each period unchanged as the income and substitution effects of the

change in the wage just balance each other. That is, individuals may respond

sensitively to transitory changes in the real wage, while responding not at

all to permanent changes.
                                          33


        This result is the essence of the intertemporal substitution

explarati on   of tie behavior of hours of work over the cycle: that indivi duals
respond sensitively to the small pro—cyclical variations that car sometimes be

detected in the real wage. Such variations could        for   instance be caused by

productivity shocks.      Hence if the cycle were driven largely by productivity

or supply shocks, and     if   intertemporal substitution wore to be established as

a major force in determining hours of work, the basic puzzle of large

movements in the quantity of labor could be solved in an equilibrium

framework.

        The empi ri cal   evidence on the i ntertemporal substitution hypothesis is
mixed, though mainly unfavorable. Work by sltonJi (1982) and Ashenfelter
(1984) finds little evidence to support strong intertemporal substitution

effects in labor supply. Hecknan and Macurdy (1987) suggest that the evidence

is still in its infancy, and that it is not inconsistent with equilibrium

models that admit considerable worker heterogeneity.

Consumption and   Leisure_ov__Cycl€j           Even if the inter—temporal leisure

substitution explanation of the cyclical behavior of real wages and employment

is accepted, the final stylized fact——the negative covariance of consumption

of goods and consumption of leisure——has to be accounted 4cr. More work is

done in booms than in recessions; there is also more consumption (or at least

purchases of consumption goods) in booms.


2714ote that the real interest rate plays a role in determining the
intertemporal allocation of labor: a procyclical pattern cf the real
interest rate could therefore account for cyclical changes in the quantity
of labor that occur despite constant real wages.
                                       34



          The standard utility function used   to study intertempora] allocation
problems is additively separable (over time). 4ssuming both consumption and
leisure   are normal, Barro and King (1984) show that such functions have the

very strong implication that both consumption and leisure should move in the
same direction in response to all disturbances except those that change the
terms of trade between consumption and leisure within a given period, that is

the   real wage.   Without real wage movements the cyclical pattern of
consumption and leisure cannot be explained by the standard form of utility
function.    But since real wage changes are, if at all, only mildly procylical,

the additively separable formulation cannot be a good one——if one insists on

an equilibrium interpretation of the business cycle.

          tiankiw, Rotemberg and Summers (1985) Examine the Euler equations

derived from the standard interternporal optimization problem based on a

particular additively separable utility function. Using aggregate time series

data they find no support for the intertemporal substitution model. The

essential problem is the cyclical pattern of leisure and consumption, for they

typically find that one or the other is inferior.

          Equilibrium business cycle proponents have suggested two alternatives

to the standard formulation. The first, due to Kydland and Prescott (1982),

allows for habit formation or fatigue in the utility function, by replacing

the leisure argument in the utility function by a distributed lag on leisure.

          The second formulation builds on the fact that most variation in hours

takes the form of changes in numbers employed rather than hours per employee.

Staying within the representative agent framework, Hansen (1985) and Rogerson

(1985) have built models in which individuals work either zero hours or full

time (say forty hours).
                                           35


         Solving the central planning problem in such an          economy, Hansen shows

that   wage' or consumption        variability over time   does riot depend on the

properties   of   the underlying utility of leisure function. rther , the
cyclical pattern of the wage reflects the properties of the marginal utility
of consumption function      and   not the marginal utility of leisure function-"-
because hours of    work are not     set to equate the marginal utility of leisure2
to the real wage.
         What is the market setup corresponding to this central planning

problem? It is that everyone owns a share of the firm or firms in the

economy, and receives the same share of profits in addition, every potential

worker signs a contract with a firm, which guarantees a given utility level in

exchange for the individual 's willingness to work a specified number of hours

if his or her number is drawn.         If there is disutility to work, then each

worker will receive a payment for signing, and an additional payment if he or

she works.

         It is not clear what should be regarded as the wage in this setting.

If it is the marginal product of labor, then that may not change over the

cycle——for irstance    if   the utility function is separable, and there is the

appearance of large changes in output with no change in the wage.

Alternatively, if everyone who signs a contract with the firm receives a

payment, and there is an additional payment for those who work, that marginal

payment may be regarded as the wage——and it could be constant over the cycle.

It is also possible though that the wage is measured as the per capita payment


B1{ the utility function is separable between leisure and consumption,
then the marginal utility of leisure at 40 hours of work per week is
constant.
                                    36


(averaged over employed and unemployed) received from the firm by each worker,

which increases with the aqgregate amount of work done in this model. Further,

if the marginal utility of consumption were decreasing, the average payment

per worker would be even more pro—cyclical. In this case the Harisen—Rogerson

construction also implies a pro—cyclical real wage.

        Two issues are relevant in judging the potential value of the

Rogerson—Hansen amendment to the standard equilibrium model. First, it is

necessary to detail the factors determining the length of theworkweek, and

the possibilities of part—time and overtime work.     It is clear that there Is

some fixed cost of taking a Job and thus that the approach starts from a

useful fact; it is also clear that the workweek in fact varies over the cycle,

and that part—time work has become increasingly common, Second, the

implication of full private insurance against unemployment and the fact that

the unemployed are in no way worse off than the employed are both

unsatisfactory, the first because there is very little private unemployment

insurance, the second because it violates everyday observation. Whether by

invoking moral hazard and non—homogeneities of the labor force it becomes

possible to explain the absence of such private insurance ir an equilibrium

model remains to be seer.

        The more important lesson of a model of   this   type may be that the

representative agent assumption is unsatisfactory, and that labor force

heterogeneity may play an important role in determining the cyclical pattern

of wages. Suppose that for technological reasons individuals can work either

full time or not at all. Suppose also that workers differ. Then variations

in employment take place at the extensive margin where new individuals enter
                                           37


 employment or leave it, rather than at the intensive margin of hour; of work.

Then     the responsiveness of hour; of work to change;    in the real wage have

nothing to do with individual utility function;, but rather with the
di ;tr i but on of reservation wages of those rear the employment mar gin.
             Variation in numbers employed across the cycle is reflected also in
the pattern of unemployment. Very little in the equilibrium business cycle
framework addresses the issue of unemploymert.° Indeed,            it   has been common

in this approach to work with the 1CVCI of output a; the key macroeconomic
variable, and to treat unemployment as a secondary        and   not very interesting
i ss u e •
             Even if   the unemployment issue is left aside,   the equilibrium   approach

to   the business cycle runs into its greatest problem in the labor market.

Real wages simply do not show the movements that are needed for this theory to

explain the facts, and it is unclear that the assumption of indivisible labor

solve; the problem. What then could explain the fact;? We have already noted

that theories that do not require labor market equilibrium may do the Job.

             Alternatively, the reported real wage may not accurately reflect the

marginal product of labor and marginal disutility of work. For instance,

imperfect capital markets may result in firms paying workers a constant real

wage over the cycle, with the allocation of labor nonetheless sensitively

reflecting shift; in the productivity of labor and marginal valuation of time.


7This point is emphasized by Heckean (1984) and Heckman and Macurdy
(1987).
Ham    (1986) argues that the unemployed cannot be interpreted as being on
their labor supply function; in any useful sense.
51This tradition goes back at least to Friedmans Presidential Address
 (1968). For an examination of the issue of involuntary unemployment, see
Lucas (1978a).

Labor adjustment costs.

              The real wage    may difler from    the   marginal product   of labor it the
short       run   when   there are costs of adjusting inputs.2 Labor adjustment costs
reduce       the response    of hours of work to the real wage: the firm changes         its
labor input in response to a transitory shock to productivity or the wage, by

1   ess than it would       without costs of adjustment. in response to a permanent

shock       to the wage or productivity, the firm eventually adjusts all the way,
setting the nargi nal product equal to the wage. But the adjustment tak
t   i me.


              With respect to cyclical adjustments to real wage movements, this

model       has exactly the opposite implications to the intertemporal substitution
model.        Costs of adjustment therefore do not help account for the cyclical

pattern of real wages and employment.35

Search une m p 1 oy


              Unemployment is modelled in an equilibrium framework as resulting from

search, where the search is not only that of unemployed workers looking for

jobs but aio that of vacancies looking for workers. Mortensen (1970)
develops a search—theoretic unemployment model and derives                 an explicit
expression for the natural rate of unemployment as a function of the
determinants of rates of job loss and acceptance. Lucas and Prescott (1974)
present a complete model of the unemployment process generated by stochastic

33Pr) extended version of the adjustment cost model is often used in
explaining the cyclical pattern of labor productivity.   In that version
not only are there costs of adjusting the input of labor, but also the
existing labor force may work harder at times of high demand, or may be
used in times of slack on maintenance and other investment-like tasks.

 shift;   in demand among sector; and a one—period lag by worlers in moving

 between sectors. More recently Diamond (1981, 1982) and Pissarides              (198)
have developed arid worked with     sophi sti   cated cort 1iUOLI5   time search model;.
Howitt (1987) is a particularly tractible search model, embodying adjustment
costs   for labor,    arid generating dynamic adjustment of employment and

unemployment to productivity and demand shocks.

          One theme o4 modern search theories of unemployment is that because

job matches require an explicit search process, there is no market to set the

wage.     (Mortensen, 1982) Rather it is assumed that the wage is set in a

bargain which divides the surplus from the job between the worker and the

firm.

          Typically   equilibrium is inefficient in these models, reflecting a

search externality which arises because a worker's decision to search makes it

easier for a firm to fill its vacancy——but there is no direct compensation

from the hiring firm to the searching worker for his or her decision to become

unemployed.     The inefficiency may make a case for unemployment compensation.
In the opposite direction, the congestion externality created for the

unemployed    by the decision of a worker to join their ranks could suggest a tax
on unemployment.

          Lilien (1982) argued that most of the variance of unemployment in the

United States in the period 198—1977 was a result of relative rather than

aggregate shocks to the economy, which set off shifts of workers between

sectors and thereby affected the aggregate unemployment rate. Abraham and

Katz (1986) and Murphy and Topel (1987) question this interpretation of the


34Sargent (1987) presents several search theoretic models, mostly from the
side   of the worker or consumer.

data: the former because differing supply and demand elasticities in any event

imply di erences         rt   sectoral   responses to aggregate shocks, and be ause the

behavior of vacancies is inconsistent with the relative disturbance

hypothesis; the latter because rising unemployment is in fact a ocited with

a decline in the mobility of labor between sectors.

          More direct evidence on the role of search in unemployment comes from

surveys showing that the time of the unemployed is mostly spent waiting. The
notion   that   individuals can search more efficiently when they are unemployed,

and therefore optimally enter unemployment to seek new Jobs has little

empirical support.            They could as well be working at MacDonalds. The theory

of search unemployment might thus be replaced by a theory of optimal wait

unemployment3 which would presumably stress the influence of aggregate demand

on the creation of job opportunities.

          Evaluating the contribution of the GeneraL Thegy_, Keynes remarked

that the disappearance of the notion of aggregate demand for almost a century

was an   extraordinary episode in the history of economic thought (Patirikin,
198G).    Much of the sophisticated development of the microeconomic foundations

of macroeconomics in the 1950s, such as the permanent income—life cycle

theory of consumption, inventory and portfolio theories of the demand for

money, and flexible accelerator theories of investment3 elaborated or the

determinants of demand.
                                         41



           There have been significant   developments     in the   empirical   modelHriq of

aggregate demand since 1975, though no real departures from earlier

theoretical approaches. The     life   cycle—permanent income consumption function

remains the mainstay of consumption theory, with new testing methods having

developed following the key contribution of Hall (1978). Hall tested the

implications of the Euler equation or first order condition for intertemporal

consumer optimization, which under specified conditions implies that

consumption huId follow a random walk.           It is not yet clear whether

consumption    is excessively variable or     excessively smooth, the issue turning

on    whether detrended income follows a stationary process or not. Empirical
work on liqui dity constraints and other causes      of   potential deviations from
the    permanent income hypothesis has turned to cross—sectional data (e.g.
Zeldes, 1985). Tobins Q theory of investment has received much attention and
is    widely used, though empirical results relating investment to stock prices

are still far from satisfactory (Summers, 1981).

           The last decade has seen real progress in the theory of aggregate

supply on Keynesian lines. The Phillips curve was exactly the empirical

construction the Keynesian model needed to model the supply side, endogenizing

the   dynamics of the wage rate and the price level. But the theory of aggregate
supply underlying the Phillips curve remained underdeveloped.              Although

Phillips (1958) and Lipsey (1960) both explained the Phillips curve as an

application of the law of supply and demand, the law itself lacked

microfoundations. Arrow (1959),    discussing price setting, argued that the
assumption of competition made explicit study of price—determination

difficult.


For a review of the issue;, see Hall (1988).
                                         42



           The Fr     man—Phtlps addition of the   expected rate of   inflation to the

Phillips    curve both   stimulated further work on the microfouridations cf price

setting,    and tended   to focus the reasons for the real effects of shifts       in
demand on    output   on errors in expectations. By 1970, Phelps arid Winter were

able to announce in the landmark Phelps volume that a 'landing on the non—

Wairasian continent has been made". The papers in the Phelps volume were

mainly earc.h theoretic, and implied that anticipated changes in prices would

have no effects on output. The radical implications of that             result   did rot

become clear until Lucas (1972, 1973) combined the Friedman—Phelps Phillips

curve with the asriumption of rational expectations.



           The cciritributions of Fischer (1977) and Taylor (19B0)37 clarified the

distinction between the implications of rational expectations and of wage or

price stickiness in accounting for real effects of money and aggregate demand

on output.     In each case sticky nominal wages determined in long—term labor

contracts were the source of nominal inertia. Each model implied a potential

stabilizing role for monetary or aggregate demand policy even in the presence

of rational expectations, and provided a framework for examining the dynamic

effects of changes in policy on prices and output.


8Nordhaus (1972) worked on the microfoundations of the Phillips curve,
showing that there was no necessary inconsistency between markup pricing
and competition.
7Phelps and Taylor (1977) also showed that nominal disturbances could
produce real effects in a rational expectations setting with sticky
prices.
For simplicity adjustment in both models is built entirely or the
dynamics of wages and prices.   In practice, other propagation mechanisms,
such as inventory adjustment arid others described in Section II above,
affect the dynamic adjustment of the economy to demand and supply shocks.

            Contractual   wace setting allows for   potentially   interesting price and

output dynamics in reaponse to disturbances to supply or demand. Particularly
in   the Taylor mode), where workers are concerned over relative wages and wges
are held at a constant level throughout each contract, wage leapfrogging can

produce protracted adjustments3. Because the dynamics depends siqnifcantly

on whether contracts are staggered or co-ordinated, there has been extensive

investi gation of the determinants of the staggering structure4'. Eince rel

world contracts are co—ordinated in some countries (e.g. Japan) and staggered

in others, it is likely that both structures may be stable, depending on              the
predominant sources of disturbances to the economy (Fethke and F'olicano,
19B6). The      efficiency of different staggering structures ha also been
investigated     (e.g. Ball, 1986).

            Although the contract wage setting approach has been fruitfu] ,      it   too

lacks microfoundations. In particular, as pointed out by Barro (1977), it

leaves open the question of why quantities are determined by demand.4' tiore

generally, the fundamental question posed by any non—equilibrium approach to

fluctuations     in which wages or prices are sticky is why, if fluctuations are

economi cally   costly, private agents do not make arrangements that avoid such
costs. 42     The noti on that there must be some market failure, an externality or

40These are reviewed in Blanchard (1988).
4tFischer used the irrLJheory assumption that firms are always on the
demand curve for labor, while Taylor assumed markup pricing and the
aggregate demand determination of output.
42Lucas (1987) has argued that the costs of aggregate fluctuations, as
measured by the variance of consumption, are small. He asserts that in
the post—World War II period, elimination of        all
                                                 variability of aggregate
consumption around trend would have raised utility, in a representative
agent model, by the same amount as an increase in the level of consumption
of one—tenth of one per cent. McCallum (1986) questions this estimate on
the grounds that it assumes the trend is independent of stabilization
policy.

coordination failure, is an old one that has not untii recently received

satisfactory formal treatment, despite the suggestive analysis by Okuri   (1981).
        When sticky wages are responsible for unemployment, the obvious

question is HWhy   don't   the unemployed bid down wages?" Keynes argued that

wage flexibility would not in any case help maintain full employment, because

of adverse effects of expected deflation on demand and employment. More

recently, de Long and Summers (1986) have re—examined this argument, finding

for some parameter values in the Taylor overlapping contractsmodel that wage

flexibility is indeed destabilizing.4

        Solow (1980) forcefully addressed the question of wage stickiness,

arguing that several causes each tend to create sticky wages nd/or prices, and

that the stickiness is a key fact in understanding business cycle

fluctuations. We examine theoretical developments of three of the causes of

wage stickiness that he discussed: long—term labor contracts44, the role of

unions, and efficiency wages. In reviewing these topics, we should note the

distinction between nominal and real rigidity of wages and prices: whereas the

Fischer and Taylor models build on sticky nominal wages or prices, in order to

develop models in which monetary policy has real effects, some of the work to

be reviewed produces real but not nominal price stickiness.

Labor contracts;   Baily   (1974) showed that for any pattern of employment, an

individual without access to the capital markets would prefer more stable to

less stable income. zariadis (1975) examined optimal labor contracts between


4Taylor (1986) claimed on the basis of an emprical analysis comparing
the periods 1891—1914 and post—World War II that greater stickiness of
wages and prices in the United States in the latter period increased the
amplitude of fluctuations given the disturbances affecting the economy.
44This is a much and well surveyed field. See zariadis (1979), Hart
(1983), Rosen (1985), Stiglitz (1986), Hart and Holmstrom (1986),

risk averse workers without access to income insurance markets, and risk

neutral firms.,    finding     that the   real wage in     the   optim1 contract was s.tit.e-
independent,     with    the   firm essentially smoothing the individuals consumption

stream by     paying a constant real wage. Aariadis assumed that workers worked
either     full time or not at all, and that firms made payments only to the

einpl   eyed, the urenpi eyed receiving unemployment compensation or some other
source     of income.
            The Bail y—A:ar i adi s result seemed to provide a reason for stickiness
of real wages and variability of real outputs with real wages sticky rather
than increasing with output, perhaps increases in demand would call forth a
greater Increase in output than in competitive markets. However, it turns out
that    with constant marginal utility of income, output in the 4:ariadis model

would be the same in each state of nature as in a competitive labor market.4

Further, if payments could be made           to   the unemployed, employed and unemployed

workers in the Azariadis model would receive the same income and the employed

would envy the unemployed.

           Insight into the output results in the Azariadis model was provided by

Hall and Lilieri (1979), following an earlier contribution cf Leontief (194)
in any bargaining situation         between workers and a firm, the employment

contract    should in each state of nature satisfy the efficiency condition that
the margi nal value product of labor be equal to the margi nal disutility of
work. The terms of compensation can then be set separately, and do not
necessarily imply that the wage           is equal   to   the   marginal value product of
labor in each state.


45Jf workers utility functions are such as to produce an upward sloping
labor supply curve, employment varies more with labor contracts than in a
competitive    market.

             The mid—seventies approach, which built labor contracts around

di f{erer;ce; in risk—aver sion and access to capital markets, does not iccount

for the fact that firms st employment decisions. The later asymmetric

information approach assume; that the firm knows the state of nature but the

worker does not.4 The          firm and the employees agree on an optimal contract

that speci 11 es wage—employment conbi nati on; in each state of   nature.     8ecause

of the asymmetric information,        contracts have to satisfy an incentive

compatibility      constraint whereby the firm doe; not have an incentive to
misrepresent the state.
             These contracts do imply that the   firm sets the employment level.     In

general they do not satisfy the ex post efficiency condition, and thus can
account for departures from Wairasian quantity levels. However, it also turns

out that      unless firms   are more risk averse than workers, optimal asymmetric

information contracts generally imply more employment in bad states of natures

than would occur in a competitive non—contract labor market. This——together

with   the    difficulty of deriving results-—has led to some discouragement over

the contract route to explaining economic fluctuations.47 Nonetheless, the

fact that asymmetric information——which certainly exists——makes for

inefficient employment levels, is itself an important result.

Unions        The labor contracting approach to wage and output determination
assumes that there is free entry into the labor pool attached to each firm,
When workers are unionized, the union may control access to        the firm's labor
force,    and may have its own utility 4unction.4

summary.
Grossmn, Hart and Maskin (1983) have embedded asymmetric information

change the variance of a variable relevant to firms' employment decisions
may affect the aggregate level of employment.

          McDonald and Scilow (1981) showed that in contracts between a union

 (with given membership) and a firm, and given certain assumptions on the

determinants of the bargaining outcome,    the behavior of the real wage ever the
cycle is determined by the cyclical behavior of the     wage elasticity of demand

for   labor. Thus with a constant elasticity of labor demand, the rel wage
would be invariant over the cycle, so long a; not all     members of the union

were employed. This is another potential reason for real wage stickiness.
         However, as noted by McDonald and Below, their model is partial
equilibrium and   deals with wage and quantity   determination in a single period.
Unemployment occurs within the   period when the demand for labor is low. But
the average level of unemployment in a succession of one—period models

realizations would depend on the dynamics of the reservation wage.      If unions

are to produce a higher average rate of unemployment than would occur in

competitive markets, they have somehow to maintain a higher reservation wage

than the competitive wage.

         If unions succeed in obtaining high wages that cause unemployment in

the short run, the dynamics of employment depends on whether it is possible

for a non—unionized ;cctor to develop. The existence of a pool of unemployed

workers provide; the opportunity for new firms to undercut existing firms by

employing the current unemployed at wages below union rates. If this process

works slowly, the presence of unions may account for slow adjustment of

unemployment towards the natural rate.     If unions rigorously control entry,

they may be responsible for permanently higher unemployment..

         There has been much interest, particularly in Europe, in using union

models or related insider—outsider model; to explain per;istent high
                                       48


unemployment (Lindbeck and Snower, 1984). Unions may be able to affect the

average   level of ureiploymert if they control   entry into the workforce.   The

key issue   then is what is the union utility function. For instance, if unions
are concerned only with the interests of their current membership, they may

totally ignore the unemployed1 and can produce long—term unemployment

(Blanchard and Summers1 1986),

          Tti policy implications of insider—outsider models are not

unambiguous. Presumably they justify open shop legislation and other steps to

break union control over entry into the work{orce; alternately, Layard (19B6>

argues for subsidi:ation of the unemployed outsiders to allow them to break

E+ficency_Wges       The   efficiency wage hypothesis is that the wage affects
worker productivity.49 In underdeveloped countries1 low wages may impair
strength and concentration and raising the wage may reduce the unit cost of

the effective labor input.

          There are several rationales for the efficiency wage hypothesis even

where physical strength is not an issue. The simplest is the sociological

explanation, that firms that pay higher wages generate a more loyal and

therefore more productive wrk force. In the shirking model (e.g. Shapiro and

Stiglitz, 1984) firms can only imperfectly monitor worker performance.

Workers who are caught shirking can be punished only by being fired, in which

case they receive the alternative wage. By paying wages above the alternative

rate, firms provide an incentive to workers not to shirk. One criticism of

this model is that shirking can also be prevented by alternative mechanisms,

such as the posting by workers of performance bonds.


49Katz (1986) presents an excellent survey and empirical examination of
the efficiency wage hypothesis.
                                             49


           The   shi rkir;g   modEl provides an e>planation for   dual labor markets, in
which higher wages are paid for primary jobs than for second.ry (in which

shirbrg is difficult) perhaps even for workers with           the sane abihty.
Whether the shirking model generates unemployment depends on how large the

secondary market is relative to the primary; certainly it is possible to

generate wait unemployment in a dual labor market if workers are willing to

work   at the primary but not        the secondary wage (Hall, 1975).

           The implications of efficiency wage theories for macroeconomic

fluctuations depend on their ratioriale.1 Solow (1979) showed that the wage

may be constant (at the unit labor cost minimizing level) in an efficiency

wage eodel ,      In underdeveloped econcimi es this would peg the r el wge at
level determined by physical efficiency. In the shirking model, the

efficiency wage would be set as a differential above the secondary wage.            It

would not then prDvide a justification for sticky real or nominal wages

without further explanation for the stickiness of the secondary wage, or some

explanation of why the primary wage itself was sticky.            In both these case;,

it   is, if arythi ng , the     real wage rather than the nomi ral wage that would be

stick y.

           Sociological       theories that build on the adverse effects of wage cuts

on morale could account for either nominal or real wage stickiness. Casual

observation certainly supports the notion that wage cutting has ar adverse

effect on morale, but the deep reasons for that are unclear. Conceivably this

is a self—justifying convention. Alternatively, relative wages may affect

wage cuts across decentralized firms

Summa!1: With one       possible   exception, contract theory, union   wage models, nd
efficiency       wage theories account for real rather than noninal wage rigidity.

The possible exception is the nominal wage version of the argument that wage

cutting reduces worker morale——but this hypothesis         amounts to little   more than

restating    the puz:le of the apparent inflexibility of wages.4

           The    union and efficiency wage models may also help account for

unemployinent'. To the extent that they produce both unemployment and rigid

real wages, they also account for the fact that cyclical changes in the rato

of employment are accompanied by only small changes in the real wage,

Sticky   Prices.

           The Keynesian tradition and the Phillips curve emphasize nominal wage

stickiness. Strictly interpreted, the aggregate supply theories outlined

above account for real wage stickiness. Coordination problems-—the ct that

given other wages and prices, any change in a wage is a change in both the

real and relative wage——could perhaps generate nominal wage stickiness out cf

real    wage stickiness. However, coordination problems fail to explain why all

2Certainly  observation of the economics profession suggests a keen
interest in relative wages, and sometimes discontent over relative wage
reductions that are also absolute wage increases.
This is the General Theory argument that the aggregate wage level may be
sticky because workers concerned with their relative wages resist cuts in
their own wages which, given other wages, would imply a reduced relative
wage.
54Nominal wage cuts in the early eighties in the United States certainly
establish that nominal wages are not completely inflexible downward, but
those cuts nonetheless appear to have been regarded as excepti onal rather
than the establishment of a new norm.
Bulow and Summers (1986) press the case for the efficiency wage as an
explanation of unemployment and other ailments.
wages are not routinely indexed. The conclusion is either that the original

enphasi s on nominal wage sti ckiriess was misplaced, or that nomini] wage

stickiness still awaits an explanation. The preoccupation with nominal wage

rigidity could be misleading though, a reflection of hysteresis in the

development of macroeconomic models, for rigid real wages are also a real

world problem with important macroeconomic consequences (e.g Iruno and Sach,

1985).

          tiore recently the emphasis has shifted from sticky wages to sticky

prices. The new approaches generally start from a now widely—used model of

imperfect competition in   the goods markets that builds on the work of Dixit
and Stiqlitz (1977) .      That imperfect competition is widespread is suggested

both by observation and by the work of Hall (1986) on markups in U.s.

industry.

Imperfect competition_gL_LLLbriurj            The General   Theor and the
monopolistic or imperfect competition revolutions occurred simultaneously.

The notion that there should be close connections between them Is an old one,

but the connection has only recently been made explicit. The intuitive reason

there may be a link is that the (eynesian assumption that suppliers are always

willing to sell more if demand at the existing price increases is a

characteristic of a monopolistic equilibrium. The reason to doubt the link,

at least in the case of nominal disturbances, is that monopolistic equilibrium

determines a set of relative prices, which will surely be invariant to nominal

shocks.

          The following general equilibrium model monopolistic competition             can

be used to make both points. There are n producer—consumErs, each consuming

all goods but      producing only one, with the following utility functions:
                                              (1—v
(1) U (C /1)          C (t'h /P) / C 1— ) )          —    Cd/b) Y   1 > >0; d>0; p 1

and   P      ((1/n) E


          Utility depends positively on consumption, C and on real money

balances t11/P, and negatively on the output of good i, Y. The production of

good i uses labor; the labor input enters the utility function in the form

shown either because production is subject to diminishing returns or because

labor is subject to increasing marginal disutility. The consumption of all

goods enters the utility function symmetrically.

          The utility function implies a constant elasticity of substitution

between goods, equal to 0.              Constant terms in the utility function are

introduced for convenience. Feal money balances enter the utility function,

and play a key role in transmitting effects of money stock disturbances to

demand.

            Producer i sets price to maxinie utility, taking the                          actions of other
producers (their prices) as given. This implies the relative price:

                                                    p—I       (1 / ( 1@ (p—i))

            So long as there are increasing marginal costs of production

(p ) 1), an increase in (t'l'/P) results in both a higher relative price and

higher output. With constant costs of production an increase in (M'/P) would

result in no change in the relative price, and an increase in output.

            Finally, recognizing the symmetry, all relative prices are equal to

one, which implies from (4) the equilibrium value of the aggregate price level

F',    and the   level   of output of each producer:
                                 (1/ (1-p))

            Note first that in equilibrium the quantity theory holds: the nominal
price level is proportional to the money stock.                              It is also true though   that
if     P1' were to increase, and producers for some reason were to keep their

nominal prices constant, the utility of each would increase. This is because

price exceeds marginal cost. That is the source of an aggregate demand
externality: if prices are fully flexible, each producer raises price when the

money stock rises, and all producers acting         together   thereby reduce aggregate

demand and   welfare.
TePAYMinsiaht           The   derivative   of the profit {uncton   of a   price setting

firm with respect t price is zero at the optimum. Thus divergences of price

from the optimum produce only second order reductions of profits. Parkin

(1986), Akerlof and      Yellen   (1985) and Mankiw (1985> observed that, combined

with even small costs of changing prices, this         implies   that changes in demand

may lead monopolistically competitive firms not to change price and instead to

satisfy demand.°

        Thus shifts in aggregate demand may lead to changes in             output.
Further, the increase in demand may make everyone better off, in a first order

way, because of the excess of price over marginal cost in the initial

situation.

        More precisely, the PAYM insight is that if all firms are at their

optimal price, and there are some fixed costs of changing price, a

sufficiently small increase in aggregate demand will lead to a welfare-

increasing expansion of output.

        Cost; of price change are often described as menu          costs,    implying a

physical cost of resetting a price.          It is difficult to think of many goods

for which such costs could be non—trivial. There may be a fixed decision cost

to the firm of reconsidering the price it charges for a particular good. Dr

there may be a loss of goodwill for firms that change price. Okun (1981)

argued that the goodwill cost is incurred by firms that change prices in


-Rotemberg (1987) named this the F'AYM insight.

response   to demand shocks, but not by firms whose price rises merely pass cost

     rasts or to customers..

          The   ass.uupti on in these cases s that there      is a fixed cost to
changing price.      Rotemberg (1982) investigates the effects on price and output

dynamics of quadratic costs. of price change. Whereas. with          fixed   costs of

changing price, a large enough shift in demand will produce small effects on

output because most firms will adjust price, with quadratic costs of price

change, larger shifts in demand cause larger changes in output.

          More careful examination of the PYM insight raises. several other

interesting issues. First, there may be multiple equilibria. In response to

a given shift in demand, both no change in price by any firm and full response

in price by all firms may be Nash equilibria (Rotemberg, 1987; Ball and Romer,

19B7).    In this sense, Ball and Romer argue that sticky prices may represent a

coordination failure.9 Second, there is the question of why firms would find

it more costly to adjust price than quantity. Changing production plans too

appears to involve decision costs. One possibility for a large firm selling

to   sophisticated   buyers in   that   whereas   the production decision is internal
and has to be made daily, the price decision ha to be communicated to a large

group of actual and potential buyers, and is thus more costly.

          Third, there is   the   question of the effects of aggregate demand shifts

on output and prices when not all firms are at their optimum price at any one

time.    Caplin and Spulber (1986) show that if firms are uniformly distributed

over the interval in which prices are set, and if the firms follow s—S pricing

policies60, then the distribution is maintained even after demand changes, and


See also Cooper and John (1985) on coordination failures.
'°Barro (1972) introduced s—S pricing rules for a monopolist. Sheshinski
and Weiss (1977) show that if the aggregate price level is increasing at a
constant rate, and if there are fixed costs of changing price, then it is
optimal for firms to use an s—S pricing policy in which relative price is
allowed to drop to a level s before being adjusted upwards to level S.

appears to    destroy the effects of the PAYtI insight   that produces Keynesian
results in the monopolistic competition model. owever, the Cap1in-pulber
result   is not robust either to the effects of discrete shock changes in the

money stock (Rotemberg, 1967), or to the possibility that prices. may     fall     as

well as rise (Dlanchard, 1988).

         It is not yet known what form optimal pricing behavior takes when the

aggregate price level is not growing steadily. An interesting result has been

obtained by Tsiddon (1986), who examines. the adjustment to an unexpected

change in the aggregate inflation rate. When the inflation rate falls, the s—

S range falls. This means that at the moment of the change, a number of fl nis

find themselves below the new optimal s, and should therefore raise price to

the new S. Some firms will be above the new 8; they however may find it

optimal to let their excessively high price be eroded by inflation rather than

adjust it. The implication is that a reduction in the growth rate of money

may initially lead to an increase in the price level.

                                  Blanchard (1988) draws the distinction between

state dependent pricing rules, such as the s—S rule, and tine—dependent rule;,

in which prices are reset at particular time;. The extent of time dependency

varies across firms, for example between firms that print catalogs and those

that sell perishables. Further, even for firms that usually set prices at

particular times, large shocks may well disturb the regular pattern.'


£lTime dependent wage setting appears to be relatively more widespread
than time—dependent price setting.

dependency of price setting.              key issue for dynamics in this case, as in the

case of wage setting, is whether           price       setting is staggered cr synchronized.

Olanchard (1903) has used a stage of processing model to show how even short

lag; in    adjusting   prices can produce long aggregate lags if price setting is

staggered.

           ilSO as in the case of wage setting, the question of the stability of

the staggering structure arises.               If an increase in the aggregate price level

increase; the desired price of a given firm, price staggering is unlikely to

be stable. For instance, where prices are fixed for two period;, if more than

half the prices re adjusted in even               period;, those wh adjust       price in odd

periods have an incentive to move their adjustment to the even period—-because

the price rise that they observe after the first period causes them to want to

raise price. Of course, price adjustments are not synchronized in practice

the    staggering may to some     extent be due to seasonality and the non—

synchronization to the idiosyncratic shocks hitting the firm (Ball and                   Romer,

1986).

                                           It   is not     obvious in the monopolistic
competition model outlined above why              worker/firm; are willing to      supply more

output   when demand increases.          In that model, increase; in labor input are
called   forth   by increases in    the    real       wage, with   larger   implying greater

sensitivity of the real wage to output.

           If    were close to one,       output would change without         much change in the

real   wage. But if       were   close    to    one, equilibrium business cycle theory
would have no difficulty accounting for the observed real wage—employment
relationship. New Iseynesianc have taken two alternative routes in explaining

the cyclical behavior of the         real    wage    in    monopolistic competition models.

$larichard and Kiyotaki (1987) model each worker as a monopolistilIy

competitive seller of labor.           At   their    optimum quantity of labor sold, worktrs

suffer little change in utility from working slightly more or less. That

could explain the cyclical real—wage employment relationship if all variations
in labor input were in hours, but            is    less persuasive when        a considerable    part

oc the variation takes the form of unemployment of the worker.

          A1:erlof and   '(ellen    (1985) instead assume monopolistic competition in

the goods markets and an efficiency wage model in the labor markets. The real
wage is held      ccristart at   the effi ci ant level ,       arid var   i ati otis in demand 1cr

goods    are translated into shifts in            output    at the same real wage.


V.         _e lop m ants.


           In   this section I briefly      review recent developments in areas              that
have not so     far been discussed.

          There    are now crariy rational expectations models with multiple
equilibria.         There is     nothing exceptional in the result that changes in
expectations affect the equilibrium of the economy; the interesting feature is

that those changed expectations (animal spirits) may be correct and thus self—

iu;tilying. This is a rigorous Justification of the notion that optimism

itself    may be sufficient to create a boom, or that all we have to fear is fear

itself.


62Rotemberg (1987) categorizes and concisely reviews these models, which
include contributions by A:ariadis (1981), Cass and Shell (1983), Diamond
and Fudenberg (1962) and Shlcifer (1986),

        Rotemberg (19B7) review; the varieties of multiple rquilitriik and

their implications. Among the striking results are those by Kehoc and Levine

(198), showing an extreme multiplicity of equilibcia in overlapping

generations models; by Grandmont (1985) showing that deterministic cycles of

virtually any order can—-under some restrictions on utility functions-be

generated as rational expectations equilibria in an overlapping geriertions

model with money a; the only asset; and by Robert; (1986) producing a

multiplicity of unemployment equilibria at talrasian prices.

        Policy analysis appears difficult when it is not clear at which

equilibrium the model will start, nor to which equilibrium a policy change or

other shocks will move it. One possibility is that multiple equilibria

enhance the role of policy, because the government may be able to provide some

focus for expectations about which is the relevant equilibrium (for instance

the full employment equilibrium). An alternative view is that models with

multiple equilibria are incomplete, awaiting the improved specification that

will remove the multiplicities.

Credit Rationing.

        The recent concentration on the aggregate supply question 0   why

output varies with only small variations in real wages has supplanted a

similar earlier question, of how monetary policy affects real activity when

interest rate movements are relatively small.   In part the earlier question

has been obscured because interest rate movements——both nominal and real—-have

become much larger in the 1970's and 1980's than in earlier decades; in

addition, doubts have arisen about the effects of monetary policy on real

output, as the rise of the real business cycle approach testifies.
                                       60




        Participants   ri credit markets believe that credit is rationed, in         the
sense that individuals or firms cannot      typically borrow as much   as they want
to at the going interest rate. Credit rationing was part of the transmission
mechanism for monetary policy in the MIT—Penn—SSRC model; with sticky interest
rates, monetary policy affects the availability     of   bank credit arid thus the
volume of investment   without necessarily   affecting interest rates.
        Credit   rationing is   certainly understandable when   interest rates are

controlled, say by usury ceilings. But credit is likely to be rationed even

without interest rate controls, for at least two reasons arising from

incomplete information under uncertainty.4 First is adverse selection: as

interest rates rise, banks are likely to attract riskier borrowers. The

second is moral hazard: as interest rates rise, borrowers tend to undertake

more risky project5.    In each case an increase in the interest rate may reduce

the banks expected return; the bank therefore rations credit.          In his

innovative   thesis, Keeton (1979) demonstrates these two effects. He also

draws a distinction between Type I and Type 11 rationing: the former applies

when each indivi dual receives less than the amount he or she would wart at the

going interest   rate; the latter when among identical individuals some are

rationed and some are not.


6:llen (1987) provides a comprehensive survey of the credit rationing
literature. Stiglitz and Weiss (1987) review their earlier
contributions arid criticisms of them.
64The case for the importance of credit market phenomena, arising from
imperfect information, in accounting for economic fluctuations and the
apparent role of money in them has been made most vigorously by
Greenwald and Stiglitz (1987).
                                            61




             Although   c.redi t reti On ng pr oduce; the   appearance of nor cler I
markets, it does not necessarily imply an inefficient              allocation   of rurces
(EngHsh, 1986). Along similar lines, Yotsuuka (1987)                 shows that   even with
credit   rationing, Ricardian equivalence may hold.

             The   sense that credit rationing is an i mportarst component of the
monetary mechanism was reinforced by the findings of Friedman (1983) that the
debt—GNP ratio was among the most stable of macro ratios, HoweVer, in an
example of Goodhart or Murphy's Law, the debt—6NP ratio              began   to diverge from

previous      behavi or shortly after the Federal Reserve started arnounci rig         tar gets

for   the growth rate of debt.
             Bernanke (1983), re—examining the Great Depression, argues that the
increased cost of financial intermediation was largely responsible for the
collapse      of investment, Beyond the effects of credit on demand, Blinder
(1985) claims that credit rationing affects aggregate supply. This is a

variant on the familiar Keyserlirsg—Patman—Cavallo—and—many—others argument

that higher interest rates are inflationary because they increase costs, A

sophisticated        general equilibrium model of credit rationing and its impact on
the macroeconomy ha been developed by Bernanke and Gertler (1987), who start
from asymmetric information between borrowers and lenders and show that firms'

balance sheets matter, and that in some circumstances government bailouts of

weak firms may be appropriate.

Banki   n.
             Fana (1980) and Fischer Black (1975) re—examined the theory of the

banking firm, providing an         abstract view of its     role, as portfolio manager and
operator     of    the accounting system. By and large this so—called new view of
                                           62



bnH rig   had       rio implications for the monetiry   mechanism beyond those already

clear from Patinkin (196).

          The common literary       notion that bank    runs may be self—justifying

prophecies was confirmed by Diamond and Dybvig (1983), who also discussed how

deposit insurance could he a self—denying prophecy. King (1983) assessed

theoretical         issues that have to be faced in analyzing the    nineteenth   century

question of whether a competitive banking system with free entry would be
viable——an issue that the banking deregulation movement makes more than

academic.



          Shiller       (1979) inaugurated a    protracted and fierce debate over the

issue of excess volatility of the stock market. The simple—minded observer
watching the U.S. stock market rise by a factor of almost three            between 1982

and   1987 asks whether anything objective          could possibly account for that

increase, or whether some         bubble or other irrationality might he

responsible     •




          It    was Shiller's considerable achievement to propose a way of

answering that question because a rational stock price is the present

discounted value of dividends, the variance of stock prices should be related

to characteristics of the joint stochastic processes for dividends and the

discount factor. Shiller assumed the discount factor constants and argued

that stock prices fluctuated excessively. The Shiller tests were rapidly

applied to the term structure of interest arid exchange rates with asset

pricestypically being found to fluctuate excessively.


65Jacklin  (1986) describes and        extends subsequent developments.
'6This sentence appears in the         September 1987 first draft of this paper.
                                           63



          The subsequent debate seemed to pit fice conomlsts against

matroecoriomi st; ,   with   the advantage hi {ti rig over   ti ne to fi Tianco. '' The
issue is the stationarity of the dividend process; most recent work tends to

find that the stock market does rot necessarily fluctuate excesively (see for

example t(leidon (1986) and Marsh and Merton (1986)), though anomalies remain

in stock price behavior.

          At the sane time as the empirical literature on excess volatility

developed, so did a theoretical literature on the possibility of bubbles in

asset prices.         bubble is a self—justifying departure of the stochastic

process for an asset price from its fundamentals, and is another example of

multiple equilibria. At a given rate of return1 r, on an asset, the expected

value of the bubble component of price has to grow at rate r. The first

bubbles were deterministic: but a bubble could typically not be expected to

grow at rate r if the economy was efficient, because it would eventually come

to dominate the economy. Blanchard (1979) produced partial equflibrium

examples of stochastic or bursting bubbles which would be expected to grow at

rate r   but would almost     surely have burst by some point.       In general

equilibrium,    Tirole (1985) has shown      that   bubbles can exist only in
inefficient equilibria in which        the growth   rate exceeds the interest rate, and

that bubbles tend to be welfare—increasing.

seen how Black Monday will affect both the statistical and the polemical
debates.
                                           64



             Barro   (1974) inaugurated another protracted debate,    this   one over the

question      of whether individual; treat government bonds as net wealth.

Patinkin (196, p289) had discussed the implication; of the issue for the

neutrality of money and the effects of open market operations on interest

rate;.       It seemed clear that if the    debt floated by   the government is to be

paid   off    by future generations, then the future taxes implied by current debt

would riot     4fst    the asset value of the debt. Barros contribution was to

show that finite lived individuals concerned about the welfare of their

descendent; might nonetheless behave as effectively infinitely lived, and thus

take into account the taxes to be levied on future generations.

             although the   issue was posed as 'i; the debt wealth", the answer      is

also key to the questions of whether in fully neoclassical models fiscal

policy   affects real       interest rates, whether federal budget deficits affect

national saving and the trade account, whether open market operations are

neutral, whether social security affects the capital stock, and so forth.

             Bernheim (1987) present; an account of the analytic arid empirical

literature it is clear that there are many reasons that Ricardian equivalence

could fail to hold, ard it is also clear that the evidence at this stage is

insufficient to change the prior views of most economists by very much.

Poterba and Summers (1987) argue that the concentration on finite hori:ons is

misleading, in that typically most of the debt will be paid off by those

currently alive, The U.S. fiscal policy experiment of the early 1980';

should, one might hope, have settled         the issue once—for—all: the major change
in the deficit raised real interest rates and did not increase private saving.

However that is only one episode, and its influence in regressions appears

insufficient to reject Ricardian equivalence (Evans, 1987).
           Barqent and Wallace; (1B1) startling claim that aonctary          {inancinq
of a government budget deficit could produce a higher inflat.ion rate than

monetary    financing increased the awareness of the intertemporal implication;
of the government budget constraint. The argument is that if           the deficit will
ul t mately be financed by money printing, then       the mccuiul at ion of i   nt crest on
the debt will require higher seigriorage revenue jr the future—-which would
imply a higher steady state inflation rate with bond financing, arid could even

imply higher inflation now. The subsequent debate clarified not only the

reasonably general conditions under which the result holds, but also the

relationship between budget deficits and inflation (Drazcn and Helpman, 1986),

which   depends on the policies that are expected to be used to reduce the
deficit to a sustainable level.

Index ati on.

           In 1974 Milton Friedman returned from Brazil convinced that indeatior

would protect the real economy from monetary disturbances and thereby reduce

the cost; of inflation. Bray (1976) and Fischer (1977) confirmed that

indexation      indeed neutralized the effect; of monetary shocks on
variables;      indexatiori in   the capital market; iould also neutrali:e   the effect;

of nominal shocks. But indeation might amplify the real effect; of real

shocks to the economy.

           Given the clear result; on indexation and nominal shock;, the minimal

adoption    of indexation in private contract; remains difficult to explain.
Evidently    there are major advantages to     nominal contracting that   are not

captured by existing models.          One possibility is that nominal shock; account

for only a small part of the uncertainty about the outcomes o contracts,
                                       66




which, together with small costs of adding complexity to contract;, prevent;

index ation.

         The experience of accelerating inflation in heavily indexed economies

such as Brazil and Israel ha; been a chastening experience for proponents of

indexation.    The fact that high inflation reflects problems in policy making

was not taken sufficiently into account; if as a result of indexation the

real effects of inflation are reduced, the result may be an increase in the

rate of inflation to achieve similar real effects.

         Weitzman'; much-discus;ed proposal that workers take part of their

compensation as a share of profits bears some similarity to indexing of the

wage to profits, at the firm level. Weitzan (e.g. 1986) argue; that firms

are more willing to hire labor in a profit—sharing scheme, which would enhance

macroeconomic stability. The extent to which superior Japanese unemployment

experience reflect; their bonus system is a key issue in evaluating profit-

sharing. There has been intensive examination of the issue in Britain, where

incentives for profit—sharing have been provided in the budget.

The TheorLf Growth.

         Pi{ter rapid development in   the 4fties arid sixties, the theories of
economic growth and capital received relatively little attention for almost

two decades, despite the absolutely central importance of growth to economic

performance. The Ramsey—Solow and Samuelson's overlapping generations models

became workhorses of micro—based macroeconomics, but the theory of growth a;


Blanch4lower and Oswald (1986), who present evidence that profit—
sharing has been widely used in Britain, and Estrin, Grout and Wadwhani
(1987) take a sceptical view o4 the stabilizing and other beneficial
effects of profit—sharing.
                                    67




such was neglected. The worldwide growth slowdown made it inevitable that

interest in growth would revive, though neither theory nor intensive       empirical
work has yet provided a persuasive explanation for the slowdown. Recent work

has emphasized the role of economies     of scale in   the growth process (e.g.

Romer, 1987).

The Theory_of Policy.

        The rational expectations revolution in macroeconomic; and game theory
have combined to produce a far more sophisticated approach to the analysis of
pal icy than was state—of—the—art a decade ago. A key paper here is Kydland
and Prescott (1977), which introduced the problem of dynamic inconsistency of

optimal policy and argued that the dynamic inconsistency arising irom

discretionary policy—making could be prevented by adopting policy rules.

Developing the game theory approach, Prescott (1978) dismIssed the use of

optimal control theory for the design of optimal policy on the grounds that

economic agent; do not respond mechanistically to changes in policy rules.

        The game theoretic approach to policy makes if possible to model

notions such as reputation and credibility that have long been staples of

policymakers'   own discussions of their actions.? The predictive content of
these applications, as opposed to their usefulness in providing insights,
remains to be developed. Barro and Gordon (1983) showed that discretionary

monetary policy—making could produce an inflationary bias, but subsequent

developments that allow for reputational effects have weakened that result;

nor is it clear how to test it.


69This large and rapidly growing literature receives little space here
because it has been surveyed at length by, among others, Fischer (1986)
and Rogoff (1987).

VI Concluding_Comment.


          Any comparison of the contents of this survey with that of Barro arid
Fischer (1976)     must conclude that there has been a tremendous increase in the

breadth   and depth of macroeconomics in the past decade. Technical progress
from the side of both theory and econometrics has made It possible to address

and illuminate issues that were simply too difficult before——such as the

excess volatility of asset prices, the macroeconomic implications of

monopolistic competition, coordination problems in the macroeconomy, bank

runs, and the existence of multiple equilibria, to pick             just a few examples.
          There is no question that macroeconomics is far more microeconomics

based than it used to be.      In a sense the microeconomic foundations of macro

now exist,     in equilibrium models of     the Prescott—Kydland type in     the

equilibrium     approach, and in models such as the Akerlof—Yellen model in the

post—Keynesian approach. But to a considerable extent the earlier notion that

once the microeconomic foundations had been laid, a set of standard macro

models    could be used, has not been justified. Rather the tendency has been to
build a variety of     micro—based models, each making or emphasizing a specific

point.

          A   three equation macromodel ,      consisting of   the IS—LM apparatus plus an

aggregate supply equation is frequently used.            In the simplest version the IS—

LM   side is reduced to the quantity equation or a Clower constraint, and a
Lucas aggregate supply equation, or one in which exogenous productivity shocks
drive output, is added.      In the more Keynesian versions, velocity becomes a
                                           69




functi on   of the nterest r ate, arid there is more detail on the demand side.
In terms of this model, there has been advance in testing of the aggregate

demand side (e.g. Hall      (197B) on consumption)    but not to the same extent in
understanding of the structural determinants         of demand; there has been real

progress in analysis of the financial markets, though not necessarily in

understanding of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy; ard there is
greater understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of the supply side.

           Has macroeconomics progressed? Yes; there has been remarkable

progress in understanding many theoretical issues, some specified above, that

were only imprecisely understood before. There has also been progress in

understanding the     structure   of the   basic macro model.

           And   yet: there is   greater not less confusion at the business end of

macroeconomics,     in understanding the actual causes of macroeconomic

fluctuations,     and in applying   macroeconomics to policy-making. Revealing
untruths    is of course progress, and it is possible that the greater

uncertainty that now exists is part of the process of rubble—clearing that

precedes the erection of a new structure.

           Probably it is not, Rather there are two factors at work, One is the

increasing realization of the extraordinary difficulty of settling disputes

with econometric evidence. Take for instance the issues of Ricardian

equivalence and excess volatility of asset prices. Both are quite

fundamental,     both have been the subjects of intensive       empirical scrutiny, but

neither has yielded to the time series evidence brought to bear.
                                         70




          What the implications of the lack of cutting power of time series

macroeconoftetric; may be remains to be seen. The use of panel data,

statistical   events studies as in     finance, and careful case studies of

particular episodes, are all obvious possibilities.

          The ;ecnd factor is that      it    ha; become fashionable, at least in   the
United States, to claim that economists have little to say on the policy
issues of the day, beyond recommending institutional reforms, That is the

comparative advantage of some. But it would not be progress for

macroeconomi ;ts   in general to    avoid current policy issues, for instance by

arguing   that while we   can (perhaps) design a      good budget rule, we cannot
answer the question of    whether    the budget deficit should be cut now or    not.

The decision will be made, one way or the other, and the abdication of serious

nacroeconomists leaves the policy advice business to those either ignorant or

unscrupulous enough to claim full understanding of the issues.

Macroecoromists will not be able seriously to participate in such analyses

without the use of models, small or large, that attempt to quantify the impact

of policy decisions.

          Finally one has to ask where the field is heading. There are two

correct answer;. One is that the field is no longer a field, that it is too

big for any researcher to describe her or himself a; a specialist in it, and

that much of macroeconomics will gradually meld into subspecialties and partly

be absorbed in existing fields.

          The second is that macroeconomics will continue just as long as

macroeconomic fluctuations. If one further takes the (appropriate) view that

business fluctuations are not caused by one major set of shocks, nor
                                       71




propagated      rnin1y by a inqle inportant mecharrn, then   progress   will have to
be made in evaluating the significance of each mechanism and 4itting the

pieces    together. That   is what macroeconometr i c models att empt to do; it

also what Kydland and Prescott attempt in their calibrated (1982) model.

Within    such models, the aggregate supply side remains   the outstanding

chal   lenge.
