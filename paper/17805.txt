The Firm-Level Credit Multiplier

                                              ABSTRACT

We study the effect of asset tangibility on corporate financing and investment decisions. Financially
constrained firms benefit the most from investing in tangible assets because those assets help relax
constraints, allowing for further investment. Using a dynamic model, we characterize this effect –
which we call firm-level credit multiplier – and show how asset tangibility increases the sensitivity
of investment to Tobin’s Q for financially constrained firms. Examining a large sample of manufacturers
over the 1971-2005 period as well as simulated data, we find support for our theory’s tangibility–investment
channel. We further verify that our findings are driven by firms’ debt issuance activities. Consistent
with our empirical identification strategy, the firm-level credit multiplier is absent from samples of
financially unconstrained firms and samples of financially constrained firms with low spare debt capacity.

1        Introduction
The interplay between real and financial decisions is a central issue in corporate finance research.
Accordingly, a large body of literature examines when firms should invest and how they should
finance their projects. The literature, however, often fails to appreciate the impact of contracting
frictions on firms’ ability to raise funds for investment. As a result, the investment process is
generally taken as exogenous to firms’ financial status and financing decisions.
        Financing frictions manifest themselves in many different ways. They typically make it harder
for firms to raise fairly-priced funds to finance their projects. As a result, the availability of financ-
ing — rather than the availability of investment opportunities — drives firms’ investment spending.
Some of the most commonly observed financing frictions stem from the limited enforceability of
contracts, especially in poor states of the world. Evidence suggests that firms strategically default
on their contractual obligations when liquidation values are too low to keep investors committed to
termination (Gilson et al. (1990) and Altman (1991)). Theoretical models recognize this problem
and characterize financing arrangements that commit investors to costly termination outcomes (see
Harris and Raviv (1990) and Bolton and Scharfstein (1990)). Although they vary in their design,
the element that makes these contracts enforceable has a common real-world counterpart: the sal-
ability or “tangibility” of the company’s assets.1 The tangibility of corporate assets is not only tied
to the firm’s investment process (asset tangibility is a function of the firm’s line of business and
capital accumulation process), but also to the firm’s ability to raise external funds.
        This paper explores an inherent attribute of the firm — the tangibility of its operating assets —
to characterize an endogenous relation between firms’ real and financial decisions in the presence
of financing imperfections. The tangibility of a firm’s assets affects its ability to pledge collateral,
which serves as creditors’ “enforceable” outside option in contract renegotiations. As such, asset
tangibility reduces debtors’ incentive to default strategically, enlarging the firm’s debt capacity.
While variants of the asset tangibility–investment channel have been described in prior work in
macroeconomics (see Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) and Bernanke et al. (2000)), the idea has not been
articulated in a firm-level setting. The extant literature lacks a theory with implications for cross-
sectional investment as well as empirical tests for the real effects of contract enforceability frictions.
        We argue that firms that face financing frictions can benefit the most from the larger debt
capacity that is created by tangible assets. In particular, access to more (or cheaper) credit allows
firms to invest more without resorting to costly external equity or public unsecured debt. We
show that the additional investment — in tangible assets — further relaxes constraints, albeit at
a diminishing rate. In this way, investment is amplified by a financing feedback of asset tangibility
that arises endogenously in the presence of contracting frictions. Our analysis formalizes the mech-
anism through which asset tangibility amplifies the impact of shocks to the firm’s opportunity set
    1
    Hereinafter, the term “asset tangibility” is generally adopted and meant to summarize the liquidation value and
ease of redeployment of a firm’s capital from the perspective of outside creditors in the event of default.

onto the firm’s investment and financing across time. We call this mechanism the firm-level credit
multiplier. The mechanism we characterize arises from the interplay between asset tangibility,
renegotiable bank debt, costly equity financing, and investment and differs from the economy-wide
credit multiplier discussed in the macroeconomics literature. As we discuss below, the firm-level
credit multiplier yields a number of new testable predictions, such as the increased sensitivity of
investment to Tobin’s Q for financially constrained firms.
   The dynamic model we use is uniquely suitable for the purpose of our analysis. Among other
features, it allows us to compute security values, characterize dynamic aspects of the credit multi-
plier, and gauge the impact of financing–investment interactions upon a number of variables that
are of wide interest for empirical research (e.g., Q and debt issuance). In addition to closed-form
solutions for constrained and unconstrained firm values and financing–investment strategies, the
model enables us to simulate artificial panel data sets and conduct cross-sectional tests similar to
those later performed in our empirical tests (based on COMPUSTAT data).
   Our model’s central results guide us in performing novel empirical tests on the extensively stud-
ied relation between corporate investment and Q. The model shows, for example, that the impact
of the credit multiplier on investment is only significant for firms that face financing frictions and
that it increases with the degree of tangibility of those firms’ assets. Empirically, both Q and
asset tangibility are expected to affect investment behavior, but the model’s credit multiplier effect
implies that the interaction of these two variables will have a strong positive impact on investment
in a cross-section of financially constrained firms. Put differently, our theory predicts that positive
innovations to investment prospects prompt stronger responses in observed capital spending when
the firm solves a constrained optimization problem and its assets are more tangible.
   We test our theory using a large sample of manufacturers over the 1971–2005 period. As is stan-
dard in the corporate investment literature, we identify the predictions of our model based on com-
parisons between firms that are likely to be more financially constrained (“constrained firms”) and
firms that are likely to be less constrained (“unconstrained firms”). We employ multiple schemes to
partition the data into constrained and unconstrained subsamples. These are based on firm char-
acteristics, such as payout policy, firm size, and debt ratings (bond and commercial paper ratings).
   For each constraint partition scheme, we find that asset tangibility promotes investment through
a credit multiplier effect for constrained firms, but not for unconstrained firms. As discussed above,
because of the role of asset tangibility in simultaneously boosting financing and investment, our
theory implies that the credit multiplier will be finely identified in the cross-section by interacting
asset tangibility with Q. Consistent with this prediction, our tests show that estimates for this
interaction term reliably explain investment across financially constrained firms. Moreover, we find
that this interaction effect is even more pronounced in a more refined set of tests in which we split
constrained firms into subsamples with low and high incremental (or “spare”) debt capacity. In par-
ticular, in line with our theory, we find that constrained firms with largely untapped debt capacity


                                                  2
display the strongest relation between investment and asset tangibility interacted with Q. Notably,
none of the effects just described are found in the cross-section of financially unconstrained firms.
      We perform an exhaustive round of checks to verify that our results also obtain under alter-
native test specifications and methods. We show, for example, that our results do not rely on a
priori assignments of firms into financing constraint categories, such as those based on observables
like firm size and debt ratings. In particular, we also estimate switching regressions in which the
probability that firms face constrained access to credit is jointly estimated with the structural in-
vestment equations — i.e., constraint assignments are endogenous to investment. Our results also
obtain when we use maximum likelihood estimations (switching regressions), GMM estimations, and
error-consistent estimations in which Q is replaced with Cummins et al.’s (2006) RealQ. Under each
of these alternative tests, the impact of asset tangibility on constrained firms’ financing–investment
interactions remains economically and statistically significant.
      To further characterize our proposed mechanism, we also look at the effect of asset tangibility
on financing decisions. Surprisingly, there is only limited empirical work on the link between tan-
gibility and capital structure. Existing studies largely document a positive correlation between the
ratio of fixed-to-total assets and financial leverage.2 The evidence in the literature is consistent
with the idea that asset tangibility matters for raising external financing. However, existing papers
do not investigate the role of asset tangibility in underlying a channel between financial contracting
and real-side investment. Our tests show that asset tangibility magnifies the effect of shocks to
investment opportunities onto debt issuance when firms are financially constrained, but not when
they are unconstrained. In other words, the tangibility-led amplification effect that is found for
investment spending is also observed for debt policies when firms face financing frictions. The
evidence we report for leverage decisions agrees with the predictions of our credit multiplier theory.
      The papers closest to ours are Almeida and Campello (2007) and Hennessy et al. (2007).
Almeida and Campello find that cash flow has a larger impact on investment when assets are
more tangible. In contrast to their empirical paper, we develop a model of the role played by asset
tangibility in underlying an endogenous link between financing and investment in the presence of
financing imperfections. Moreover, our analysis shows how debt policies (e.g., debt issuance) are
affected by asset tangibility, while their study provides no characterization of firm financial policies.
Hennessy et al. analyze Q theory with financing frictions for firms using risk-free debt and costly ex-
ternal equity. In contrast, our model encompasses mixtures of risky debt and costly external equity.
Their study is silent on the credit multiplier and its implications, which is the focus of our analysis.
      The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 studies a dynamic model of financing
and investment. Section 3 discusses data and empirical methodology. Section 4 tests our theory’s
main predictions. Section 5 concludes.

    One exception is a recent paper by Campello and Giambona (2011), who show that the redeployability of
tangible assets has a causal impact on corporate leverage.

2        Theory
2.1        Setup

Time is continuous and the horizon is infinite. Consider a firm that has a growth option but no
assets-in-place and no outstanding debt.3 At any point in time t ≥ 0, the firm may exercise its
option by paying a fixed cost K in exchange for receiving uncertain cash flows. This exercise cost
of the growth option can be financed by debt, equity, or a mixture of debt and equity. Potential
cash flows from option exercise are subject to productivity shocks and evolve over time according
to a geometric Brownian motion, Xt , with drift µ, volatility σ, and initial value X0 > 0. The firm
is risk-neutral and discounts at the risk-free rate r > µ.
        We model the pledgeability of the firm’s assets (i.e., the value of the exercised growth option
V ) by assuming that the transfer of the firm’s physical assets in bankruptcy entails costs that are
proportional to those assets. If the firm’s assets are seized by its creditors, only a fraction, τ V < V ,
of the firm’s physical capital is recovered. τ is a function of the nature of the firm’s assets (e.g.,
assets such as land and machinery are easier to verify and foreclose than patents and trademarks),
as well as industry characteristics, such as capital utilization rates and used capital redeployability.
        The firm can finance the exercise cost with a mix of bank debt, which is renegotiable, and exter-
nal equity. Bank debt promises a contractual payment of b unless the firm is liquidated (i.e., claims
are settled and the proportion of tangible firm value, τ , is transferred to the bank). As we allow for
renegotiation of the debt contract, strategic default optimally occurs when cash flows decline suffi-
ciently.4 At that point, equityholders keep control of the firm and make take-it or leave-it offers to
the bank, which results in strategic instead of contractual debt payments until cash flows rise again.
        Finally, external equity funding of the capital expenditure, K, is costly if the firm faces financial
frictions; i.e., the firm cannot find fairly-priced funding for its profitable investment opportunity.5
In particular, each equity-financed $1 of the capital expenditure leads to an exercise cost of $(1 + ι)
for the constrained firm, where ι > 0 represents the linear component of equity issuance costs, while
each equity-financed $1 for the unconstrained firm leads to an exercise cost equal to $1.6
    3
     This allows us to abstract from the debt overhang problem analyzed in an extensive literature (see, e.g., Chen
and Manso (2010), Hackbarth and Mauer (2011), and the references therein).

     See, for example, Mella-Barral and Perraudin (1997), Fan and Sundaresan (2000), and Hackbarth et al. (2007),
where liquidation is also inefficient but, in equilibrium, bilateral bargaining eliminates liquidation.

     See Bernanke et al. (2000) for models on how financing frictions influence macroeconomic dynamics.
   6
     For simplicity and tractability, floatation costs are normalized to zero for the unconstrained firm in that we can
regard financing frictions as a relative statement about issuance costs of constrained and unconstrained firms. The
numerical simulations we carry out below do not require algebraic tractability. So we will add quadratic issuance
costs for constrained firms as suggested by Atinkilic and Hansen (2000) as well as much smaller, linear floatation
costs for unconstrained firms to reinforce the robustness of our model’s main prediction.

2.2      Solution

We work recursively by first solving for firm value after investment, V . We then determine bank
debt value after investment, B. A prerequisite for this bank debt valuation is the characterization
of the optimal strategic debt service when the firm has the ability to make take-it or leave-it offers
to the bank. We value the constrained firm and the unconstrained firm at time zero, which allows
us to derive their value-maximizing investment strategies.
       The firm’s value after investment is given by:

                                               V (X) = U X ,                                                 (1)

where X denotes the current cash flow and U ≡ 1/(r − µ) denotes the growth-adjusted, risk-neutral
discount factor. Consequently, the value of the firm in case of bankruptcy (i.e., liquidation) equals:

                                             L(X) = τ V (X) .                                                (2)

       In case of renegotiation, equityholders make take-it or leave-it offers to the bank. Since the
bank can reject an offer, the bank’s payoff in case of bankruptcy, L, represents its outside option
in the bargaining game with the firm. Outside of renegotiation, the bank can claim at the most
the present value of the contractual payments. Thus, the bank’s reservation value function is
                                                           
                                                   b
                                     R(X) = min      , L(X)                                   (3)

given that it would reject any debt service offer yielding a lower payoff than R.
       On the one hand, strategic debt payments, s, must be sufficient to induce acceptance by the
bank; i.e., B(X) ≥ R(X). On the other hand, there must exist an incentive for the firm to make
strategic rather than contractual debt payments; i.e., s < b. The latter observation implies an
interval, [X, ∞), such that no renegotiation occurs above an endogenously determined renegotia-
tion threshold, X. Since equity’s dividends are decreasing in the strategic debt service, the former
observation implies that B(X) = R(X) over the interval (0, X) where renegotiation occurs.7
       In the renegotiation region, the bank’s claim B pays s and offers capital gains E[dB(X)] over
each time interval dt. The required rate of return for holding this claim is the risk-free rate r.
Therefore, the Bellman equation for all X ∈ (0, X) is:

                                     r B(X) dt = E [dB(X)] + s dt ,                                          (4)

where E[·] is the expectation operator. Applying Ito’s lemma to the right-hand side of this equation,
it follows that the bank debt value satisfies for all X ∈ (0, X) the ordinary differential equation:

                                  r B = µ X BX +        1
                                                        2   σ 2 X 2 BXX + s ,                                (5)
   7
    We confine attention to strategic debt service functions that are piecewise right-continuous in X (see, e.g.,
Mella-Barral and Perraudin (1997) or Hackbarth et al. (2007) for more details).


                                                       5
where subscripts denote partial derivatives. Substituting R and its derivatives for B implies that,
in the renegotiation region, strategic debt service is linear in X, taking the form: s(X) = τ X.
   Similar arguments imply that the bank debt value satisfies for all X ∈ [X, ∞):

                                r B = µ X BX +      1
                                                    2      σ 2 X 2 BXX + b .                           (6)
                                                            b
The solution of Eq. (6) is B(X) = A1 X β + A2 X ν +         r   where β > 1 and ν < 0 are the positive and
                                                       1
negative roots of the quadratic equation: Q(ξ) ≡       2   ξ (ξ − 1) σ 2 + ξ µ − r = 0. The constants A1
and A2 are determined by the value-matching conditions B (X) = L (X) and limX→∞ B (X) = rb .
These conditions yield the following bank debt value function:
                              
                               τ V (X)

                                                    ν
                   B(X) =                                                                              (7)
                                     

                               −
                                        − τ V (X)           if X ∈ [X, ∞) .
                                 r     r              X
   To determine the optimal renegotiations strategy, consider starting at an arbitrarily high value
of X where the payment of b is made. In choosing the renegotiation threshold, X, equityholders find
the highest cash flow level such that an offer s(X) is accepted by the bank in the left neighborhood
of X. This reduces the optimal renegotiation strategy to a smooth-pasting condition:

                                          lim BX = lim BX                                              (8)
                                         X↑X               X↓X

Solving Eq. (8) yields equity’s strategic switch point for entering into renegotiations with the bank:
                                                          
                                            r−µ         ν       b
                                   X =                              .                              (9)
                                              r      ν−1       τ
   Finally, the value of equity equals, in each of the two regions, the firm’s value less the value of
bank debt. This firm value identity implies the following equity value function after investment:

   We next solve the unconstrained firm’s investment problem. This is not only a useful bench-
mark, but also an ingredient of the constrained firm’s investment problem. Working backwards,
the value of the unconstrained firm prior to investment, F u , equals the expected present value of
equity value at the time of investment, T u , minus the capital expenditure net of bank debt value
issued at time T u . Thus, the firm invests to maximize the value of its option:
                                          u
                      F u (X) = sup E e−rT S(XT u ) − (K − B(XT u )) .
                                                                   
                                                                                                      (11)
                                   Tu

Because the firm does not produce any cash flows before investment, owners only receive capital
gains of E [dF u (X)] over each time interval dt. The required rate of return for investing in the uncon-
strained firm is the risk-free rate r. Therefore, the Bellman equation in the continuation region is:

                                     r F u (X) dt = E [dF u (X)] .                                    (12)

                                                   6
Applying Ito’s lemma to the right-hand side of Eq. (12) implies that the value of the unconstrained
firm prior to investment satisfies the ordinary differential equation:

                                  r F u = µ X FXu +        1
                                                           2   σ 2 X 2 FXX
                                                                        u
                                                                           .                               (13)

Eq. (13) has the general solution F u (X) = A1 X β +A2 X ν , which is subject to three boundary condi-
tions. First, the value of the unconstrained firm upon investing is equal to the payoff from investing:

                                 F u (X̂ u ) = S(X̂ u ) − (K − B(X̂ u )) ,                                 (14)

where X̂ u denotes the unconstrained firm’s investment threshold. In the absence of frictions, Eqs.
(7) and (10) imply that the unconstrained firm’s value-matching condition in Eq. (14) simplifies to:

                                       F u (X̂ u ) = V (X̂ u ) − K .                                       (15)

Second, as cash flows tend to zero, the option to invest becomes worthless so that it satisfies:
limX→0 F u (X) = 0. Third, to ensure that investment occurs along the optimal path, the uncon-
strained firm’s optimal investment threshold, X̂ u , is the one that maximizes the unconstrained firm’
option value to invest. Solving the unconstrained firm’s problem yields the following proposition.

Proposition 1 The unconstrained firm’s value-maximizing investment strategy is:
                                                      
                                                   β
                               X̂ u = K (r − µ)           ,                                                (16)
                                                  β−1
                                                                               1
where β > 1 is the positive root of the quadratic equation: Q(ξ) ≡             2   ξ (ξ − 1) σ 2 + ξ µ − r = 0.
For all X ≤ X̂ u , the unconstrained firm’s value is given by:
                                                         1−β                β
                             u            1−β        1                 X
                           F (X) = K                                                .                      (17)
                                                    β−1            β (r − µ)

The results in Eqs. (16) and (17) reveal that asset tangibility is irrelevant for the unconstrained firm.

   Perhaps surprisingly, the unconstrained firm’s solution is invariant to asset tangibility even
though it also utilizes a mixture of renegotiable bank debt and equity to finance investment. Propo-
sition 1 characterizes some basic and realistic features of financing–investment dynamics of the un-
constrained firm. In the absence of financing frictions, the features of the benchmark case are also
typical for models with all-equity financing of the exercise cost (see Dixit and Pindyck (1994)). For
example, because the exercise payoff increases with the growth rate of cash flows, µ, and decreases
with the exercise cost, K, the value-maximizing investment threshold of the unconstrained firm,
X̂ u , declines with µ and rises with K. During a given time interval [0, T ], the dynamic model
implies that the investment hazard (i.e., the likelihood of reaching an investment point, at which



                                                     7
the option to invest is optimally exercised) rises with µ and declines with K.8 Similarly, a greater
volatility for the changes in X produces more uncertainty over the value of the exercise payoff and
                                                                             β
hence an increased incentive to wait since the hysteresis term,             β−1 ,   is an increasing function of σ.
       Similar arguments apply to the derivation for the constrained firm. That is, the value of the
constrained firm prior to investment satisfies the following ordinary differential equation:

                                      r F c = µ X FXc +       1
                                                              2   σ 2 X 2 FXX
                                                                           c
                                                                              ,                                  (18)

which is again solved subject to suitable boundary conditions. First, the value of the constrained
firm upon investing equals the payoff from investing net of equity issuance costs if applicable:

                      F c (X̂ c ) = S(X̂ c ) − (K − B(X̂ c )) − ι (K − B(X̂ c )) 1K>B(X̂ c ) ,                   (19)

where X̂ c denotes the constrained firm’s investment threshold and 1ω represents the indicator
function of the event ω. Since bank debt is renegotiable and, in equilibrium, bilateral bargaining
eliminates liquidation, the firm utilizes the largest available value of B(X̂ u ) in Eq. (19) to econ-
omize on external equity issuance costs. Notice that, even though ∂B(X)/∂b ≥ 0, there exists a
bank debt capacity for an arbitrary cash flow level, X, in the following sense:

                          ∃ bmax s.t. X(bmax ) = X ⇒ B(X) = B(X) = R(X) .                                        (20)

Intuitively, there is a critical bank coupon capacity, bmax (X), beyond which raising promised pay-
ments to the bank cannot raise bank debt value. Thus, the optimal bank debt coupon is given by:
                                                       
                               max           r      ν−1
                              b (X) =                       τX .                           (21)
                                           r−µ        ν

Importantly, this bank debt capacity is an increasing function of asset tangibility, which plays
an important role for the constrained firm. Substituting Eq. (21) into Eq. (7) and evaluating at
X = X̂ u yields an endogenous “quantity constraint” in the spirit of Hart and Moore (1994) in that
B(X̂ c ) |                 = R(X̂ c ) for optimal bank debt financing at the endogenously selected time
          b = bmax (X̂ c )
of investment. Second, as cash flows tend to zero, the option to invest becomes worthless so that
it satisfies: limX→0 F c (X) = 0. Third, to ensure that investment occurs along the optimal path,
the constrained firm’s optimal investment threshold, X̂ c , is the one that maximizes the constrained
firm’ option value to invest. Solving the constrained firm’s problem yields the following proposition.

    Proof. The general solution to Eq. (18) along with the two value-matching conditions for
X → 0 and X → X̂ c imply that the constrained firm’s investment problem solves:
                      h                                                 i  X β

          Xc                                                                X̂ c
which has three distinct investment policies, since the indicator function can be zero in two different
regions (i.e., with or without optimally timed exercise) or one in a third region. To see this, sup-
pose that there exists a critical level τ , above which equity issuance costs are not incurred, and the
indicator function is equal to zero. Then Eq. (26) simplifies to Eq. (17) for τ ∈ [τ , 1) and hence the
constrained firm’s investment threshold coincides with the unconstrained firm’s investment thresh-
old, X̂ u , in Eq. (16). Next, suppose that there also is a critical level τ , below which equity issuance
costs are incurred, and the indicator function is equal to one. For τ ∈ [0, τ ), Eq. (26) becomes:
                                    h                              i  X β

                      max F (X) = S(X̂ ) − (1 + ι) (K − B(X̂ ))                 .                (27)

The smooth-pasting condition FXc (X̂ c ) = 0 yields the constrained firm’s investment threshold, X̂ c ,
in Eq. (22) if τ ∈ [0, τ ).

     Since the additional term in X̂ c compared to X̂ u ,      , is always greater than one, we have
                                                        1 + ιτ
X̂ u < X̂ c at τ = τ . Accordingly, we also have F c (X) < F u (X) at τ = τ . Thus, the constrained
firm’s value function, which is based on incurring equity issuance costs and timing the option
optimally, and the unconstrained firm’s value function, imply a jump at the point where tangibility
is sufficiently high such that a switch from the constrained to the unconstrained investment policy
is optimal. Note that, at this switch point τ , we have that B(X̂ u ) ≥ K and hence in the left
neighborhood of τ we also have that B(X̂ u + ) ≥ K since B 0 (X) > 0 and hence there is an
intermediate region of not timing exercise optimally to avoid equity issuance costs. Then the
constrained firm optimally invests at the bank-funding threshold, which solves B(X̂ c ) − K = 0,
because this dominates the expected present value from investing at the optimally timed thresholds
with equity issuance costs. This is so, as long as for τ ∈ [τ , τ ) the following holds:

Letting the first inequality hold with equality yields Eq. (24) and the letting the second inequality
hold with equality yields Eq. (23). Depending on asset tangibility which implies feasibility, the
constrained firm can pick from three increasingly valuable investment policies: optimally timed
investment without equity issuance costs, bank-funded investment without equity issuance costs
and without optimal timing, and optimally timed investment with equity issuance costs.
     Proposition 2 describes the financing–investment dynamics of the constrained firm, which em-
ploys — like the unconstrained firm — a mixture of debt and equity to finance the growth option.
The proposition highlights several interesting features of corporate financing and investment in the
presence of financing imperfections. First, a comparison between Propositions 1 and 2 indicates
that asset tangibility is irrelevant for the solution of the unconstrained firm’s optimization prob-
lem. However, Proposition 2 reveals that the interaction between asset tangibility and contracting
frictions plays a critical role in the solution of the constrained firm’s optimization problem.
     Second, the first case in Eq. (22) formalizes the intuition that asset tangibility can relax financ-
ing constraints in the “high” tangibility region. For a sufficiently high level of asset tangibility given
by the solution to Eq. (23), which equates the expected present value from the bank-funding rule
that avoids equity issuance costs at the expense of optimal timing with the one from investing with-
out equity issuance costs and with optimal timing, the constrained firm’s problem coincides with
the unconstrained firm’s problem and hence contracting frictions are irrelevant in this limiting case.
Intuitively, the constrained firm’s bank debt coupon capacity in Eq. (21) rises with asset tangibility
and hence bank debt can assume a sufficiently high value relative to the exercise cost such that

                                                                  10
B(X̂ c ) ≥ K for an optimally timed exercise threshold. As a result of this larger debt capacity, the
constrained firm can avoid issuing costly external equity when optimally timing option exercise and
behaves like the unconstrained firm. In other words, if and only if asset tangibility is sufficiently
high, then the constrained firm still implements the unconstrained firm’s investment policy.
    Third, Proposition 2 reveals the existence of another critical level of asset tangibility, one that
solves Eq. (24). The reason for this “intermediate” region described by Eqs. (22) and (25) is
that in the interval [τ , τ ) the expected present value from investing at the non-optimally timed
bank-funding threshold, which solves B(X̂ c ) − K = 0, dominates the expected present value from
investing at the optimally timed threshold with equity issuance costs.9 At the critical level τ (or
τ ) the optimally timed value with (or without) costly external equity financing equals the non-
optimally timed value from investing at the bank-funding threshold. Importantly, the constrained
firm’s value-maximizing investment threshold declines with τ in the interval [τ , τ ). In other words,
the constrained firm’s investment problem is relaxed by asset tangibility in this region.
    Finally, according to the last case in Eq. (22), the constrained firm with sufficiently low levels of
asset tangibility can only exercise its option optimally by issuing a mixture of bank debt and costly
external equity. For this “low tangibility” region where the firm incurs equity issuance costs, com-
parison of Eq. (22) to Eq. (16) implies that the ratio ρ ≡ X̂ c /X̂ u = (1+ι) / (1+ι τ ) is strictly greater
than one for non-zero equity issuance costs, increasing with equity issuance costs, and decreasing
with asset tangibility. This ratio shows how tangibility also relaxes the firm’s financial constraint in
the “low tangibility” region where the firm incurs equity issuance costs: ∂ρ / ∂τ = − ι (1 + ι) / (1 +
ι τ )2 < 0 . Moreover, the firm’s strategic behavior in the renegotiation region, (0, X), leads to an
endogenous “quantity constraint” that is based on its asset tangibility, τ , which, in turn, interacts
with issuance costs, ι. Importantly for our analysis, notice that the wedge between constrained and
unconstrained investment thresholds rises with financing frictions: ∂ρ / ∂ι = (1 − τ ) / (1 + ι τ )2 > 0 .
Taken together, the cross-partial derivative of this wedge in the “low tangibility” region is:

                              ∂ 2 ρ / ∂τ ∂ι = − (1 + ι (2 − τ )) / (1 + ι τ )3 < 0 ,                               (28)

which means that the positive role of asset tangibility for investment is stronger for more constrained
firms (i.e., firms with larger financing constraints benefit relatively more from asset tangibility).
    In all, Proposition 2 formally characterizes how the interplay of asset tangibility, renegotiable
bank debt, costly external equity, and investment gives rise to the firm-level credit multiplier.
   9
     Intuitively, constrained firms with intermediate tangibility are willing to delay investment a bit beyond the
unconstrained threshold in order to avoid equity flotation costs. These firms invest at just the bank-funding point
where the bank would be willing to fund the entire investment. For constrained firms with sufficiently low tangibility,
the opportunity cost (in terms of forgone dividends) of delaying investment until the bank is willing to fund the entire
capital expenditure is simply too high and hence these firms act as if equity will be the marginal source of financing.

2.3   Economic Characterization

To see the credit multiplier at work, consider a positive innovation to investment opportunities. In
particular, consider a shock to product demand (say, higher cash flows X) that implies a higher in-
vestment option value. The firm’s demand for investment increases with higher potential cash flows
from investment. As the firm invests, its capital base increases. If the firm’s assets are intangible,
an increase in the firm’s asset base does not boost recovery values, which are lenders’ “enforceable”
outside option in case of contract renegotiations. Investment in tangible assets, in contrast, pro-
vides higher recovery values and hence a better protection from ex post hold-up problems (strategic
default). Differently put, higher collateral values improve creditors’ position in renegotiations, en-
larging ex ante debt capacity. Access to more (or cheaper) bank credit, in turn, allows for further
investment avoiding the need to tap into costly external equity. An important point brought up by
the model is that this financing–investment mechanism dynamically propagates itself across time
(albeit at a diminishing rate, dictated by the level of asset tangibility).
   More generally, the firm-level credit multiplier effect says that greater credit capacity triggers
faster investment responses to positive innovations to investment opportunities. The implication is
that following a series of positive shocks to investment opportunities, constrained firms with more
tangible assets will invest, on average, more often; and in a present value sense, they will invest
larger amounts than otherwise identical firms with less tangible assets.
   We further characterize the firm-level credit multiplier in Figure 1 below. The figure shows
the effect of asset tangibility, τ , on value-maximizing investment, where the dashed lines chart
the unconstrained firm’s exercise threshold, X̂ u , and the solid lines chart the constrained firm’s
exercise thresholds, X̂ c . It is assumed that the initial cash flow is X = $1, the risk-free interest
rate is r = 6%, the growth rate of potential cash flows is µ = 0.5%, the volatility of potential cash
flows is σ = 30%, and the investment cost is K = $10. The constrained firm in the left panel faces
linear equity issuance costs of 12% whereas the more constrained firm in the right panel faces linear
equity issuance costs of 12% and quadratic equity issuance costs of 1%.
   Notice that the slope of the more constrained firm’s exercise threshold is steeper, suggesting
that the effect of asset tangibility on financing–investment dynamics is stronger for the firm that
faces larger financing frictions. Simply put, as emphasized in the model solution, asset tangibility
matters relatively more for more constrained firms. Notice also that in the right panel, where the
unconstrained firm faces mild financing frictions, the unconstrained investment threshold, X̂ u , is
not completely independent of asset tangibility. Yet the unconstrained firm’s response to changes
in asset tangibility is much less pronounced than that of the constrained firm.
   The central implication of the firm-level credit multiplier described in our model is that asset
tangibility amplifies the impact of productivity shocks by reducing frictions faced by financially
constrained firm. This is akin to a propagation mechanism that translates positive shocks to un-
observed investment opportunities more directly into observed financing and investment when the

Figure 1. Asset Tangibility, Financing Constraints, and Investment
The figure shows the effect of asset tangibility, τ , on constrained and unconstrained investment. The dashed lines chart
the unconstrained firm’s exercise threshold, X̂ u , and the solid lines plot the constrained firm’s exercise thresholds,
X̂ c . It is assumed that the initial cash flow is X = $1, the risk-free interest rate is r = 6%, the growth rate of potential
cash flows is µ = 0.5%, the volatility of potential cash flows is σ = 30%, and the investment cost is K = $10. In
the left panel, the unconstrained firm faces no equity issuance costs, while the constrained firm faces linear equity
issuance costs of 12%. In the right panel, the unconstrained firm faces moderate equity issuance costs of 2%, whereas
the constrained firm faces linear equity issuance costs of 12% and quadratic equity issuance costs of 1%.


firm faces financing frictions. These novel financing–investment interactions are dynamic in nature
and create an endogenous relationship between financing and investment decisions under financing
imperfections. Our analysis is in sharp contrast to those in which investment is exogenous to the
firm’s financial status and financing decisions.

2.4     Simulation

In addition to obtaining closed-form solutions for the constrained and the unconstrained firm values
and investment strategies, our model also allows us to simulate financing–investment interactions,
hence establish a closer connection between theory and empirics. Notably, we can verify our model’s
main empirical implication by estimating the base regression specification and the interactive (credit
multiplier) specification using model-implied, simulated panel data sets.
    To verify that our theoretical analysis implies a strong interaction effect between asset tangibility
and Q in investment regressions (as later identified by our empirical analysis), we use simulation to
generate artificial data from the model. These simulations take the solutions to the optimization
problems in Propositions 1 and 2 as given and do not involve any additional optimizations. To
begin, each firm i is characterized by the vector of model parameters (T angiblity, K, r, X, µ, σ),
which may be firm- or industry-specific. Since our focus is on the positive role of asset tangibility for


                                                             13
constrained firms, we only need firm-level heterogeneity along this dimension. That is, T angibility
is specified by the set τ ∈ {0.025, 0.05, ..., 0.725, 0.75} scaled by K, which provides 30 different
“tangibility” cases when using a step size of 0.025. The investment expenditure is normalized to
K = $10. The risk-free rate is assumed to equal r = 6%. The initial cash flow level is X0 = $1,
the growth rate of cash flows is µ = 0.5%, and the volatility of cash flows is σ = 30%. Finally, the
firm-specific cash flow process is discretized using the following approximation for t ≥ ∆t:
                                                                           √
                               Xt = Xt−∆t exp{(µ − 12 σ 2 ) ∆t + σ              ∆t t } ,                       (29)

where ∆t is is one quarter and t is a standard normal random variable.
       To present a realistic and rich treatment of financial constraints, we consider two alternative
cases. In the first case, which corresponds to the modeling assumptions for Propositions 1 and 2,
the unconstrained firm faces no equity issuance costs (i.e., ι = 0%), while in the second case the
unconstrained firm faces also a mild level of floatation costs (i.e., ι = 2%). Consistent with the
theoretical analysis, the constrained firm faces only a linear issuance costs of ι = 12% in the first
case. In the second case, we enrich the model simulations by letting the constrained firm face an
additional quadratic floatation cost of 1%.
       We want to translate the simulated Xt -paths of each firm into a time series of Q values (recall,
that Q is the ratio of the firm’s market value divided by its investment cost). Proposition 1 implies
in case of the unconstrained firm the following Qu (Xt )-paths for Xt ≤ X̂ u :
                                                          1−β           β
                                F u (Xt )

which is, as suggested by economic intuition, increasing in Xt since β > 1 (i.e., ∂Qu / ∂Xt > 0),
but invariant to asset tangibility (i.e., ∂Qu / ∂τ = 0). Similarly, the theory provides analytical
insights into the effect of asset tangibility on Q for constrained firms. Using the last expression
from (25) in the “low tangibility” region, scaling by K, and simplifying yields for Xt ≤ X̂ c :
                                                     1−β                      β

which is also increasing in Xt (i.e., ∂Qc / ∂Xt > 0).10 In addition, growth options of constrained
firms with more tangible assets are, all else equal, more valuable and hence ∂Qc / ∂τ > 0. Taken
together, the firm-level credit multiplier can be re-expressed for Q: ∂ 2 Qc / ∂τ ∂Xt > 0. Accord-
ingly, the interaction term of Q and τ , Q × τ , captures the increasingly high investment propensity
associated with both high cash flow levels and high tangibility levels. Note that Q alone can be high
because of a rising Xt -path even when τ is low, which would not imply, on average, a higher invest-
ment hazard of constrained firms. Therefore, the interaction term should measure the additional,
  10
    For brevity, the value of Qc (Xt ) in the “intermediate tangibility” region is suppressed and the corresponding
value in the “high tangibility” region is given in Eq. (30). Naturally, all three regions are used in the simulation.


                                                         14
incremental effect on investment of constrained firms when both Xt and τ are high. According to
our theory, the coefficient estimate of Q×τ should, however, be insignificant for unconstrained firms.
   To minimize the influence of any particular simulation experiment, we generate in total 200
panel data sets, which are populated by 600 firms (i.e., 20 firms for each of the 30 “tangibility”
cases). In each panel, we follow these firms for 70 years at a quarterly frequency. As we drop the first
35 years from each panel to minimize the influence of the initial conditions and we transform the
quarterly data into annual (year-end) data, we end up with 21,000 firm-year observations per panel.
   Panel A of Table 1 reports average coefficient estimates of regression results for the 200 simulated
data sets with 600 firms over 35 years using the base regression specification, in which investment
is modeled as a linear function of only Q and T angibility (omitting at first the Q-interactive term
from Eq. (33)). Panel B tabulates estimation results for the credit multiplier regression specification
in Eq. (33). That is, the base investment model includes Q and T angbility as firm characteristics
without the Q-interactive term, while the credit multiplier (interactive) investment model contains
Q, T angibility, and Q × T angibility as independent variables. As dependent variable, we use an
investment hazard, defined as the number of investment points per firm for a given time period
scaled by K. In particular, the investment intensity Investment = I/K is defined as the cumula-
tive counter, I ∈ {0, 1, 2, ...}, of a firm starting from X and reaching an investment point, X̂, the
first time from below divided by the book value of assets, K. At the time of reaching an investment
point, the firm is replaced by a replica of itself starting again at the initial cash flow level with an
identical but unexercised option.
   To begin, for each of the two cases of financial constraints considered in Panel A of Table 1,
we observe that Investment responds very significantly to Q across all estimations and partitions.
As expected from the real options model, Q is particularly strong across financially constrained
firms. Interestingly, Investment only responds reliably to T angiblity for constrained firms in the
model-implied, simulated panel data sets.

   As discussed above, a direct way to gauge the multiplier effect in the actual and simulated data
is to interact Q with T angibility. Panel B tests the main prediction of our model by estimating
Eq. (33) across subsamples of constrained and unconstrained firms in the artificial data. Consistent
with the economic intuition derived from the model, we can generally reject with high statistical
confidence (lower than 1% test-level) the hypothesis that the coefficients on the interaction term
are similar across subsamples of constrained and unconstrained model firms. Moreover, the table
reinforces the existence of an important interactive (multiplier) effect of Q and T angibility across
financially constrained firms. Simply put, the tangibility-led firm-level credit multiplier disappears
in the absence of model-induced financing constraints. However, it plays an increasingly important
role in explaining investment intensities as model-induced financing constraints increase. As will be


                                                  15
made clearer in Section 4, Table 1 implies a notable success in linking the model-implied regression
results for artificial data to the regression results we obtain using COMPUSTAT data.

2.5   Model Extensions

Our model delivers a parsimonious, testable characterization of the firm-level credit multiplier. The
next section builds on the basic implications of our theory to check empirically whether data on
firm financing and investment decisions seem to engender the firm-level credit multiplier effect. Be-
fore conducting those tests, however, we describe a number of interesting extensions of our model.
While we think these extensions are beyond the scope of the current paper, we briefly discuss some
of their implications.
   A natural matter for studying the interface between macroeconomics and corporate finance is
whether financing constraints, in general, and, in particular, equity issuance costs are time-varying,
possibly moving with aggregate conditions. We chose to focus on firm-specific financing constraints,
which are likely time-invariant, but it is natural to speculate that those constraints might bind more
with monetary policy tightenings or aggregate demand contractions. As it turns out, adding this
extra state variable would not materially change the key mechanism described by our analysis. On
the other hand, the dynamics of investment and financing interactions might change depending
on how one models business cycles. In line with our theory, asset tangibility should matter even
more during economy-wide contractions; however, its net impact on observed investment spending
will depend on how investment demand might behave across the business cycle. A straightforward
way to assess the net effect of macroeconomic contractions on our empirical results is to contrast
the sensitivity of investment spending to asset tangibility across booms and recessions, and across
monetary easings and tightenings.
   Another interesting extension is to allow asset tangibility, τ , to vary with time, responding pos-
itively to favorable innovations to industry prices and demand conditions. While endogenizing τ
would add complexity to our framework, our conclusions would not be materially affected. Indeed,
doing so would generally strengthen our model’s results. To see this, note that in a setting where a
firm’s assets are valued as a function of industry demand, one has that positive shocks to product
prices will make investment both more desirable (occurring earlier in our framework) and easier
to finance (due to higher bank debt capacity). As for a test of this idea, we note that while not
explicitly considered in our empirical analysis, one of our measures of asset tangibility (based on
the Bureau of Census data) varies over time according to industry conditions of demand for capital.
   Finally, one would find it interesting to allow the unconstrained firm to raise additional debt
capital from a continuum of lenders in public debt markets, with endogenous default and associated
endogenous deadweight losses capitalized into debt prices. In addition to the constrained firm’s
endogenous “quantity constraint” based on asset tangibility, this extension would produce an en-
dogenous “pricing constraint” for the unconstrained firm, which is also based on asset tangibility.


                                                 16
Since this additional type of debt introduces the risk of inefficient liquidation, it will not be optimal
to use it within the confines of our theory’s setup unless we add other frictions, such as corporate
taxes. Under this scenario, investment would have an additional (capital structure) advantage of
gaining access to net tax benefits of public debt, which rises with asset tangibility.11 Notably, an
optimal capital structure theory with multiple classes of debt is beyond the scope of this paper,
which focuses on the characterization of the firm-level credit multiplier in its most parsimonious
and simplest form. The basic setup we use does not need multiple classes of debt for the multi-
plier effect to emerge; all that is strictly necessary for the multiplier follows from asset tangibility,
renegotiable bank debt, costly external equity, and investment. Along the lines of this argument,
in Section 4.2 below we look empirically at whether constrained firms choose to issue debt in ways
that mimic the impact of the firm-level credit multiplier effect on investment spending.


3         Data and Empirical Test Design
3.1        Data Description

Our sample selection approach follows that of Almeida et al. (2004) and Almeida and Campello
(2007). We consider the universe of U.S. manufacturing firms (SICs 2000–3999) over the 1971–2005
period with data available from COMPUSTAT on total assets, market capitalization, capital expen-
ditures, and plant property and equipment (capital stock). We eliminate firm-years for which the
value of capital stock is less than $1 million, those displaying real asset or sales growth exceeding
100%, and those with negative Q or with Q in excess of 10 (we define Q shortly). The first selection
rule eliminates very small firms from the sample, for which linear investment models are likely inad-
equate (see Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995)). The second data cut-off eliminates those firm-years
registering large jumps in their business fundamentals (size and sales); these are typically indicative
of mergers, reorganizations, and other major corporate events. The third cut-off is introduced as a
first, crude attempt to minimize the impact of problems in the measurement of investment opportu-
nities, and to improve the fitness of our investment demand model. Among many others, Abel and
Eberly (2002) and Cummins et al. (2006) use similar cut-offs and discuss the poor empirical fit of
linear investment equations at high levels of Q. We deflate all series to 1971 dollars using the CPI.
         Our basic sample consists of an unbalanced panel with 65,508 firm-year observations with 6,316
unique firms. Table 2 describes the computation and reports summary statistics for the variables
used in our main tests. Since our sampling and variable construction methods follow that of the
literature, it is not surprising that the numbers we report in Table 2 resemble those found in re-
lated studies (e.g., Almeida and Campello (2007)). In the interest of brevity, we omit a detailed
    11
    If the unconstrained firm can, in addition to external equity and renegotiable bank debt, issue non-renegotiable
bond market debt as, e.g., in Proposition 1 in Hackbarth et al. (2007), then this would also lead to a weak dependence
of the unconstrained firm’s investment threshold on asset tangibility in this more general setting.

3.2   Empirical Specification

The central result of our theory is that of a feedback effect between investment and financing in the
presence of credit constraints: tangible assets ease financing, which amplifies the response of firm
investment spending to shifts in firm investment opportunities. We develop two empirical models
to test our credit multiplier idea, one concerns investment, the other concerns financing decisions.
   First, we specify a multiplicative-type model relating investment spending (I) to investment
opportunities (Q) and asset tangibility (τ ). In particular, we consider:

                             it = α1 Qt−1 + α2 τt−1 + α3 (Qt−1 × τt−1 ) ,                         (32)

where it = It /Kt−1 denotes capital-normalized investment over time t. Our credit multiplier theory
predicts that the interaction term Q × τ has a positive coefficient in an investment equation like Eq.
(32) when the firm faces financing constraints; in short, the firm invests relatively more in response
to positive investment opportunities when its assets allow for more credit capacity. No such effects
should be observed in a cross-section of financially unconstrained firms.
   To operationalize our test, we experiment with a parsimonious model of investment demand.
We do so by augmenting the standard Q-theory investment equation with a proxy for asset tan-
gibility and an interaction term that allows the role of Q to vary with asset tangibility. Define
Investment as the ratio of capital expenditures (COMPUSTAT item #128) to beginning-of-period
capital stock (lagged item #8). Q is our basic proxy for investment opportunities, computed as
the market value of assets divided by the book value of assets, or (item #6 + (item #24 × item
#25) − item #60 − item #74) / (item #6). We define Tangibility shortly (see Section 3.3). Our
first empirical model can be written as follows:

           Investmenti,t = α1 Qi,t−1 + α2 T angibilityi,t−1 + α3 (Q × T angibility)i,t−1          (33)
                             X             X
                           +      F irmi +     Y eart + εi,t ,
                                  i             t

where Firm and Year capture firm- and year-specific effects, respectively. All of our estimations
correct the regression error structure for within-firm correlation (firm clustering) and heteroskedas-
ticity using White-Huber’s error-consistent estimator. Reported R2 s account for fixed effects.
   It is worth noting that a large literature includes a firm’s cash flow in investment regressions
such as Eq. (33). Our model does not generate explicit predictions for firm cash flows, but in the
robustness checks that follow we also include cash flows in our model specifications. This allows for
comparisons with previous studies and serves the purpose of checking whether our findings could
be explained by income shocks (see Section 4.1.3).

                                                    18
   Secondly, we study a model of external financing. Define DebtIssuance as the change in the
ratio of short- and long-term debt (item #9 + item #34) to lagged book value of assets (item #6).
We regress this measure of debt taking on Q, Tangibility, and an interaction term that allows the
role of Q to vary with Tangibility. Our second empirical model can be expressed as:

          DebtIssuancei,t = α1 Qi,t−1 + α2 T angibilityi,t−1 + α3 (Q × T angibility)i,t−1           (34)
                              X             X
                            +      F irmi +     Y eart + εi,t .
                                     i            t

   Following the standard literature, we allow the coefficient vector α in Eqs. (33) and (34) to
vary with the degree to which the firm faces financing constraints by way of fitting our models sepa-
rately across samples of constrained and unconstrained firms. In contrast to much of the literature,
we also estimate α using a maximum likelihood methodology in which constraint assignments are
determined jointly with the investment (or debt taking) process (see Section 3.4).
   According to our theory, the extent to which investment opportunities matters for constrained
investment (alternatively, debt taking) should be an increasing function of asset tangibility. While
Eq. (33) (Eq. (34)) is a direct linear measure of the influence of tangibility on investment (debt)
sensitivities, note that its interactive form makes the interpretation of the estimated coefficients less
obvious. For instance, if one wants to assess the partial effect of Q on Investment (DebtIssuance),
one has to read off the result from α1 + α3 × T angibility. Hence, in contrast to other papers in
the literature, the estimate returned for α1 alone says little about the impact of Q on investment
demand (debt taking). That coefficient represents the impact of Q when Tangibility equals zero,
a point that lies outside of the empirical distribution of our measures of asset tangibility. As we
discuss below, the summary statistics of Table 2 will aid in the interpretation of the estimates
returned by our interactive model.

3.3   Proxy for Asset Tangibility

We proxy for asset tangibility (Tangibility) using a firm-level measure of expected asset liquidation
values that borrows from Berger et al. (1996). In determining whether investors rationally value
their firms’ abandonment option, Berger et al. gather data on the proceeds from discontinued op-
erations reported by a sample of manufacturing firms over the 1984–1993 period. The authors find
that a dollar of book value yields, on average, 72 cents in exit value for total receivables, 55 cents
for inventory, and 54 cents for fixed assets. Following their study, we estimate liquidation values
for the firm-years in our sample via the computation:

            T angibility = 0.715 × Receivables + 0.547 × Inventory + 0.535 × Capital,

where Receivables is COMPUSTAT item #2, Inventory is item #3, and Capital is item #8. As in
Berger et al., we add the value of cash holdings (item #1) to this measure and scale the result by
total book assets.

                                                   19
3.4    Financially Constrained and Financially Unconstrained Groupings

Our tests require splitting firms according to measures of financing constraints. There are many
plausible approaches to sorting firms into financially “constrained” and “unconstrained” categories.
Our basic approach follows the standard literature, using ex-ante financial constraint sortings that
are based on firm observables, such as payout policy, firm size, and debt ratings. In particular, we
adopt the sorting schemes discussed in Almeida et al. (2004) and Acharya et al. (2007):

    • Scheme #1: In every year over the 1971–2005 period, we rank firms based on their payout
      ratio and assign to the financially constrained (unconstrained) category those firms in the
      bottom (top) three deciles of the payout distribution. We compute the payout ratio as the
      ratio of total distributions (dividends plus stock repurchases) to assets. The intuition that fi-
      nancially constrained firms have lower payout follows from the argument that their reluctance
      to distribute funds is caused by a wedge between the costs of internal and external financing.

    • Scheme #2: We rank firms based on their total assets throughout the 1971–2005 period and
      assign to the financially constrained (unconstrained) category those firms in the bottom (top)
      three deciles of the asset size distribution. The rankings are again performed on an annual
      basis. The argument for size as a good measure of financing constraints is that small firms
      are typically young and less well known and thus more likely to face capital market frictions.

    • Scheme #3: We retrieve data on firms’ bond ratings and categorize those firms that never
      had their public debt rated during our sample period as financially constrained. Given that
      unconstrained firms may choose not to use debt financing (thus not receiving a debt rating),
      we only assign to the constrained subsample those firm-years that both lack a rating and
      report positive debt (see Faulkender and Petersen (2006)).12 Financially unconstrained firms
      are those whose bonds have been rated during the sample period. The advantage of this
      measure of constraints over the former two is that it gauges the market’s assessment of a
      firm’s credit quality. The same rationale applies to the next measure.

    • Scheme #4: We retrieve data on firms’ commercial paper ratings and categorize as financially
      constrained those firms that never display any ratings during our sample period. Observations
      from those firms are only assigned to the constrained subsample in years in which positive
      debt is reported. Firms that issued rated commercial paper at some point during the sample
      period are considered unconstrained.

    Table 3 reports the number of firm-years under each of the financial constraint categories used in
our analysis. According to the payout scheme, for example, there are 27,658 financially constrained
  12
     Firms with no bond ratings and no debt are not considered constrained, but our results are unaffected by how we
treat these firms. The same approach is used for firms with no commercial paper ratings and no debt in Scheme #4.



                                                        20
firm-years and 19,549 financially unconstrained firm-years. The table also shows the extent to
which the four classification schemes are related. For example, out of the 27,658 firm-years clas-
sified as constrained according to the payout scheme, 12,857 are also constrained according to the
size scheme, while a much smaller fraction, 3,689 firm-years, are classified as unconstrained. The
remaining firm-years represent payout-constrained firms that are neither constrained nor uncon-
strained according to size. In general, there is a positive association among the four measures of
financing constraints. For example, most small (large) firms lack (have) bond ratings. Also, most
small (large) firms make low (high) payouts. However, the table also makes it clear that these
cross-group correlations are far from perfect. This works against our tests finding consistent results
across all classification schemes.

   One potential drawback of the ex-ante sorting approach described above is that it does not allow
the investment process to work as a determinant of the financial constraint status — the constraint
categorization is exogenously given. In turn, we consider an alternative categorization approach
that endogenizes the constraint status together with other variables in a structural model. The ap-
proach, borrowed from Hovakimian and Titman (2006), uses a switching regression framework with
unknown sample separation to estimate investment regressions. One advantage of this estimator
is that we can simultaneously use all of the above sorting information (i.e., dividend policy, size,
bond ratings, and commercial paper ratings) together with asset tangibility to categorize firms. In
turn, we provide a brief summary of this methodology.
   Assume that there are two different investment regimes, which we denote by “regime 1” and
“regime 2.” While the number of investment regimes is given, the points of structural change are
not observable and are estimated together with the investment equations. The model is composed
of the following system of equations (estimated simultaneously):

                                          I1it = Xit α1 + ε1 it                                    (35)

                                          I2it = Xit α2 + ε2 it                                    (36)
                                            ∗
                                           yit = Zit φ + uit .                                     (37)

Eqs. (35) and (36) are the structural equations of the system; they are essentially two versions of
our baseline investment model in Eq. (33). Let Xit be the vector of explanatory variables, and α
be the vector of coefficients that relates the variables in X to investment I1it and I2it . Differential
investment behavior across firms in regime 1 and regime 2 is captured by differences between α1
and α2 . Eq. (37) is the selection equation that establishes the firm’s likelihood of being in regime
1 or regime 2. The vector Zit contains the determinants of a firm’s propensity of being in either

regime. Observed investment is given by:
                                                       ∗
                                        Iit = I1it if yit <0                                        (38)
                                                       ∗
                                        Iit = I2it if yit ≥ 0.
 ∗ is a latent variable that gauges the likelihood that the firm is in the first or in the second regime.
yit
    The parameters α1 , α2 , and φ are estimated via maximum likelihood. To estimate those pa-
rameters, we assume that the error terms ε1 , ε2 , and u are jointly normally distributed. Critically,
the estimator’s covariance matrix allows for nonzero correlation between shocks to investment and
shocks to firms’ characteristics — this makes the model we use an ‘endogenous switching regres-
sion.’ As such, the extent to which investment spending differs across the two regimes and the
likelihood that firms are assigned to either regime are simultaneously determined.
    Finally, to identify the system we need to determine which regime is the constrained one and
which regime is the unconstrained one. The algorithm in Eqs. (35)–(38) creates two groups of
firms that differ according to their investment behavior, but it does not tell the econometrician
which firms are constrained. To achieve identification, we need to use priors about which firm
characteristics that are likely to be associated with financing constraints. We do so using the
same characteristics employed in the ex-ante sortings (payout, size, and ratings). We also include
Tangibility, since as described by our model, asset tangibility can ameliorate financing constraints.


4     Empirical Results
Our tests first consider corporate investment. We subsequently examine cross-sectional patterns in
firm financing (debt capacity and debt issuance).

4.1     Tests on Investment Spending

Our examination of corporate investment considers a standard investment equation and an inter-
active (“multiplier”) model. We then perform robustness checks that help rule out alternative
explanations for our findings.

4.1.1    The Base Investment Model

We build intuition for our study’s empirical tests by way of estimating a simpler version of Eq.
(33). In this version, corporate investment is modeled as a linear function of only Q and Tangibility.
We would expect both of these variables to retain some explanatory power over the cross-sectional
variation of investment. In particular, absent empirical biases, investment spending should respond
to proxies for investment opportunities across all sets of firms (both financially constrained and
unconstrained firms). As for asset tangibility, we would expect it to be a strong determinant of in-
vestment across financially constrained firms, carrying less importance (if any) in the cross-section
of financially unconstrained firms.

                                                   22
   Table 4 reports estimation results for the base regression model across financially constrained
and unconstrained firm partitions. Panel A collects results based on exogenous characterizations of
constraints, while Panel B considers the endogenous regime switching approach. For each of the ten
constrained/unconstrained comparison pairs in Table 4, we observe that Investment responds very
significantly to Q across all estimations and partitions. Interestingly, the coefficient for Q is partic-
ularly strong across financially constrained firms. This is noteworthy because much of the debate
about empirical biases in investment regressions in the last decade revolved around an attenuation
bias that appeared to affect constrained firms’ Q in a pronounced fashion. Like other recent studies
(e.g., Baker et al. (2003) and Campello and Graham (2011)), we find no indication that attenuation
bias in Q disproportionately affects financially constrained firms’ investment regressions.

                                   Insert Table 4 About Here

   Also noteworthy is the response of Investment to Tangibility. Consistent with the basic logic
of our theory, asset tangibility is systematically, positively associated with investment spending
when firms are financially constrained. Indeed, our estimates suggest that this relation is econom-
ically strong. For example, the estimates from the first partition reported in Table 4 (see row 1 in
Panel A) imply that a one-standard deviation increase in Tangibility leads to an increase of 6.7%
(= 0.5605 × 0.1196) in Investment, an increase that is equivalent to 25.6% (= 0.0670/0.2617) of the
average investment rate of our sample. These pronounced effects are not observed across financially
unconstrained firms. For those firms, the coefficients returned for Tangibility are significantly lower
than those returned for constrained firms.

4.1.2   The Credit Multiplier Effect

Our model’s central insight is related to the amplifying effect of asset tangibility on the response
of investment spending to investment opportunities in the presence of financing constraints — the
credit multiplier. As previously discussed, a direct way to gauge the multiplier effect in the data is
to interact Q with Tangibility. We now perform several tests of the main prediction of our model,
estimating Eq. (33) across various subsamples.
   Our main empirical findings are reported in Table 5, which has the same layout of Table 4.
The results presented are remarkably strong: for every single comparison pair, the interaction term
of Q and Tangibility is highly significant and positive for constrained firms, while either negative
or indistinguishable from zero for unconstrained firms. Indeed, one can generally reject with high
statistical confidence (lower than 1% test-level) the hypothesis that the coefficients of interest are
similar across the two constraint types. Noteworthy, the table reveals not only the existence of an
important interactive (multiplier) effect of Tangibility across financially constrained firms, but also
that much of the unconditional impact of Q on Investment for constrained firms (as reported in
Table 4) is transmitted via Tangibility. Simply put, the direct effect of Q on Investment across


                                                   23
constrained firms, though still positive, dwarfs in comparison with the effect that comes via its
interaction with Tangibility.


                                  Insert Table 5 About Here

   To illustrate the economic importance of the estimates in Table 5, consider again the one re-
ported in the first row of Panel A. While Q alone (i.e., uninteracted) has only a small effect on
investment, a one-standard deviation change in Q (= 0.5196), measured at the average level of
Tangibility (= 0.5583), leads to a 6.0% (= 0.0148 + 0.0456) increase in Investment (approximately
23.1% of the average sample rate of investment).
   The evidence uncovered in Table 5 is remarkably consistent with the credit multiplier. They
show that, in the presence of financing frictions, investment spending responds more strongly to
the arrival of new investment opportunities when a firm’s assets provide more valuable collateral.

4.1.3   Robustness of the Multiplier Effect

This section collects a battery of tests designed to verify the robustness of our central findings.
Among other things, we experiment with additional estimation procedures, consider the issue of
mismeasurement in Q, and include firm cash flows in our specifications. To save space, we only
report results based on standard measures of financial constraints.


GMM Estimations         OLS estimations of investment models are believed to suffer from a number
of empirical biases. As such, one could wonder about the robustness of our main results relative to
estimation approaches that ameliorate issues such as endogeneity and heteroskedasticity. To assess
whether our findings are sensitive to the estimation methodology used, we re-estimate the models
of Table 5 via GMM. We do so following Cummins et al. (2006) and use up to three lags of the
variables included in Eq. (33) in our set of instruments. While those included regressors are in level
form, our instruments are in differenced form.
   We find that these standard GMM estimations return coefficients that are both economically
and statistically more significant than those from the OLS model. Importantly, the inferences that
we obtain are similar. Once again, Tangibility significantly strengthens the effect of Q on Invest-
ment for financially constrained firms, but not for unconstrained firms. We omit the tabulation of
these GMM estimations to save space.


Mismeasurement in the Proxy for Investment Opportunities Prior work on investment
estimations has cited concerns with the possibility that the standard proxy for investment oppor-
tunities, Q, could suffer from pronounced mismeasurement (e.g., Cummins et al. (2006)). One
problem with mismeasurement is that it introduces a downward bias in the variable affected by it.
In our application, the possibility that Q is severely mismeasured would lead the OLS estimator to


                                                 24
over-reject the hypothesis that Q is different from zero. As we have shown in our base tests, how-
ever, Q is statistically significant in all of the regressions in which it is not further interacted with
Tangibility. When we interact Q with Tangibility, Q still remains the main driver of investment,
only now via the interaction term.
   It is not easy to determine how an attenuation bias in Q could systematically explain our find-
ings. For instance, the impact of that bias on other estimates would depend on the covariance
between Q and Tangibility. As it turns out, we find that such covariance is insignificant for our
measures of tangibility. Nevertheless, we note that the existing literature proposes remedies for
mismeasurement in Q that are easy to implement. Cummins et al. (2006), for example, contend
that Q is likely to capture the firm’s investment opportunities with error because equity market
values (in the numerator of Q) often deviate from firm fundamentals, thereby misrepresenting the
firm’s marginal product of investment. Those papers propose, instead, a proxy for Q (called RealQ)
that is derived from earnings projections made by financial analysts. The empirical implementa-
tion of RealQ mimics exactly that of standard Q, except that one proxies for the unobserved future
marginal products of capital with an approximation for the future average products based on long-
term earnings forecasts from IBES. Studies using RealQ show that it systematically outperforms
standard Q in empirical investment regressions. A limitation of this approach, however, is that
only a relatively small subset of firms in COMPUSTAT has long-term earnings forecasts reported
in IBES. Additionally, note that IBES only consistently reports earnings forecasts starting in 1989.
These data considerations reduce the sample used in our RealQ tests.
   In Table 6, we re-estimate the models of Table 5 (Panel A) replacing Q with RealQ. We again
find strong support for our theory’s main prediction: Tangibility reliably amplifies the impact of Q
(i.e., RealQ) on Investment for financially constrained firms, but not for unconstrained firms.

                                   Insert Table 6 About Here

   Another potential concern with mismeasurement in Q is whether this could bias upward the
Q × T angibility interaction term. Noting that the literature is silent on the effect of mismeasured
variables in interaction terms, we address this problem by performing a series of Monte Carlo exper-
iments. In Appendix B, we show that coefficient estimates of an interaction term that contains one
(or even two) mismeasured variables are also biased towards zero. In other words, a measurement
problem in Q would make it harder for our tests to find the effect of the credit multiplier via the
Q × T angibility interaction term.


Including Cash Flows in the Benchmark Model                 The original Q theory of investment does
not prescribe a role for cash flows as a driver of investment. Since the work of Fazzari et al. (1988),
however, it has become common practice to include cash flows in empirical investment equations as
a way to gauge the impact of financing constraints on investment decisions. Noteworthy, Fazzari et


                                                   25
al.’s proposed interpretation of investment-cash flow sensitivities has been criticized on theoretical
grounds (e.g., Kaplan and Zingales (1997)) as well as on grounds that empirical biases may plague
estimates of that sensitivity (Gomes (2001) and Cummins et al. (2006)). In addition to these lim-
itations, we note that our theory does not have explicit predictions for the role of cash flows. As
result, we chose to omit cash flows from our benchmark regression model. Nevertheless, it might
be worth it experimenting with the inclusion of firm cash flows in our estimations. Doing so will
allow for comparisons with previous studies and also serve the purpose of checking whether our
findings could be explained by stories based on the response of investment to income shocks.
   In Table 7, we estimate models similar to those of Table 5 (Panel A), but now including lagged
CashF low (COMPUSTAT item #18 plus item #14, scaled by lagged item #8) as an additional
control. Consistent with prior studies, our estimations suggest that constrained firms’ invest-
ment is positively affected by cash flows; however, their investment-cash flow sensitivities are only
marginally statistically significant (at the 10 to 5% test level). The salient feature of this new
round of estimations is that our inferences about the credit multiplier effect remain unchanged. In
particular, the new estimates for the Q × T angibility term closely resemble those of our benchmark
regressions, but with a slight loss in statistical significance.

Further Checks We further examine the robustness of our results by way of changing our proxy
for asset tangibility and by considering time-varying industry effects in our estimations.
   Following Kessides (1990) and Worthington (1995), we also measure asset redeployability using
the ratio of used to total (used plus new) fixed depreciable capital expenditures in an industry. The
idea that the degree of activity in asset resale markets affects financial contractibility is formalized
in Shleifer and Vishny (1992). To construct this measure, starting from 1981, we hand-collect data
for used and new capital acquisitions at the four-digit SIC level from the Bureau of Census’ Annual
Survey of the Manufacturers. Our results reported in Appendix A are qualitatively similar when
we proxy for asset tangibility using this alternative measure.
   We finally examine whether industry dynamics may influence our results by experimenting with
industry–time fixed effects. This approach addresses, for example, potential biases associated with
developments in industry competition that affect investment and might be correlated with the main
elements of our story (Tangibility and Q). Our results (untabulated) show that the introduction of
industry×time interaction effects does not alter our inferences about the credit multiplier effect.

4.2   Tests on Debt Capacity and Debt Taking

Our theory on the multiplier effect of asset tangibility on investment is predicated on the notion
that tangibility enhances external financing capacity; in particular, that it helps support additional
debt financing. While the results thus far are consistent with this hypothesis, we have not examined

                                                   26
the empirical relation between debt financing and investment that underlies the credit multiplier.
We do so in this section. Specifically, expanding our testing approach, we perform a number of
experiments considering the role of incremental (“spare”) debt capacity and debt taking decisions.

4.2.1      Debt Capacity

Our tests suggest that asset tangibility helps constrained firms obtain more credit following pos-
itive innovations to investment opportunities. As a result, they invest more in response to those
innovations. Until now, the tests concerning this idea were performed without explicitly accounting
for firm financing. In other words, we did not consider whether the firm’s ex-ante indebtness would
influence the extent to which firms take advantage of the enhanced debt capacity provided by in-
vestment in tangible assets. For instance, if a firm is already highly indebted prior to the positive
shock to investment, then it should be less able to invest as a function of asset tangibility; that is,
the credit multiplier would be weaker or even fail. In contrast, the credit multiplier is likely to be
more pronounced when innovations affect firms with more spare debt capacity.
      It is difficult to gauge a firm’s ex-ante debt capacity. However, our theory provides for a viable,
albeit potentially incomplete, characterization of incremental debt capacity. Recall, we argue that
the ability to obtain credit is a increasing function of a firm’s asset tangibility. Accordingly, the
correlation between the firm’s leverage and the degree of its asset tangibility could provide infor-
mation about the firm’s spare debt capacity: if a firm carries less (more) leverage on its balance
sheet than other firms with similar asset tangibility, then that firm is likely to have higher (lower)
incremental debt capacity.13
      This insight helps us construct an empirical proxy for spare debt capacity. That proxy is based
on the component of a firm’s long-term debt that is not explained by the firm’s asset tangibility.
This component can be directly gauged from the residuals of a regression of Leverage (or, item #9 ÷
item #6) on Tangibility. While the magnitude of those regression residuals may be of little economic
interest, they are useful in gauging spare debt capacity in that they can be employed to rank firms
into categories. We proceed in this way, ranking firm-years into a “high” (“low”) debt capacity
category if the leverage regression residuals associated with those firm-years fall into the bottom
(top) three deciles of the distribution of the residuals. To check that the results we obtain from this
experiment are economically sensible, we also rank firms into low and high debt capacity according
to their lagged, raw leverage ratios. Both of these rankings are performed on an annual basis.
      Table 8 shows what happens when we condition our interactive models on firms’ spare debt
capacity. Panel A presents results for the debt capacity sorting scheme that is based on leverage
residuals. Panel B is similarly structured, but high and low debt capacity categories are based on
rankings of raw leverage ratios. Only financially constrained firms are used to perform our tests,
since only those firms’ investment is affected by the credit multiplier. The results presented in Pan-
 13
      In the capital structure literature, Campello (2006) uses a related approach.


                                                           27
els A and B of Table 8 are remarkably strong and internally consistent. They show that, among
constrained firms, the credit multiplier reported in previous tables (e.g., Table 5) is strongest across
firms with high debt capacity, and nonexistent across firms with low debt capacity. This is exactly
what one should expect given the dynamics of the credit multiplier implied by our theory.

4.2.2   Debt Taking

We argue that asset tangibility magnifies the impact of investment opportunities on observed in-
vestment spending through a financing channel. This happens because of a feedback effect between
investment and financing in the presence of financing constraints — our theory predicts that the
two processes should move in tandem. We empirically test this logic by turning to firms’ debt
taking behavior. We do so in a regression framework in which debt taking (DebtIssuance) is on
the left-hand side, while on the right-hand side we include the set of drivers we used for tests on
investment. This empirical specification is represented by Eq. (34) above.
   Table 9 reveals several interesting aspects of our debt taking tests. First, as reported by prior
studies, leverage is negatively associated with Q and positively associated with Tangibility. Second,
the estimates for tangibility interacted with Q substantiate the dynamics of our credit multiplier:
(1) constrained firms take on more debt in response to increases in investment opportunities when
their assets are more tangible; (2) unconstrained firms’ investment is unaffected by the credit multi-
plier effect. The results for the debt taking model provides further evidence that Tangibility and Q
jointly influence investment spending via a financing channel in the presence of credit imperfections.

                                   Insert Table 9 About Here

   Before concluding, it is worth noting that the results in Table 9 suggest that firms with very
high asset tangibility (above the 75th percentile of the distribution of Tangibility) observe no direct
relation between Q and DebtIssuance — i.e., the Q-interaction term dominates the Q-intercept
term. Notably, this is similar to the relation between Q and DebtIssuance across financially uncon-
strained firms. At lower levels of Tangibility, however, increases in Q are met with sharp declines
in debt. These findings are at the very heart of the impact of financing constraints on corporate
policies. Our estimates imply that contracting imperfections can lead to a negative association
between investment opportunities and external financing, but that this adverse effect can be at-
tenuated by variables that enhance the contracting environment, such as asset tangibility. This
firm-level effect is similar to the arguments made by Bernanke et al. (1996, 2000) in their pioneer-
ing work on the credit multiplier in the aggregate economy. These authors argue that the impact
of financing imperfections stemming from agency problems and asymmetric information issues are
minimized when firms have enough collateral. In that case, firms borrow from the capital markets
whenever they are hit by positive innovations in investment opportunities. As collateral values

                                                  28
drop, however, financing frictions become more relevant. Firms with good prospects (higher Q)
then shy away from borrowing funds in the credit markets.


5    Concluding Remarks
We model the effect of asset tangibility and financing constraints when financing and investment
are jointly determined. For financially constrained firms, acquiring assets that can be used as col-
lateral alleviates ex post hold-up problems and hence enlarges ex ante debt capacity. This, in turn,
speeds up investment timing. Our model predicts that financially constrained firms with more
tangible assets invest more and borrow more in response to positive shocks due to an endogenous
financing–investment feedback effect that propagates across time — the firm-level credit multiplier.
    Our model’s central insights guide us in conducting empirical tests to shed new light on the
relation between investment spending and Q. More specifically, while both Q and tangibility are
expected to explain the firm’s investment, the credit multiplier predicts that the interaction of these
two variables should have an even stronger impact on investment in the cross-section of financially
constrained firms. Based on a large sample of manufacturers over the 1971–2005 period, a variety
of tests strongly support our theory’s predictions. Consistent with our identification strategy, we
show also that the credit multiplier is absent from samples of financially unconstrained firms and
financially constrained firms with low incremental debt capacity. Finally, estimation results on debt
issuance as a function of Q, tangibility, and Q interacted with tangibility lend further support to our
firm-level credit multiplier effect. In particular, when firms are financially constrained, they take on
more debt in response to increases in investment opportunities when their assets are more tangible.
    The set of results generated by this study suggests that further extension of this research agenda
may prove fruitful. More generally, our findings indicate that contracting imperfections may have
important, yet understudied implications for corporate financial decisions. In future research, it
would be interesting to examine whether the time-varying quality of collateral or the exposure to
business cycle dynamics can, for example, explain differences in the complexity and evolution of debt
structures and financial leverage ratios over time, and across firms. Likewise, it would be interesting
to examine whether collateral alleviates external contracting problems in ways that affect various
financial policies of the firm (such as cash management, dividend distributions, and leases).

Appendix A
This appendix contains the results of tests using the second measure of tangibility, which we do
not tabulate in the paper. The proxy we use is an industry-level, time-variant proxy that gauges
the ease with which lenders can liquidate a firm’s productive capital. In particular, we measure
asset redeployability using the ratio of used to total (i.e., used plus new) fixed depreciable capital
expenditures in an industry. The proxy captures the idea that the degree of activity in asset resale
markets (i.e., demand for second-hand capital) affects financial contractibility. To construct the
intended measure, starting from 1981, we hand-collect data for used and new capital acquisitions
at the four-digit SIC level from the Bureau of Census’ Annual Survey of the Manufacturers. Data
on plant and equipment acquisitions are compiled by the Bureau every year, but the last survey
identifying both used and new capital acquisitions was published in 1996. Besides the shorter time
coverage, we note that estimations based on this measure of asset tangibility use smaller sample
sizes because not all of COMPUSTAT’s SIC codes are present in the Census data. To make the
results in this appendix easily comparable to the ones in the paper, we use the corresponding table
numbers from the paper in this appendix (i.e., the base regression results are in Table 4-A and
the credit multiplier regression results are in Table 5-A). Moreover, we tabulate a few unreported
robustness tests using the paper’s primary measure of tangibility, which is an annual, firm-level
proxy for expected value of assets in liquidation, in Tables 6-A, 7-A, and 8-A.

This table displays OLS-FE (firm- and year-fixed effects) estimation results of the base investment model (omitting
the Q-interactive term from Eq. (31) in the text). The estimations in Panel A use pre-determined firm selection into
“financially constrained” and “financially unconstrained” categories. Constraint category assignments use ex-ante
criteria based on firm dividend payout, asset size, bond ratings, and commercial paper ratings. In Panel B, switching
regression estimations allow for endogenous selection into “financially constrained” and “financially unconstrained”
categories via maximum likelihood methods. The“regime selection” regression (unreported) uses payout ratio, asset
size, a dummy for bond ratings, a dummy for commercial paper ratings, and T angibility as selection variables to
classify firms into constraint categories (see text for details). Investment is the ratio of fixed capital expenditures
(item #128) over lagged fixed capital stock (item #8). Q is computed as the market value of assets divided by the
book value of assets, or (item #6 + (item #24 × item #25) – item #60 – item #74) / (item #6). T angibility is an
annual, industry-level measure of asset redeployment; available from 1981 through 1996 (data taken from the Bureau
of Census’ Annual Survey of Manufacturers). All firm data are collected from COMPUSTAT’s annual industrial
tapes over the 1971–2005 period. All firm data are collected from COMPUSTAT’s annual industrial tapes over the

Table 6-A. Investment Spending, Q, and Asset Tangibility: The Credit Multiplier
Effect Using GMM Estimations

This table displays GMM-FE (firm- and year-fixed effects) estimation results of the credit multiplier investment
model (Eq. (31) in the text). The estimations use pre-determined firm selection into “financially constrained” and
“financially unconstrained” categories. Constraint category assignments use ex-ante criteria based on firm dividend
payout, asset size, bond ratings, and commercial paper ratings (see text for details). Investment is the ratio of fixed
capital expenditures (item #128) over lagged fixed capital stock (item #8). Q is computed as the market value
of assets divided by the book value of assets, or (item #6 + (item #24 × item #25) – item #60 – item #74) /
(item #6). T angibility is an annual, firm-level proxy for expected value of assets in liquidation (the computation
follows Berger et al. (1996)). The instruments include lags 1 through 3 of the model’s differenced right-hand side
variables. All firm data are collected from COMPUSTAT’s annual industrial tapes over the 1971–2005 period. The
sample firms are from manufacturing industries (SICs 2000–3999). The estimations correct the error structure for
heteroskedasticity and clustering using the White-Huber estimator. Robust standard errors reported in parentheses.
Diagnostic statistics for instrument overidentification restrictions (p-values for Hansen’s J-statistics) and instrument
relevance (first-stage F -statistics’ p-values) are also reported.

Table 7-A. Investment Spending, Q, and Asset Tangibility: The Credit Multiplier
Effect Replacing Q with the Projection of Q on Industry Prices

This table displays OLS-FE (firm- and year-fixed effects) estimation results of the credit multiplier investment model
(Eq. (31) in the text), where conventional Q is replaced by the projection of Q on industry-level PPI (from the
Bureau of Labor Statisticcs). This construct is denoted P rojQ. The estimations use pre-determined firm selec-
tion into “financially constrained” and “financially unconstrained” categories. Constraint category assignments use
ex-ante criteria based on firm dividend payout, size, bond ratings, and commercial paper ratings (see text for de-
tails). Investment is the ratio of fixed capital expenditures (item #128) over lagged fixed capital stock (item #8).
T angibility is an annual, firm-level proxy for expected value of assets in liquidation (the computation follows Berger
et al. (1996)). All firm data are collected from COMPUSTAT’s annual industrial tapes. The sample firms are from
manufacturing industries (SICs 2000–3999). While for most industries the PPI series compilations start in the 1970’s,
for many it starts in the mid-1980’s. All of the PPI series end in 2003. The estimations correct the error structure for
heteroskedasticity and clustering using the White-Huber estimator. Robust standard errors reported in parentheses.

Appendix B
This appendix establishes that coefficient estimates of an interaction term that contains one (or
even two) mismeasured variables are also biased towards zero, so a measurement problem in Q
would make it harder for our tests to find the effect of the credit multiplier via the Q × T angibility
interaction term. In other words, we examine the effect of mismeasurement on coefficient estimates
returned for Q interacted with T angibility by employing Monte Carlo experiments.
    In a first set of experiments, we simulate our interactive model considering the case in which
only one right-hand side variable is measured with error. That is, we consider:

     Investmenti,t = α0 + α1 Qi,t−1 + α2 T angibilityi,t−1 + α3 (Q × T angibility)i,t−1 + ei,t ,              (39)

where ei,t is i.i.d. and the observable variable Q is mismeasured. In particular,

                                               Qi,t = Q∗i,t + εi,t ,                                          (40)

where Q∗ is the unobservable, true variable, and the measurement error εi,t is i.i.d. and independent
of ei,t . This specification is equivalent to assuming cov(Q∗i,t , εi,t ) = 0 and cov (Qi,t , εi,t ) = var (εi,t ),
which corresponds to the classical errors-in-variables problem.
    To study the potential bias in estimates of α3 (the credit multiplier effect) due to measurement
                                                                                         0
error in Q, we consider three different distributions for innovations (ei , εi ) : (1) a standard nor-
mal distribution, (2) a log-normal distribution, and (3) a chi-square distribution with 3 degrees of
freedom. Without loss of generality, we normalize the simulated parameter values of αi to unity
for all i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}. To allow for various correlation structures, we generate random samples
of Q and T angibility from the above distributions, multiply the resulting vectors by the matrix
cov(Q, T angibility), and generate Q × T angibility. We use four alternative correlation matrices,
where the diagonal elements are equal to 1 and off-diagonal elements equal to 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75.
We perform simulations for various sample sizes. Since the estimation results are qualitatively
similar across different sample sizes, we tabulate the result for n = 500 (results for other sample
sizes are available upon request). For each simulation the number of repetitions is 10,000.

   Table 9-A collects the least squares estimates based on our simulated data. The table shows that
the coefficients involving Q are likely biased in the presence of mismeasurement. Crucially, however,
Table 9-A shows that the observed biases work against finding evidence for our credit multiplier
theory. In particular: (1) as expected, the estimates of α1 are biased downwardly; (2) notably,
estimates of α3 are also biased downwardly; and (3) the estimates of α2 could be downwardly or
upwardly biased, depending on the assumed correlation structure.
   In a second set of experiments, we examine the case in which two explanatory variables are
mismeasured. That is, both Q and T angibility suffer from measurement error. To handle this more
general case, we incorporate another mismeasurement equation into the simulation framework; that
is, the simulated data is now generated by equations (39), (40), and

                                                               ∗
                                 T angibilityi,t = T angibilityi,t + i,t ,                     (41)

where T angibility ∗ is the additional unobservable variable, and the additional measurement error
i is i.i.d. and independent of ei and εi .
   Table 10-A summarizes our findings for the second set of Monte Carlo experiments. The es-
timation results for the case when Q and T angibility are imprecisely measured are qualitatively
similar to the ones for the case when only Q is measured with error. The main difference between
the two sets of results is that estimates of α2 are now, as expected, also downwardly biased.

   The above simulations have shown that the coefficients of interest for our tests are biased
downward when there are measurement errors in one or two of the explanatory variables of our
main regression specification (Eq. (31)). More concretely, they indicate that mismeasurement in Q
and/or T angibility also lead to an attenuation bias in the coefficient returned for the interactive
term Q × T angibility. Altogether, these potential biases make it more difficult for one to detect a
significant role for our credit multiplier theory in the data.

Table 1. Base and Credit Multiplier Regressions on Simulated Data
This table displays (average) OLS estimation results of the base investment model (omitting the Q-interactive term
from Eq. (31)) in Panel A and the credit multiplier investment model (Eq. (31) in the text) in Panel B for 200
simulated panels of 600 model firms over 35 years. The estimation results in Panels A.1 and B.1 use linear issuance
costs to assign firms into “financially constrained” and “financially unconstrained” categories. The estimation results
in Panels A.2 and B.2 use linear-quadratic issuance costs to assign firms into “financially constrained” and “financially
unconstrained” categories. Investment is the ratio of the number of investment points reached by a firm over the
book value of assets, K. That is, the cumulative counter of a firm starting at X and reaching an investment point, X̂,
the first time from below and then being replaced by a replica of itself starting out again at X with the counter being
moved up by one. Q is computed as firm value F (·) divided by the book value of assets, K. T angibility is specified
by the set τ ∈ {0.025, 0.05, ..., 0.725, 0.75} scaled by K, which provides a step size of 2.5% and yields 30 “tangibility
cases.” In each of the 200 panels, we use 20 firms per case and hence obtain 600 firms, which we follow for 70 years
at a quarterly frequency. As we drop the first 35 years from each panel and transform the quarterly data into annual
(year-end) data, we end up with 21,000 firm-year observations per panel. The estimations correct the error structure
for heteroskedasticity using the White estimator. Robust standard errors reported in parentheses.

Table 2. Sample Descriptive Statistics
This table displays summary statistics for the main variables used in the empirical estimations. All firm data
are collected from COMPUSTAT’s annual industrial tapes over the 1971–2005 period. The sample firms are from
manufacturing industries (SICs 2000–3999). Assets is the firm’s total assets (COMSPUSTAT’s item #6), expressed
in millions of CPI-adjusted 1971 dollars. Investment is the ratio of fixed capital expenditures (item #128) over
lagged fixed capital stock (item #8). Q is computed as the market value of assets divided by the book value of assets,
or (item #6 + (item #24 × item #25) – item #60 – item #74) / (item #6). T angibility is the expected value of
assets in liquidation (the computation follows Berger et al. (1996)). Leverage is computed as item #9 divided by
item #6. DebtIssuance is the change in long- (∆item #9) and short-term debt (∆item #34) over lagged total assets.

constrained or unconstrained (see text for definitions). To ease visualization, we assign the letter (C) for constrained
firms and (U) for unconstrained firms in each row/column. All firm data are collected from COMPUSTAT’s annual
industrial tapes over the 1971–2005 period. The sample firms are from manufacturing industries (SICs 2000–3999).

Table 4. Investment Spending, Q, and Asset Tangibility: Base Regressions
This table displays OLS-FE (firm- and year-fixed effects) estimation results of the base investment model (omitting
the Q-interactive term from Eq. (31) in the text). The estimations in Panel A use pre-determined firm selection into
“financially constrained” and “financially unconstrained” categories. Constraint category assignments use ex-ante
criteria based on firm dividend payout, asset size, bond ratings, and commercial paper ratings. In Panel B, switching
regression estimations allow for endogenous selection into “financially constrained” and “financially unconstrained”
categories via maximum likelihood methods. The“regime selection” regression (unreported) uses payout ratio, asset
size, a dummy for bond ratings, a dummy for commercial paper ratings, and T angibility as selection variables to
classify firms into constraint categories (see text for details). Investment is the ratio of fixed capital expenditures
(item #128) over lagged fixed capital stock (item #8). Q is computed as the market value of assets divided by the
book value of assets, or (item #6 + (item #24 × item #25) – item #60 – item #74) / (item #6). T angibility is an
annual, firm-level proxy for expected value of assets in liquidation (the computation follows Berger et al. (1996)). All
firm data are collected from COMPUSTAT’s annual industrial tapes over the 1971–2005 period. The sample firms are
from manufacturing industries (SICs 2000–3999). The estimations correct the error structure for heteroskedasticity
and clustering using the White-Huber estimator. Robust standard errors reported in parentheses.

Table 7. Investment Spending, Q, and Asset Tangibility: The Credit Multiplier Effect
Including CashF low
This table displays OLS-FE (firm- and year-fixed effects) estimation results of the credit multiplier investment model
(Eq. (31) in the text), with the inclusion of cash flow as a control variable. The estimations use pre-determined firm
selection into “financially constrained” and “financially unconstrained” categories. Constraint category assignments
use ex-ante criteria based on firm dividend payout, asset size, bond ratings, and commercial paper ratings (see text for
details). Investment is the ratio of fixed capital expenditures (item #128) over lagged fixed capital stock (item #8).
Q is computed as the market value of assets divided by the book value of assets, or (item #6 + (item #24 × item
#25) – item #60 – item #74) / (item #6). CashF low is the ratio of operating income (item #18 + item#14) over
lagged fixed capital stock. T angibility is an annual, firm-level proxy for expected value of assets in liquidation (the
computation follows Berger et al. (1996)). All firm data are collected from COMPUSTAT’s annual industrial tapes
over the 1971–2005 period. The sample firms are from manufacturing industries (SICs 2000–3999). The estimations
correct the error structure for heteroskedasticity and clustering using the White-Huber estimator. Robust standard
errors reported in parentheses.

Table 8. Investment Spending, Q, and Asset Tangibility: Debt Capacity and the Credit
Multiplier Effect

This table displays OLS-FE (firm- and year-fixed effects) estimation results of the credit multiplier investment model
(Eq. (31) in the text), where constrained firms are split into “high” and “low” debt capacity groups. In Panel A,
firms are assigned into high and low debt capacity categories according to annual rankings of the residuals from a
regression of firm leverage on asset tangibility. Low (high) residuals are associated with high (low) incremental debt
capacity. In Panel B, annual rankings based on raw leverage are used. Accordingly, firms ranked at the bottom (top)
of the leverage distribution are considered to have high (low). Investment is the ratio of fixed capital expenditures
(item #128) over lagged fixed capital stock (item #8). Q is computed as the market value of assets divided by the
book value of assets, or (item #6 + (item #24 × item #25) – item #60 – item #74) / (item #6). T angibility is
an annual, firm-level proxy for expected value of assets in liquidation (the computation follows Berger et al. (1996)).
Leverage is computed as item #9 divided by item #6. All firm data are collected from COMPUSTAT’s annual
industrial tapes over the 1971–2005 period. The sample firms are from manufacturing industries (SICs 2000–3999).
The estimations correct the error structure for heteroskedasticity and clustering using the White-Huber estimator.
Robust standard errors reported in parentheses.

Policy

This table displays OLS-FE (firm- and year-fixed effects) estimation results of the credit multiplier debt model (Eq.
(32) in the text). The dependent variable is DebtIssuance, defined as the change in long- (∆item #9) and short-

is the ratio of fixed capital expenditures (item #128) over lagged fixed capital stock (item #8). Q is computed as
