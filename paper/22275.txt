Is the Macroeconomy Locally Unstable and Why Should We Care?

                                           ABSTRACT

In most modern macroeconomic models, the steady state (or balanced growth path) of the system
is a local attractor, in the sense that, in the absence of shocks, the economy would converge to the
steady state. In this paper, we examine whether the time series behavior of macroeconomic
aggregates (especially labor market aggregates) is in fact supportive of this local-stability view of
macroeconomic dynamics, or if it instead favors an alternative interpretation in which the
macroeconomy may be better characterized as being locally unstable, with nonlinear
deterministic forces capable of producing endogenous cyclical behavior. To do this, we extend a
standard AR representation of the data to allow for smooth nonlinearities. Our main finding is
that, even using a procedure that may have low power to detect local instability, the data provide
intriguing support for the view that the macroeconomy may be locally unstable and involve limit-
cycle forces. An interesting finding is that the degree of nonlinearity we detect in the data is
small, but nevertheless enough to alter the description of macroeconomic behavior. We complete
the paper with a discussion of the extent to which these two different views about the inherent
dynamics of the macroeconomy may matter for policy.

1         Introduction
There are two polar views about the functioning of a market economy. On the one hand, there is
the view that such a system is inherently stable, with market forces tending to direct the economy
towards a smooth growth path. According to this belief, most of the fluctuations in the macroe-
conomy result either from individually optimal adjustments to changes in the environment or from
improper government interventions, with market forces acting to prevent the economy from being
unstable. On the other hand, there is the view that the market economy is inherently unstable, and
that left to itself it will repeatedly go through periods of socially costly booms and busts. According
to this view, macroeconomic policy is needed to help stabilize an unruly system.
        Most modern macroeconomic models, such as those used by large central banks and governments,
are somewhere in between these two extremes. However, they are by design generally much closer
to the first view than the second. In fact, most commonly used macroeconomic models have the
feature that, in the absence of outside disturbances, the economy is expected to converge to a stable
path. In this sense, these models are based on the premise that a decentralized economy is both
a globally and locally stable system, and that market forces, in and of themselves, do not tend
to produce booms and busts. The only reason why we see economic cycles in most mainstream
macroeconomic models is due to outside forces that perturb an otherwise stable system. While such
a framework is very tractable and flexible, the ubiquitous and recurrent feature of cycles in most
market economies requires one to question whether the market economy may, by its very nature,
be inherently unstable and feature recurrent booms and busts, with a bust sowing the seeds of the
next boom.1
        There are at least two reasons why much of the macroeconomic profession adheres to the idea
that the market economy is best described as a system with a unique stable steady state, where
fluctuations are generated only by exogenous shocks. First, the majority of modern macroeconomic
models based on optimizing behavior support the view of such a stable economic system. Second,
when looking at the time series behavior of many labor market variables (such as the employment
rate, the unemployment rate, or the job finding rate), the estimated impulse response functions
    1
     Although the idea of endogenous boom and bust cycles has a long tradition in the economics literature (Kalecki
[1937], Kaldor [1940], Hicks [1950], Goodwin [1951]), it is not present in most modern macro-models. Recent
exceptions are Myerson [2012], Matsuyama [2013], Gu, Mattesini, Monnet, and Wright [2013] and Beaudry, Galizia,
and Portier [2015b].

indicate that these variables respond to shocks in a manner suggestive of a stable system. For
example, if one estimates a simple AR model for labor market variables, the roots of the system
are generally well below one, which is consistent with the view that the system is stable.2
       In this paper, we question this consensus. We begin by arguing that the local stability of the
macroeconomic system should not be evaluated using linear time series methods, even if nonlinear-
ities are thought to be very minor and only relevant rather far away from the steady state. Instead,
we show why it is essential to allow for the possibility of nonlinearities (even if these may be very
small) when exploring whether a dynamic system is locally stable. We then derive a simple class
of time series models which we use to explore the stability properties of a number of macroeco-
nomic aggregates. Using the results, we discuss why local instability should be treated as a relevant
theoretical possibility when thinking about macroeconomic dynamics.3 The main body of the text
focuses on estimating the inherent dynamics of labor market variables and other macroeconomic
aggregates. As we show, when we allow for simple nonlinearities in estimation, we generally find
that this significantly changes the local properties of the system; in particular, it often switches
from being locally stable when the nonlinear terms are excluded to being locally unstable when
they are included.
       After establishing that the macroeconomic system may be locally unstable, we then turn to
examining the nature of the implied dynamics. This can be done by looking at how the system,
with its stochastic elements turned off, evolves when it starts away from the steady state. If the
steady state is unique and locally unstable, the system will not converge to a point.4 Instead, in such
a case there are three possible outcomes. One is that the system is globally unstable; that is, that
the system will explode outward until it hits the economy’s underlying capacity or non-negativity
constraints. This is very unlikely to be the case for labor market variables, since it would imply for
example that we should see the unemployment rate approaching either 100% or 0%. This leaves two
remaining possibilities, both involving endogenous fluctuations. The first of these is that the system
   2
     In the 1980s, following Blanchard and Summers [1986], a branch of the literature explored the case of an exact
unit root in unemployment series as an indication of hysteresis. However, in practice, estimations gave persistent but
stable dynamics, as pointed out by Blanchard and Summers [1986]: “We shall instead use ‘hysteresis’ more loosely
to refer to the case where the degree of dependence on the past is very high, where the sum of coefficients is close but
not necessarily equal to 1.” (footnote 1, page 17).
   3
     A reader mainly interested in the theoretical rationale for local instability in macroeconomic models may want
to consult Beaudry, Galizia, and Portier [2015b].
   4
     We discuss in section 2.4 the possibility of multiple steady states and its implications.



                                                           2
may converge to a limit cycle; that is, the system settles into a recurrent pattern of booms and busts.
The second possibility is that the system exhibits chaotic dynamics; that is, the system exhibits
seemingly random non-recurrent fluctuations (despite being fully deterministic) and is sensitive to
initial conditions.5 As we shall show, when we find that the system exhibits local instability, we
generally find that there is a unique steady state and that the (non-stochastic) dynamics converge to
a limit cycle. In this sense, our results suggest that a significant part of macroeconomic fluctuations
may reflect forces that create endogenous boom-and-bust phenomena. Further, we find no evidence
of chaotic behavior; that is, we do not find evidence that the deterministic part of the system exhibits
sensitivity to initial conditions, a property that would render forecasting particularly difficult.
        In the last section of the paper we discuss why our findings may be relevant for policy. In
particular, we explore how the effects of stabilization policy may change in the presence of local
instability and limit cycles. For example, we show that reducing the impact of shocks on the
economy may not always help stabilize the system in such cases, and in particular it may only
change the frequency of fluctuations, without necessarily decreasing their overall amplitude.


2         A Framework for Exploring Local Stability and Endoge-
          nous Cycles
In order to discuss the issue of local stability, it is helpful to focus on a variable that reflects cyclical
fluctuations but that does not exhibit secular growth. Simple examples in macroeconomics are some
labor market variables, such as the unemployment rate. Let us denote such a variable, in deviation
from its mean, by xt . One generally views xt as being locally stable if there are endogenous forces
present that tend to push it back towards its steady state when slightly perturbed. Suppose we
believe that the process for xt is approximately linear near its steady state. Then one may explore
the local stability properties for x by first estimating an ARMA model for x, as given by

                                           xt = A(L)x
                                                e     t−1 + B(L)t ,                                             (1)
    5
     A deterministic dynamic system is considered sensitive to initial conditions when arbitrarily small differences
in initial conditions can lead to significant differences in outcomes over time. In such a case, forecasting long-run
outcomes is considered problematic.




                                                         3
where A(L)
      e    and B(L) are polynomials in the lag operator and where t is an i.i.d. process.6 Let us
                                                      7
denote by A the companion matrix associated with A(L).
                                                 e      If we find that the largest eigenvalue of
A is less than 1,8 then the steady state is stable. However, even if we believe that this system may
be close to linear near the steady state, and that the variance of  may be small, such an approach
can provide a misleading answer regarding whether the steady state is locally stable or unstable.
This can be shown with the following example.
       Suppose the data-generating process (DGP) is actually

                                            xt = A(L)x
                                                 e     t−1 + F (xt−1 ) + t ,                                               (2)

where F (·) is a nonlinear function with F (0) = F 0 (0) = 0, which would be the case for example if
F (·) is a polynomial function with no constant or linear terms. In this case, whether the system
is locally stable at the zero steady state depends only on the eigenvalues of the companion matrix
A, and not on the function F (·). However, this does not necessarily mean that one can disregard
F (xt−1 ) in the estimation of (2). If the eigenvalues of A are all less than 1, and if the variance of 
is small, then omitting F (xt−1 ) in the estimation of (2) is unlikely to alter any conclusions drawn
about the local stability of the system. However, if the largest eigenvalue of A is greater than 1,
then omitting F (xt−1 ) can easily lead one to conclude that the system is locally stable when it is
in fact locally unstable.9 To see this most clearly, consider the situation where A(L)
                                                                                  e    = −α and
F (xt−1 ) = βx3t−1 , with α, β > 0. Since the covariance between xt−1 and x3t−1 is positive but these
terms enter (2) with opposite signs, omitting x3t−1 from the econometric specification will tend to
bias the estimate of α towards zero. If the system is locally unstable (α > 1), but β is large enough
relative to α − 1,10 then one would nonetheless incorrectly infer that the system was locally stable.
   6
      For ease of exposition, we consider here processes without a constant term, which amounts to assuming that
the steady state of the process is at zero. In our empirical exercise below, we relax this assumption.
    7
      If A(L)
         e    = a1 + a2 L + · · · + an Ln−1 , then we define the associated n × n companion matrix as follows: the first
row is given by [a1 , a2 , . . . , an ], the lower-left (n − 1) × (n − 1) block is given by In−1 , and the remaining entries are
zero.
    8
      Throughout this paper, for the sake of brevity the term “largest eigenvalue” will be used to refer to the eigenvalue
that has the largest modulus, and when we say that an eigenvalue is greater (less) than 1, unless otherwise indicated
we mean that its modulus is greater (less) than 1.
    9
      Fundamentally, if the largest eigenvalue of A is greater than 1, then the system will tend to move away from
the steady state (even if the variance of  is very small), which causes higher-order terms to become more relevant
in the DGP. It is for precisely this reason that using an econometric specification containing only first-order terms is
more likely to yield misleading results in such a case than in the case where the largest eigenvalue of A is less than 1.

Note also in this case that the closer α is to 1, the more likely it is that even a small value of β will
be enough to arrive at the wrong conclusion about the stability of the system.
   We have explored the behavior of such biases in various model specifications using Monte Carlo
methods. A typical example is the following. We simulated 5,000 1,000-period samples of the DGP

                          xt = αxt−1 − 0.6xt−2 − 0.3xt−3 − 0.01x3t−1 + .25t ,                       (3)

where t is i.i.d. N (0, 1), and where α takes values in [0.5, 1.5]. For this DGP, local stability
depends on whether |λ|max is greater or smaller than 1, where |λ|max is the maximum modulus of
the eigenvalues of the companion matrix to A(L)
                                           e    = α − 0.6L − 0.3L2 . When α ∈ [0.5, 1.5], this
process implies that |λ|max ∈ [0.94, 1.4]. When |λ|max ∈ [0.94, 1), the steady state x = 0 is locally
(and globally) stable, while when |λ|max > 1 it is locally unstable. In this latter case, the DGP
is such that, in the absence of any shocks, xt would be attracted towards a limit cycle (as long
as x0 6= 0). Figure 1 plots, as a function of the DGP |λ|max (which is in turn a function of α),
the average estimated |λ|max for both the well-specified model and a mis-specified model in which
the nonlinear term is dropped. The first thing to notice is that the estimate of |λ|max for the well-
specified model is unbiased, as indicated by the fact that it lies directly on the 45◦ line. Next, note
that the difference between the estimated values of |λ|max for the well-specified and mis-specified
models provides an indication of the importance of including the nonlinear term. As one can see
in the Figure, the bias in estimating the mis-specified model is very small when |λ|max < 1 in the
DGP. Thus, in this case, whether or not one includes the nonlinear term is virtually irrelevant for
determining whether the steady state is locally stable. However, the same degree of nonlinearity
becomes much more important when the |λ|max in the DGP becomes greater than 1, as evidenced by
the fact that the mis-specified model continues to indicate that the zero steady state is stable (i.e.,
|λ|max < 1 for this model) when it is in fact locally unstable in the DGP. One inference that can be
drawn from this exercise is that, when estimates from a linear model yield a maximum eigenvalue
that is close to 1 in modulus, this may be an indication that omitting nonlinear terms has made the
steady state appear to be locally stable when in fact it is not. Moreover, the degree of nonlinearity
in the DGP may be very modest, but may nevertheless be important for assessing local stability.
We return to this issue below in the context of our empirical results.
   The above discussion suggests a simple protocol for exploring local stability. One can start by

Notes: For each of 100 values of α evenly distributed in the interval [0.5, 1.5], we simulated 5,000
times a 1,000-period sample of the DGP (3). From the resulting simulated data, we estimated
by OLS either the well-specified equation (3) or a mis-specified equation that omits the cubic
term in (3). For each model and each α, we then computed the average maximum modulus of
the eigenvalues of the companion matrix to A(L)

estimating a linear model for the variable of interest and examine its local stability properties. Then
one can add nonlinear terms (e.g., higher-order polynomial terms) to the specification, estimate it,
and check the local stability properties of the resulting nonlinear model. If the addition of the
nonlinear terms causes the largest eigenvalue of the linear approximation of the system to go from
below 1 to above 1, this is an indication that the system may in fact be locally unstable. This is
the procedure we will follow. In following such a procedure, it is generally important to include in
the nonlinear specification terms that are at least of order three, since such terms are more likely
to capture distant forces that may favor stability and whose omission would be more likely to bias
in favor of inferring local stability.

2.1       How to Interpret Local Instability

A common property of most modern macro models is that fluctuations reflect the effects of ex-
ogenous shocks around a stable steady state. Macroeconomic models with unstable steady states
are more of a rarity. While it is true that a Walrasian equilibrium model is unlikely to have an
unstable steady state, models with strategic complementarities across agents can easily give rise
to such configurations, even when the complementarities are not large enough to generate multiple
equilibria. To see this, consider the following extremely simple environment describing the determi-
nation of an aggregate outcome. We have a collection of n agents indexed by i who make a decision
xit at each date t, with the average outcome being xt = n−1 i xit . Suppose that in the absence
                                                             P

of any interactions across agents, their actions could be described by a stable decision rule of the
form xit = A(L)x
           e     it−1 + t , where the largest eigenvalue of A (where A is the companion matrix to

A(L)
e    as defined above) is less than one. In this case, the dynamics for xt are given by the stable
system xt = A(L)x
            e     t−1 + t . Now suppose we modify this environment slightly to allow for strategic

complements across agents, such that the decision rule of agent i now includes a term that reflects
their beliefs about the average behavior of others. In particular, suppose

                                xit = A(L)x
                                      e     it−1 + γEit (xt ) + t ,        0<γ<1

where Eit (xt ) reflects agent i’s expectation of others’ behavior,11 and the parameter γ governs the
degree of strategic complementarity. The dynamics of xit now reflect the effects of both the stable
  11
       We assume for simplicity that n is large enough that agents ignore the effect of their own choice xi on x.

captured by having 0 < γ < 1. Assuming a rational expectations, symmetric Nash equilibrium
outcome, the dynamics for xt are then given by

What are the stability properties of xt in this case? If γ is sufficient small, then xt will remain
stable. However, if γ is sufficiently large (while remaining below 1), then one may verify that the
largest eigenvalue of the companion matrix for A(L)/(1
                                               e       − γ) will be greater than 1, in which case
the system will be unstable. Note also that if the largest eigenvalue of A is below but close to 1,
then only a very small degree of strategic complementarity will be enough to produce instability in
the system.
   The above example illustrates that in environments where agents interact, and where these
interactions take the form of strategic complementarities, then the appearance of a non-stable
steady state can arise quite easily. This gives rise to three possibilities: (i) the economy has more
than one steady state and one or more of these other steady states is an attractor, (ii) the economy
has more than one steady state and all are unstable, or (iii) the economy has only one steady
state and therefore the economy cannot converge to a steady state. While we explore all three
possibilities in our empirical work, we show that the data favor the third one, so let us focus on this
possibility here. If the economy has only one steady state and it is unstable, what will the dynamics
of the system look like? If the system is globally linear, then the economy must necessarily explode.
However, it is unlikely that the assumption of linearity, which may be appropriate near the steady
state, remains so as one moves far away from the steady state. For example, complementarity
between individuals’ actions, which may be present near the steady state, is likely to give way
to forces of strategic substitutability when one moves far away from the steady state. This is
likely to arise since, if the economy is on an exploding path, eventually resource or non-negativity
constraints will become binding. Hence, when one considers global behavior in such environments,
it is necessary to recognize that some countervailing forces are likely to appear and stop the system
from exploding. Such alternative forces will be manifested as some sort of nonlinearity. If this is
the case, then the local instability of the steady state will create dynamics that endogenously favor
economic fluctuations, as the system will neither explode nor converge to its only steady state. This

                                                    8
outcome can take the form of a limit cycle, wherein in the absence of shocks the economy would
undergo a regular and predictable boom-and-bust pattern. Alternatively, it can produce chaotic
behavior, in which the economy will fluctuate in an irregular and seemingly unpredictable fashion
even in the absence of shocks, and in which the deterministic dynamics would exhibit sensitivity
to initial conditions, making forecasting very difficult. Note that, while chaos is an interesting
theoretical possibility, as documented below and in contrast to the limit-cycle case we do not find
any evidence to suggest that it may be empirically relevant.
       Our goal in this paper will be to examine the time series behavior of several cyclical indicators
of macroeconomic activity while allowing for nonlinearities. We will examine (i) whether these
systems exhibit unique or multiple steady states, (ii) whether the implied steady states are locally
stable, and (iii) if the dynamics exhibit limit cycles or chaotic behavior. In principle, the empirical
exercise we perform is straightforward. We begin by estimating univariate processes allowing for
nonlinear forces. We then examine whether the implied dynamics are stable or explosive near the
steady state(s) by looking at the root structure of the local linear approximation. Finally, we
examine the behavior of the variable if we start it away from the steady state, while shutting down
the effects of any stochastic terms. In particular, if we find that a variable exhibits a unique steady
state and local instability, we want to examine whether it then converges to cyclical behavior. The
main difficulty with this procedure is determining the class of nonlinear models to consider, as
nonlinearities can take on many forms.12

2.2       Baseline Univariate Model

Our approach to exploring local stability and possible endogenous cyclical behavior will be to
estimate univariate models of the form

                                 xt = a0 + A(L)x
                                           e     t−1 + F (xt−1 , xt−2 , . . .) + t ,                              (4)
  12
     Since we will be examining behavior within a limited class of nonlinear models, one must be careful about which
inferences can be made. For example, if we do not find evidence of local instability in this class, this does not imply
that the macroeconomic environment is necessarily stable. However, if we do find that local instability and limit
cycles appear in this limited class, it will provide some reason to question the consensus view that macroeconomic
fluctuations reflect mainly the effects of shocks within an otherwise stable system.




                                                          9
where xt is a cyclical variable of interest, and F (·) is a multivariate polynomial function with no
constant or linear terms.13 In general we would like to allow all the lags of x that appear in
A(L)x
e     t−1 to potentially enter nonlinearly through F (·). As we have discussed, we also wish to allow

F to be of at least order three in order to avoid potentially important biases in the estimation
of A(L).
   e     When F (·) is of minimum order three, however, the number of terms it contains grows
very fast with the number of lags of x. For example, if F is a third-order polynomial in three
lags of x, then with no further restrictions the resulting regression will feature sixteen nonlinear
terms, while adding a fourth lag would add another fifteen terms on top of this, and so on. Since
we would like to allow more distant lags to enter the regression without simultaneously having an
explosion of coefficients to estimate, we impose the following two restrictions: (a) F is a polynomial
of order three, and (b) lags of x beyond the second enter (4) only through an accumulation term
Xt−1 ≡ δ ∞             j
          P
            j=0 (1 − δ) xt−1−j . Under these restrictions, we can equivalently write (4) as


                      xt = a0 + a1 xt−1 + a2 xt−2 + a3 Xt + F (xt−1 , xt−2 , Xt−1 ) + t                    (5)

where F (·) is a multivariate polynomial containing second- and third-order terms in its arguments.14
There are two important things to note about the econometric specification (5). First, it embeds
the standard AR(2) process, which is known to be able to capture well many of the dynamics of
macroeconomic variables. Second, it allows for more distant lags to play a role (through Xt−1 )
without requiring the estimation of too many extra parameters. We should emphasize that our
inclusion of an accumulation term of this form is motivated by the class of models presented in
Beaudry, Galizia, and Portier [2015b] where the emergence of limit cycles is shown to be a possibility.
See Appendix A for more details.

2.2.1    Handling Low-Frequency Movements

The specification we laid out in (5) is hopefully a sufficiently flexible way to allow us to offer new
insight regarding the stability and cyclical properties of major macro aggregates. One remaining
question is how to treat very low-frequency movements in the variable xt . It is well known that
most macroeconomic aggregates (even labor market variables) exhibit important low-frequency
  13
     Even if the cyclical variables we consider generally have a zero mean, we nevertheless allow for a non-zero
intercept in our baseline specifications. Results are robust to omitting the intercept.
  14
     Note that the F in (4) and the F in (5) are not technically the same functions.


                                                      10
movements that are not generally thought to be related to the business cycle. For example, a
variable such as total hours worked per capita, which according to many macro models should be
stationary, often exhibits important low-frequency movements that are most often attributed to
demographics and social change. We would like to remove such movements from our data, as they
are likely to confound the cyclical properties we are interested in. In particular, in what follows we
will interpret the framework we laid out above as modeling the cyclical element of a cyclical-trend
unobserved component model. That is, we want to interpret the observed data as having been
generated by a process of the form
                                                 xO         T
                                                  t = xt + xt ,


where xO                                                                                 T
       t is the observed variable, xt is the unobserved cyclical component of interest, xt is a latent

low-frequency trend, xt and xTt are orthogonal series, and the process for xTt can be written
                           Z ω
                       T
                                                               
                     xt =        a (ω) cos (ωt) + b (ω) sin (ωt) dω,   ω ≤ π.                                 (6)
                                 −ω

Here, a (ω) and b (ω) together determine the phase and amplitude associated with trend fluctuations
of frequency ω, and ω is the maximum frequency associated with trend fluctuations.
       Within this framework, in order to implement our estimation of an equation such as (5) on the
cyclical component of an observed macroeconomic aggregate xO
                                                           t , it is necessary for us to take a

stance on how to remove any low-frequency movements in the data that we believe are unrelated
to business cycle behavior; i.e., on how to remove xTt . In most of our exploration, we will do this
simply using a high-pass filter that removes fluctuations with periods longer than 20 years. With
quarterly data, this corresponds to setting ω = 2π/80 in equation (6), and making the additional
identifying assumption that, not only are trend fluctuations made up entirely of frequencies below
ω (as imposed by (6)), but these low frequencies are only associated with the trend component;
that is, we also assume that the cyclical component xt is associated only with frequencies above ω.15
We will include in our analysis a Monte Carlo evaluation of the potential biases in this approach
to detect local instability and limit cycles in the extracted cyclical component. For robustness, we
will also report results obtained using other detrending methods.
  15
      This identification assumption is quite strong, but allows for a simple two-step approach to the data: first
detrend, then estimate. We leave for future research the exploration of decomposition methods that do not require
this assumption.

2.3    Three Embedded Models

Expanding (5), we get the following expression for the evolution of xt , which we refer to as the
“Full” model:
             xt = β0 + βx xt−1 + βx0 xt−2 + βX Xt−1

                  + βx2 x2t−1 + βx02 x2t−2 + βX 2 Xt−1
                                                   2


                  + βxx0 xt−1 xt−2 + βxX xt−1 Xt−1 + βx0 X xt−2 Xt−1

                  + βx3 x3t−1 + βx03 x3t−2 + βX 3 Xt−1
                                                   3
                                                                                                   (7)

                  + βx2 x0 x2t−1 xt−2 + βx2 X x2t−1 Xt−1

                  + βx02 X x2t−2 Xt−1 + βxx02 xt−1 x2t−2 + βxX 2 xt−1 Xt−1
                                                                       2                   2
                                                                           + βx0 X 2 xt−2 Xt−1

                  + βxx0 X xt−1 xt−2 Xt−1 + t .

This Full model (7) allows for a rich nonlinear departure from the linear model. However, the
drawback of such a specification is that it involves twenty parameters, making some properties hard
to illustrate. For this reason, we will consider at the other extreme a very parsimonious version of
(5) which consists of the inclusion of only one nonlinear term. We choose this one non-linear term
to be a cubic term in xt−1 . This choice, while somewhat arbitrary, is made for two reasons. First,
from an intuitive standpoint, including odd-order nonlinear terms—of which the third is the lowest
order—allows for a symmetric treatment of large positive and negative deviations from the steady
state. Second, if there is only to be a single non-linear term, having that term be solely in xt−1
seems to us to be the simplest choice. Our “Minimal” model is therefore given by

                       xt = β0 + βx xt−1 + βx0 xt−2 + βX Xt−1 + βx3 x3t−1 + t .                   (8)

As we shall see, we get very similar results based on either the minimal model or the full model,
but the minimal model allows for simpler illustrations.
   Finally, we will also consider an “Intermediate” model that lies between these two extremes.
One possibility in order to find the best intermediate specification is, for each variable under study,
to start from the Full model and sequentially remove insignificant variables. As this procedure is
somewhat arbitrary, we instead choose as our intermediate model the case where we keep most
third-order terms from the full model, while eliminating all second-order terms. This has the
feature of significantly reducing the number of parameters, while still allowing for relatively rich

                                                     12
nonlinearities. In particular, of the seven third-order terms in (7), we keep the three cubic terms
and the two cross-terms involving xt−1 and Xt−1 , so that our Intermediate model model becomes

                                 xt = β0 + βx xt−1 + βx0 xt−2 + βX Xt−1

                                       + βx3 x3t−1 + βx03 x3t−2 + βX 3 Xt−1
                                                                        3
                                                                                                                     (9)
                                                                        2
                                       + βx2 X x2t−1 Xt−1 + βxX 2 xt−1 Xt−1 + t .

Our three models—Full, Intermediate, and Minimal—together offer a tractable nonlinear framework
for examining whether certain macroeconomic variables may exhibit local instability and limit
cycles. We will also compare the behavior of these nonlinear models with two specifications that
do not feature any nonlinear terms: the “Linear” model, given by

                                 xt = β0 + βx xt−1 + βx0 xt−2 + βX Xt−1 + t ,                                      (10)

and a simple AR(2) model,
                                        xt = β0 + βx xt−1 + βx0 xt−2 + t .                                         (11)

2.4       Estimation with Total Hours
Data Treatment and Estimation Results

The motivation we used to derive our reduced-form model is one based on a cyclical indicator, such
as hours worked per capita. Accordingly, the first measure we examine is the (log of) BLS total
hours worked, deflated by total population. The mechanisms behind our motivating model were not
meant to explain low-frequency fluctuations such as those related to demographic and sociological
change (e.g. aging, female labor market participation, etc.). As can be seen in panel (a) of Figure
2, total hours (grey line) has exhibited important low-frequency movements over the last 50 years.
For this reason, we begin by filtering the data in order to remove these movements. We do this
by using a (linear) high-pass filter that retains only fluctuations associated with periods less than
20 years.16 The trend (black line) and its filtered component are displayed in panels (a) and (b),
respectively, of Figure 2.
       Once we have a series for x = h (filtered hours), we then need to construct the accumulated hours
series analogous to Xt to above, denoted Ht . To construct this series, we truncate the accumulation
  16
      We discuss the robustness of our result to the filter below. The quarterly series is filtered (80-quarter high-pass
filter) over the sample 1948Q1-2015Q2.

at N quarters, so that Ht = δ                    j=0   (1 − δ)j ht−j . We set N = 40 so that, for example, observations
of h from 1950Q2 to 1960Q1 are used to compute H1960Q1 . We assume for now that δ = 0.05. Later
we show that our results are robust to different values of δ.

         Notes: Total hours are measured as the log of BLS total economy hours worked, deflated by total
         population. The trend of that series is obtained by removing from the level series its filtered
         component, where the filter is an 80-quarter high-pass filter, over the sample 1948Q1-2015Q2.
         The cyclical component is expressed in percentage deviation from the level series.



    For each of our two linear and three nonlinear models, OLS parameter estimates obtained using
our total hours series are displayed in Table 1, with t-statistics in parentheses. One can verify that
in the nonlinear models there is always at least one significant nonlinear term. More informative are
the Wald tests (see Table 2) that compare the fit of the different models. For example, when testing
the AR(2) model against the Full model, we test the joint nullity of all the coefficients except βh
and βh0 (the coefficients on ht−1 and ht−2 , respectively) in the Full model. The first row of Table 2
shows that we reject the simple linear AR(2) model against all alternatives. The second row reaches
the same conclusion for the Linear model. The third row shows that, at a 1% level of confidence,
the Minimal model is not rejected against any of the nonlinear alternatives. We first discuss the
results obtained with this Minimal model, since it is easiest to understand and illustrate. We will
show later that results are mostly the same with the Intermediate and Full models.

Model Selection Using LASSO

An alternative way of selecting the model specification is to use statistical methods developed in
the data-mining literature. One particular method, the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and
Selection Operator), allows for both model selection and shrinkage. The method, proposed by
Tibshirani [1996], consists of minimizing the residual sum of squares of the Full model subject
to the restriction that the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients be less than a constant.
Because of the nature of this constraint, it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly zero,
and hence act as a model-selection device. The value of the constant in the constraint is chosen to
minimize the Akaike Information Criterion. The estimated equation is given by

                    xt = − 0.07 + 1.3 xt−1 − 0.23 xt−2 − 0.03 x2t−1 + 0.21 Xt−1
                                                                            2


                         + 0.04 xt−1 xt−2 + 0.29 xt−1 Xt−1 − 0.30 xt−2 Xt−1
                                                                                                            (12)

                                                                                 2


                         + 0.05 xt−1 xt−2 Xt−1 + t .

One can check that only 12 of the 18 variables of the Full model are present in (12), the others being
assigned a coefficient of zero. We will explore the robustness of the results by comparing results
obtained with Minimal, Intermediate, Full and LASSO models.

        steady states.



Local Instability and Limit Cycles

For the sake of clarity, let us write down the estimated AR(2), Linear, and Minimal models after
shutting down the stochastic component:
               
                ht = −0.00 + 1.42 ht−1 − 0.48 ht−2 ,
                  ht = −0.01 + 1.31 ht−1 − 0.34 ht−2 − 0.25 Ht−1 ,
                  ht = −0.02 + 1.39 ht−1 − 0.34 ht−2 − 0.27 Ht−1 − 0.01 h3t−1 .
               

Note that, even though our Minimal model is nonlinear, it is easy to check that it has only one
steady state at h = −0.09. In order to examine the local stability of each of these three equations,
we compute the largest eigenvalue of each system when linearized around its steady state. For the
Minimal model, this linear approximation is simply17

                                   ht = 1.39 ht−1 − 0.34 ht−2 − 0.27 Ht−1 .

Maximum eigenvalues are displayed in Table 3.
       For the AR(2) model, the maximum eigenvalue is 0.86.18 For the Linear model, it is higher
(0.96), but still less than 1. The steady states implied by the point estimates of the AR(2) and
Linear models therefore indicate local stability, which is not surprising. For the nonlinear Minimal
model, on the other hand, the maximum eigenvalue is 1.01, so that the steady state is locally
  17
     Note that the coefficient on ht−1 in this approximation is in fact different from the one reported above, though
the two are equal to two decimal places.
  18
     Note that the maximum eigenvalue is not the auto-correlation coefficient because the process is an AR(2) not
an AR(1).


                                                         17
unstable. This may seem to conflict with the visual impression given by the data (Figure 2, panel
(b)) that the economy does not explode. In fact, it is precisely the third-order term h3t−1 that
prevents explosion, since it enters negatively in the estimated equation. The steady state is thus
locally unstable, but as h moves aways from the steady state, the term h3 acts as a centripetal force
that pushes the economy back towards the steady state if it strays too far. As a result, the economy
will oscillate without explosion and without convergence to a fixed point. This can be seen by using
the Minimal model to construct a deterministic forecasted path for h, conditional on information
at date T0 . Formally,    this deterministic forecast is computed as:

                                                               e t−1 + βbh3 e           ∀ t > T0 ,
                Ht        =   (1 − δ)H e t−1 + δe
                                                ht                                      ∀ t ≥ T0 .
              e

We forecast h over 1000 periods with the estimated model. We start (arbitrarily) from the first
trough of the sample (i.e., 1961Q3) and plot the forecasted path in the model state space (ht , ht−1 , Ht ).
As we can see in panel (a) of Figure 3, the trajectory is quickly attracted to a limit cycle. Figure 4
shows that this convergence holds more generally: starting from two initial conditions—one inside
the limit cycle and one outside—the system converges to the limit cycle, suggesting that it is indeed
attractive. Note that, as h is highly autocorrelated, there is little loss of information if one projects
the limit cycle onto the (ht , Ht ) plane (panel (b) of Figure 3) instead, and we will often use that
representation of the limit cycle in what follows.
       It is quite interesting that such a simple specification, which was motivated from our previous
theoretical analysis (see Beaudry, Galizia, and Portier [2015b]), displays a limit cycle. We will
document later using Monte Carlo methods that this result is unlikely to be an artifact of our data
treatment. Before exploring further the properties of the Minimal model, it is useful to show that
we obtain similar results with the other nonlinear models. Table 3 shows that the largest eigenvalue
is also greater than 1 for the Intermediate and Full models. As shown in Figure 5, these two models
(as well as the LASSO model) also generate limit cycles, with all specifications producing cycles of
similar amplitudes for total hours.19
  19
     Note that, except under very special circumstances that are unlikely to be encountered in our case, existence
of and convergence to a limit cycle cannot be proven mathematically. As a result, throughout this paper we rely on
numerical simulations to check for these properties.

             Notes: This corresponds to the deterministic simulation of the Minimal model (8), starting in
             1961Q3. The model has been estimated over 1960-2014 using 80-quarter high-pass-filtered total
             hours.



         Let us now focus on the Minimal model and look at the size and frequency of the limit cycle.
As illustrated in Figure 6, the deterministic forecast for the Minimal model displays a cycle whose
frequency and amplitude is close to the ones observed in the data. Figure 6 also displays 95%
confidence bands around the deterministic forecast, and shows that after 60 quarters, the confidence
bands have the same amplitude as the deterministic cycle. Panel (a) of Figure 7 compares the
deterministic forecast of the Minimal model to the AR(2) and linear model, while panel (b) compares
the deterministic forecast of the Intermediate, Full and LASSO models.

Other Labor Market Variables

We now explore the robustness of the results we obtained using total hours to using other la-
bor market variables instead. In particular, we examine the behavior implied by estimating our
Minimal model using, sequentially, non-farm business hours, the job finding rate and the rate of
unemployment. For each of these variables, we report in Figure 8 the deterministic forecast path in
(xt , Xt )-space, as well as xt over time, where x is the variable under consideration and X its accumu-
lated level (defined as before by Xt ≡ δ ∞               i

the job finding rate, and finally panels (e) and (f) correspond to the rate of unemployment. In all
three cases, we start the forecast from 1961Q3. As is clear from these figures, a limit cycle appears
in all three cases, and these cycles have durations close to 9 years, with amplitudes similar to the
actual data.

How Significant Are Limit Cycles?

Up to now, we have checked for the existence of limit cycles using only the models’ point estimates.
Beyond the either/or results implied by these point estimates, it is of interest to use the sampling
variability to quantify how strongly the data support the presence of instability and limit cycles. To
do so, we derive estimated parameter distributions for the Minimal, Intermediate and Full models
using a bootstrap procedure. For each bootstrapped data set, we check for the existence of a
limit cycle, which we define as meeting the following conditions: (i) starting in the simulation
period corresponding to 1961Q3,20 the deterministic simulation of the nonlinear model estimated
on this data set converges to a limit cycle; and (ii ) the Wald test rejects the linear model against
  20
     One could repeat the deterministic simulation starting from all dates of the sample. This would make the
convergence to a limit cycle unchanged or more frequent.

        80-quarter high-pass filter before estimation. See Appendix B for details of samples and variable
        definitions. A ? indicates that in more than half of replications, simulation was explosive. In
        such cases, we re-drew bootstrap innovations until we obtained 1,000 non-explosive replications.



the nonlinear one at 5%. Results are displayed in Table 4. As can be seen from the table, the
detection of limit cycles ranges mainly between 50 and 78%. This indicates that the null hypothesis
of the absence of limit cycles in the data cannot be rejected at conventional levels of significance.
Nonetheless, a person with a diffuse prior would in most cases infer that limit cycles are more likely
than not.
       Next, rather than focusing on our holistic definition of a limit cycle, we consider how strong
the results are with regard specifically to the local instability that we have identified. To this end,
we have computed—for the Linear and Minimal models estimated on Total Hours—the bootstrap
distribution of the maximum eigenvalue. For the Minimal model, this eigenvalue is computed for the
linear approximation at the steady state.21 Figure 9 plots the PDF for the bootstrap distributions.
As can be seen, the distribution is almost entirely below one for the linear model. In contrast,
allowing for a single cubic term in the estimation shifts this distribution significantly to the right,
with 79% of the mass now being concentrated above 1. Again, this pattern is insufficient to reject
the null hypothesis of stability at conventional levels of significance. Nonetheless, the results do
clearly suggest that local instability is a relevant possibility.
       Finally, as one further check on the strength of our results, we attempt to answer the following
question. Suppose the DGP is indeed stable and linear. Accounting for parameter uncertainty, how
likely are we to erroneously conclude that the steady state is unstable simply by allowing for nonlin-
earities in the estimation? To answer this question, for total hours we have computed a bootstrap
  21
       We checked that this steady state was unique in each of our bootstrap replications.

distribution for the maximum eigenvalue of each nonlinear model estimated on data generated by
either the AR(2) or Linear model, where we account for uncertainty in the parameters of the latter
models. Table 5 reports instability p-values from these bootstrap distributions associated with the
actual observed maximum eigenvalues (i.e., those reported in Table 3). The results suggest that,
accounting for sampling variability, we are unlikely to see the magnitude of instability we have
observed in the data for the nonlinear models if the true DGP is one of the linear models. For
example, if the true DGP were the Linear model, we would obtain maximum eigenvalues for the
Intermediate and Full models at least as great the ones we observed in the data less than 15% of
the time, and less than 2% of the time for the Minimal model.

Multiplicity of Steady States

Since we are examining dynamics in a nonlinear framework, we need to recognize the potential for
a multiplicity of attractors in the system. First, let us note that all the estimated equations are
backward-looking, so that there is (trivially) never indeterminacy in the solution to our equations.22
 22
      This does not mean that micro-founded models capable of generating limit cycles never feature indeterminacy.

       Notes: In this table, the DGP is either the (stable) AR(2) or Linear model, with parameters
       drawn from a bootstrapped distribution. For each of 10,000 parameter draws, a new data set was
       generated (again via bootstrap), and the nonlinear models were estimated on this data, yielding
       a distribution for the maximum eigenvalue for each nonlinear model when the DGP is linear
       and stable. Table reports instability p-values – i.e. the probability for maximum eigenvalues of
       nonlinear models estimated on actual data (see Table 3) to be larger than one in modulus .



In contrast, we do need to check for the existence of multiple steady states or multiple limit cycles
for our estimated models. Consider first the case of multiple steady states, and focus on the Minimal
model when shocks are turned off:

                            ht = β0 + βh ht−1 + βh0 ht−2 + βH Ht−1 + βh3 h3t−1 ,

                           Ht = (1 − δ)Ht−1 + δht .

Estimation typically gives β0 very close to zero, βh larger than one, βh0 and βH negative, and βh3
negative and small. Assume for simplicity that β0 is exactly zero, such that h = 0 is a steady state.
Non-zero steady states of the Minimal model, if they exist, are the two opposite real numbers h
and −h, with23                                s
                                                  1 − βh − βh0 − βH
                                         h=                         ,
                                                         βh3
Restricting to the case where βh3 < 0, we have multiplicity of steady states if and only if

                                             βh + βh0 + βH > 1.                                            (13)

Therefore, although the model is nonlinear, it can generically be in a parameter configuration with
a unique steady state.
  23
     This analysis can be extended to the Intermediate model when β0 = 0. Non-zero steady states, if they exist,
are the two opposite real numbers ±h with
                                         s
                                                   1 − βh − βh0 − βH
                                    h=                                        .
                                            βh3 + βh03 + βH 3 + βh2 H + βhH 2



                                                      27
   Note that, as βH approaches zero, the condition for local instability of the zero steady state is,

                                                βh + βh0 > 1.                                      (14)

Thus, for βH close to zero, (13) and (14) coincide: the occurrence of limit cycles, which requires
local instability, necessarily implies multiplicity of steady states. However, when the economy has a
longer memory (i.e., βH is negative but not arbitrarily close to zero), the two conditions no longer
coincide, and in particular it is possible for the steady state to be both unique and locally unstable.
This is typically what the data will suggest in the Minimal model.
   In the case of multiplicity, the question is whether the non-zero steady states are stable or
unstable when the zero steady state is unstable. Taking a first-order Taylor expansion of (8)
around h, we have the following dynamics (omitting constant terms):
                                            2
                           ht = (βh + 3h βh3 ) ht−1 + βh0 ht−2 + βH Ht−1 .                         (15)
                                 |   {z    }
                                       βh


Note that the same equation holds for the local dynamics around −h. As we are looking at situations
where βh3 < 0, we will have β h < βh , such that it is possible that the two non-zero steady states
are stable when the zero steady state is unstable. In such a case, although there exists a limit cycle
in the neighborhood of zero, it would be possible to have trajectories that would start close (but
not arbitrarily close) to zero and converge to h or −h. The same argument can also be made for
the Intermediate and Full models. The occurrence of additional, attractive steady states depends
ultimately on the parameters of the model. Our findings suggest, however, that such a situation is
unlikely to be relevant. In particular, given the coefficients as estimated on total hours, the Minimal
and Intermediate models both feature unique steady states. Moreover, while there are three steady
states for the Full model (located at h = −0.77, 0.22, and 1.23), all three of these steady states
are locally unstable, which implies that the system cannot converge to a steady state in any of our
models estimated on total hours.
   Note that, for the Full model, it is in principle possible that two or even all three of the steady
states could be surrounded by distinct attractive limit cycles. It is not possible to prove analytically
that this is not the case, but it can be checked numerically. Figure 10 displays (in (ht , Ht )-space)
four deterministic forecasts from the Full model: two starting near the intermediate (h = 0.22)
steady state, and one each starting near the high and low steady states. Steady states are indicated

by stars in the figure. One observes that all trajectories apparently converge to the same closed
orbit, suggesting that the existence of multiple attractive limit cycles is unlikely.

The Power of Our Limit Cycle Detection Procedure

One may worry that our procedure, especially our detrending procedure, might generate spurious
limit cycles even if the DGP is actually locally stable, or alternatively that it may fail to detect a
limit cycle when there is indeed one. We investigate these issues here using Monte Carlo analysis.
First, we check that we do not spuriously find limit cycles when there are none present. To do so,
we first filter (logs of) total hours with an 80-quarter high-pass filter, so that

                                              hLt = hTt + ht

where hLt stands for levels, hTt for the trend and where ht is the cyclical component. We then
estimate an AR(2) on the filtered data. This AR(2), which is the one displayed in Table 1, will

                                                    29
serve as the DGP. We then simulate the estimated (stable) AR(2) to obtain an artificial cyclical
       ht , then add it to the actual trend series hTt to generate an artificial level series
series b

                                                 hLt = hTt + b
                                                 b           ht

By construction, these simulated level series do not feature limit cycles. We may then apply our
limit-cycle-detection procedure to these simulated series in order to verify that it does not spuriously
detect limit cycles where there are none. That is, we treat each simulated level series in the same
way we have treated the actual level series: first filter, then estimate the Minimal, Intermediate and
Full models, then check for the existence of a limit cycle. For each model and simulation, we check
for the existence of a significant limit cycle, which we define as meeting the following conditions: (i )
starting in 1961Q3,24 the deterministic simulation of the model converges to a limit cycle; (ii ) the
Wald test rejects the linear model against the nonlinear one at 5%. We perform 10,000 simulations,
and report the results in the first row of Table 6. The three models spuriously detect limit cycles
less than 5% of the time, suggesting that our procedure is highly unlikely to detect a limit cycle if
one does not exist in the DGP. The second row of Table 6 shows similar results for the case where
the DGP is the estimated Linear model instead of the AR(2).25
       Next, we test for the possibility of missing a limit cycle with our procedure when it does exist
in the data. In order to do so, we take the estimated Minimal, Intermediate or Full model as the
DGP and follow the same procedure as above. The results are displayed in the bottom three rows
of Table 6, and show that limit cycles are relatively hard to detect using our procedure. Typically,
when the estimated model is well specified (meaning that it has the same form as the DGP), our
procedure detects limit cycles about half of the time.
       From theses Monte Carlo simulations, we conclude that it is unlikely that we will spuriously
detect limit cycles, and that correctly detecting a limit cycle when one is present occurs at best
58% of the time.
  24
      One could repeat the deterministic simulation starting from all dates of the sample. This would make the
convergence to a limit cycle unchanged or more frequent.
   25
      When we set the threshold level to 1% in the Wald tests (instead of the estimated p-value), the test fails to
reject the (spurious) existence of a limit cycle 0.9% (resp. 1.5%) of the time for the Minimal model when the DGP
is the AR(2) model (resp. the Linear model), and 0.7% (resp. 1.3%) and 0.6% (reps. .8%) for the Intermediate and
Full models.

     Notes: In this table, we estimate the Minimal, Intermediate and Full models under various values
     of δ. “LC” means that the estimated model displays a limit cycle. The number in parenthesis
     indicates the fraction of the 1,000 bootstrap replications for which we found a limit cycle with the
     Linear model being rejected at 5% against the nonlinear one. All the models have been estimated
     over 1960-2014 using 80-quarter high-pass-filtered total hours.



Robustness

Here we briefly discuss the robustness of our main results. We maintain focus on the case where
our measure of activity is total hours per capita. We begin by examining the robustness of our
results with respect to our choice of δ in the computation of H and to our detrending procedure.
Recall that, in order to construct the cumulated series H, we need to make a choice for the value
of δ. Table 7 shows that a limit cycle is detected generically for the Minimal model, as long as δ
is not too large for the Intermediate and Full models, and as long as δ is also not too small in the
Intermediate model.
   Next, Table 8 considers filters other than the 80-quarter high-pass one used so far, and also
consider the model estimated with the LASSO method. Let us first note that the high-pass filter is


                                                       31
a linear filter and therefore should not spuriously introducing nonlinearities, so that in general we
should not expect to find cycles where there are none simply by choosing a particular parameter
for the filter. On the other hand, if there exists a limit cycle in the data but the filter parameter
we choose removes the frequencies associated with that cycle, our procedure would in general fail
to identify this cycle. Further, given the strong implicit restrictions imposed on the data when
estimating our three models—which are strongest in the Minimal model, and weakest in the Full
model—we should in general expect to find that our choice of filter affects our ability to identify
limit cycles even if they exist in the data, and that this sensitivity to the filter should be strongest in
the Minimal model and weakest in the Full model. The results presented in Table 8 largely support
these predictions. In particular, we report results using different high-pass filters from 100 to 50
quarters, as well as for commonly-used band-pass (6,32) and Hodrick-Prescott (λ = 1600) filters.
We also report results for when we detrend using polynomial time trends of order three, four and
five.
    Three conclusions emerge from the table. First, the detrending procedures that remove only the
lowest frequencies (i.e., the 60 quarters or more high-pass filters and the polynomial time trends)
are generally associated with limit cycles, while the procedures that also remove the middle range of
frequencies (i.e., the band-pass (6,32) and Hodrick-Prescott (λ = 1600) filters) are not. Given the
considerations discussed above, this is consistent with the view that the data features a medium-
frequency limit cycle, and that two of the most commonly-used filters in the business cycle literature
remove those frequencies by design. This in turn suggests the need to focus on fluctuations that
are longer than traditionally thought to be associated with business cycles.
    Second, the Minimal model is quite sensitive to the choice of filter, with no clear pattern to
this sensitivity, while the Intermediate and Full models are relatively insensitive. This is consistent
with the view that it may be the strong model restrictions underlying the Minimal model that drive
much of its observed sensitivity to the filter (as opposed to spurious patterns generated by the filter
itself). In particular, the fact that the more flexible specifications typically support the existence of
a medium-frequency limit cycle, while the very restrictive specification may or may not depending
on the filter used, is supportive of the hypothesis that a medium-frequency limit cycle is present in
the data but the Minimal model is too restrictive to detect it consistently. Finally, note that limit
cycles are at best only found 40% of the time when we do not filter the data.

2.5      Behavior in Other Countries

Here we extend our exploration of macroeconomic dynamics using data on the unemployment rate
in other countries.26 These results are presented in Table 9. We estimate our three models for 11
countries. As can be seen in the table, we find some evidence of limit cycles in about half of the
countries. Although this is somewhat low, interestingly this ratio is similar to the detection rate
we have found in our Monte Carlo exercise. Looking closely at each country makes it clear why we
do find limit cycles in some and not in others. As an example, let us consider Switzerland and the
Netherlands. Data and deterministic forecasts for these two countries are displayed in Figure 11.
      Switzerland and the Netherlands both have marked low-frequency dynamics. In the case of
Switzerland, (Figure 11, panels (a) and (c)), there appears to have been a change of regime around
1990, there was almost zero unemployment in the 70’s and 80’s, but a 3.5% average since 1990.
Besides this low-frequency variation, what emerges from Figure 11(c) is the big recession of 1991-
1993, and the progressive recovery from 1993 to 2000. Instead of a relatively regular cycle, as we
have observed in the U.S., we see one big cycle and four smaller ones, which is a pattern that

Notes: In this table, we estimate the Minimal (8), Intermediate (9) and Full (7) models, con-
sidering various labor market variables. “LC” means that the estimated model displays a limit
cycle. The number in parenthesis indicates the fraction of the 1,000 bootstrap replications for
which we found a limit cycle with the Linear model being rejected at 5% against the nonlin-
ear one. Data are always detrended with an 80-quarter high-pass filter before estimation. See
Appendix B for details of samples and variable definitions. A star (?) means indicates that in
more than half of the replications, the simulation with bootstrap innovations was explosive, so
that the pseudo-data sample could not be used for estimation. In this case, we have drawn again
bootstrap innovations until we obtained 1,000 non-explosive replications.

       Notes: Unemployment rate is observed over the sample 1970:Q1-2014:Q4. Unemployment rate is
       measured as “Registered Unemployment Rate” for Switzerland and as “Harmonized Unemploy-
       ment Rate: All Persons” for the Netherlands. The H series is constructed assuming N = 20,
       so that estimation starts in 1975Q2. The trend of these series is obtained by removing from the
       level series its filtered component, where the filter is an 80-quarter high-pass filter. The cyclical
       component is expressed in percentage deviation from the level series. Deterministic forecasts are
       done starting from 1975Q1, with the estimated AR(2) (11) and Minimal (8) models.

cannot be easily captured by our reduced-form models. Hence, the Minimal model estimated on
this data does not exhibit a limit cycle, and the dynamics of forecasted unemployment as of 1975
are not very different from the ones obtained with an AR(2) model.27 Things are very different
for the Netherlands (Figure 11, panels (b) and (d)). The low-frequency dynamics feature a marked
increase from the early 70’s to the late 80’s, followed by a prolonged decline through to the early
2000’s. The key determinants of those trend movements are the first and second oil shocks, followed
by important labor market reforms in the 90’s. Fluctuations around this trend, however, have been
very regular—and in particular we do not observe one big cycle dwarfing the others, as was the case
for Switzerland—and thus the estimated Minimal model features a limit cycle.

2.6      Quantity Variables
Difficulties

We now turn to the estimation of our nonlinear reduced-form equation using quantity variables.
Before performing this exercise, we want to highlight the added difficulties associated with quantity
variables. To this end, consider the simple case in which output is given by yt = θt + ht , where θ is
TFP, and in which hours follows as before a process of the type

                        ht = a0 + a1 ht−1 + a2 ht−2 + a3 Ht + F (ht−1 , ht−2 , Ht−1) + t            (16)

In such a case, the dynamic equation for output y is given by
                                                       ∞
                                                       X
                      yt = a0 + a1 yt−1 + a2 yt−1 + a3   (1 − δ)j−1 (yt−j − θt−j ) + t
                                                         j=1
                                                               ∞
                                                                                          !
                                                               X                                     (17)
                           +F      yt−1 − θt−1 , yt−2 − θt−2 ,   (1 − δ)j−1 (yt−j − θt−j )
                                                               j=1

                           + θt − a1 θt−1 − a2 θt−2 − a3 + t

If we had a good measure of θt , then the estimation of (17) would not be any more difficult than
our estimation of (16) using hours worked. However, in the absence of a good measure of θ, the
estimation of (17) becomes difficult. Simply using a filtered measure of yt as a representation of
yt −θt is unlikely to perform well. This can be seen in practice by running a Monte Carlo experiment
as follows. We take our estimates of the Minimal, Intermediate or Full model obtained when run on
 27
      A similar pattern is found using the Intermediate and Full models (not shown in the Figure).

the 80-quarter high-pass filtered total hours series. As shown previously, all three of these estimated
models feature a limit cycle. We then use this estimated model to create an artificial cyclical series
of hours, to which we add the log of labor productivity taken from the data. This gives us a log-level
series for artificial output. We then treat this level series in the same way we will treat the actual
level series of output: filter, estimate the Minimal, Intermediate, and Full models, then check for
the occurrence of a significant limit cycle. We perform 10,000 simulations, and report in Table
10 the percentage of simulations for which a limit cycle is (correctly) detected. The three models
hardly detect limit cycles in these simulated output series, even if by construction they contain
limit cycle forces. Detection rates are around 15% when the estimated model embeds these DGP
specifications. Despite this low detection rate, we nonetheless proceed and examine whether our
procedure detects limit cycle in the actual quantity data. As we will see, the detection rate is much
lower when using quantity variables than when using labor market variables—as could be expected
given the Monte Carlo exercise.

Estimation Results

We estimate the three models (7), (8) and (9) on output, total consumption, durable goods expen-
ditures, fixed investment, various components of investment, and the capacity utilization rate. Each
of these variables is again first detrended using an 80-quarter high-pass filter. Estimation results
are summarized in Table 11. While we do not find much evidence of limit cycles using the minimal
model, interestingly, we find a limit cycles detected at a frequency of over 50% using all variables
except Equipment Investment.

     cycle with the Linear model being rejected at 5% against the nonlinear one. Data are always
     detrended with an 80-quarter high-pass filter before estimation. See Appendix B for details of
     samples and variable definitions. A star (?) means indicates that in more than half of the
     replications, the simulation with bootstrap innovations was explosive, so that the pseudo-data
     sample could not be used for estimation. In this case, we have drawn again bootstrap innovations
     until we obtained 1,000 non-explosive replications.



3    Should we care?
The previous section explored whether cyclical movements in macroeconomic variables exhibited
characteristics suggestive of local instability and limit cycles. In this section we examine whether
one should care about identifying/differentiating such a possibility. There are at least two poten-
tial reasons why one might care. First, it is possible that it could lead to improved forecasting
ability. Second, it is possible that policy changes could have differing effects on stable and locally
unstable/limit cycle models. Our explorations suggest that, for forecasting purposes, differentiat-
ing between the two cases is likely of second-order importance. This is most easily observed by
recognizing that the variance of the one-step-ahead forecast error for the Linear model is almost
identical to that for any of the nonlinear models. However, as we argue in this section, we believe
that, for policy purposes, identifying whether macroeconomic dynamics may contain limit cycles
forces can be of first-order importance. In particular, we discuss how a policy aimed at countering
the effects of shocks can lead to very different outcomes depending on whether the model exhibits
limit cycles, even though the two models are similar in terms of standard forecast performance.

3.1       Theoretical Results

The goal of stabilization policy is to reduce inefficient macroeconomic volatility. In practice, this
is often equated to the goal of reducing the cyclical volatility of output and employment. One
stabilization approach is to direct policy towards countering or nullifying the impact of certain
exogenous forces hitting the economy. In linear models, such a strategy will generally be effective,
as a reduction in the variance of exogenous shocks translates directly in to a reduction in the
variance of endogenous variables. However, in an environment where limit cycle forces may be
present, this strategy may no longer be effective. In particular, in this section we will show that
when limit cycle forces are present, (i) a reduction in the variance of shocks may actually increase
the variance of endogenous variables; (ii) even if reducing the variance of shocks reduces the variance
of the outcomes, the relationship between the shock variance and outcome variance is likely to be
quite weak; and (iii) the principal effect of reducing the shock variance is likely to dampen higher-
frequency movements while accentuating longer cyclical movements (whereas such a change in the
shape of the spectrum would not arise in a linear model).
       In order to look at these issues, we will focus again on a univariate setup.28 For example, consider
an environment where the dynamics of a state variable of interest xt may we written as

                                            xt = F (xt−1 , xt−2 , . . . ) + t

where t is an exogenous shock with variance σ2 . If the function F (·) is linear and is such that
x is stationary,29 then the variance of x will be strictly increasing in the variance of . However,
if the function F (·) is nonlinear, then the link between the variance of x,30 denoted σx2 , and the
variance of  may be much more complicated. In particular, even in the case where F (·) is such that
σx2 exists and is finite, σx2 will not necessarily be an increasing function of σ2 . More to the point,
when F (·) is such that the deterministic system xt = F (xt−1 , xt−2 , . . . ) admits a limit cycle, then
σx2 will often be decreasing in σ2 over some range. To illustrate this point, consider an order-three
  28
      In this section we will be discussing the effects of changes in shock variances on the variances of endogenous
variables. Accordingly, results from this section needs to be interpreted cautiously given the potential for the Lucas
Critique to apply.
   29
      That is, the roots of the polynomial 1 − F (λ, λ2 , . . . ) lie outside the unit circle.
   30
      With some abuse of terminology,Pwe define the mean and variance         PTof x by time2 averages rather than ensemble
                                         T
averages, i.e., by µx ≡ plimT →∞ T1 t=1 xt and σx2 ≡ plimT →∞ T1 t=1 (xt − µx ) , respectively, assuming these
probability limits exist and are independent of the initial state x0 . Thus, according to our definition, we will have
σx2 > 0 even in a non-stochastic environment as long as the system does not converge to a single point.

data-generating process similar to those we have estimated in section 2, but in which we remove
both the accumulation and the second autoregressive terms for analytical tractability:

                                     xt = −βx xt−1 + βx3 x3t−1 + t ,                              (18)

                                              1 < βx < 2,                                          (R1 )

and

one may verify that when σ2 = 0 the system (18) possesses a limit cycle of period two31 in which x
                                         q
alternates between x̄ and −x̄, where x̄ ≡ ββx −1
                                              3
                                                 . Moreover, this 2-cycle attracts all orbits for which
                                                x

0 < |x0 | < 1. Now consider an increase in σ2 . How does this affect the variance of x? Proposition
1 indicates that an increase in σ2 can lead to a decrease in σx2 .

Proposition 1. If the random variable xt evolves according to equation (18) with restrictions R1
and R2 , then the variance of xt will be decreasing in σ2 when σ2 is sufficiently small.

Proof. See Appendix C.

      The intuition for Proposition 1 reflects the nature of the nonlinear forces generating the limit
cycle. Near the limit cycle, a shock that moves x outside of the cycle (i.e., so that |xt | > x̄) is
countered by stronger forces pushing it back towards the cycle than is a shock that moves x inside
the cycle (i.e., so that |xt | < x̄). Hence, shocks that move x inwards are more persistent, and
therefore, on average, for σ2 sufficiently small the system spends more time inside the cycle than
outside of it. This effect causes the overall variance of x to be decreasing in σ2 . Although the scope
of Proposition 1 is quite limited, since it covers only a small class of data-generating processes that
support limit cycles, it nevertheless makes clear that the relationship between shock variance and
output variance can be negative when the underlying data-generating process admits a limit cycle.

3.2      Illustrating the effects of changes in shock variance

Proposition 1 suggests that, in models featuring limit cycles, there may be a more complicated
relationship between shock variance and outcome variance than the simple positive one usually
 31
      See May [1979].


                                                    40
encountered in stable models. To follow up on this, we have explored numerically whether this
feature may arise in the richer environments of the previous section. In all cases we found that,
for small values of σ2 , an increase in the shock variance has either a small but noticeable negative
effect or no discernible effect at all on output variance, while for larger values the effect is positive
but substantially weaker than in a linear environment. In this sense, a robust take-away appears to
be that, in environments that support limit cycles of the size we believe may be in macroeconomic
data, the link between shock variance and outcome variance is likely to be very muted relative to its
linear counterpart. To illustrate this, in panel (a) of Figure 12 we plot the relationship between σ
and σx for the Intermediate and the Linear models as estimated on total hours worked per capita.32
As was shown in the previous section, in the absence of shocks the Intermediate model exhibits
limit cycles. On the contrary, the estimated linear model has a stable steady state, so that when
σ = 0 we have σx = 0.
       The are two notable features that emerge from panel (a) of Figure 12. The first is that, as in
the simple example of Proposition 1, the relationship between σ and σx is actually negative for low
values of σ . Let us stress again, however, that this is not the pattern we think is most relevant.
The second—and, we believe, more important—feature that emerges from the figure is the extent
to which the relationship between σ and σx is much weaker in the case of the nonlinear model as
compared to the Linear model. For example, increasing σ from 0.1 to 0.5 causes σx to increase
by 400% in the Linear model, while it increases by only 62% in the Intermediate model. The fact
that the plotted relationship has a non-zero intercept for the limit cycle model is not surprising,
but the fact that the slope of this relationship is so much weaker on average is telling. This result
is further documented in panel (b) of the same Figure. Taking into account sample uncertainty,
we plot the bootstrap distribution of the slope of σh (σ ), evaluated for the observed level σ ≈ 0.6,
together with the slope point estimate for the Linear model. This panel shows that the slope is
lower in the intermediate model at any level of significance. This pattern suggests that stabilization
policy aimed at mitigating the effects of shocks may be of more limited value than suggested by
estimation of the Linear model. The goal of stabilization policy in such a case may instead be to
focus on identifying and mitigating the underlying forces that generate and sustain limit cycles.33

     Estimated parameters are given in Table 1.

     In our previous work (Beaudry, Galizia, and Portier [2015b]) we presented a structural model where limit
cycles arose as the result of a complementarity in consumption decisions generated by imperfect unemployment

     Notes: For each model, we derive parameter distributions by bootstrapping with 1,000 replica-
     tions. Then, for each value of σ , we simulate Ttot = Tbrn + T periods of data, with Tbrn = 1,000
     and T = 100,000.                                Tbrn periods of data, we compute σh2 as the time

     point estimates in panel (a). In panel (b), we report the bootstrap distribution of the slope of
     σh (σ ), evaluated for the observed level σ ≈ 0.6, for the Intermediate model. For the Linear
     one, we report the slope at the point estimates for the parameters. For both models, the slope is
     computed as [σh (0.7) − σh (0.5)] /0.2.



   To further emphasize how changes in input volatility affect outcome behavior in models with
or without limit cycles, in Figure 13 we plot the spectrum of the outcome variable x for several
different values of σ . Panel (a) shows spectra for the Intermediate nonlinear specification, while
panel (b) shows spectra for the Linear one. For the Linear model, panel (b) illustrates that the effect
of changing the volatility of  is very simple: a fall (rise) in σ decreases (increases) the spectrum
substantially and uniformly. In contrast, as shown in panel (a), the effect of changing σ in the
model that features a limit cycle is primarily to change the shape of the spectrum. In particular,
a fall in σ decreases the importance of higher frequencies and accentuates the importance of lower
frequencies, while a rise in σ does the reverse. For example, as we can see in the Figure, when
we reduce σ by a third, from 0.84 (dotted line) to 0.56 (solid line)—where the latter is the value
insurance. In that framework, the policy prescription to help stabilize the economy would therefore be to reduce
the complementarity in agents’ decisions by improving consumption insurance through, for example, automatic
stabilizers.

          data sets.



estimated for the data—the spectrum at periodicities below 40 quarters decreases substantially,
while the importance of periodicities above 40 quarters increases substantially. Such observations
are interesting, as they provide a potentially different perspective on how a reduction in shock
volatility—such as is often thought to have arisen during the period of the great moderation—can
affect the economy. If the underlying system exhibits limit cycles, a great moderation in input
volatility would result in a less volatile economy in the short term, but would tend to increase the
importance of the lower-frequency movements associated with cycles lasting around 10 years.
      In summary, much of the focus of traditional macroeconomic stabilization policy is based on
the view that fluctuations are primarily driven by shocks. If instead limit cycle forces play an
important part in generating fluctuations, this warrants a rethinking of how best to conduct policy.
In particular, in this section we have emphasized that aiming to counter or to nullify shocks to
the macroeconomy is likely to be much less effective at reducing economic volatility if limit cycles
are present.34 Such policies may somewhat reduce volatility, but the main effect may be to simply
 34
      More precisely, a reduction in input volatility may have very little impact on the the overall volatility of the



                                                             43
change the frequency at which fluctuations arise, with higher-frequency movements being dampened
by the policy at the cost of amplifying lower-frequency movements. As a consequence, in such a
case it could be best to de-emphasize a framework focused on countering shocks and move towards
a stabilization framework that aims to reduce the forces that may be causing the limit cycles.
For example, in our previous work (Beaudry, Galizia, and Portier [2015b]), we have emphasized
the role of strategic complements in producing limit cycles. An effective stabilization policy in
such a situation is one that reduces these complementarities. If the complementarity is related
to precautionary saving associated with unemployment risk as in Beaudry, Galizia, and Portier
[2015a] and [2015b], then policy should focus on mitigating the effect of unemployment risk on
individuals by offering better unemployment insurance. Policies aimed at countering shocks in such
an environment will not in general be hitting the important margins.


4     Conclusion
The first aim of this paper has been to examine whether fluctuations in macroeconomic aggre-
gates may be best described as reflecting the effects of shocks to an otherwise stable system, or
whether such fluctuations may instead—to a large extent—reflect an underlying instability in the
macroeconomy which repeatedly gives rise to sustained boom and bust phenomena. To examine
this question we have proposed a simple nonlinear time series framework that has the potential to
capture instability and limit cycle behavior if it is present in the data. The framework we adopted
was motivated by previous work that emphasized the role of strategic complementarities in creating
local instability in environments with accumulated goods. We first focused on the behavior of labor
market variables, and especially the behavior of total hours worked per capita, and found intriguing
evidence in favor of the view that the macroeconomy may be locally unstable and produce limit cy-
cle forces. For example, we found that aggregate labor market variables often indicate the presence
of forces that favor recurrent business cycles with a duration of close to 9 years and an amplitude
of 4-5%. When looking at aggregate output measures, we found less robust evidence.
    One of the main challenges in this endeavor was to find a powerful tool for identifying local
instability if it is present. As we showed using Monte Carlo methods, the approach we adopted
is not very powerful, and this is especially true when looking at output measures. This suggests
system when the deterministic version of the system exhibits limit cycles.


                                                        44
that it would be fruitful in future work to develop a more powerful method. Given this difficulty,
it is interesting that we have been able to find as much evidence supporting the notion of local
instability and limit cycles as we have. Moreover, even when we have not found local instability,
we have almost always found that the system is very close to being unstable.35 This suggests to us
that the macroeconomy should be viewed as either locally unstable or very close to being locally
unstable.
      In the second section of the paper, we have briefly examined what the presence of local instability
and limit cycle forces could imply in terms of stabilization policy. Our main observation on this
front is that stabilization policy aimed at countering the shocks hitting the economy may turn out
to be very ineffective at stabilizing the economy. In particular, we have shown that a reduction in
shock variances may have little effect on overall macroeconomic volatility if the economy is locally
unstable. Since this analysis was performed using a reduced-form model, more structural analysis is
necessary before coming to clear policy implications, but we nevertheless believe that these insights
are highly suggestive of why the presence of locally instability may matter for policy.

      For most cases we found the modulus of the largest eigenvalue of the estimated system to be very close to 1.

Appendix
A      Motivation for Baseline Specification
Consider the following demand-driven macroeconomic environment with two aggregate variables: per capita
output denoted yt , and per capita capital denoted kt . These variables are the result of individual-level
decisions by agents i = 1 to n, with n large. The capital stock of each agent i accumulates according to
a standard accumulation equation, with depreciation rate δ, where we assume that a fixed fraction γ of
agent i’s purchases today, denoted yit , contributes to his capital stock tomorrow as follows:

                                kit+1 = (1 − δ)kit + γyit ,      0 < γ < 1 − δ.

For ease of discussion, we want to think of agent i’s capital stock as his holding of durable goods (including
possibly housing) for which he receives utility directly. Output in this economy is assumed to be demand-
determined,   so that per capita output is simply the average of thePindividual-level purchases, i.e., yt =
n−1 i yit . This implies that the per capita capital stock, kt ≡ n−1 i kit , accumulates according to
    P

                                           kt+1 = (1 − δ)kt + γyt .                                     (A.1)

    To begin, consider the case where individual output demands are allowed to be affected by only three
forces as follows:
                                     yit = α0 − α1 kit + α2 yit−1 + it .                          (A.2)
In equation (A.2), output demand is allowed to be affected by the agent’s holding of consumer capital.
In particular, let us focus on the case where α1 > 0, which implies that more consumer capital leads to
less desire for new purchases, as would be the case, for example, in the presence of diminishing marginal
utility. Output demand is also allowed to exhibit inertia through α2 ≥ 0, where this force may reflect
for example habit or adjustment costs. Finally, we allow a random idiosyncratic term it , which may be
correlated across agents but is i.i.d. across time. A decision rule of the form given in (A.2) can be derived
from individual-level optimization, in which case the coefficients α1 and α2 will typically be smaller than
1. Aggregating equation (A.2), we may obtain

                                       yt = α0 − α1 kt + α2 yt−1 + t ,                                 (A.3)

where t ≡ n−1 i it . Under the assumption that α1 and α2 are smaller than 1, equations (A.1) and (A.3)
                P
form a simple stable linear dynamic system. It is interesting to recognize that in this case if α2 and 1−δ are
close to 1, then the roots of this system can be very close to 1, while nonetheless staying stable. We take
equations (A.1) and (A.3) as a simple representation of basic forces that could be driving macroeconomic
fluctuations.
    Now let us slightly extend the above system by introducing an additional term in the determination
of individual-level demand. Here we want to add the possibility that agents’ expectations about other
agents’ decisions may affect their own behavior. Such interaction effects can arise for many reasons. It
is not our goal to take a stand on one particular reason here, but instead to argue that such interactions
can drastically change the dynamics of the system, even if the effects remain small and close to linear. To
capture such an effect, let us generalize the individual decision rule as follows
                                                                    e
                                 yit = α0 − α1 kit + α2 yit−1 + G (yit ) + it ,                        (A.4)
        e is agent i’s expectation about aggregate economic activity, and the function G(·) captures how
where yit
this expectation affects his behavior. If G0 is positive, agents’ individual-level demands play the role of

                                                       47
strategic complements, while if it is negative they play the role of strategic substitutes. Let us start with
the extreme case where all agents base their expectations only on the past realization of yt , and that this
expectation is simply backward-looking with yite =y
                                                    t−1 . In this case, the aggregate determination of output
is given by
                                 yt = α0 − α1 kt + α2 yt−1 + G (yt−1 ) + t .                           (A.5)
How does the introduction of the strategic interaction term G (yt−1 ) affect the dynamic system? This
depends on whether, near the steady state of the system, actions are strategic substitutes or complements. If
they are strategic substitutes, then the system will tend to maintain stability and nothing very interesting is
likely to happen. However, if they are strategic complements, then the dynamics may change considerably.
In particular, consider the case where α2 and 1 − δ are close to 1. Then one may show that even a small
degree of strategic complementarity near the steady state can render the system locally unstable.36 In such
a case, the global properties will depend on the nature of the nonlinearities in G(·). If the complementarities
grow as the system moves away from its steady state, then it will tend to exhibit global instability, in which
case the system will explode. In contrast, if the complementarities die out as the system moves away from
the steady state, then the system will tend to produce either a limit cycle or chaotic behavior. Again,
all this can arise even if the system remains close to linear and complementarities are rather weak. For
example, suppose that G takes the form G(y) = µ0 +µ1 y +µ2 y 3 . Then (A.5) can be re-written in univariate
form using (A.1) to eliminate kt . Moreover, if we close the model by assuming that yt = ht , where ht is
hours worked per capita, then we can write the determination of hours as a univariate process in ht as
                                          ∞
                                          X
                    ht = a0 + µ0 − a1 γ         (1 − δ)j−1 ht−j + (a2 + µ1 ) ht−1 + µ2 h3t−1 + t .            (A.6)
                                          j=1

Equation (A.6) is a special case of the type of univariate time series model we estimate in section 2. We
emphasize here the possibility interpreting this model as one determining hours worked, as opposed to
determining output, as the formulation in terms of hours work can be shown to being more robust to
allowing for fluctuations in productivity (see section 2.6). Note also that (A.6) features the presence of an
accumulation term, which motivates our inclusion of such a term in our econometric specification.

       C      Proof of Proposition 1
       Assume that σ2 is small, so that |x0 | is close to x̄. Without loss of generality, take x0 close to x̄,37
       and define
                                                   yt ≡ (−1)t xt − x̄
       To understand yt , note that, since x0 is close to x̄ and σ2 is small, we should have xt > 0 for t even
       and xt < 0 for t odd, i.e., the sign of xt should switch every period.38 Thus, |yt | captures the absolute
       deviation of xt from the non-stochastic sequence x̄t ≡ (−1)t x̄ (the 2-cycle), while sgn (yt ) captures
       the direction of that deviation relative to zero: if yt < 0 then xt is “inside” the 2-cycle (i.e., |xt | < x̄),
       while if yt > 0 then xt is “outside” the 2-cycle (i.e., |xt | > x̄).
       Next, it is straightforward to verify that
                                                   p                     2               3
                          yt = (3 − 2βx ) yt−1 − 3 (βx + 1) (βx − 1)yt−1    − (βx + 1) Yt−1 + νt
  37
    It is straightforward to extend the following reasoning to the case where x0 is close to −x̄.
  38
    This stems from the fact that, with x0 close to x̄ and σ2 small, the dynamic behavior of xt is dominated by the
same forces that generate the 2-cycle.

                                                          49
where νt ≡ (−1)t t ∼ i.i.d. N 0, σ2 . Since (3 − 2βx ) ∈ (−1, 1), the fixed point of this system at
                                      

yt = 0 is stable, and thus for σ2 small we may restrict attention to the second-order approximation
to this system,                                  p                   2
                         yt ≈ (3 − 2βx ) yt−1 − 3 (βx + 1) (βx − 1)yt−1  + νt                    (C.1)
yt is clearly stationary, so that we have
                                                         p
                         E [yt ] ≈ (3 − 2βx ) E [yt ] − 3 (βx + 1) (βx − 1)E yt2
                                                                             

                                      3  
                                 = − E yt2
                                     2x̄

For σ2 > 0, we will have E yt2 > 0, and thus E [yt ] < 0. Since xt = (−1)t (yt + x̄), we may obtain
                                


                                        σx2 = E yt2 + 2x̄E [yt ] + x̄2
                                                  

                                            ≈ x̄2 − 2E yt2
                                                         


where we have used the approximation from above to replace E [yt ]. Thus, as σ2 increases from zero,
xt becomes less volatile, which completes the proof.
