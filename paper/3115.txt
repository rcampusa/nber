                  AlL THEORY AND THE AILING PHILLIPS CURVE:
                A CONTRACT BASED APPROACH TO AGGREGATE SUPPLY


                                  ABSTRACT

This paper presents empirical evidence from U.S. data of a
structurally stable aggregate supply relationship between real and
nominal rates of interest and the rate of unemployment.            The paper
reviews theories of contracts that are based on the twin assumptions

of asymmetric information and limited collateral and it argues that
these theories (referred to as A.I.L. theories) provide a strong
theoretical foundation for a contract—based theory of aggregate
supply.   It is suggested that the original Phillips curve estimates
should be reinterpreted in the light of A.I.L. theories which
represent alternatives to the Phelps—Friedman interpretation of the
Phillips relationship.

Introduction

     My focus in this paper is the role of certain recent microeconomic

contract-based theories in helping us to understand the theory of aggregate

supply. Typically, these theories are viewed as part of a search for the

underpinnings of Keynesian explanations of the Phillips curve. Contract

theories are supposed to explain why prices are sticky and thereby help us

understand why unemployment may temporarily deviate from its 'natural rate'

I shall argue that this view of the role of contract theories is fallacious.

Contract theories do not justify the status quo;   instead they provide a

powerful alternative to both Neo-Keynesian and New-Classical theories of

aggregate supply.

     The group of theories that I am referring to is a subset of the class

of all contract theories that takes, as its starting point, two important

premises. The first of these premises is that contracts are written between

parties who are asymmetrically informed about the state of the world. The

second premise is that agents have limited access to collateral. To differ-

entiate the members of this class of theories from more familiar insurance-

based approaches to contract theory I shall refer to them as Asymmetric

Information limited Liquidity theories or AlL theories in short.1

     The most prominent feature that separates AlL theories from both Neo-

Keynesian and New-Classical theories of aggregate supply is that AlL

theories deny the utility of the concept of the natural rate of unemploy-

ment. According to standard popular approaches to macroeconomics, cyclical

variability of the level of economic activity is due either to intertemporal

substitution of leisure or to sticky prices of one kind or another. In

either case, short run fluctuations in employment occur mainly as a result

of the failure of agents to perfectly forecast future economic conditions.

The long run upward movements in unemployment rates that have occurred in
                                       2




both the U.S. and Europe in recent years are perceived to be due to

structural adjustment problems or as due to hysteresis effects that have

altered the natural rate. The AlL contract-based alternative, on the other

hand, explains both cyclical and long-run movements in the unemployment rate

as rationally anticipated fluctuations in an equilibriujii rate of unernploy-

ment that are caused by movements in real and nominal interest rates. The

advantage of this approach is that it unifies a theory of short run

fluctuations in employment with a theory of long term movements in the level

of economic activity.

     I have argued elsewhere2 that a contract theory based on asymmetric

information and limited collateral has strong theoretical claims to be given

serious consideration a a replacement to the Phelps-Friedman theory of the

expectations-augmented Phillips curve.     I briefly review this argument in

section (3) of this paper. The main contribution of this work is, howeVer,

empirical. In section (6) I present estimates of an AlL based theory of

supply from U.S. annual time series data. The relationship not only fits

well- it also remains structurally stable over the entire post-war sample

period. A researcher who had estimated an AlL based equation using only

pre-war data would not go far wrong if he or she applied the same parametric

model to post-war data from 1946 up to the present day.

1. Related Literature

     A number of authors have been concerned with the effects of collateral

on macroeconomic theory, and with the role of informational asymmetries in

te theory of financial intermediation. I view the present work as comple-

mentary to this literature. One of the earliest theoretical pieces on the

theory of financial intermediation is the work by Stiglitz and Weiss (1981)

on credit rationing. Mark Certler and Ben Bernanke (1987) have made a

number of important contributions and papers by Bruce Smith (1983), Steve
                                        3




Wiliamson (1986), Creenwald and Stiglitz (1986), and Fazzari, Hubbard and

Peterson (1987) have explored both theoretical and empirical implications of

theories of imperfect financial intermediation. This literature is

comprehensively surveyed in the paper by Mark Gertler (1988).

     My difference is one of emphasis. Most of the work that I cite above

is concerned with the implications of informational assymetries for the

theory of aggregate demand and it is my impression that these authors have

in mind a fairly standard transmission mechanism, from demand fluctuations

to output, that operates through price inflexibility on the supply side. It

is my contention, in this paper, that the same set of theories that offers a

potential explanation of, for example, the Keynesian investment multiplier

also suggests a very different mechanism for the transmission of policy

shocks to aggregate supply. It is the theory of supply that I concentrate

on below.


2. The Stylized Facts

     In this section of the paper I summarize three stylized facts that

concern the relationship between inflation, the rate of interest and

employment.    I than offer an interpretation of these facts in terms of an

AlL based theory of aggregate supply.

FACT NUMBER   1.

     In the United Kingdom there was a marked and fairly stable inverse

relationship between unemployment and the rate of wage inflation from 1861

well into the 1960's. Beyond this date the relationship appears to have

broken down and parts of the 1970's and 1980's have been characterized by

the simultaneous occurrence of both high inflation and high unemployment.

PIANATION
The traditional explanation for the Phillips curve relationship is as a wage

adjustment equation. According to this interpretation, high unemployment

causes wages to fall as part of a disequilibrium adjustment process.

      The AlL based theory reverses the direction of causation. Under the

AlL interpretation, a high rate of inflation is associated with a low

realized rate of interest. When the real rate of interest is low, the

equilibrium frequency of contract failures is low. These contract failures

may manifest themselves as bankruptcies or as layoffs. In either case,

contract terminations are rationally anticipated outcomes of negotiations

between asymmetrically informed parties; that is, the form of the contract

as explained not assumed as in more traditional ad-hoc contract based

theories that have been advanced as possible justifications for sticky-price

Keynesian theories of supply.3

     The Phelps-Friedman explanation of the disappearing Phillips curve

relies on the idea that original estimates of the relationship neglected to

take account of the influence of expectations on the wage formation process.

The AlL interpretation of the facts also relies on an omitted variable

problem but in AlL theory it is the influence of the rate of interest that

has been omitted and not the effect of (un-observable) inflationary

expectations. Until the mid 1960's the nominal rate of interest exhibited

very little movement relative to its more recent fluctuations (see figure

(III) which documents this assertion for U.S. data). Failure to take

account of the interest rate as an explanatory variable in the aggregate

supply equation caused the estimated Phillips curve   to   shift in the 1970's

when a high and volatile rate of interest became part of the background of

central bank monetary policy.

FACT NUMBER 2

     In   post-war U.S. time series data there is a strong correlation between

lagged values of the rate of interest and values of the unemployment rate.

The mean lag is about nine months. If the influence of expected inflation is

removed from the series, the role of the nominal interest rate is still

significant; that is, the nominal interest rate exerts an influence on the

level of aggregate economic activity that is independent of the expected

real rate of return.4

EXPLA1ATION

     The role of the nominal interest rate fits naturally into AlL based

theories in which a lack of liquidity is an important factor that

contributes to a high incidence of layoffs. The nominal rate of interest

represents the opportunity cost of holding money and an optimal contract

balances this opportunity Cost against the benefit of additional liquidity.

In AlL theories this benefit arises from the fact that a high cushion of

liquidity allows firms to offer a more stable wage. Ex-post stability of

the contracted wage, in the presence of fluctuations in the marginal

productivity of labor, allows the firm to make more efficient employment

decisions. If a firm had to raise the wage every time that it wished to

expand output, then it would be less likely to expand in times of high

productivity.

     The simplest way to think of the chain by which the nominal rate of

interest affects employment is to view money as a productive asset; money

enters the production function and directly affects aggregate supply. If

the opportunity cost of holding money rises than firms will use less of it.

Since money is a Complement to labor, the net effect is that high interest

rates are associated with less employment in equilibrium.

FACT NUMBER 3

      The unemployment rate in the United States exhibits a significant

degree of persistence. An A.R.I.M.A. (1,1,0) process fits reasonably well

to twentieth century annual data with an auto-regressive co-efficient of

approximately 0.5.

EXPLANATION

       It has recently become common practice to explain the persistence of

unemployment in terms of hysteresis effects.5 Under this interpretation,

unemployment has remained high in recent years because workers remain out   of
the   labor force in the face of persistent spells of demand induced

unemployment. This effect causes an increase in the natural rate. Under

AlL theories, on the other hand, unemployment is highly auto-correlated

because the lagged value of the unemployment rate serves as a proxy for the

effects of financial structure on the efficiency of labor contracts.   I


provide evidence in section (6) of this paper that the value of previous

periods profits is a more appropriate regressor, in an aggregate supply

equation, than is the lagged value of the unemployment rate. The real value

of last periods profits is an important explanatory variable because when

profits are high entrepreneurs do not need to borrow as much from external

sources in order to finance their activities. High profits reduce the

dependence of the entrepreneur on outside funding and, by so doing, reduce

the production inefficiencies that are induced by contracts between

asymmetrically informed parties.

3. A Review of AlL Theory.

       In this section I review the structure of AlL based theories. The

presentation is broken into three parts each of which is designed to explain

the role of three explanatory variables in the AlL theory of aggregate

supply. These variables are the real rate of interest, the nominal rate of
                                     7




interest and the profits that are earned by entrepreneurs.

     Throughout this section, I maintain the simplifying assumption that

future prices are perfectly foreseen. Although uncertainty is important in

AlL theory it is uncertainty about the productivity of individual enter-

prises that provides the motive for agents to write contracts. The basic

theory does not differentiate between the anticipated real rate of interest

and the realized real rate of interest and it is eclectic on which of these

variables should enter the aggregate supply function. This important issue

is treated in section (4) in which I discuss the question of the indexation

of nominal contracts to observed prices.

I. THE ROLE OF THE REAL RATE OF   INTEST
     The most direct way of explaining why the real rate of interest is a
key variable in AlL theories of supply is by means of a parable. Think of a

simple economy in which all output is produced by one-person-firms. These

firms are owned and operated by self-employed risk-neutral entrepreneurs

each of whom may combine a single unit of his own labor with a single unit

of capital. Nothing of substance hinges on the assumption that the techno-

logy is of this rather simple form although it is important that there

should be at least two inputs. The second input introduces a role for a

second individual and provides a motive for a contract. I refer to the

second individual as a banker and to stress the fact that risk-sharing does

not play a role in AlL theories I assume that this second individual is also

risk-neutral. The role of the banker is to provide sufficient funds to the

entrepreneur to enable him to purchase a machine.

       The process of production yields an uncertain future return and the

distribution of this return is known by both the entrepreneur and the

banker. These two individuals must write a Contract that specifies how the

proceeds of the enterprise will be divided up between them. At this point
                                      8




AlL theories introduce a key assumption:

ASYMMETRIC        the entrepreneur has better information
INFORMATION       about the productivity of his own business than does the

                  banker.


     This assumption is an important ingredient of theories that rely on

informational asymmetries and it is a feature that is missing in more

familiar insurance based approaches to contract theory. The role of the

assumption is to limit the set of contracts that can be written to those

that are indexed to common verifiable information. Its effect is to Link

together the employment rule and the loan repayment schedule in any contract

that is acceptable to both parties. This linkage is achieved by the

principle that a contract will be acceptable to the banker if it provides

the entrepreneur with ai incentive to truthfully reveal the productivity of

the enterprise.6 Any contract that has this property must take account of

the fact that, ex-post, the entrepreneur will make the employment decision

that is in his own best interests. Since the entrepreneur will make this

decision by comparing the marginal product of employment with the marginal

amount that he must pay to the banker, it follows that the loan repayment

schedule and the employment level cannot be separated from each other.

     At this point AlL theories introduce a second key assumption:

LIMITED          the collateral of the entrepreneur is limited by his own

COLLATERAL       wealth.


This assumption limits the amount that the entrepreneur can pay to the

banker in the worst possible state of nature.

       In order to clearly explain the combined implications of these two

assumptions I make the simplifying assumption that the technology permits

only two possible employment decisions. The entrepreneur may decide either
                                     9




to work or to lay himself off. Further assume that the banker observes

whether or not the entrepreneur decides to work but that he cannot observe

either the productivity of the enterprise or ex.post profits. These

assumptions imply that the set of acceptable contracts consists of those

that make one payment to the banker if production takes place and a

different payment if it does not.

     It is at this point that the real rate of interest enters the picture.

The expected real rate of interest represents the value of the banker's

opportunity cost of funds. The higher is this ex-ante expected return, the

higher must be the expected value of the banker's share of the enterprise.

Since the payment received by the banker in the event of bankruptcy is

limited by the wealth of the entrepreneur, an increase in the rate of

interest must be accompanied by an increase in the payment that is promised

to the banker in the event that production takes place. ut herein lies the

essence of the AlL approach to aggregate supply. The entrepreneur's ex-post

employment decision is itself a function of the amount that must be paid to

the banker. Once a contract has been written and the state of nature is

revealed to the entrepreneur he will decide whether or not to declare

bankruptcy by comparing his ex-post utility under two alternative employment

decisions. In order to induce the entrepreneur to work, the marginal

product of employment must exceed his disutility of effort: in addition it

must be sufficiently high to cover the marginal increment in the loan-

repayment-schedule. If the ex-ante real interest rate increases then the

increment in the loan-repayment-schedule must also increase and, ex-post,

there will be fewer states of nature in which the entrepreneur finds it

worthwhile to employ himself.

     In an economy that consists of a large number of self-employed

entrepreneurs, each of whom receives an idiosyncratic productivity shock,
                                         10



the aggregate quantity of output that is produced will be a decreasing

function of the real rate of interest because a higher real interest rate

induces a higher equilibrium frequency of contract failures. This is the

basic mechanism that underlies AlL theories of aggregate supply.

II. THE ROLE OF THE NOIIINAL RATE OF INTEREST.

     A slight modification to the above story will serve to illustrate the

role that money may play in the productive process. Consider a scenario in

which an entrepreneur must write a contract with a single worker. In order

not to complicate this picture unnecessarily let us assume that the entre-

preneur has no need of a banker since he has sufficient collateral to

purchase his own capital equipment. As in the previous discussion, assume

that there are only two possible employment states -     the worker may work or
he may be laid off. Unlike the previous story however it is now the worker,

and not the entrepreneur, who supplies his labor time to the enterprise.

The worker observes his own    ex-post   labor supply whereas the entrepreneur

observes the random productivity of the enterprise.

     The way that one may introduce money into this story is by requiring

that the worker should be paid in cash. The entrepreneur may invest his

wealth in the form   of   productive capital in the enterprise, but in so doing

this capital is tied up and becomes unavailable for use in making wage

payments to the worker. He must decide, ex-ante, how much of his wealth to

retain in the form   of   liquid assets and how much of it to sink into more

productive, but less available, capital.7



     The worker and the entrepreneur must negotiate a contract that offers

the worker a sufficiently high ex-ante expected return to induce him to

forego his next best alternative. But, as in the situation that we

discussed above, the set of acceptable contracts is limited to those that
                                     11




make one payment to the worker if he is employed and another payment if he

is laid off. The payment that the worker receives if he is laid off is

limited by the liquid assets of the entrepreneur. It follows that the lower

the liquidity position that is taken by the entrepreneur the larger must be

the wage that is paid to the worker if he is employed; that is, a low level

of liquidity will be associated with a high degree of variability in the

contracted-wage-schedule. But the degree of variability of the contracted-

wage-schedule will itself affect the probability that the entrepreneur will

decide to employ the worker. In making an ex-post employment decision the

entrepreneur will compare the worker's marginal product to the marginal

increment in his wage-schedule. The larger is the gap between the layoff

payment and the employment payment the lower is the probability that the

worker will be employed.

     It is at this point that the role of the nominal interest rate enters

the picture. The money rate of interest represents the opportunity cost of

holding cash and the entrepreneur must balance this opportunity cost against

the benefit that is afforded by a less volatile employment-schedule. If the

interest rate rises then the entrepreneur will hold less cash. To

compensate the worker for the fact that he will be paid less if he is laid

off, the contracted- wage-schedule must promise to pay more to the worker if

he is employed. But this additional variability in the wage-schedule will

cause the entrepreneur to be less likely, ex-post, to decide to employ the

worker. Across the whole economy a higher rate of interest will be

associated with a lower level of liquidity and with a higher frequency of

layoffs. It is this basic mechanism that causes the nominal rate of

interest to be an important explanatory variable in AlL theories of

aggregate supply.
                                     12




III. THE ROLE OF PROFITS.

     In AlL theory contracts will be more efficient if entrepreneurs are

able to finance a higher proportion of their activities with internally

generated sources of funds. Take a simple example in which all output is

produced by entrepreneurs who face a set of identical projects of the type

that I discussed in part (I). If all projects are of given size then the

most efficient way of organizing production is for each entrepreneur to own

a single plant that is purchased with his own funds. A social organization

of this type will maximize the social product since it eliminates the effi-

ciency distortions that are introduced by contracts between asymmetrically

informed agents. Whether or not such an organization will arise in a

competitive economy depends on the relationship between the technology,

which dictates efficient plant size, and the wealth distribution, which

determines the extent to which production requires individuals to share the

entrepreneurial role. Those individuals who are wealthier are more likely

to become entrepreneurs because they will need to borrow less from other

individuals in order to set up a firm. Wealth bestows a comparative

advantage in the role of entrepreneurship because it permits the individual

to make more efficient production decisions. As an economy evolves over

time, the distribution of income between entrepreneurs and other members of

society will itself affect the efficiency with which productive activity is

organized. If entrepreneurs receive a large share of national income then

these individuals will need to borrow less in future periods from other

members of society. A high current level of profit will be associated with

a high future level of economic activity because it reduces the dependence

of entrepreneurs on less efficient sources of outside funding. It is this

basic mechanism that explains why profits are included as an explanatory

variable in AlL theories of aggregate supply.
                                     13




4. The Indexation of Contracts

    One of the issues that has caused problems for Neo-Keynesian contract

theories concerns the indexation of contracts. According to these theories,

firms offer contracts to workers in which wages are stable because workers

are risk averse and, ceteris-paribus, they would prefer a stable income

stream to one that fluctuates. But this explanation is widely recognized to

be flawed. The Neo-Keynesian theory of aggregate supply relies on an assum-

ption that agents write contracts in which money wages are predetermined.

Stable money wages do not insure workers against fluctuations in the value

of the monetary unit; indeed quite the opposite is the case. Predetermined

money wages expose workers to the risk of income fluctuations in the face of

demand disturbances that presumably these individuals would prefer to avoid.

     AlL theories do not face this problem. In the basic theory that I

outlined in section (3) I made the strong assumption that there was no

aggregate uncertainty. This assumption is clearly counter-factual and it

must be modified if the theory is to be applied to the data. The most

straightforward way in which to introduce aggregate uncertainty is to assume

that the price level fluctuates randomly and that this fluctuation is

independent of the idiosyncratic production uncertainty that is faced by any

particular entrepreneur. This would be the case, for example, if all

aggregate fluctuations arose as a result of random policy actions on the

part of the central bank. In this situation it is meaningful to distinguish

between the ex-ante expected real rate of interest and the ex-post realized

real rate. Which of these two variables is the appropriate regressor in an

AlL theory of aggregate supply? The answer to this question is that, if

both parties are risk-neutral, then they will be indifferent to a contract

in which the money wage rate is indexed to the observable price level and

one in which it is not. If one party is more risk averse than the other
                                       14



then the details of the employment contract and, in particular, the degree

to which the contract is indexed to the price level, will depend on the

relative curvature of the utility functions of the entrepreneur and of the

worker. In AlL theory unanticipated shocks do not play a central role in

explaining employment fluctuations and consequently the issue of contract

indexation is secondary.

     Although from a theoretical point of view one might happy with this

approach -   - it does lead to a number of difficulties in empirically testing
the theory.     It is clearly not a good description of the real world to

assume that future prices are perfectly foreseen and it is almost certainly

true that one of the roles of liquid assets (a role that is not captured by

the theory that I have discussed) is to provide a guarantee of payment

against aggregate fluc'ations in income. By neglecting to model the role

of aggregate uncertainty it is likely - -   to   the extent that aggregate

uncertainty is important in the real economy - -    that   the theories that I

have described above will generate predictions that are at odds with the

facts. One place in which this problem is likely to manifest itself is in

the counterfactual implication, of the simple AlL theory, that the business

cycle is symmetric. Upswings are predicted to last for just as long, and to

be just as severe, as downswings8 although we know that this is not the case

at least in the U.S.

     In applying the theory to U.S. data I have taken account of the fact

that most contracts seem to contain only limited indexing provisions and I

shall therefore interpret the real interest rate variable as an ex-post

rate. This approach side-steps the issue of aggregate fluctuations and it

does not offer a satisfactory solution. However, in the absence of a well

formulated theory of contracts in general equilibrium, that takes account of

the effects of aggregate disturbances, it is as close as I am able to come
                                               15




to providing a consistent theoretical implementation of the ideas that I

have described above. The details of the empirical implementation of my

approach are described in the next section.

5. Frog Theory to Evidence

     In the next two sections of the paper I explore the statistical

evidence for an AlL based theory of supply. My data consists of annual

time series on four basic explanatory variables for the period from 1929 to

1986. These variables are:

     PR.ATE I . . .    .    the   period t-l interest rate on six month commercial

                            loans,

     DLPRICE . . . .        the logarithmic difference of the period t and period t-l
                            values of the GNP deflator,

     UNEM                   the period t unemployment rate,

     LRPROF 1     .   ..    the logarithm of the period t-l value of real national
                            income, net of real compensation to employees.

These variables are graphed in figures (I) and (II) from which it is

apparent that each of these variables has experienced a marked upward trend

over the sample period. The Durbin-Watson statistics for the residuals of a

regression of each of these series on a constant are presented below:

     PRATE    —       .13                           DLPRICE   —   .78
     UNEM —           .18                           LRPROF    —   .04

J.D. Sargan and Alok Ehargava present a test for stationarity of a time

series that is based on the Durbin Watson statistic. The critical value of

this test for a simple random walk with a sample size of 57 is approximat-

ely .49 and hence three of these series (the inflation series is the

exception) do not seem to be stationary. Since standard asymptotic theory

does not apply to non-stationary data the regression results that I report

below are based on first differences.9 The data in first difference form is
                                              16




presented in figures (III) and (IV) and the corresponding Durbin Watson

statistics are given by:

     DPRATE 1 —       1.57                          DDLPRICE —        2.02

     DUNEM       —    . 93                          DLRPROF       —   1 .02.

     The profits variable that I have chosen to work with consists,

essentially, of the sum       of   proprietors incomes, rental income, corporate

profits and net interest as reported in the national income and product

accounts of the United States. This is a very broad interpretation of

entrepreneurial income but has the advantage of avoiding the problem that

the category in which profits are reported depends in an arbitrary way on

the tax laws.

     In addition to the four basic variables I have also used annual data on

the real values of consump..ion, GNP and the stock of high powered money as

instruments in instrumental variables estimation of aggregate supply. The

consumption and CNP data is taken from the national income and products

accounts: the series on high powered money for earlier years is assembled

from various Federal Reserve publications and for the post-war period it is

taken from the Economic Report of the President.

6. The Evidence For A Stable Suplv Relationship

     The regression equation that I have estimated for these data series

takes the form:


[1] DUNEM    —    -l9.5*DDLPRICE       +   42.7*DPRATE 1      -   10.7*DLRPROF   1,
                     (5.5 )                (11.4)                 (1.6 )


where standard errors appear in parentheses. The equation was estimated for

the entire sample period and for various sub-periods to check stability

across pre-war and post-war samples. Equation [I] reports the results that

I obtained for the full sample using a recursive instrumental variables
                                         17




estimator.1O     I used instrumental variables because the current value of the

price level appears as a regressor on the right hand side of the equation

and one would expect that this variable would also enter an aggregate demand

equation in a complete system.      I used a recursive estimator as a means of

checking the stability of the parameter estimates over the sample period.

     The instruments were chosen by picking lagged values of variables that

one would expect to appear in the reduced form of a small econometric model.

The complete set of instruments that was used to estimate equation [1) is

listed below:

     DDLPRICE 1           the lagged difference in the inflation rate

     DLPRICE 1            the lagged value of the logarithmic inflation rate

     DUIMON 1             the lagged value of the logarithmic money growth rate

     DDLGNP 1             the difference in the real logarithmic growth rate of

                          GNP, lagged once

     DDLRGNP 2            the difference in the real logarithmic growth rate of

                          GNP, lagged twice

     DDLHNON 2            the difference in the logarithmic money growth rate,

                          lagged twice

     DLRCONS 1     ....   the lagged value in the logarithm of real consumption

                          expenditure.

The reduced form equations for DUNEM and for DDLPRICE are presented in Table

I, which also reports some additional statistics for the instrumental

variable regression. The choice of instruments does not make a great deal

of difference to the IV. estimates and I experimented with a number of

alternatives including lagged values of investment, of government expendi-

ture and various lags of the first and second differences of the logarithm

of the price index and of the money stock.
                                     18




     Equation (1) is typical of the results that I obtained using a number

of different sample periods and a number of different instrument sets.1 I

have not restricted the coefficient on DDLPRICE to be equal and of opposite

sign to the coefficient on DPRATE I and it is clear from the precision with

which these coefficients are estimated that a restriction of this nature

would be rejected by the data with high probability. That is, one cannot

accept the proposition that it is only the real rate of interest that

belongs in the aggregate supply equation rather than real and nominal rates

of interest separately. This statement does, however, deserve some quali-

fication since the effects of the nominal interest rate and of the inflation

rate are being picked out by the data over very different sample periods.12

     Figure (III) graphs the difference in the inflation rate and the

difference in the nominal interest rate over the period from 1931 to 1986.

Notice that for the initial part of the sample period there is a great deal

of variability in the inflation rate but not much movement at all in the

rate of interest. In the latter part of the sample period this situation is

reversed. One might suspect that the data will be unable to identify the

coefficient on the interest rate in pre-war data and that it will similarly

be unable to identify the separate effect of the inflation rate in post-war

data. This suspicion is born out in Table (II) in which I present separate

estimates for pre 1945 and post-war samples. Since there are only 12 obser-

vations in the pre 1945 sample I was forced to use a restricted instrument

set that drops DDLRGNP 1, DLHNON 1 and DLPRICE I as a way of increasing the

number of degrees of freedom. Table (II) also reports estimates for the

pooled sample using the restricted instrument set.

     The remarkable feature of all of the estimates that I obtained is that

they remain stable over the entire post-war sample period. Figures (V),

 (VI) and (VII) present recursive estimates of the coefficients on the
                                      19




realized inflation rate, on the lagged interest rate and on profits, for

sequential sample periods beginning with the period 1933 to 1964 and ending

with the sample period 1933 to 1986. The dashed lines are approximate 5%

standard error bounds. As an indication of the stability of this relation-

ship in post-war data, Figure (VIII) presents a graph of fitted versus

actual values of DUNEM for the period from 1933 to 1986. This equation is

estimated using data from 1933 to 1958 but it is graphed for the entire

sample period. Although there is some evidence of a break between pre-war

and post-war samples, a researcher who had estimated equation [1] using     data
from 1929 up until 1945 would not have gone far wrong in applying these

estimates to the post-war period.13

     In Section (3) of the paper I discussed the issue of the persistence of

unemployment. As a test of whether lagged profits is an appropriate explan-

atory variable in an aggregate supply equation I ran a number of

encompassing tests in which various additional explanatory variables were

tested as alternatives to lagged profits. In all of the equations that I

tested the functional form that includes only DLRPROF 1, DDLPRICE and

DPRATE I performed significantly better than the joint model and the

alternative model that did not include lagged profits was rejected. Table

(III) reports the outcome of two of these tests. The top panel of the table

tests an alternative model in which lagged profits is replaced by the lagged

unemployment rate. Notice that this alternative model is overwhelmingly

rejected against the joint model which includes both DLRPROF 1 and DUNEM I

as regressors --   the F-statistic of 27.425 is well outside the 5% error
bound, under the null, of 4.034. The model that drops lagged unemployment

and includes only lagged profits, however, cannot be rejected with an F-

statistic of .096. The second panel of Table (III) presents similar results

for a test of the model that replaces lagged profits with the lagged value
                                     20



of compensation to employees. This model is again overwhelmingly rejected

in favor of the AlL specification.

7. Conclusion

     I hope to have persuaded the reader that the statistical evidence that

I have presented lends qualified support to AlL theories of aggregate supply

and that these theories offer a more promising research agenda for macro-

economics than the Phelps-Friedman alternative. In concluding I should add

that if this view is correct it follows that expectational surprises play,

at best, a secondary role in the business cycle. One is left with a view of

the transmission mechanism, from policy to output, that occurs through the

effects of intertemporal relative prices. According to this view, fiscal

and monetary policy can affect the level of economic activity in the lot

run if and only if they can influence real and nominal rates of interest.

There is little doubt that the money rate of interest is free to be chosen

in a fiat money economy and, in this sense, the non superneutrality of money

that I have described above is likely to prove uncontroversial. One may

reasonably argue that these kinds of non-superneutralities are likely to be

unimportant in practice but this is a matter that is at least potentially

capable of being decided by the evidence.

     The ability of policy to influence the real rate of interest is a

different matter. There are skeptics who will point to both theoretical

and empirical reasons for doubting that this theory will provide a

successful explanation of the transmission mechanism. On the empirical

side, the real rate of interest in the post war U.S. seems to be quite well

described by a first order autoregressive process and it does not seem to be

Cranger caused by any other economic time series.14 On the theoretical

side, if one works within the representative agent paradigm, then one would

not expect that fiscal policy could influence the real rate of return in the
                                     21




long run. But this is not the only possible interpretation of the facts and

the representative agent paradigm is not the only framework that one might

use to organize the data. The overlapping generations model is an equally

useful framework and, within this structure, one would predict that fiscal

policy can have permanent long run effects on the rate at which agents can

make intertemporal trades. From the overlapping generations perspective,

the finding that fiscal policy does not Cranger cause the real rate of

interest represents evidence of a highly elastic aggregate supply curve.15

     In any event, these issues will not be decided by the evidence that I

have presented in this paper: they require a more fully specified

theoretical model and a more complete simultaneous equations approach to the

data: there is still much work to be done. In 1958, A.'J. Phillips closed his

pper with the lines:

     "These conclusions are of course tentative. There is need for

     much more detailed research into the relations between

     unemployment, wage rates, prices and productivity."

Thirty years of intensive theoretical and applied work does not seem to have

brought us much closer to a resolution.

     1Some of the more recent approaches to contract theory combine

asymmetric information with an insurance based approach. The O.J.E. supple-

ment, vol. 98 1983, edited by Azariadis and Stiglitz contains a number of

such papers. This volume goes only part way to providing the kind of

alternative theory of supply that I am referring to and, for the most part,

it is oriented to the task of explaining the Neo-Keynesian assumption of

sticky prices. AlL theories require the additional assumption of limited

collateral.

     2Roger E.A. Farmer, "A New Theory of Aggregate Supply" (1984>. Also

see "Money and Contracts", (1988a) which discusses the effect of nominal

interest rates on aggregate supply in a general equilibrium model.

         should be pointed out that the implications of AlL based theories

of aggregate supply are distinct from New-Classical Inter-Temporal-Substi-

tution (I.T.S.) theoriesis which also stress the role of real interest

rates. In I.T.S. theories agents supply more labor today if the currently

anticipated real rate of interest is high. In contrast, AlL theories

predict that employment will be high today if the rate of return that is

realized today is low. Both the timing and the sign of the relationship

differ between the two theories. AlL theories are also eclectic on the

distinction between the effects of the anticipated real rate of interest and

the realized rate. Which of these variables is important depends on whether

contracts are indexed to the observable rate of inflation. This in turn de-

pends on agents attitudes to risk sharing which in AlL theories are seen as

second order effects. Section (4) discusses the indexation issue in more

depth.

        4C.A. Sims, "Comparison of Interwar and Postwar Cycles: Monetarism

Reconsidered" American Economic Review vol. 70, 1980. Sims documents this

assertion for small vector auto-regressions. Evidence for the effect of

nominal interest rates after correcting for anticipated inflation is found

in Litterman and Weiss, "Money Real Interest Rates, and Output: A Reinter-

pretation of Postwar U.S. Data", Econometrica vol. 53, number 1 January

1985.

        5See, for example, the paper by Blanchard and Summers, "Hysteresis and

the European Unemployment Problem," in the 1986 NBER Macroeconomics Annual.

A number of authors have recently begun to question the natural rate

hypothesis in the light of recent European experience. Several papers on

 he issue are collected in the American Economic Review May 1988 papers and

proceedings. Most writers on the topic, however, maintain the distinction

between a theory of short run fluctuations and a theory of movements in the

natural rate. It is my contention that this distinction is artificial and

anachronistic.

           contract that has this property is said to be incentive compatible

and the principle is usually referred to as the revelation principle. See

the paper by Roger Myerson, "Incentive Compatibility and the Bargaining

Problem", Econometrica vol. 47, 1979 pp. 61-74.

         7One   might   argue that a theory that relies on an assumption that

workers are paid in cash does not fit well with recent experience. However,

 the critical feature of the AlL explanation is that the opportunity cost of

 liquidity is an increasing function of the nominal rate of interest. In

U.S. time series data the gap between the loan rate of interest and the

 deposit rate is a stable linear function of the level of the three month T-

bill rate. It follows that even if firms hold their liquid assets in the
                                           24



form of interest bearing deposits they will still face a cost of liquidity

that increases systematically with the rate of interest. The papers by

Farmer (1988a,b) discuss this issue in more depth and provide evidence of

the relationship between loan rates and deposit rates for post-war U.S.

time-series data.

      81 am grateful to Glenn Hubbard for drawing my attention to this issue.

At   the   present time an approach that integrates theory and data with the

same degree of precision as real business cycle theory is beyond our grasp.

Economies with informational perfections of the kind that I describe in this

paper can not be described as solutions to a planner's problem and one

cannot, therefore, exploit the second welfare theorem and reduce the

equilibrium of such an economy to a representative agent problem.

       9J.D. Sargan and Alok Bhargava (1983). The Sargan-hargava test is

uniformly most powerful against the alternative of a first order stationary

Markov process and seems to be preferable to the alternative Dickey-Fuller

(1981) test which is not invariant to whether the alternative hypothesis is

a pure random walk or a random walk with drift.

               regressions were run using David Hendry's program C.I.V.E.

       11The residuals of the regression do not show evidence of auto-

correlation although I did find evidence of heteroscedasticity and they do

not pass tests for normality. There is no evidence of A.R.C.H. effects.

There is some evidence of mis-specification of the functional form although

I did not manage      to   find a parsimonious representation of the relationship

that performed better than the equation that is reported. A functional fort

in which     the   logarithmic difference of the unemployment rate appears on the

left hand side does significantly worse.

       12Since there is some reason to believe that the methods of data

collection differ between pre-war and post-war samples (see the article by
                                        25




Christina Romer (1986)), it is possible that    the hypothesis that only the
real rate of interest is important would not be rejected if one had access

to a consistently collected sample in which there was substantial variation

in both variables.

     13There is no evidence of a structural break in the data at any point

beyond 1947. The pre-1946 and post-war samples do show some evidence of

structural instability but this result is highly sensitive to the single

observation for 1946 which corresponds to the removal of war-time price

controls. If 1946 is included in the post-war sample, it dramatically

reduces (in absolute value) the magnitude of the post-war inflation co-

efficient. If 1946 is excluded from the post-war data, the effect of

inflation in the post-war sample is much closer to the pre-1946 value

'   hough it is still estimated very imprecisely.
            Litterman and Weiss (1985).

      '5There are also open economy issues that I have not touched on.    For

example, it may well be that, in addition to real rates of return, policy

may affect unemployment through effects on relative prices of domestic

versus foreign goods. By changing fiscal policy, the government may induce

a transition to a new equilibrium relative price. During the transition,

the effective real rate of interest will fluctuate. This offers a possible

channel by which fiscal policy may alter output in the short run even if the

long run   rate   of return is pegged by the world rate.
