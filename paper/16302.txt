We identify American call and put options on the S&P 500 index futures from 1983 to 2006 that

violate the stochastic dominance upper bounds of Constantinides and Perrakis (2007) as

potentially profitable investment opportunities‚Äî‚Äúgood sell‚Äù options. We then consider the

utility enhancement that obtains from the exploitation of such violations by adopting the

appropriate trading policy for a generic investor holding only the market index and the risk free

asset. In both the identification of violations and the trading policy we recognize the potential

early exercise of these American options. We allow for realistic trading conditions by using only

observable information and by incorporating transaction costs, bid ask spreads, and trading

delays (by waiting one quote before entering the position).

       The main contribution of our paper is to show that trading policies that exploit these

violations lead to out of sample portfolio returns that stochastically dominate (in the second

order) portfolio returns that do not exploit them. This means that the expected utility of a generic

risk averse investor, as defined above, increases when exploiting these violations. This result is

independent of any specific preferences, such as mean variance preferences.

       Whereas we find a substantial number of violations of the call upper bound, the

corresponding put upper bound and call and put lower bounds identify relatively few violations

partly because the first two of these bounds are weak, while there do not seem to be many

violations of the put lower bound in our data. Since the frequency of violations of these bounds

is too low for statistical inference, we focus on violations of the call upper bound.1 We note that

we can also use our statistical tests as a general method to investigate good buys or good sells

and in particular the goodness of alternative methods in finding such opportunities. Finally, we

show that neither a simple heuristic for trading options based on observed option price

percentiles for buying low and selling high nor an application of the Bernardo and Ledoit (2000)



                                                                                                  2
bounds systematically lead to out of sample portfolio returns that stochastically dominate

portfolio returns that do not trade in options. We conclude that the identification of good buy

and good sell options is difficult, yet the Constantinides and Perrakis (2007) bounds achieve this

task.

         There is ample evidence that motivates our focus on the class of investors holding the

market and the risk free asset. Surveys report that a large number of US investors follow

indexing policies in their investments. Bogle (2005) reports that, in 2004, index funds account

for about one third of equity fund cash inflows since 2000 and represent about one seventh of

equity fund assets. The S&P 500 index is not only the most widely quoted market index, but has

also been available to investors through exchange traded funds and index futures for several

years. Furthermore, the results are robust to the investor‚Äôs portfolio composition. We show in

our tests that the writing of good sell options may increase the expected utility of an investor

holding a portfolio that includes a wide range of assets in addition to the index and the risk free

asset.

         The bounds that identify good sell options are valid for any distribution of the underlying

asset, including the empirical ones extracted from past data.2         Furthermore, the stochastic

dominance statistical tests by Davidson and Duclos (2000, 2006) which we employ to assess the

out of sample profitability of our trading policy are valid under minimal technical assumptions

about return distributions.

         Finally, the results are robust to the estimation of the bounds. Note that we are only

using the bound violations as signals for trading.        Thus, the assumptions underlying the

derivation of the bounds may be violated as long as the signals are sufficiently informative for

utility enhancing trading.



                                                                                                  3
       We use the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) database on S&P 500 futures options,

from 1983 to 2006, which is clean and spans a long period. Much of the earlier empirical work

on the mispricing of index options is based on data on the S&P 500 index options that comes

from two principal sources: the Berkeley Options Database (from 1986 to 1995) that provides

relatively clean transaction prices, but misses important events over the past 14 years, such as the

1998 liquidity crisis, the dot com bubble, and its 2000 burst; and the OptionMetrics (starting in

1996) data base which, however, is of uneven quality and contains only end of day quotes.

       Our tests are nonparametric in the sense that we do not assume any particular distribution

for the underlying asset returns. Therefore, our finding of good sell options cannot be attributed

to stochastic volatility and jumps in the index price. We use historical data on the underlying

S&P 500 index returns in order to estimate the bounds. We use several empirical estimates of

the underlying return distribution, all of them observable at the time the trading policy is

implemented. For each one of these estimates, we evaluate the corresponding bounds over the

period from 1983 to 2006 and then identify the observed S&P 500 futures options prices that

violate them. For each violation, we identify the optimal trading policy of a generic investor

with and without the option, using the observed path of the underlying asset till option expiration

and recognizing realistic trading conditions such as possible early exercise and transaction costs.

We identify the profitability of the pair of policies for each observed violation and then conduct

several stochastic dominance tests over the entire sample period.

       A large body of finance literature addresses the mispricing of options. Rubinstein (1994)

and Jackwerth and Rubinstein (1996) observe a steep index smile in the implied volatility of

S&P 500 index options that suggests that out of the money (OTM) puts are too expensive.

Indeed, a common hedge fund policy is to sell OTM puts. Coval and Shumway (2001) find that



                                                                                                  4
buying zero beta, at the money (ATM) straddles/strangles loses money. Santa-Clara and Saretto

(2009) also find that strategies of selling index options are good deals. The results of Ait-Sahalia

and Lo (2000), Jackwerth (2000), and Rosenberg and Engle (2002) are suggestive of stochastic

dominance, albeit in frictionless markets with a representative agent. The assumption of a

representative agent can be justified if the market is complete. Ait-Sahalia and Lo (2000, pages

25-26) call for extensions which do not rely on complete markets. Our results on stochastic

dominance allow for both an incomplete market (thereby removing the requirement that a

representative investor exists) and frictions.

       Constantinides, Jackwerth, and Perrakis (2009) provide empirical evidence that both

European puts and calls on the S&P 500 index violate corresponding stochastic dominance

bounds on European options put forth by Constantinides and Perrakis (2002). Constantinides,

Jackwerth, and Perrakis (2009) estimate the time series process of the index price, use this

process to calculate upper and lower stochastic dominance bounds on the prices of options, and

report the observed violations of the bounds by option prices. This process is subject to model

misspecification and estimation error. Therefore, the bounds are potentially calculated with

error. The reported violations do not account for potential error.

       We address the above concerns in this paper as follows.            The claim of stochastic

dominance is not based on the observation of option prices violating the bounds. Observed

violation of the bounds only triggers the trading of these options. The claim of stochastic

dominance is based on the out of sample statistical test of whether the portfolios that incorporate

such options stochastically dominate portfolios which do not incorporate them. Even if the

assumptions that lead to the theoretical development of the bounds are violated in practice, this

does not detract from the finding of stochastic dominance based on the empirical tests but,



                                                                                                  5
instead, makes the claim of stochastic dominance conservative and implies that the estimated

bounds may still be used as identifiers of good sell options.

       Unlike the results in Constantinides, Jackwerth, and Perrakis (2009), our tests of

stochastic dominance do allow for error in the realized returns. The statistical tests are based on

the one month realized distribution of returns of these portfolios. The tests are nonparametric

and, therefore, free from assumptions regarding the return distribution. The tests are not based

on the estimated time series process of the index price and, therefore, are free from estimation

error and model misspecification of the time series process of the index price. The reported

findings of stochastic dominance are conservative because potential errors in calculating the

bounds result in a trading rule that is less efficient in spotting violations. Finally, we estimate the

bounds at time t based only on information available at time t. Therefore, both the calculation of

the bounds and the tests of stochastic dominance are truly out of sample.

       The paper is organized as follows. In Section I, we present the restrictions on futures

option prices imposed by stochastic dominance and discuss the underlying assumptions. In

Section II, we describe the data and the empirical design. We present the empirical results in

Section III and demonstrate their robustness in Section IV. In Section V, we discuss the

implications of our results and conclude. Additional results are reported in the appendices and in

the online appendices.



      I.      Restrictions on Futures Option Prices Imposed by Stochastic Dominance



       We summarize the model and assumptions in Constantinides and Perrakis (2007) that

lead to the bounds that signify violations of stochastic dominance. We stress that, even if these



                                                                                                     6
assumptions do not hold in practice, this does not detract from the finding of stochastic

dominance based on the empirical tests reported in this paper, but instead makes the claim of

stochastic dominance conservative: the tests of stochastic dominance do not depend on the

assumptions made in deriving the bounds.

        We allow the market to be incomplete and agents to be heterogeneous. We investigate

the restrictions on option prices imposed by one particular class of agents that we simply refer to

as ‚Äútraders‚Äù. We allow for other agents to participate in the market but this allowance does not

invalidate the restrictions on option prices imposed by the traders.

        We consider a market with several types of financial assets. First, we assume that traders

invest only in two of them, a bond and a stock with the natural interpretation as a market index.

Subsequently, we assume that traders can invest in a third asset as well, an American call or put

option on the index futures. The bond is risk free and has total return R. The stock has ex

dividend stock price St at time t and pays cash dividend Œ≥ St , where the dividend yield Œ≥ is

deterministic. The total return on the stock, (1 + Œ≥ ) ( St +1 / St ) , is assumed to be i.i.d. with mean

RS . The call or put option on the index futures has strike K and expiration date T . The

underlying futures contract is cash settled and has maturity T F , T F ‚â• T . We assume that the

futures price Ft is linked to the stock price by the approximate cost of carry relation


Ft = (1 + Œ≥ ) ( ) RT ‚àít St + Œµ t , t ‚â§ T F ,
             ‚àí T F ‚àít F
                                               Œµ t ‚â§ Œµ , where the basis risk Œµ t is serially independent

and independent of the stock price.

        Transfers to and from the cash account (bond trades) do not incur transaction costs.

Stock trades decrease the bond account by transaction costs equal to the absolute value of the

dollar transaction, times the proportional transaction costs rate, k , 0 ‚â§ k < 1 . Transaction costs,


                                                                                                       7
exchange fees, and price impact are accounted for in what we refer to as the bid and ask prices of

options.

          We assume that traders maximize generally heterogeneous, state independent, increasing,

and concave utility functions. We further assume that each trader‚Äôs wealth at the end of each

period is weakly monotone increasing in the stock return over the period, as explained in

Constantinides and Perrakis (2007).3

          We do not make the restrictive assumption that all market agents belong to the class of

utility maximizing traders. Thus, our results are robust and unaffected by the presence in the

market of agents with beliefs, endowments, preferences, trading restrictions, and transaction

costs schedules that differ from those of the utility maximizing traders modeled in

Constantinides and Perrakis (2007).

          A trader enters the market at time zero with x0 dollars in bonds and y0 dollars in ex

dividend shares of stock. We normalize the stock (or, index price) to y0 dollars so that the trader

holds one share (or, one unit of the index). We consider two scenarios. In the first scenario, the

trader may trade the bond and stock but not the options. The trader makes sequential investment

decisions at discrete trading dates t ( t = 0, 1... , T ' ), where T ', T ' ‚â• T F ‚â• T , is the finite terminal

date. The trader‚Äôs objective is to maximize expected utility, E[uT ' (WT ' )] , where WT' is the

trader‚Äôs net worth at date T'. Utility is assumed to be concave and increasing and defined for

both positive and negative terminal worth, but is otherwise left unspecified. We refer to this

trader as the index (and bond) trader, IT, and denote her maximized expected utility by

V0IT ( x0 , y0 ) .

          In the second scenario, as in the first scenario, the trader enters the market at time zero

with x0 dollars in bonds and y0 dollars in ex dividend shares of stock, but immediately writes

                                                                                                            8
one American futures call option with maturity T , T ‚â§ T F , where C are the net cash proceeds

from writing the call.4 We assume that the trader may not trade the call option thereafter. At

each trading date t ( t = 0, 1... , T ) the trader is informed whether or not she has been assigned

(that is, assigned to act as the counterparty of the holder of a call who exercises the call at that

time). If the trader has been assigned, the call position is closed out, the trader pays Ft ‚àí K in

cash, and the value of the cash account decreases from xt to xt ‚àí ( Ft ‚àí K ) . The trader makes

sequential investment decisions with the objective to maximize her expected utility, E[uT ' (WT ' )] .

We refer to this trader as the option (plus index and bond) trader, OT, and denote her maximized

expected utility by V0OT ( x0 + C , y0 ) .

        For a given pair ( x0 , y0 ) , we define the reservation write price of a call as the value of C


                (           )
such that V0OT x0 + C, y0 = V0IT ( x0 , y0 ) . The interpretation of C is the write price of the call at


which the trader with initial endowment ( x0 , y0 ) is indifferent between writing the call or not.

Constantinides and Perrakis (2007) state a tight upper bound on the reservation write price of an

American futures call option that is independent of the trader‚Äôs utility function and initial

endowment and independent of the early exercise policy on the calls:



                                                      1+ k
                                C ( Ft , St , t ) =        max ‚é°‚é£ N ( St , t ) , Ft ‚àí K ‚é§‚é¶ , t ‚â§ T .   (1)
                                                      1‚àí k



The function N ( S , t ) is defined as follows:




                                                                                                        9
          N ( S , t ) = ( RS ) ‚àí1 E[max{(1 + Œ≥ ) (
                                                ‚àí T F ‚àít ‚àí1)   F
                                                             RT ‚àít ‚àí1St +1 + Œµ ‚àí K , N ( St +1 , t + 1)} St = S ], t ‚â§ T ‚àí 1
                    = 0, t = T .

                                                                                                                          (2)

The economic interpretation of the call upper bound is as follows. If we observe a call bid price

above the reservation write price, C , then any trader (as defined in this paper) can increase her

expected utility by writing the call.

         Transaction costs on the index have only a small effect on the upper bound. Specifically,

without transaction costs on the index, the upper bound is max ‚é°‚é£ N ( S t , t ) , Ft ‚àí K ‚é§‚é¶ ; with

transaction costs on the index, the upper bound merely increases by the multiplicative factor

(1 + k ) / (1 ‚àí k ) .   The reason is that this particular bound is based on a comparison of the utility of

an index trader to the utility of an option trader. Both traders follow the trading policy which is

optimal for the index trader but is generally suboptimal for the option trader. This policy incurs

very low transaction costs because trades are infrequent, as shown in Constantinides (1986).

         If we further assume that the trader can buy a call at price C ( Ft , St , t ) or less and trade

the futures and do so costlessly, we obtain the following put upper bound:5



                                   P ( Ft , St , t ) = C ( Ft , St , t ) ‚àí R
                                                                               ‚àí(T ‚àí t )
                                                                                           Ft + K , t ‚â§ T .               (3)



with similar interpretation. Constantinides and Perrakis (2007) derive lower bounds on the

reservation purchase price of American call and put options on futures. We do not state these

lower bounds here because the observed frequency of their violation is too low for statistical

inference.


                                                                                                                          10
                          II.     Data Description and Methodology



       In this section, we describe our data on index, futures, and option prices. We explain

how we calibrate a tree of the daily index return and use it to calculate the option bounds. We

describe the construction of the portfolio of the index trader (IT) and of the option trader (OT).

Finally, we explain our empirical methodology of comparing the performance of the IT and OT

portfolios in terms of their means and in terms of the criterion of second order stochastic

dominance.



                           II.A    Data Description and Estimation

       We obtain the time stamped quotes of the 30 calendar day S&P 500 futures options and

the underlying nearest to maturity futures for the period from February 1983 to July 2006 from

the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) tapes. This results in 247 sampling dates. We obtain

the interest rate as the 3 month T bill rate from the Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15. The

data sources are described in further detail in Appendix A.

       For the daily index return distribution, we use the historical sample of logarithmic returns

from January 1928 to January 1983. However, when looking forward for each of our 247 option

sampling dates, we adjust the first four moments of the index return distribution in various ways

which we now describe in detail. We set the mean logarithmic index return at 4% plus the

observed 3 month T bill rate instead of estimating the mean index return from the data in order to

mitigate statistical problems in estimating the mean. We implement this by adding a constant to

the observed logarithmic index returns so that their sample mean equals the above target.



                                                                                                11
        We estimate both the unconditional and conditional volatility of the index returns. We

estimate the unconditional volatility as the sample standard deviation over the period January

1928 to January 1983.

        We estimate the conditional volatility in three different ways. First, we estimate the

conditional volatility as the sample standard deviation over the preceding 90 trading days. We

also estimate the conditional volatility over the preceding 360 days.         The results remain

essentially unchanged. Second, we estimate the conditional volatility as the ATM implied

volatility (IV) on the preceding day, adjusted by the mean prediction error for all dates preceding

the given date (typically some 3%).6 Finally, we estimate the conditional volatility as the Nelson

(1991) EGARCH (1, 1) model volatility using EGARCH coefficients estimated for S&P 500

daily returns over January 1928 to January 1983 applied to residuals observed over the 90 days

preceding each sample date to form projections of the volatility realized till the option expiry

date.7 We estimate the 3rd and 4th moments of the index return as their sample counterparts over

the preceding 90 days.

        In Table I, we report statistics of the prediction error of the above volatility estimates.

The best overall predictor is the adjusted ATM IV and the second best predictor is the 90 day

historical volatility.

                                      [Table I about here]



    II.B     Calibration of the Index Returns Tree and Calculation of the Option Bounds

        We model the path of the daily index return till the option expiration on a T step tree,

where T is the number of trading days in that particular month. The tree is recombining with m

branches emanating from each node. Every month we calibrate the tree by choosing the number



                                                                                                12
of branches, spacing, and transition probabilities at each node to match the first four moments of

the daily index return distribution, as described in the online Appendix B. We numerically

calculate the bounds in equations (1)-(3) by iterating backwards on the calibrated tree.



                        II.C    Portfolio Construction and Rebalancing

       For each monthly stock return path, we employ the following rebalancing policies. For

the index trader (who manages a portfolio of the index and the risk free asset in the presence of

transaction costs), we employ the optimal trading policy, as derived in Constantinides (1986) and

extended in Perrakis and Czerwonko (2006) to allow for dividend yield on the stock.

Essentially, this policy consists of trading only to confine the ratio of the index value to the bond

value, yt / xt , within a no transactions region, defined by lower and upper boundaries.

       We derive these boundaries for the following parameter values: one way transaction cost

rate on the index of 0.5%; annual return volatility of the index of 0.1856, the sample volatility

over 1928 to 1983; interest rate equal to the observed 3 month T bill date; risk premium 4%; and

constant relative risk aversion coefficient of 2. For this set of parameters, the lower and upper

boundaries are y0 / x0 = 1.2026 and 1.5259, respectively. At the beginning of each month and

before the trader trades in options, we set x0 = 73,300 and y0 = 100,000, which corresponds to the

midpoint of the no transactions region, y0 / x0 = 1.3642. We normalize the index price to y0

dollars so that the trader holds one unit of the index. In our empirical work, we verify the

robustness of our results to these parameter values and the initial portfolio composition.

       For the option trader (who manages a portfolio of the option, index, and the risk free asset

in the presence of transaction costs), we set x0 and y0 to the same values as for the index trader.

The option trader writes or buys one call or one put on the index futures. We normalize the size

                                                                                                  13
of a futures contract to be on one unit of the index; and we normalize the size of the futures

option to be on one futures contract.

       The portfolio composition changes, depending on the assumed position in futures

options, as explained in Appendix B. We employ the trading policy which is optimal for the

index trader but is generally suboptimal for the option trader.        Recall that the goal is to

demonstrate that there exist profitable investment opportunities for the option trader. Given this

goal, it suffices to show that there exist profitable investment opportunities for the option trader

even though the option trader follows a generally suboptimal policy in trading the index.

       We focus on the case where the basis risk bound, Œµ , is 0.5% of the index price. Over the

years from 1990 to 2002, 95% of all observations have basis risk less than 0.5% of the index

price. In Section IV, we argue that our empirical results are robust to the basis risk bound.



                                 II.D    Empirical Methodology

       For each of our methods of estimating the bounds, we obtain 247 monthly portfolio

returns for the index trader and the option trader, respectively. Our goal is to test whether the

portfolio profitability of the index and option traders are statistically different in the months in

which we observe violations of the bounds.

       We apply the criterion of second order stochastic dominance (SSD), which states that the

dominating portfolio is preferred by any risk averse trader, independent of distributional

assumptions, such as normality, and preference assumptions, such as quadratic utility. Formally,

the OT portfolio stochastically dominates the IT portfolio if, for every z in the joint support of

their respective distributions, the following holds:




                                                                                                 14

with strict inequality for at least one value of z, where

J = OT , IT , FJ ( x) is the cumulative distribution function of the portfolio return, and z is the

lower bound of the common support.

       First, we test the null hypothesis H 0 : IT ;2 OT against the alternative that either

OT ;2 IT or that neither one of the two distributions dominates the other. Hence, rejection of

the null hypothesis fails to rank the two distributions. We also test the converse null hypothesis

H 0 : OT ;2 IT against the alternative that either IT ;2 OT or that neither one of the two

distributions dominates the other.       For these hypotheses, we report the results of the test

proposed by Davidson and Duclos (2000) (DD (2000)), described in Appendix C. The test

requires that returns be serially uncorrelated, an assumption that holds well in all our return

series: the first order serial correlation ranges from -0.0267 to 0.0964 and is statistically

insignificant.

       Second, we test the null hypothesis H 0 : OT ;

portfolio return does not stochastically dominate the index trader‚Äôs portfolio return, against the

alternative hypothesis H A : OT ;2 IT , which states that the option trader‚Äôs portfolio return

stochastically dominates the index trader‚Äôs portfolio return. Rejection of this hypothesis means

that the option trader‚Äôs portfolio return stochastically dominates the index trader‚Äôs portfolio

return. Likewise, we test the converse null hypothesis H 0 : IT ;          against the alternative

hypothesis H A : IT ;2 OT . For these hypotheses, we report the results of the test proposed by

Davidson and Duclos (2006) (DD (2006)), described in Appendix C. We use the algorithm

developed by Davidson (2007). Again, the test requires that returns be serially uncorrelated, an

assumption that holds well in all our return series. Nolte (2008) investigates the power of the

DD (2006) when there are GARCH effects and finds that the test performs well.

       The power of the DD (2006) test is low, unless one trims the tails of the paired outcomes.

Therefore, we trim 10% of the paired outcomes in the left tail of our sample distributions which

affects both the IT and OT returns similarly and is, therefore, innocuous. The trimming of the

right tail of the distribution presents a problem. Without any trimming on the right tail, the test

has low power. Trimming on the right, on the other hand, may bias our test towards rejection of

the null, because IT tends to produce superior results to OT when the return of the underlying

asset is high. For this reason, we present in our tables results with 0%, 5%, and 10% trimming

on the right. In the online Appendix C, we test the effects of such trimming on simulated data

that mirror our sample. Our simulations show that the test is, if anything, conservative in

rejecting the false null.   To facilitate interpretation, we perform all our statistical tests on

annualized arithmetic returns on the wealth of OT and IT investors.8

       We choose the tests DD (2000) and DD (2006) because, unlike several alternatives, they

apply to correlated samples and are more powerful than other well known tests. For further

discussion, see Tse and Zhang (2003).




                                                                                                16
                                   III     Empirical Results



       In Section III.A, we describe the pattern of observed violations for the bounds with

respect to the degree of moneyness. In Section III.B, we present the main empirical results. We

compare the portfolio return of an option trader who writes good sell calls or puts at their bid

price with the portfolio return of an index trader who does not trade in the options over the

period from 1983 to 2006. We find that the return of an option writer stochastically dominates

the index trader‚Äôs return, net of transaction costs and the bid ask spread. Whereas we find a

substantial number of violations of the upper bounds, we find relatively few violations of the

lower bounds.



                               III.A The Pattern of Violations

       In Figure 1, we plot the four bounds for one month options for May 22, 1996, expressed

in terms of the implied volatility, as a function of the moneyness, K / F . We set œÉ = 20% and

Œµ = 0 . The figure also displays the 95% confidence interval, derived by bootstrapping the 90

day distribution. The call upper bound is tighter than the put upper bound and both bounds are

downward sloping. The put lower bound is tighter than the call lower bound. The put lower

bound is downward sloping but the call lower bound is not.

                                  [Figures 1 and 2 about here]

       In Figure 2, we display the time pattern of actual violations of the call upper bound. The

crosses display the violations of the call upper bound for the period February 1983 to July 2006.

For the adjusted IV distributions, the first 21 dates are not in the sample because they are needed

to obtain the adjustment. The solid lines are the natural logarithm of the S&P 500 index, the

                                                                                                17
VIX index, and the T Bill rate. For all different ways of estimating volatility, we observe

violations after significant down moves in the index, when we expect the implied volatility to be

high.

                                      [Table II about here]

        In Table II, the violations are shown as a proportion of the quotes in each moneyness

range. We note that, for all methods of estimating the bounds, there is a large proportion of

violations. For the moneyness range 1.03-1.08, a large proportion of the available quotes violate

the corresponding bound for all estimation methods.

                                     [Table III about here]

        Table III shows the violations in each moneyness range, as a proportion of the total

number of quotes across the whole range of moneyness. The largest number of violations, as a

proportion of the total number of quotes, is found in the 1.01-1.03 moneyness range and not in

the 1.03-1.08 range because there are relatively few quotes in the latter range. For all estimation

methods, a majority of the identified violations are in the liquid range, 0.99-1.03. The exchange

regulations specify that the minimum number of available contracts must be at least 20 for each

quote. Our data also shows that the average size of the violation is between 5% and 56% of the

upper bound for most methods of estimating the bounds as we move from the 0.96-0.99 liquidity

range to the 1.03-1.08 liquidity range. In the stochastic dominance tests, the power of the tests

depends, by construction, on the proportion of months with observed violations.

        We further investigate how the incidence of calls violating the upper bound relates to

characteristics of the options (moneyness, ATM implied volatility, volume of trade, and put call

ratio), the index (return, momentum, presence of jumps between trading dates, dividend yield,

skew, and volume of trade), the term structure, and the default spread. For each of the four



                                                                                                18
volatility prediction methods, we sort the sample of calls into terciles and report the average

fraction of violations in the top and bottom terciles. The results are reported in Table IV. The

incidence of violations is higher when the Moody Baa-Aaa default spread is high, when the

futures open interest is high, and also when momentum is high ‚Äì all situations which suggest that

uncertainty of investors is rather high. This nervousness might then well transmit to the option

market and increase the likelihood of observing violating options. For all other characteristics,

we do not find a consistent pattern of violations because the incidence of violations depends on

the prediction method of the volatility as an input to the derivation of the bounds.

                                      [Table IV about here]


                      III.B Empirical Evidence on Stochastic Dominance

         We apply our statistical tests to all months in the sample, even though there are months in

which the OT trader does not trade in options and the returns in these months are identical for the

OT and IT portfolios, thereby making it harder for us to establish profitable (utility improving)

trading opportunities. In Table V, Panels A and B, we present the cases of call and put bid prices

violating their upper bound, when we set the basis risk bound at 0.5% of the index price. We

find a higher frequency of violations of the upper call bound than of the upper put bound because

the upper call bound is tighter than the upper put bound, as we observed in Figure 1.9

                                       [Table V about here]

         In our first test of stochastic dominance, we consider the hypothesis H 0 : OT ;2 IT ,

which states that the option trader‚Äôs return dominates the index trader‚Äôs return. We apply the DD

(2000) test and obtain p-values that exceed 10% for both the upper call bound and the put upper

bound.



                                                                                                 19
         In our second test, we consider the hypothesis H 0 : IT ;2 OT , which states that the index

trader‚Äôs return dominates the option trader‚Äôs return. Again, we apply the DD (2000) test. In

Table V, Panel A, the p-values are lower than 1% and the hypothesis is rejected when the option

trader writes good sell calls. In the first two rows of Panel B, the p-values exceed 10% but that is

largely because there are very few months in which we observe violations of the put upper

bound.

         In our third test, we consider the hypothesis H 0 : IT ;/ 2 OT which states that either the

option trader‚Äôs return dominates the index trader‚Äôs return or that neither return dominates the

other. We apply the DD (2006) test and obtain p-values of one for both the upper call bound and

the put upper bound.

         Finally, we consider the hypothesis H 0 : OT ;/ 2 IT , which states that either the index

trader‚Äôs return dominates the option trader‚Äôs return or that neither return dominates the other. As

we explained earlier, the power of the DD (2006) test is low, unless we trim the tails of the

paired outcomes. Therefore, we trim 10% of the paired outcomes in the left tail of our sample

distributions. Without trimming on the right tail, the test has low power and the p-values are

high in the two panels of Table V. Without trimming, we reject at the 10% level for one case in

Panel A. In Panel A, with either 5% or 10% trimming on the right tail, the null is rejected. In

Panel B, the results are inconclusive largely because there are few months in which we observe

violations of the put upper bound.

         In Table V, the reported annualized return difference between the portfolios of the OT

and IT traders appear low because the written call is a small fraction of the dollar investment in

the portfolio: for each unit of the index held in the portfolio, the OT trader writes only one call.

In fact, the identified good sell call options provide average monthly returns of 12.3 ‚Äì 43.2 % to


                                                                                                 20
an investor who writes them at their bid price. The range 12.3 ‚Äì 43.2 % corresponds to the four

different ways of estimating the volatility; in three out of these four cases, the average returns are

statistically significant according to the bootstrap test with 9,999 trials.

        We repeat our run for the subset of OTM good sell calls with little change in the results.

To put these results in perspective, the average monthly returns of all call options written at their

bid price is 7.7 % and this return is not statistically significantly different from zero.

        A second reason for the rather low portfolio returns is that we report the average return

difference of all months, including the months in which there are no violations of the bounds and

no option writing. For example, suppose that there are violations in n months and no violations

in m months; further suppose that the option writing over the n months increases the annualized

return in these months by x % on average.           In the table, we report the annualized return

difference as xn / ( n + m ) % and not as x %. As shown in the table, even the largest number of

dates with violations is still less than half the total number of dates in our sample. Therefore, the

excess returns attributable to the options strategies should properly be multiplied by a factor

greater than two. The economic significance can be further raised by employing portfolios with

more than one call option per unit of the underlying future. We defer the presentation of these

results until Section IV.B and Table VII which detail the robustness of our approach.

        Overall, the results in Table V show that the relatively large number of violations of the

call upper bound by call bid prices leads to a trading policy where the option trader‚Äôs return

stochastically dominates the index trader‚Äôs return. Furthermore, the observed violations of the

call upper bound are economically significant: we find that stochastic dominance evades

rejection only after we artificially decrease the price of the written calls by 10-15%.




                                                                                                   21
        The statistical significance of violations of the put upper bound by put bid prices is weak

because there are few months in which we observe violations of the put upper bound. Since

several earlier studies such as Bondarenko (2003) and Driessen and Maenhout (2007) identify

short puts as highly attractive investments, we further investigate the issue of the existence of

good sell put options by testing the policy of shorting straddles and strangles triggered by

observing call options violating their upper bounds at the same or similar strike price. The

results, reported in the online Appendix D, are consistent with put mispricing documented in

these earlier studies.



                                     IV      Robustness Tests



        We address the robustness of the results to the composition of the trader‚Äôs initial portfolio

(Section IV.A), the number of written options (Section IV.B), the rebalancing of the portfolio

(Section IV.C), and the determination of the bounds (Section IV.D). We find that the results

presented in Table V are robust. In Section IV.E, we demonstrate that the option upper bounds

produce trading results superior to both a na√Øve trading policy and a policy based on the

Bernardo and Ledoit (2000) bounds.



                     IV.A Robustness to the Initial Portfolio Composition

        We test the sensitivity of the results to the assumption that the index trader does not hold

any assets other than the risk free asset and the index. We vary the composition of the IT

portfolio by adding a broad range of risky assets and investigate whether the trader improves her

utility by writing the earlier identified good sell calls. The bounds that we rely upon are no



                                                                                                  22
longer strictly valid because they are derived under the assumption that the index trader does not

hold any additional assets beyond the index and the risk free asset. Nevertheless, we rely on

these bounds to find good sell calls, thereby making it more challenging to find a profitable OT

strategy.

                                      [Table VI about here]

       In Table VI, we consider several cases where the IT portfolio differs from a portfolio

invested in the S&P 500 index and the risk free asset either by replacing the investment in the

S&P 500 index with investment in different indices (Panels A-C); or, by varying the percentage

investment in the index and broadening the portfolio to include the ‚Äúhigh minus low‚Äù (HML) and

‚Äúsmall minus big‚Äù (SMB) excess returns of Fama and French (1993) and a real estate fund

(Panels D-F); in the online Appendix E, we also consider cases of open option positions. In all

cases, we find that the portfolio return of the option trader who writes good sell calls

stochastically dominates the return of the modified index trader.



                     IV.B Robustness to the Number of Written Options

       The bounds stated in Constantinides and Perrakis (2007) are derived under the restriction

that the number of written calls does not exceed the number of units of the index held in the

portfolio. In Table VII, we show that, with an increase in the ratio to 1.5 options per unit index

the return gains to the OT portfolio range from 0.46% to 0.99%, while for a ratio of 2 these gains

become 0.62% to 1.32%; in both cases the tests show dominance of OT over IT. Only when the

ratio increases to 3 do the tests fail to establish dominance at conventional significance levels.

                                      [Table VII about here]




                                                                                                     23
                          IV.C Robustness to Portfolio Rebalancing

       In Section II.C, we described the portfolio rebalancing policy of the index trader and the

option trader. The policy depends on the assumed risk aversion of the trader. For the results

presented in Tables V, we applied the portfolio rebalancing policy which is optimal for a trader

with risk aversion coefficient equal to two. We stress that neither the bounds nor the empirical

tests depend on the risk aversion of the trader.

                                     [Table VIII about here]

       We examine the robustness of our results to the trader‚Äôs rebalancing policy in three ways.

First, we replace the optimal rebalancing policy with a buy and hold policy, essentially

equivalent to assuming that the transaction cost is infinite. Since the upper and lower stochastic

dominance bounds on option prices are independent of the trader‚Äôs utility, we observe the same

number of violations as we do in Table V. The results of the stochastic dominance tests are

displayed in Table VIII and are virtually identical to those in Table V.

       Second, we set the relative risk aversion coefficient at ten instead of two. The change in

the risk aversion coefficient only affects the portfolio rebalancing policy. The test results are

again virtually identical to those in Table V and are reported in the online Appendix F. The

reason for this robustness is that the no transactions region is wide and rebalancing is infrequent,

irrespective of the degree of risk aversion and irrespective of an exogenously imposed buy and

hold policy. Third, the test results are virtually unchanged when the starting portfolio is at either

boundary of the no transactions region.




                                                                                                  24
                    IV.D Robustness to the Determination of the Bounds

       In Table V, the bounds are calculated under the assumption that the futures basis risk is

within 0.5% of the index price, consistent with the observation that 95% of all observations over

1990 to 2002 have basis risk within 0.5% of the index price. As a robustness check, we suppress

the basis risk and present the results in the online Appendix G. The bounds become tighter and

there appear to be more violations. Since the upper call and put bounds are lower, the options

trader is less selective than before in writing options that violate their upper bounds. As in Table

V, the DD (2000) test does not reject the hypothesis H 0 : OT ;2 IT and rejects the hypothesis

H 0 : IT ;2 OT . With 10% trimming, the DD (2006) test rejects the hypothesis H 0 : OT ;/ 2 IT .

We conclude that the results in Table V are robust to basis risk.

       Next, we set the expected premium on the index at 6% instead of 4%. Since the upper

call and put bounds are higher, the options trader is more selective than before in writing options

that violate these bounds. We also set the premium at 2%. The results are reported in the online

Appendix H. In all cases, the stochastic dominance results in writing calls are as strong as in

Table V. We conclude that the results in Table V are robust to the assumption that the expected

premium on the index is 4%.

       Finally, we examine whether the unusually high implied volatility after the October 1987

crash affects our results by presenting unusually profitable utility improving trading

opportunities. We exclude from the sample the seven months from October 1987 to April 1988

and find that the test results are essentially the same as in Table V.




                                                                                                 25
                       IV.E Comparison to Alternative Trading Rules

       One may downplay our test results in identifying good sell options, arguing that they are

a consequence of the widely accepted view that OTM index calls and puts are ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù and

that even the na√Øve trading rule of indiscriminately writing all OTM calls and puts is ‚Äúprofitable‚Äù.

We address this concern by showing that neither a simple heuristic for trading options based on

observed option price percentiles for buying low and selling high nor an application of the

Bernardo and Ledoit (2000) bounds lead to out of sample portfolio returns that stochastically

dominate portfolio returns that do not trade in options.

                                      [Table IX about here]

       We compare the portfolio return of an index trader with the portfolio return of an option

trader who indiscriminately writes all available calls or puts on index futures every month. The

results are presented in the first two lines of Table IX, Panel A. Both the DD (2000) and DD

(2006) tests are weakly supportive of the hypothesis that the call option trader‚Äôs returns

stochastically dominate the index trader‚Äôs returns. This conclusion is not strengthened in Panels

B and C where the trader writes the top 10% and 2.5% of the calls, respectively, because of the

reduced sample size.

       Next, we compare the portfolio return of an index trader with the portfolio return of a

na√Øve option trader who indiscriminately writes all available puts on index futures every month.

The results are presented in the second line of Table IX, Panel A. The DD (2006) test, with any

amount of trimming of the right hand tail, does not reject the hypothesis that the OT portfolio

does not dominate the IT portfolio. This suggests that indiscriminate writing of puts does not

improve the portfolio return in terms of the stochastic dominance criterion.




                                                                                                 26
       The results presented in the last two lines of Table IX, Panel A, B, and C, confirm the

obvious, that there is no evidence that indiscriminate buying of calls or puts leads to portfolio

returns that stochastically dominate the portfolio return of the index trader.

       Overall, the na√Øve trading rules work well in a quarter of the cases: they work well in

writing calls but work poorly in writing puts, buying calls, or buying puts. Thus, the limited

success of the na√Øve trading rules appears to be fortuitous. By contrast, the trading rules based

on stochastic dominance bounds work well in practically all cases: they identify good sell calls

and puts and find very few good buy calls and puts.

       Finally, we compare the portfolio return of an index trader with the portfolio return of an

alternative call trader who identifies good buy and good sell calls by applying the Bernardo and

Ledoit (BL, 2000) bounds. We apply the BL program specified for the Monte Carlo approach.

We simulate the terminal distribution for the S&P futures price under the risk neutral measure

for the future volatility estimates as before. Then for a given gain loss ratio we derive the lower

or upper bounds on call prices by applying a respective maximization or minimization program

to BL replicating portfolio constrained to satisfy this given gain loss ratio. Since we apply BL

bounds only to calls, neglecting the early exercise feature is innocuous for futures options.

Having estimated these bounds, we use them to search for the respective violations of the lower

and upper bounds as before. Note that deriving BL bounds for American put options presents

technical difficulties beyond the illustrative scope of our application.

                                       [Table X about here]

       The application of the BL bounds requires as input an exogenous parameter, the gain to

loss ratio. In Table X, Panels A and C, we report results for gain to loss ratio of 2. The results

for the upper bound are similar to the ones obtained for the CP upper bound in Table V;



                                                                                                27
however, the results for the lower bound are disastrous. Even when we increase the gain to loss

ratio to 4 (Panels B and D), which by design results in fewer good buys and good sells, these

results for the lower bound prevail when volatility is estimated unconditionally. At the same

time, we observe no evidence for stochastic dominance for the upper bound except for 90 day

volatility estimation mode; furthermore, in two cases we observe negative excess return to OT.



                                  V       Concluding Remarks


       We introduce a novel approach for empirical research in option pricing and apply it to

S&P 500 index futures options. We search for good sell and good buy American call and put

options on the S&P 500 index futures by employing stochastic dominance upper and lower

bounds on the prices of options. We find a substantial number of violations of the call upper

bounds, but relatively few violations of put upper bounds and even fewer of the call and put

lower bounds. Since the frequency of violations of these bounds is too low for statistical

inference, we focus on violations of the call upper bounds.         We observe that the highest

proportion of violations occur in the region of OTM calls, where the bounds are tight. We find,

however, that the largest number of violations are in the close to the money region and, hence,

likely to correspond to liquid options.

       We compare the portfolio return of an option trader who writes good sell calls at their bid

price with the portfolio return of an index trader who does not trade in the options over the

period 1983 to 2006. In out of sample tests, our main result is that the return of a call writer

stochastically dominates the index trader‚Äôs return, net of transaction costs and the bid ask spread.

The dominance holds under a variety of methods for estimating the underlying return




                                                                                                 28
distribution. It also holds when the trader is allowed to vary her portfolio position by adding

other risky assets beyond the index to her portfolio.

         Our results are consistent with equilibrium in a segmented market along the following

lines.   Mutual funds exert price pressure on OTM index puts because they buy them as

insurance; and overoptimistic speculators exert price pressure on OTM calls because they buy

them as a leveraged bet. Furthermore, Garleanu, Pedersen, and Poteshman (2009) argue that

dealers inflate the prices of options. As we show in the paper, this presents opportunities for

individual investors to write good sell calls and enhance their portfolio returns, net of transaction

costs, in terms of the criterion of stochastic dominance. This can be an equilibrium if the number

of such traders and the scale of their trades are sufficiently small so that they do not eliminate the

overpricing. Large investors such as hedge funds who can potentially eliminate the overpricing

do not write these good sell options in a large scale because, as Santa-Clara and Saretto (2009)

point out, they face obstacles including margin calls and lack of market depth.

                                         Appendix A: Data

       S&P 500 futures have maturities only in months in the March quarterly cycle. Options

on the S&P 500 futures have maturities either in a month in the March quarterly cycle

(‚Äúquarterly options‚Äù) or in a month not in the March quarterly cycle (‚Äúserial options‚Äù). We

consider one month quarterly options written on one month futures and one month serial options

written on futures with the shortest maturity. We obtain the time stamped quotes of the one

month S&P 500 futures options and the underlying one month futures for the period February

1983 to July 2006 from the CME tapes.

       From futures prices, we calculate the implied S&P 500 index prices by applying the cost

of carry relation Ft = (1 + Œ≥ ) ( ) RT ‚àít St + Œµ t , assuming away basis risk, Œµ t ‚â° 0 . Recall that our
                               ‚àí T F ‚àít F




goal is to compare the investment policies of the index trader and the option trader. Since both

policies stipulate approximately the same stock component, the effects of this component cancel

each other out. Also, it is common in empirical work to derive the index value from the index

futures; see, for example, Jackwerth and Rubinstein (1996).

       We obtain the daily dividend record of the S&P 500 index over the period 1928 to 2006

from the S&P 500 Information Bulletin and convert it to a constant dividend yield for each 30

day period. Before April 1982, dividends are estimated from monthly dividend yields. We

obtain the interest rate as the three month T bill rate from the Federal Reserve Statistical Release

H.15. We estimate the variance of the basis risk, var ( Œµ t ) , from the observed futures prices and

the intraday time stamped S&P 500 record obtained from the CME.

       We rescale the index price St by the multiplicative factor 100,000 / S 0 so that the index

price at the beginning of each 30 day period is 100,000. Accordingly, we rescale the futures

price, index futures option price, and strike by the same multiplicative factor.

                                                                                                     30
        We consider options maturing in 30 calendar days, which results in 247 sampling dates.

The 30 day rule eliminates the observation of the October 1987 crash from our sample.

Therefore, we use one 40 day period for October 1987 in order to observe the crash. Our results

remain unchanged. Since the first maturity of serial options was in August 1987, the first 19

periods occur with quarterly periodicity. Overall, we record 36,921 raw call quotes and 42,881

raw put quotes. After eliminating obvious data errors, we apply the following filters: minimum

15 cents for a bid quote and 25 cents for an ask quote; K/F ratio within 0.96-1.08 for calls and

within 0.92-1.04 for puts; and matching the underlying futures quote within 15 seconds. Part of

the data is lost due to the CME rule of flagging quotes, i.e. bids (asks) are flagged only if a bid

(ask) is higher (lower) than the preceding bid (ask); in addition, no transaction data is flagged.

We recover a large part of the data by analyzing the sequence between consecutive bid ask flags;

however, this recovery is not possible in all cases. As a result of the applied filters, we obtain

29,822 quotes for calls and 30,281 quotes for puts in our final sample. These quantities translate

into roughly 60 data points for all strikes for either bid or ask prices for an average day.



                                    Appendix B: Trading Policy

        We consider calls with moneyness (K/F) within the range 0.96-1.08 and puts within the

range 0.92-1.04. If we observe n call bid prices violating the call upper bound, each with

different strike price, then the option trader writes 1/ n calls of each type with the underlying

futures corresponding to the index value of y0 . The trader transfers the proceeds to the bond

account: x = x0 + ‚àë i =1 Ci / n and y = y0 .
                      n




                                                                                                31
         If we observe n put ask prices violating the put lower bound, each with different strike

price, the option trader buys 1/ n puts of each type and finances the purchase out of the bond

account: x = x0 ‚àí ‚àëi =1 Pi / n and y = y0 .
                      n




         However, when there is a violation of the upper put bound and the option trader writes

puts, the trader also sells one futures contract for each written put. The intuition for this policy

may be gleaned from the observation that the combination of a written put and a short futures

amounts to a synthetic short call. In fact, the upper put bound in equation (3) is derived from the

upper call bound in equation (2) through the observation that if we can write a put at a

sufficiently high price we violate the upper call bound by writing a synthetic call.

         Finally, when there is a violation of the lower call bound and the option trader buys calls,

the trader also sells one futures contract for each purchased call. The intuition is the same as

above.

         The early exercise policy of a call is based on the function N in equation (2). However,

whenever the option trader is short an option, each period we derive the function N based on the

forward looking distribution of daily returns, i.e. this function is derived under the empirical

distribution of the daily index returns between the option trade and the option maturity.

Effectively, we endow the counterparty of the option trader with information on the 2nd, 3rd, and

4th moments of the forward distribution, while imposing the first moment. The early exercise

policy of a call or put is simplified by the observation that the decision is a function only of time

and the ratio of the strike price to the index level.

          The sample counterpart of conditions (4) and (5), applied to the two distributions drawn

from their respective populations, is that we must have for every z in the joint support:

See DD (2000) for further details. Clearly, if (C.1) is violated at any point in the interior of the

joint support, the null of non dominance cannot be rejected. On the other hand, (C.1) becomes,

by definition, equality at one or both endpoints of the support. The DD (2006) test deals with

this problem by restricting the set of points over which (C.1)-(C.2) are estimated.

          DD (2000) provide a test of the null hypothesis H 0 : OT ;2 IT in terms of the maximal

and minimal values of the extremal test statistic TÀÜ ( z ) , defined below. The null is not rejected, if

the maximal value of the statistic is positive and statistically significant and the minimal value of

the statistic is either positive or negative and statistically not significant. As opposed to DD

(2006), this test may provide evidence for stochastic dominance even if we observe a negative

statistic TÀÜ ( z ) .

          The variable z denotes the annualized arithmetic return of a trader, where the subscripts

IT and OT distinguish between the index trader and the option trader. The statistic TÀÜ ( z ) is

defined as follows:

The maximal and minimal values of the statistic are calculated as a maximum and minimum of

(C.3) over a set of points of z, as explained below. Stoline and Ury (1979) provide tables for the

nonstandard distribution of the maximal and minimal value of TÀÜ ( z ) at the 1%, 5%, and 10%

levels. In principle, the number of points in this joint support over which the test may be

performed needs to be restricted since a ‚Äòlarge‚Äô number of these points violate the independence

assumption between the TÀÜ ( z ) s. Therefore, we compute these statistics for 20 points, equally

spaced in the joint support of WIT and WOT (including the endpoints) which corresponds to k =

20 in the Stoline and Ury (1979) tables.

       By contrast, DD (2006) develop the concept of restricted stochastic dominance in testing

                             / 2 IT . The test derives the minimal TÀÜ ( z ) -statistic over a suitably
the null hypothesis H 0 : OT ;


                                                                                                                                34
restricted interval in the joint support for IT and OT. The restriction for the testing interval

comes from the observation that a minimal TÀÜ ( z ) -statistic may not be significant by any

distributional standards in the tails of the distribution, be it a sample or a population. It can be

easily shown that the leftmost t-statistic is approximately equal to 1, by construction. The

numerator of the rightmost t-statistic is simply given by (C.1) the difference of the sample

means, which implies that testing for SSD at the largest observed outcome corresponds to testing

for the significance in the difference in the sample means; this condition is much stronger than

necessary for SSD. Having derived the minimal TÀÜ ( z ) -statistic in a restricted interval, the DD

(2006) test applies a bootstrap procedure to the entire data to derive the p-value for the test as

described below.

       A necessary condition for applying DD (2006) is that condition (C.1) holds for our

sample.   By our trading strategies, condition (C.1) holds over the left side of the return

distribution. Its validity, therefore, needs to be tested only over the right side, in which case it

corresponds to the positivity of the difference of the means of the two samples. We verify this

positivity in all cases and, wherever it is satisfied in the sample, we subject it to further

verification by block bootstrapping 10 years of results from our data. In almost all cases the

bootstrap results confirm the sign of the means‚Äô difference.

       The test statistic TÀÜ ( z ) is the same as in DD (2000) and is given by (C.3)-(C.6). This

statistic is computed for the values of z that are sample points within the restricted interval, i.e.,

in this interval we have coupled observations of WIT and WOT , transformed to annualized

arithmetic returns. As opposed to the DD (2000) test, there is no restriction on the number of

these points and we compute the minimal value of TÀÜ ( z ) in the restricted interval. It may be

shown that TÀÜ ( z ) is monotonic between the sample points; therefore the minimal value of TÀÜ ( z )

                                                                                                   35
may be found only at a sample point. If the minimal value is negative anywhere in the full

support, the null of non dominance is accepted with p-value of 1. In this regard, the DD (2006)

test is more conservative than the DD (2000) test. The latter test verifies whether an extreme

negative TÀÜ ( z ) is significant for the null   H 0 : IT ;2 OT   while the former test accepts the null of non

dominance. Otherwise, we apply the bootstrap approach for the derivation of the p-values for

the null hypothesis, as described in detail in DD (2006) and Davidson (2007). These are simply

the number of cases for which the minimal TÀÜ ( z ) under the bootstrap distribution exceeds the

minimum TÀÜ ( z ) of our sample divided by the number of bootstraps.

          In our tests, we use 999 bootstrap replications in order to derive the p-values in the tables.

The bootstrap procedure samples all observed coupled values of WIT and WOT under artificial

probabilities derived for the empirical likelihood maximization under the condition that that the

T ( z)   is set equal to zero at the sample point at which it attains its minimum. See Davidson

(2007) for further details.

          There is a cost in adopting the DD (2006) null, because, as it can be analytically shown,

this null cannot be rejected over the entire support of the sample distribution. DD (2006)

overcome this problem by restricting the interval over which the null may be rejected to the

interior of the support, excluding points at the edges. They then show by simulation that

inference on the basis of this restricted interval constitutes the most powerful available inference

on the existence of stochastic dominance. In the case of correlated (coupled) samples, the

procedure for restricting the interval in the right tail is to start by trimming two pairs of data

points: one with the maximal WIT and the corresponding WOT , and one with the maximal WOT

and the corresponding WIT . We continue in a similar way until the desired degree of trimming is

reached. An analogous procedure is implemented in the left tail. Note that the DD (2006) test
                                                                                                           36
results for such a procedure are more conservative than those resulting from trimming pairs of

observations in the extremes of the tails of the distribution, irrespective of the sample (OT or IT)

to which this extreme belongs.

       In the online Appendix C, using simulated data with characteristics that mirror our

sample, we compute the rejection probabilities of the null hypothesis when it is true as well as

when it is false. DD (2006) is a weak test without trimming, since it has very low probabilities

of rejection of the non dominance null even when it is false. With 5% trimming, the test is still

conservative as far as rejecting the false non dominance null. Problems with rejection of the null

when it is true occur only for deep out of the money options. For this reason, we repeat the

stochastic dominance tests for the call upper bound in Panel A of Table V for a restricted

moneyness range, i.e. by removing violating OTM calls outside the range from the sample. The

results are reported in Table I and remain essentially unchanged.

The errors are defined as the difference between the monthly volatility and the volatility predicted by a given mode.
The unconditional volatility is the sample standard deviation over the period January 1928 to January 1983. The 90
day volatility is the sample standard deviation over the preceding 90 trading days. The adjusted IV is the ATM IV
on the preceding day, adjusted by the mean prediction error for all dates preceding the given date, where we drop
from the preceding days all 21 pre crash observations. The EGARCH volatility is the volatility using EGARCH
coefficients estimated for S&P 500 daily returns over January 1928 to January 1983 and applied to residuals
observed over the 90 days preceding each sample date to form projections of the volatility realized till the option
expiration date.

Equally weighted average of all violating options equivalent to one option per share was traded at each date. The
symbols * and ** denote a difference in sample means of the OT and IT traders significant at the 5% and 1% levels in
a one sided bootstrap test with 9,999 trials. Maximal t-statistics for Davidson and Duclos (DD, 2000) test are
compared to critical values of Studentized Maximum Modulus Distribution tabulated in Stoline and Ury (1979) for
three nominal levels of 1, 5, and 10% with k = 20 and ŒΩ = ‚àû . The p-values for H 0 : OT ;2 IT are greater than 10%,
the highest nominal level available in the Stoline and Ury (1979) tables. The p-values for the Davidson and Duclos
(2006) test are based on 999 bootstrap trials. The p-values for H 0 : IT ;/ 2 OT are equal to one.

Equally weighted average of all violating options was traded at each date. The symbols * and ** denote a difference
in sample means of the OT and IT traders significant at the 5% and 1% levels in a one sided bootstrap test with
9,999 trials. Maximal t-statistics for Davidson and Duclos (DD, 2000) test are compared to critical values of
Studentized Maximum Modulus Distribution tabulated in Stoline and Ury (1979) for three nominal levels of 1, 5,
and 10% with k = 20 and ŒΩ = ‚àû . The p-values for H 0 : OT ;2 IT are greater than 10%, the highest nominal level

Figure 1. Illustration of upper and lower bounds on call and put options. Bounds are derived for œÉ = 0.20
imposed on a 90 day past distribution of daily S&P 500 returns for May 22, 1996. 95% upper and lower confidence
intervals represented by dotted lines are derived by bootstrapping the 90 day distribution. The results exemplify the
dependence of the bounds on the third and fourth moments of the distribution because the width in of the confidence
intervals is determined solely by varying the skewness and kurtosis, i.e. the bootstrap changes only these quantities.

Figure 2. Time distribution of observed violations. The crosses display the violations of the call upper bound for the
period February 1983 to July 2006. For the adjusted IV distribution, the first 21 dates are not in the sample. To facilitate
presentation, the S&P Index was transformed to a logarithmic scale. The inception date of the VIX index was on
February 4th, 1986. The value for VIX just prior to the October 1987 crash was 170% and is trimmed to facilitate
presentation.

    In the online appendix A, we demonstrate the ability of the lower bounds to identify good buy options by showing

that a portfolio with long positions in options bought at artificial prices equal to the lower bound stochastically

dominates a portfolio without them.
2
    In the absence of transaction costs and additional state variables, Oancea and Perrakis (2009) show that the bounds

nest the jump diffusion and stochastic volatility option pricing models.

    For example, a trader who holds 100 shares of stock and a net short position in 200 call options violates the

monotonicity condition, while a trader who holds 200 shares of stock and a net short position in 200 call options

satisfies the condition. Essentially, we assume that the traders have a sufficiently large investment in the stock,

relative to their net short position in call options (or, net long positions in put options), such that the monotonicity

condition is satisfied.

    The reservation write price of a call is derived from the perspective of a trader who is marginal in the index, the

bond, and only one type of call or put option at a time. Therefore, these bounds allow for the possibility that the

options market is segmented.

    We prove equation (3) by noting that an investor achieves an arbitrage profit by buying a call at C ( Ft , St , t ) ,

writing a put at P , P > P ( Ft , S t , t ) , selling one futures, and lending K ‚àí R              Ft . In the proof, we ignore the daily

marking to market on the futures until the exercise of the put or the options‚Äô maturity, whichever comes first. This

matters little because the investor has a large investment in the bond which suffices to cover margin calls.

    We start with the 22nd month. We use the holdout sample of the first 21 months to estimate the mean adjustment

error and adjust the IV of the 22nd month. We use the holdout sample of the first 22 months to estimate the mean

adjustment error and adjust the IV of the 23rd month; and so on.

    We form the volatility projections by iterating from day t + 1 till the option maturity T, as explained in Baillie and

Bollerslev (1992). We use as inputs the past 90 day residuals and the model coefficients estimated in the pre sample

period. In the final step, we sum up the forecasted squared residuals to derive the variance forecast for a given

period. The estimated model coefficients were as follows: Œ∫ -0.10451, ARCH (1) 0.16620, GARCH(1) 0.98799,

leverage -0.05969.

    We annualize returns since times to maturity vary from 28 to 31 days in our sample. Since transaction costs are

present in our economy, we derive returns for the liquidation of the risky asset under the assumed one way

transaction costs rate of 0.5%.

    The theory in Constantinides and Perrakis (2007) has not produced a tight upper bound for put futures options.

The bound in (3) is a weak filter extracted from the combination of the call upper bound and put call parity.
