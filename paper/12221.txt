                                            ABSTRACT

Using National Youth Survey (NYS) data, we examine the relationship of current criminal activity
and past arrests using an ordered probit model with unobserved heterogeneity. Past arrests raise
current criminal activity only for the non-criminal type, while past criminal experience raises current
criminal activity for both types. Also, the age crime profile peaks at age 18 for non-criminal type
individuals, but for criminal type individuals, it continues to rise with age. Past research indicates
that age arrest profiles rise till age 18 and then fall for both types, suggesting lower apprehension
rates for criminal type individuals.

1. Introduction
       In this paper, we use data from the National Youth Survey (NYS) to investigate

the determinants of the criminal behavior of young men.1 Our work is, we believe, the

first in the economics literature to incorporate three important factors affecting criminal

behavior: arrests, criminal experience, and observed and unobserved individual

characteristics such as family and social background and unobserved types. Past work has

only looked at subsets of these and hence could have obtained misleading results.

Distinguishing between these factors is of vital importance in designing effective anti-

crime policies. For example, allowing for more than one type is important. Suppose that

there are two types: the criminal type and the non-criminal type. The criminal type

commits crimes repeatedly while the non-criminal type does not. If past arrests result in

more crimes today by the non-criminal type, but not by the criminal type, then policies

that are tough on first time offenders could well be self-defeating!

       NYS contains self-reported data on arrests as well as on crimes committed. We

use this information to identify the arrest effect and the criminal experience effect. We

use the term “arrest effect” to mean the overall effect of past arrests on individuals’

criminal behavior. The arrest effect has at least three components: the perceived

probability effect, the stigma effect and the criminal training effect.

       Upon arrest, an individual may update his perceived probability of being caught

and punished upward, which makes him less likely to commit a crime in the future (i.e.,

the perceived probability effect, see Lochner, (2000)). Arrests and convictions cause

stigma, which may decrease earnings in legitimate activities, making crime more

attractive. Also, when incarcerated, he cannot commit crimes, though he may learn

criminal skills from fellow prisoners and thus accumulate criminal training (see Bayer,
Pintoff and Posen, (2004)). The former would reduce current crimes (and arrests) while

the latter would raise current crimes (and reduce current arrests).

       Similarly, the “experience effect” captures the overall effect of past criminal

experience on current criminal behavior, other things being constant. The experience

effect has at least two components: the learning by doing effect and the effect via

perceived probability. An individual could become more skilled at committing crimes

with experience, i.e., leaning by doing. In addition, an individual may update his

perceived probability of arrest downwards: more past crimes, given arrests, would tend to

reduce the perceived probability of arrest, and increase crimes today.

       In order to capture observed heterogeneity, we include as explanatory variables

information on schooling, employment and parental background. In order to allow for

unobserved heterogeneities, we incorporate random effects on the constant term. In

addition, we allow slope coefficient estimates to differ across the two unobserved types.

The estimation results indicate that the two types could be interpreted as the non-criminal

type and the criminal type.

       It is well known that individuals differ in their criminal behavior: most people do

not commit crimes regularly, whereas a small fraction of the population commits most of

the crimes. One of our is to see how the criminal types differ from the non-criminal types,

not only in terms of the overall likelihood of committing crimes, but also in terms of the

effect of past arrests and past criminal experience on current criminal behavior. However,

it is inappropriate to simply assign types to individuals based on their arrest or criminal

history. We infer individual’s types by estimating a mixture model that allows us to have

different parameters for the two types. The behavioral parameters for the two types as
well as the posterior probability (given characteristics) that an individual is of one type or

of the other should be determined so as to best replicate the data.2 This is basically the

approach taken here in using the “mixture” model. In Section 5, we show that we do need

to take this approach, as the results from taking the simplistic approach are very different

from those when the model is appropriately specified.

       We use an ordered probit setting. This allows for the fact that most people do not

commit any crimes. In addition, it improves over the simple probit setting as it also

utilizes information about the number of crimes committed.3

       Our estimation results are summarized as follows: The criminal experience effect

is significantly positive for the non-criminal type, both before age 18 and after. It is

positive for the criminal type as well, though insignificant after age 18. Importantly, the

arrest effect turns out to be quite different between the two types. In particular, after age

18, the arrest effect for the criminal type is significantly negative, while it is significantly

positive for the non-criminal type.4 We also find that controlling for other variables, the

crime rate increases with age even after age 18 for the criminal type, whereas it decreases

with age after age 18 for the non-criminal type.5 This result highlights the importance of

using data on criminal activity and not just on arrests. In Imai and Krishna (2004), for

example, it is shown that arrests of the criminal type fall off even faster than those of the

non-criminal type after the age of 18. Our results indicate that this should not be

interpreted as evidence that their criminal activity follows a similar path, rather, that

criminal types become better at evading arrest after 18. In terms of policy, our results

suggest that tough on crime policy may be more effective for repeat offenders since

arrests seem to serve as a deterrent for criminal types.
       There has been some recent work by economists analyzing criminal behavior

using individual level data. Viscusi (1986) uses cross sectional data to argue that criminal

behavior responds to economic incentives. Tauchen, Witte and Griesinger (1994) use the

Philadelphia Birth Cohort Study panel and run a probit (with random effects) of arrests

on past arrests and other variables including police spending. They find that past arrests

have a positive coefficient and police spending has a negative coefficient.

       Self-reported criminal activity data is used by Grogger (1998), Lochner (2004)

and Mocan and Rees (1999). Using a probit approach, Grogger (1998) shows that

criminal activity rises when labor market conditions worsen. Lochner (2004) uses both

arrest and criminal activity data to show that education reduces arrests as well as criminal

activities. Mocan and Rees (1999) estimate criminal choice equations using an ordered

probit approach. Their focus is on the possible determinants of crime including

employment conditions that vary across regions. However, none of them look at the

effect of past criminal activity or arrests on current crime.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the

ordered probit model of crime and the estimation strategy. In Section 3, we discuss our

data. In Section 4, we present the estimation results and their implications. In Section 5,

we conclude by outlining some work in progress that extends our model in various

directions.

2. Model Specification

       To capture the relationship between crimes, arrests and unobserved heterogeneity

we estimate a standard ordered probit model of criminal choice: for individual i at time t,

the following equation describes his criminal behavior:
                          yit* = bi + ϕ0 + xit′ ϕ1 + ε it                            (1)


where

                                  ε it ~ Φ (⋅) .


We assume the error term is i.i.d. and its distribution function is standard normal. bi is

the mean-zero random effects on the constant term and ϕ0 is the constant term. xit is a

vector of time-varying explanatory variables of individual i at time t. The elements of this

vector include age, past arrest records,6 number of past crimes committed7 (for criminal

experience), total past years of schooling, total past years of work, etc. yit* is the

unobserved latent index variable representing the propensity to commit crimes. We only

have limited information on the number of crimes individual i committed in period t: we

know the category into which this number falls but not the exact count. Let yit denote

this category. We specify that

                       yit = 1 (commit no crime) if yit* ≤ µ1 ,
                       y it = 2 (commit 1 to 2 crimes) if µ1 < yit* ≤ µ 2 ,
                       y it = 3 (commit 3 to 11 crimes) if µ 2 < yit* ≤ µ3 ,
                       y it = 4 (commit 12 to 30 crimes) if µ3 < yit* ≤ µ 4 ,
                       y it = 5 (commit 31 crimes or more) if µ 4 < yit* .

We define µ0 = −∞ and µ5 = +∞ , and normalize µ1 to be 0 for identification.

        We allow for unobserved heterogeneities both in the constant term as well as the

other coefficients. 8 First, we allow for two types with potentially different parameters so

that their behavior could differ.9 Second, we allow for the mean-zero random effects on

the constant term, as done by Tauchen et al. (1994) among others. Even though we

incorporate some observable characteristics of individuals that affect their chances of
committing a crime, there may be many other individual characteristics that matter, but

are unobservable to the econometrician. Including random effects in the constant term is

a way of capturing such time-invariant effects, at least partially.10

       As discussed above, in our estimation model, past criminal records are

endogenous. Since the schooling and work choice are not explicitly modeled, both past

years of schooling and past years of work are assumed to be strictly exogenous. 11

Because of the poor quality of schooling and work data in NYS, we decided to leave the

estimation of a more formal model of schooling, work and crime choice for future

research. We also assumed that given past criminal history, past arrests are exogenous.

We believe that this assumption is reasonable since individuals do not directly choose the

number of arrests.12

       When lagged criminal experience enters into the right hand side, we face a

problem known as the Initial Conditions Problem (see Heckman (1981)). Since initial

criminal experience and the random intercept term are correlated, the coefficient estimate

of the lagged experience is biased. We use a method similar to Wooldridge (2000) to deal

with this problem. That is, we can rewrite the random effects term as follows:

                bi = θ 0 + θ1CEi 0 + θ 2WE i + θ 3 HE i + xi′   4   + ηi


where CEi 0 is the initial period criminal experience, WE i is the time-average of the

number of years of employment after age 18, and HE i is the time-average of the highest

grade attended by the individual. xi is a vector of time-constant covariates such as family

background. η i is assumed to be mean-zero normally distributed and uncorrelated with

y i*0 . Then, equation (1) can be rewritten as follows:
        yit* = (θ 0 + ϕ0 ) + θ1CEi 0 + θ 2WE i + θ 3 HE i + xi′   4   + xit′ ϕ1 + ηi + ε it            (2)


where (θ 0 + ϕ 0 ) is the constant term to be estimated, and η i is the new random effects

term.

         Incorporating heterogeneities in the ordered probit estimation involves integration

over both the latent error term ε , the random effect of the constant term η , and the type

heterogeneity. We adopt a Bayesian approach suggested by Albert and Chib (1993). We

choose to do so for computational reasons. With the Bayesian approach, integration over

the latent error term and the random effect term can be done straightforwardly as part of

the simulation process of the posterior distribution. This is known as the Markov Chain

Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Geweke, Keane and Runkle (1997), using the

multinomial probit model as an example, argue that the Bayesian MCMC method works

well compared to other standard estimation techniques, such as Simulated Maximum

Likelihood or Simulated Method of Moments. The major difficulty in Bayesian

estimation has been computing the posterior distribution if its dimension, which equals

the number of parameters, 43 in our case, is very high. Using the MCMC procedure,

more specifically, the Gibbs sampler algorithm, allows us to simulate the posterior

distribution in manageable blocks.

         The parameters that need to be estimated are those in equation (2) which

determines yit* . This includes the random intercept term ηi . We denote the vector of

other coefficients to be          . They include constant terms, the coefficients for the past

arrests and past criminal experience, and coefficients for the observed individual

characteristics described in Table 2 to Table 4. We allow                          to take on different values
depending on the type. The other parameters we estimate are the threshold parameters γ 2

to γ 4 and the variance of the random effects denoted d . We also estimate the prior type

probability λ which can roughly be interpreted as the proportion of criminal type

individuals in the population.

       The estimation procedures are described in detail in Appendix 1. We set up the

priors for d and   {   (s)
                             , λ( s )   }

where INVWISH (v, G ) is the Inverted Wishart distribution with the degree of freedom v

and the scale matrix G, and D(α1 ,α 2 ) is the Dirichlet distribution with parameters α1 and

α 2 . The prior distribution of the threshold parameters γ is assumed to be completely

diffuse.

3. Data

       The National Youth Survey (NYS) we use contains a random sample of 1,725

individuals from ages 11 to 17 in 1976. Individuals were surveyed annually from 1976 to

1980; then again in 1983 and 1986.

       From 76 to 80 as well as for 83 and 86, we have data on the number of crimes

committed in that year. But in 1981, 1982, and 1984, 1985, the exact numbers of crimes

committed are not available. Instead, we only know in which of the four categories (0, 1-

2, 3-11, 12-) their criminal activity falls, which was part of the reason for using the

ordered probit approach. In order to construct the past criminal activity variable, we
impute the number of crimes committed in each category to be the lower end point.14

Moreover, only the criminal activity of last three years is used. This is a simple way to

model the depreciation of past criminal activities. The results seem to be robust to using

other specifications.

       The data on arrests are limited in that total arrests in the past two years are

available only for years 1983 and 1986. Total arrests to date are recorded for 1980 and

1983. To fill in the missing arrest records, we evenly spread the incremental arrests over

the intervening years.

       We only use the male sample in the data as males commit most of the crimes.

There are 918 male individuals in the data set. We exclude individuals who have

incomplete responses for arrests in 1980, 1983, or 1986 since we cannot recover the

arrest variable for these individuals from the data. The total number of male individuals

in the data set is 1725, Furthermore, we exclude individuals who have incomplete

responses for crimes committed on 1978, 1979 and 1980 since for these individuals, we

cannot recover the criminal experience variable from the data. Having done this gives us

a final sample of 612 individuals.

       Table 1-4 show some sample statistics and Table 5 contains information on the

types of crimes included. Figure 1 depicts the age mean crime profile which differs from

the conventional age arrest profile. It has a peak at age 13, and is flat thereafter. This is

surprising since most age arrest profiles in the literature have a pronounced peak around

age 18. Figure 2 depicts the modified age mean crime profile, where for each age, the top

3% of the individuals, i.e., those who committed the most crimes, are removed. After

such outlier removal, the age crime mean profile is a smooth function of age, and has a
peak around age 18. It resembles the conventional age arrest profiles more than the

original profile suggesting that the self-reported crime data has some outliers. We also

plot the percentage of individuals at each age who committed at least one crime during

that year. From the age crime participation profile in Figure 3, we can see that in one

year, about 30% of the individuals commit crimes at least once. We also can see that the

variation of the age-crime participation profile is smaller than that of the age mean crime

profile. This is because the variation in numbers of crimes committed is ignored if we

only focus on the discrete choice of whether the person committed crime at least once or

not during one year. That is exactly why we use an ordered probit model for estimation.

4. Estimation Results

       Table 6 (Model 1) contains the parameter estimates as well as the standard errors.

The two unobserved types are called type 1 and type 2. We term these the non-criminal

type and the criminal type respectively as type 1 commits fewer crimes at all ages. The

probability of the criminal type is estimated to be about 0.12. This is similar to the

estimate found in Imai and Krishna (2004).

       Other things constant, the crime rate for the non-criminal type increases with age

before age 18 and decreases with age after age 18. For the criminal type, however, the

crime rate increases with age even after age 18. Imai and Krishna’s results (2004) suggest

that the arrest rate for the criminal type decreases more rapidly with age than for the non-

criminal type. However, this need not imply that the age crime profile does the same if

the criminal type becomes better at avoiding arrests after the age 18. Our results show

that this is indeed the case, at least in the National Youth Survey data. In Figure 4, we

plot the age mean crime profiles of the non-criminal type and the criminal type. This
confirms the results that for the criminal type, crimes increase after the age 18, especially

after the age 22.

       The criminal experience effect (i.e., the coefficient on the crimes committed over

the last 3 years) is positive both for the non-criminal type and the criminal type. Before

age 18, the criminal experience effect is larger for the criminal type than for the non-

criminal type.

       The arrest effect (i.e., the coefficient on the past arrest record) is positive and

significant for the non-criminal type both before and after age 18. It is negative for the

criminal type, though only significant after age 18. One interpretation of this is that the

non-criminal type would be more stigmatized upon arrest than the criminal type. Thus,

the stigma and training effect discussed earlier could dominate the perceived probability

effect for non-criminal type individuals but would not do so for criminal type individuals.

If a criminal type individual already has a bad reputation, then it is not surprising that his

stigma effect is smaller.15

       The coefficient on schooling (the highest grade attended by the individual) is

positive for the non-criminal type and is negative though not significant for the criminal

type. This does not imply that schooling increases crime, because current schooling is not

included in the variables. It could be that past schooling is negatively correlated with

current schooling and current schooling decreases crime. The coefficients on employment

(the number of years of employment after age 18) are insignificantly different from zero.

To fully understand the effect of schooling and employment, we need to estimate a model

of criminal behavior where schooling and employment choices are endogenous.16
        Coefficients on the family backgrounds for both types have the expected sign,

parents’ presence in the home has the expected effect, even though not significant, in that

it reduces criminal activity. Also note that for both types, individuals whose parents

graduated from high school seem to commit fewer crimes, perhaps as the families are

better off and so the children have more to lose. Other coefficients have expected signs or

are not significantly different from zero.

        It is worth noting that it is not straightforward to interpret coefficients on the time-

constant covariates such as race and family background. That is because they also contain

the Wooldridge initial conditions corrections term. In other words, even if the coefficient

of a race dummy is positive, it is unclear whether the individual belonging to the race is

more likely to commit a crime or to have high criminal experience prior to the sample

period, leading to high crimes in the future. Therefore, one should not over emphasize the

differences in the estimates across types though they have reasonable signs for the most

part.

        In Table 6 (Model 2), we report the estimation results in which, as is often done in

the crime literature, we include past arrests, but do not include past crimes committed, as

explanatory variables. Notice both before and after 18, the arrest coefficients for the non-

criminal type are positive though not always significant. When criminal activity is

included, both coefficients are positive and significant. The arrest coefficients for the

criminal type are negative both before and after 18 but are not significant. When criminal

activity is included, both coefficients are negative and the coefficient after age 18 is

significant.
       We conclude that adding past criminal activity to the regressors increases the

significance of the arrest coefficients, and in some cases, dramatically changes their

magnitude, for example, for the non-criminal type and for the criminal type after age 18.

This is likely due to the omitted variable bias. The direction of the bias is less clear

because past crimes are likely to be correlated not only to past arrests, but also to age, and

random effects term. Furthermore, it is also worth mentioning that the precision of the

random effects term is larger for the original specification ( d −1 = 1.086) than that for the

specification which does not include past criminal experience in the regressor

( d −1 = 0.455) . This suggests that part of criminal behavior attributed to past crimes

should be attributed to unobserved heterogeneities at the individual level

       Table 7 shows the marginal effects of the coefficient estimates for our model, i.e.,

the effect of a marginal change of a regressor on the probability of zero crimes, crimes

less than or equal to 2, crimes less than or equal to 11, and crimes less than or equal to 30.

The marginal effect measures the change in probability due to a small change in the

variables.17 It is evaluated by setting the parameters at the posterior mean and variables at

the sample mean. Hence, being black raises the probability (by .13) of committing no

crimes. All the signs and magnitudes of the marginal effects make sense and are

consistent with the parameter estimates. For example, for the non-criminal type, a unit

increase in age decreases the probability of not committing any crimes before age 18

by .0293 but increases it after age 18 by .0061. Recall that the coefficient for age for the

non-criminal type was positive below age 18 and negative after 18. Before and after the

age 18, an increase in log arrests and log past crimes reduces the probability of no crimes

committed.
       For the criminal type, an increase in age reduces the probability of committing

crimes less than or equal to 30 times a year, i.e., an increase in age increases the

probability of committing crimes more than 30 times a year. This is not so for the non-

criminal type. Table 7 indicates that for the non-criminal type, most of the changes occur

at the margin of criminal participation. This is because most of the non-criminal types do

not commit any crimes. On the other hand, for the criminal type, most of the changes

occur around the probability of committing 11 to 30 crimes, as can be seen from the fact

that changes occur disproportionately at the cumulative probability of committing less

than 30 crimes. This again comes from the fact that criminal type typically commits more

than 10 crimes per year. It is interesting to see clear differences between the non-criminal

and the criminal types with respect to which range of the numbers of crimes committed

the marginal change has the most impact on.

       In addition to our original model, we estimate a model without incorporating

unobserved types and compare it to the original model. Table 8 provides the estimation

results. The after age 18 coefficient on past arrests in this model is estimated in between

the coefficient for the criminal type and that for the non-criminal type in our original

model. Thus, it is essential for an empirical model of crime to allow unobserved types to

have different coefficients. In this respect, past literature that does not allow for

unobserved types can fail to suggest effective policies as discussed in the introduction.

       In Table 9, we report the proportions of crimes that the non-criminal type and the

criminal type commit. Here, we classified an individual as a non-criminal type if the

posterior probability of being a non-criminal type is more than 50%. As can be seen,

criminal type individuals tend to commit crimes like carrying hidden weapons and selling
drugs. Even though drug related crimes also occur for the non-criminal type, they are

much less likely, while minor crimes such as stealing less than $50 are more common.

       Finally, we look at the results of sample splitting, the simplistic approach to

dealing with heterogeneity. Specifically, we split the sample into the two groups. We

ordered individuals by the number of crimes committed and estimated the model for the

top 12 percent and the remaining 88 separately. We chose the 12 percent break based

upon the type probability of criminals being 12 percent in the mixture model. Table 10

provides the estimation results. The results show that coefficients on arrests and crimes

tend not to be significant: only the criminal human capital coefficient for the low end of

the sample is significant. This is because the assignment of types is based on total

criminal activities, which is endogenous. For example, individuals who, despite the low

past criminal experience, belong to the criminal type must have high current and future

crimes, resulting in negative bias on the past crime coefficients for the criminal type. This

confirms the hazards of such a simplistic approach.

5. Conclusion

       In this paper we have focused on the determinants of criminal activity as opposed

to arrests. Our main results are threefold.

       First, there is reason to believe that criminal type individuals and non-criminal

type individuals behave differently. Not allowing for such differences leads to misleading

results: as shown, the estimates when we do not allow for two types differ considerably

from those when we do. Second, we show that criminal behavior depends not just on past

arrests, but also on past criminal experience. Neglecting this tends to bias the effect of

arrests on crime upwards as discussed earlier. Third, we show that it is inappropriate to
look at the age arrest profile and assume it reflects the age crime profile. The age arrest

profile differs from the age crime profile and differs across types as well. Just because the

arrest rate for the criminal type decreases more rapidly with age than that for the non-

criminal type does not mean that criminal behavior does.

        Our work has a number of policy implications. First, since criminal types differ

from non-criminal types in their behavior, policies towards them should differ. Recall

that the coefficient on arrests for criminal type is negative and significant after the age 18

and positive and significant for the non-criminal type. This suggests that arrests increase

criminal behavior for the non-criminal type, but not for the criminal type. Thus, tough on

crime policies for the criminal type individuals look more attractive than for the non-

criminal type individuals, suggesting leniency towards first time offenders and harshness

towards repeat offenders, such as the “three strikes and you are out” one might be on the

right track.

        Second, our work suggests that habitual criminals seem to be able to evade

arrests. The age crime profile of criminal type individuals is increasing in age while their

age arrest profile is decreasing after 18. There seems to be a significant criminal human

capital effect for both types. This suggests that targeting police activity towards known

criminals might be useful.

        To get a better understanding of the factors affecting criminal behavior, we need

to consider at least two additional elements, namely past convictions and the perceived

probability of punishment. If we had the latter, then the coefficient on criminal activity

would more clearly capture criminal human capital. Moreover, the coefficient on arrests
would better capture any stigma associated with arrests alone. Finally, the coefficient on

conviction would capture both learned criminal behavior and stigma due to conviction.

       It would also be worthwhile constructing and estimating the determinants of

arrests, conviction as well as the perceived probability of punishment18 simultaneously

with that of criminal choice. Such a setup would help cast light on questions like: is there

a race bias in arrests and convictions? Are habitual criminals indeed able to better evade

arrest? If the coefficient on past criminal activity for criminal types in the arrest equation

is negative, this might suggest habitual criminals are indeed better at evading arrests. If

the coefficient on past arrests for them is positive, a “rap sheet effect” is suggested, i.e.,

known criminals are more likely to be caught.

Appendix 1: Estimation Procedure

            The Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is straight forward

and avoids the difficulties inherent in dealing with posterior distributions which are

complex high dimensional functions of the parameters. It simulates the posterior

distribution by drawing sequentially from a series of conditional distributions of lower

dimension which converge in distribution to the posterior distribution.

            We also include a simulation step termed "Data Augmentation". This simulates

the latent variable yit* which is a latent variable and not observable. Once the latent

variable yit* is drawn, the Ordered Probit estimation becomes a straightforward Bayesian

linear regression estimation.

            Let us denote Z ∈ {1,2} to be the type of the individual. The variables that need to

be simulated are: (Z , y * ,η , β , d −1 , λ , γ ) . y and X are given in the data. The MCMC

algorithm in this case is a chain of the following steps:

Set the initial values [Z ( 0 ) , y *( 0) ,η ( 0) , β ( 0) , d −1( 0) , λ( 0 ) , γ ( 0 ) ]

            STEP 1: Draw Z (1) given [y *(0 ) ,η ( 0) , β ( 0) , d −1( 0 ) , λ( 0 ) , γ ( 0) , y, X ]

            STEP 2: Draw y *(1) given [Z (1) ,η ( 0) , β ( 0) , d −1( 0) , λ( 0) , γ ( 0) , y, X ]

            STEP 3: Draw η (1) given [Z (1) , y *(1) , β ( 0) , d −1( 0 ) , λ( 0 ) , γ ( 0 ) , y, X ]

            STEP 4: Draw β (1) given [Z (1) , y *(1) ,η (1) , d −1( 0) , λ( 0) , γ ( 0) , y, X ]

            STEP 5: Draw d −1(1) given [Z (1) , y *(1) ,η (1) , β (1) , λ( 0) , γ ( 0) , y, X ]

            STEP 6: Draw λ(1) given [Z (1) , y *(1) ,η (1) , β (1) , d −1(1) , γ ( 0 ) , y , X ]

            STEP 7: Draw γ (1) given [Z (1) , y *(1) ,η (1) , β (1) , d −1(1) , λ(1) , y, X ]
Repeat Step 1 to Step 7 with the new initial values [Z (1) , y *(1) ,η (1) , β (1) , d −1(1) , λ(1) , γ (1) ].

Below, we discuss in more details the simulation algorithms of each conditional draws.

              Let P (i, s ) be the probability that individual i is of type s for s = 1,2. Recall that

λs denotes the type probability. Hence,

The full conditional density of zi is:

 S
         I ( zi = s ) P(i, s )
s =1



which is used to draw the value for zi .

2. Draw [y it | Z ,η , β , d −1 , λ , γ , y, X ]

              The full conditional density of yit* is as follows. Given the draw for the type just

obtained, and the remainder of the parameters and data, we obtain the conditional density

function of yit* to be

  (                        )(
I γ j −1 < yit* ≤ γ j φ yit* | ηi + xit′ β ( s ) ,1                 )
where I (⋅) is an indicator function and φ ( yit* | ηi + xit′ β ( s ) ,1) is a normal distribution with

mean ηi + xit′ β (s ) and a variance of unity. Thus, draw yit* from the normal distribution,

      (                           )
N ηi + xit′ β (s ) ,1 truncated at the left by γ j −1 and to the right by γ j .

3. Draw [η i | Z , y * , β , d −1 , λ , γ , y, X ]:

                The full conditional density of ηi is


  (                     )∏ φ (y                                             )
                         T
φ ηi | 0, d ( s )                         *

                         t =1



Thus, draw ηi from N η̂i , dˆi where                   (           )
                        (y                         )

            ( )

                         −1
                              +T .


4. Draw [β ( s ) | Z , y * ,η , d −1 , λ , γ , y, X ] :

                The full conditional density of β ( s ) is the same as the posterior density for the

regression parameter in the normal linear model

Y **( s ) = X ( s ) β ( s ) + ε ( s ) , ε ( s ) ~ N n ( s )T (0, I )

when the types are separated and where n( s ) denotes the number of individuals of type s

which defines the dimension of the above normal distribution. X ( s ) and Y ( s ) are the

stacked matrix and vector for the separated types. That is

            (
X ( s ) = xi′1 1 ,            , xi′1T ,         , xi′n ( s ) 1 ,   , xi′n ( s )T   )′
                (
Y **( s ) = yi*1*1 ,            , yi*1*T ,        , yi*n*( s ) ,       , yi*n*( s )T   )′
where the new variable yit** is just yit* displaced by the random term, i.e.,
yit** = yit* − ηi .

If β (s ) is assigned the proper conjugate N k (β 0( s ) , B0( s ) ) prior, then the we draw β (s ) from

        (                   )
N k βˆ ( s ) , Bˆ ( s ) where


            (
βˆ ( s ) = B0( s ) + X ( s )′ X ( s )             ) (B

            (
Bˆ ( s ) = B0( s ) + X ( s )′ X ( s )             )−1

6. Draw [λ | Z , y * ,η , d −1 , β , γ , y, X ] :

                The full conditional density of is


        (                   )∏

                                i =1 s =1


Thus, we sample λ from the Dirichlet distribution

D(α1 + n1 ,                 , α s + ns )

where ni denotes the number of individuals of type i, i.e.,

 N
        I ( z i = s ) = ns

7. Draw [γ j | Z , y * ,η , d −1 , β , λ , y, X ] :

y * contain all the information available about γ j , the conditional density of γ j is uniform

on the following interval:

             it                                                                 ]
                  : y it = j}, γ j −1 }, min {min{y it* : y it = j + 1}, γ j +1 } .

       For estimation, we set up the prior distributions as follows: d ~ INVWISH (3,0.1) ,

β ~ N (0, I ) for type 1 and type 2, and (λ1 , λ 2 ) ~ D(1,1) . We run 20, 000 MCMC iterations.

Convergence is achieved within the first 3000 iterations. The first 5,000 iterations are

used as burn-in samples, and the next 20,000 iterations are used for computing the

posterior distributions.

     Our work is empirical rather than theoretical. In addition to classic work, such as Becker (1968), there has

been some interesting recent work on some of the issues we examine. For example, Burdett, Lagos and

Wright (2004) develop a search model where unemployment, income inequality and crime are all

endogenously determined and look at the effects of several policies to combat crime. mrohoro lu, Merlo

and Rupert (2004) calibrate a general equilibrium model of crime to see what accounts for the fall in crime

in the 90’s.
2
    For a more detailed discussion, see Heckman and Singer (1984).
3
    A Tobit setting also uses this information. A count data setting does so as well and in addition respects the

fact that only integral numbers of crimes occur. Our choice of the ordered probit setting is based on data

considerations. In some years, information on criminal activity is not complete: only the range of criminal

activity is given.
4
    If we estimate the ordered probit without allowing for unobserved heterogeneity in coefficients, we find a

positive effect of arrests on criminal activity since non-criminal types dominate.
5
    Note the contrast to all existing work that uses age arrest data and finds the age arrest profile peaks at

around 18.
6
    Past arrest record variable is: log(number of past arrests + 1) .

7
    Past crimes committed variable is: log(number of past crimes committed + 1) .

8
    The state dependence effect of past criminal experience on current criminal behavior is separately

identified from the individual heterogeneity through the timing of past crimes committed. See Chay and

Hyslop (2004) for more detailed discussions on identification.
9
    Since packaged programs cannot deal with this, we had to write the required program.
10
     It is tempting to use fixed effects in combination with a mixture model so that one need not assume strict

exogeneity of education and work as done here. However, at present we are unaware of the existence of

this technique.
11
     Lochner (2004) empirically investigates the joint relationship between schooling, work and crime.
12
     Notice that this assumption will give us some bias if the arrest probability depends on the individual

unobserved characteristics.
13
     Subscripts on the density function denote the dimension of the random variables.
14
     We could have alternatively used the mean number in each category, but this rescaling would create

problems at the upper end since some individuals commit many crimes inordinately affecting the mean. All

the crime data in the tables below is based on this imputation.
15
     This is consistent with the work of Waldfogel (1994) who looks at the effect of past convictions on

current wages. He finds that decreases in wage are more substantial for individuals in jobs that require

credibility than in jobs that do not. If non-criminal type individuals are in jobs that require relatively more

credibility compared to criminal type individuals, then our finding that the non-criminal type is more

stigmatized is consistent with his results.
16
     Lochner (1999) estimated a simple dynamic lifecycle model where individuals jointly choose schooling,

work and crime
17
     The formula for the marginal effect is similar to that for the probit model. That is, the marginal effect of

the probability of the crime category being less than or equal to j is,
                                                                           ∂prob( y ≤ j | x = x )
