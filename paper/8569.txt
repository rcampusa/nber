        In this paper, we examine which markets are most synchronized internationally and exhibit the
greater extent of comovement. We focus on daily data for four asset markets: bonds, equities, foreign
exchange, and domestic money market. Our sample covers thirty-five developed and emerging market
countries during 1997-1999. The extent of comovement and responsiveness to external shocks is
examined in different ways. To measure the response of these markets to adverse external shocks, we date
the peaks in domestic interest rates and bond spreads and the largest daily declines in equity prices and
assess the extent of clustering around the same period. We also analyze which markets show evidence
of greatest comovement in general, irrespective of whether there are adverse shocks or not.

                                          I. Introduction

       Much has been written about globalization and the greater degree of capital market

integration in the past decade. One strand in this vast literature has developed a variety of

approaches to test for the extent of capital mobility.1 Another rapidly-growing branch has

attempted to document the incidence of contagion, spillovers, or international propagation of

shocks. Often, these studies focussed on the cross-country correlations of asset returns.2

       However, most of this literature has paid little attention to the probable case that not all

asset markets are likely to be equally affected by external shocks or equally integrated

internationally.3 4 Such differentiation in the sensitivity to external shocks or the extent of global

integration may arise for several reasons. For example, Reinhart and Reinhart (1999) provide a

simple model where investors have perfect access to the international bond market but bank

customers have less complete access. They show that if depositors have access to international

capital markets interest rates on deposits will co-move with international interest rates on bonds,

but if borrowers cannot borrow from abroad lending rates of interest need not covary with the

interational interest rates on bonds. 5 Similarly, if a government allows its bonds to be freely

traded internationally but has restrictions on the foreign ownership of equities, one would expect

           See, for instance, Frankel (1992) and Obstfeld (1995).
       2
           See Dornbusch, Park, and Claessens (2000), for a recent survey.
       3
         External shocks may take the form of a rise in international interest rates, an oil shock,
or a financial crisis in another country.
       4
           An exception is Hausman and Rigobon (2000).
       5
         Obviously, the opposite is true if borrowers are the ones with access to international
capital markets, while depositors do not.

                                                  1
that bond yields would be more responsive to external shocks than equity returns. However,

market segmentation of these types will not be the only reason why some asset markets may be

more sensitive to external shocks than others. While a variety of narratives describing episodes

of contagion suggest that speculative attacks on currencies are bunched together across countries,

the heterogeneity in exchange rate arrangements and monetary policy across countries would

suggest that exchange rates and the “policy” domestic interest rate are likely to covary

internationally less than an internationally traded sovereign bond or equity.6 Similarly, equity

price indices may have a markedly different industry composition across countries, which may

act to dampen comovement with equity markets across the border. In other words, the domestic

idyosynchratic component in some asset markets is greater than in others.

       In this paper, we examine which markets are most synchronized internationally and

exhibit the greater extent of comovement. We focus on daily data for four asset markets: bonds,

equities, foreign exchange, and domestic money market. Our sample covers thirty-five developed

and emerging market countries during 1997-1999. The extent of comovement and responsiveness

to external shocks is examined in three different ways. First, to measure the response of these

markets to adverse external shocks, we date the peaks in domestic interest rates and bond spreads

and the largest daily declines in equity prices and assess the extent of clustering around the same

period. Second, we conduct principal component anylisis over the entire sample to analyze

which markets show evidence of greatest comovement in general, irrespective of whether there

are adverse shocks or not. Lastly, we look for volatility spillovers, working with the simplest of



       6
       One example is Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz (1995), which analyzes of Europe’s
Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis.

                                                 2
the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models to examine

whether there was a marked change in volatility much along the lines of Edwards and Susmel

(2000).

          In the next section, we describe and date the various episodes of regional or global

financial turmoil that we study and provide some background on the international setting during

our sample period. In Section III, we compare the extent of comovement across countries and

the profile of daily volatility in four asset markets--bond, equity, foreign exchange, and domestic

money market. Concluding remarks, sprinkled with some policy implications, are presented in

Section IV.

                                   II. Episodes and Background

          In what follows, we turn our attention to some of the events or “shocks” that have shaped

financial markets in recent years; all these episodes are likely to be familiar to the reader, as these

have received considerable attention from the financial press.



1. Asset markets

          Shocks may be confined to a single market, such as equities, or may have more far-

reaching consequences, simultaneously affecting foreign exchange, domestic money, and the

international bond markets. Most often, when a country is mired in a deep financial crisis, all

markets are affected; the currency weakens, domestic interest rates rise as expectations are

unsettled and/or the monetary authorities tighten policy to restore credibility, the terms of

borrowing in international capital markets (assuming access is not lost altogether) deteriorates,

and other asset prices (i.e., equity and real estate) slide. Volatility increases across the board.


                                                   3
Milder periods of turbulence, owing to external developments, may not have such widespread

effects. For instance, the period of financial market turbulence around October 27-28, 1997, was

nearly global in scope but was largely confined to equity markets. In the analysis that follows,

we will pay particular attention to how the spread of disturbances across countries differs among

the four asset markets we study.



2. Events

       Table 1 presents a brief chronology of significant events during the January 1, 1997-

August 31, 1999 period. The list is not meant to be exhaustive, rather it highlights some of the

key episodes we analyze.7 In the remainder of this paper, our focus is primarily on four events.

In chronological order, they are: the devaluation of the Thai baht on July 2, 1997; the Russian

devaluation and default on August 17, 1998; the September 1-2, 1998 stint, during which

Malaysia introduced fairly drastic capital control measures (on September 1st) and LTCM issued

a letter to its shareholders revealing its precarious condition (on September 2nd); and the

recapitalization of LTCM that began on September 23rd, 1998.

       While these events are a focal point of our study, there are other episodes that are

encompassed in our analysis. These include: the crash of the U.S. equity market and the

speculative attack on Hong Kong on October 28, 1997; the evolution of the Korean crisis

following the devaluation of the won on November 17, 1997; the closure of Solomon Brothers’



       7

LTCM on July 20, 1998; the inter-FOMC meeting reduction in U.S. interest rates on October 15,

1998; and the Brazilian devaluation on January 13, 1999, which also coincided with rumors

about a possible debt crisis in China.



3. Data and sample

       Our data is daily and spans the period beginning on January 1st, 1997 through August

31st, 1999. Because of the daily frequency of the data, the variables we analyze are confined to

financial markets. Specifically, these variables are: the domestic “policy” interest rate--

whenever possible, overnight interbank interest rates are used; the daily return on equities in the

local currency taken from local bourse indices;8 the percent change in the daily exchange rate

versus the dollar or versus the deutschemark (DM);9 and, the interest rate spreads on bonds that

capture the “pricing of risk”. For the industrial countries, the interest rate spread is between

corporate and sovereign bonds, while for emerging markets the spread is between a sovereign

bond and a comparable United States Treasury security. The particulars for all the data used for

the thirty-five countries in our sample are provided, along with their respective sources, in the

Data Appendix.



       8
         More precisely, returns are defined as the percent change in equity prices, as dividend
data is not available on a daily frequency.
       9
          For all the countries the exchange rate is bilateral against the U.S. dollar. The
exceptions are Estonia and the European countries, for which bilateral exchange rates versus the
DM are used. The exchange rate is expressed as number of local currency units per dollar or DM;
hence, and increase denotes a depreciation. After January 1, 1999, DM quotes are based on a
strict translation from euros.

                                                  5
       The countries in our sample cover more of the mature-to-emerging-market range of

experiences. Countries with less developed capital markets and a significant extent of financial

repression are not a part of this study, as the focus rests on high-frequency capital market

developments. We can classify the sample into five, somewhat arbitrary, seven-country

groupings: The G7 countries, which are comprised of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,

United Kingdom, and the United States; and the transition economies, which include Bulgaria,

Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Russia, and the Ukraine. The remaining three groups

are primarily by region. There is the Asian cluster, which includes Hong Kong, Indonesia,

Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand. The other European group,

which excludes those countries that are part of the G7, and includes, Finland, Greece, Holland,

Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the non-European Turkey. Finally, the Latin American sample

consists of the larger economies in the region, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru,

and Venezuela.



4. The international setting

       Tables 2 and 3 present a broad brush view of the key variables during three sub-periods in

our sample: the period in between the devaluation of the Thai baht and that of the Russian ruble;

the couple of weeks in between the Russian devaluation and the introduction of capital controls

in Malaysia, which occurs a day before LTCM issued a letter to its shareholders; and the stretch

between that day and the relatively rare interim easing of monetary policy in the United States.

Table 2 presents the cumulative change in the variables of interest, which simply compares the

end point to the first observation of the sample. Hence, for example, interest rates were roughly


                                                 6
the same on August 17, 1998 as they were on July 1, 1997 for the G7 and the Latin American

economies, although, rates were higher for the Asian and transition economies (7.09 and 13.14

percent, respectively.) Since the first sub-sample covers a much longer period, Table 3 presents

the same data for daily changes at a monthly rate.10 So, for instance, during the first sub-sample,

interest rates rose (on average) by 0.69 percent per month for the transition economies, but the

increase was close to zero for the G7 countries.

       The three subsamples are quite distinct from one another. Prior to the Russian crisis,

Asian exchange rates had depreciated markedly against the US dollar--largely owing to the

collapse of the Indonesian rupiah. Asian equity prices fell 56 percent, while the terms at which

they could borrow in international capital markets deteriorated, as reflected in the widening of

bond spreads of 354 basis points. Over this period, other emerging markets also experienced

declining asset prices, despite relatively stable exchange rates and interest rates. For the Latin

American group, equity prices fell 32 percent, as equity markets in the region fell across the

board.11 More surprisingly, bond yield spreads widened 522 basis points--even more than for the

Asian crisis countries.12 The widening in bond spreads is even more pronounced for the

transition economies. However, this is largely owing to Russia. Equity markets were falling

nearly everywhere for the transition group, with the exception of Hungary. By contrast, most



       10
        Specifically, the change reported in Table 3 divided by the number of days in the
subsample raised to 30 to present it as a monthly rate.
       11
        The decline in equity prices was largest for Venezuela (56 percent) and smallest for
Colombia (11 percent).
       12
         Again, the largest deterioration was for Venezuelan bonds, as the spread widened by
1,793 basis points.

                                                   7
European and G-7 equity markets had substantial rallies during this period, with notable

exceptions being Japan (down 25 percent) and Norway (down 11 percent).

       Following the Russian devaluation and before the LTCM story entered the public domain,

the picture changes markedly.13 Equity markets take a tumble everywhere, with the exceptions of

South Korea and Russia, which begins to recover from its massive slide. Latin American

markets are particularly hard hit. Bond spreads widen dramatically, especially for Latin

American sovereign borrowers. For Russia the spread widens more than 6,300 basis points. Bid-

ask spreads on debt instruments also widen dramatically, reflecting the loss of market liquidity.

As the next section will illustrate in the context a simple model, this reflected several

withdrawals from risk-taking. Domestic interest rates in Latin America rise during this period,

with Mexico and Peru posting the largest increases. The higher interest rates during this period

owe both to the loss of credibility many emerging markets suffered following the Russian

default--in part on the reassessment of the likelihood of bailouts by the International Monetary

Fund--and to the use of tight-money policies by many emerging market central banks to defend

exchange rates.

       What is striking about the last subsample, which are the six weeks preceding the Fed’s

interest rate cut, is that emerging markets appeared to be recovering already from the Russian

shock. Interest rates had started to decline, particularly in Asia, while equity markets were

recovering, especially in Malaysia and Thailand. Bond spreads for Latin America had began to

narrow (by about 289 basis points), although yields spreads remained well above pre-crisis



       13
          , It is important to note that stories of LTCM’s financial difficulties were circulating as
early as July 20.

                                                  8
levels. For industrial countries the picture is very different from the emerging markets, as equity

markets continued to tumble and bond spreads widened further.

       This strikingly divergent performance between emerging and mature capital markets in

this last period may owe to the fact that, during these weeks, there was much speculation in

financial circles, as to whether there would be more LTCMs. Hence, there was concern about the

health of the financial centers, rather then the periphery. By then, the periphery had already been

hard hit and portfolio inflows of capital (bond and equity) had dramatically dried up. This stands

in contrast to the equity market booms most of the industrial countries were enjoying prior to the

Russian/LTCM shock.



              III. International Comovement in Asset Markets: Some Evidence

       To begin our enquiry as to which asset markets show the greatest extent of comovement

across countries, we examine some basic descriptive statistics. In particular, we compare the

dates of maximum and minimum values during the full sample to those of the episodes we are

interested in analyzing. Many of the countries in our sample do not allow their currencies to float

freely--even when they say they do.14 As a consequence, we focus in the overnight domestic

interest rate, as the highest rates may be associated with speculative attacks on the foreign

exchange market. Table 4, which provides the dates of the maximum values, reveals that, for

most of the Asian countries in our sample, interest rate peaks occur in the second half of 1997




       14
          See Reinhart (2000) and Calvo and Reinhart (2000) on the pervasiveness of the “fear of
floating” across both industrial and emerging market countries.

                                                 9
and into early 1998, a period of much turbulence in the region.15 August and September 1998

also shows numerous entries, coinciding with the Russia/LTCM crises. However, with only a

couple of exceptions, peaks in domestic interest rates are not highly synchronized across

countries. The global coordination of disturbances is far more evident in Tables 5 and 6, which

provide the dates of the largest daily equity market declines and the largest increase in the bond

yield spread. These equity market crashes are overwhelmingly clustered on October 27-28, 1997

and in the interval between the Russian devaluation and the Federal Reserve’s intermeeting

interest rate cut. The bunching of disturbances across countries is even more evident in the bond

spread data presented in Table 6. With a few exceptions, the largest daily increases occur in the

late summer and fall of 1998.

       On the basis of these simple observations, it would appear that the October 1997

disturbance, while far-reaching in its global scope was, confined to equity markets, while the

August-October 1998 disturbances extended to bond markets as well.



1. Principal component analysis

       To assess more formally how the degree of comovement across countries in several

financial variables evolves over time and across regions, we applied principal component

analysis to the financial time series data over the full sample, as well as several subsamples.

       We focus on four daily time series, the domestic policy interest rate, the return on equity,

the change in the exchange rate (in percent), and the bond spreads, for thirty-four of the thirty-




       15
            This will be discussed in more detail in the next section.

                                                  10
five countries in our.16 From these series, we constructed a smaller set of series, the principal

components, that explain as much of the variance of the original series as possible. The higher

the degree of co-movement in the original series, the fewer the number of principal components

needed to explain a large portion of the variance of the original series. In case where the original

series are identical (perfectly collinear), the first principal component would explain 100 percent

of the variation in the original series. Alternatively, if the series are orthogonal to one another, it

would take as many principal components as there are series to explain all the variance in the

original series. In that case, no advantage would be gained by looking at common factors, as

none exist.

        The procedure begins by standardizing the variables so that each series has a zero mean

and a unit standard deviation. This standardization ensures that all series receive equal treatment

and the construction of the principal component indices is not influenced disproportionately by

the series exhibiting the largest variation. The correlation matrix of the standardized series, E, is

decomposed into its Eigen-vectors (P) and the diagonal matrix of Eigen-values (7).


                                                                                                      (1)




The Eigen-vectors are the loading factors, or weights, attached to each of the original series. For

a particular time-series, the higher the degree of comovement with other series the higher (in

absolute value) its loading factor. If a particular time series is uncorrelated with the remaining

series included in the analysis, then its loading factor in the first principal component should be


        16
             Owing to limited data availability, Bulgaria is excluded from the sample.

                                                  11
close to zero. A priori, this is what we should expect to see for the time series of, say, a small

country with a “perfectly idiosyncratic” shock, or for a country which has binding capital

controls.17

        The results are presented in Tables 7-8 for the four regional groupings and for the G-7

countries. The share of the variance of the original series (in this case equity returns) explained

by the first principal component ranges from a low of 0.36 for the transition economies to a high

of 0.57 percent for the European group--with the other groups falling in between. These results

are hardly surprising, in light of the lack of homogeneity in the Transition economies group

relative to the higher degree of integration in Europe.

        Examining the factor loadings by region or group, the outcomes are equally intuitive.

Among the Asian countries in our sample (Japan excluded), South Korea has the lowest factor

loading (0.24); this result is not surprising, given that that its own financial crisis began months

after the onset of turmoil in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.18 Malaysia

shows the next-to-least degree of comovement (the loading factor is 0.32)--then again, Malaysia

had capital controls throughout the latter part of the sample. Among the European grouping, the

extent of comovement is the least for Turkey, which has unresolved chronic inflation problems,

and Greece. Among the G7 countries, the patterns of comovement are also largely defined along

regions. The four European countries move in unison, the United States and Canada move in

          As the controls insulate the country from external disturbances (see Edison and
Reinhart, 1999).

another block;19 and Japan shows the least comovement with the other G7 countries.

       Turning to Latin America, comovement is strongest among the larger three--Argentina,

Brazil and Mexico, and least for Colombia and Venezuela. These patterns of covariation are not

unique to the 1997-1999 sample. In the immediate aftermath of the Mexican crisis, when most

Latin American equity markets posted substantial declines, Colombia’s equity market posted

moderate gains.20 Lastly, comovement is strongest among the earlier reformers--Poland, the

Czech Republic, and Hungary--and weakest the Republics of the the former Soviet Union.

       Tables 15 and 16 also report, for comparison purposes, the results for interest rate

changes and exchange rates. As is evident for all the country groups, the extent of covariation is

noticeably lower reaching reaching 0.4 for any group’s excxhange rates and interest rates.



2. Conditional variances

       In this section, we work with the simplest of the generalized autoregressive conditional

heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models to examine whether there was a marked change in volatility

during and around the various episodes analyzed in the preceding section.21 We consider the

following models:




       19
          This is evident in the factor loadings of the second principal component, shown in the
next column.

            See Calvo and Reinhart (1996) for an analysis of this episode.
       21
            In all cases a GARCH (1, 1) model was estimated.

the variance equation, T is the mean of the variance; the lag of the mean squared residual from

the mean equation (i.e., ,2t-1 ) is the ARCH term and last period’s forecast variance (i.e.,

F2t-1) is the GARCH term. The number of autoregressive lags, k, was selected on a country-by-

country basis using both the Akaike and Shwartz criteria; if these yielded different results as

regards the optimal lag length, both models were estimated. We also estimated a comparable

model for the domestic interest rate and the change (in percent) of the exchange rate. Periods of

turbulence that are part of our sample of daily observations render the assumption of identically

and independently distributed conditionally normal disturbances in the most basic GARCH

model inadequate.23 Given the presence of heteroskedastic disturbances in our sample (i.e., the

,s), we use the methods described in Bollersev and Woolridge (1992) to compute the Quasi-

Maximum Likelihood covariances and standard errors.

       The conditional variance of daily equity returns is plotted for each country in Appendix

dividend data at a daily frequency.

Figures 1-18, while some of the most salient features of this exercise are summarized in Tables

17-21. Before turning to a discussion of specific countries, however, there are some general

patterns that emerge from the analysis of the conditional variance of equity returns for these

thirty three countries that merit mention. Even without knowing what events transpired during

the three years covered in our sample, the equity returns data reveal four periods of general

market stress, as reflected in large-to-moderate spikes in the variance of equity returns. Two

periods stand out most clearly from a review of the figures: a marked period of turbulence at end-

October-early November of 1997 in most of the equity markets in our sample--this episode was,

for the most part, relatively short-lived; and a more severe and far more protracted bout of

volatility that, for most countries, begins in August of 1998 and lasts through October of that

year. 24 Indeed, a tally of the information presented in Tables 9-13 reveals that in more than half

of the countries in the sample the largest spikes in volatility were recorded in the late summer

and fall of 1998 and, that in nineteen of the thirty-three countries, this period was associated with

the most persistent bout of volatility in the sample.

       In addition to the two more obvious episodes of market volatility on a global scale, there

are two periods of market stress which merit discussion. The first of these occurs in early 1998,

at the height of the Asian crisis and it engulfs all the Asian countries in our sample, including

Japan.25 Indeed, for seven of the countries in our sample (all in Asia), this episode shows the


       24
           The first of these episodes lines up with the equity market crash in New York and,
particularly Hong Kong on October 28, 1997, while the second spans the Russian crisis-LTCM
debacle.
       25
          Korea’s devaluation of the won occurs on November 17 and their negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund last into late December 1997-early January 1998. Furthermore,
during this period there are recurring rumors that China will devalue and set the stage for a new

                                                 15
most marked and persistent rise in equity market volatility. The high volatility during this

period, however, is largely confined to Asia, as both mature and emerging markets elsewhere are

relatively tranquil. The other market turbulence episode revealed by this data occurs in January

1999, and it is most evident in Latin America. The equity markets of four countries in our

sample (all in Latin America) record their largest spike in volatility in that month; the shock,

however, seems to be relatively short-lived. Several European and Transition economies’ equity

markets also show more moderate increases in volatility. This spike corresponds to both the

Brazilian devaluation of the real and several market disruptions after the Chinese government

refused to help foreign creditors of GITIC. Fears of debt crisis in China also swept through Hong

Kong at this time.

       As regards individual countries, it is worth noting that in some cases overlap with “global

events” may be more of a coincidence that the conditional variances reveal. For example, as

discussed earlier in the context of the principal component analysis, Colombia is a country whose

equity market shows little comovement with the rest of Latin America or other equity markets.

Its deep financial crisis, which occurs shortly after the devaluation of the ruble, had little to do

with Russia or LTCM--as it had been brewing for fundamental reasons for some time. Similarly,

the spike in interest rates in Greece following the equity market turbulence in end-October 1997,

was owing to an attack on the drachma motivated by predominantly domestic considerations.

Another feature of the conditional variances, which applies to several “crisis” countries, is that

the conditional volatility of equity returns remains consistently higher in the post-crisis period.

This is most evident of Indonesia and South Korea, but it also applies to Colombia, the


round of financial instability in the region.

                                                  16
Philippines, and Thailand. In sum, the analysis of the variance of equity prices provides

additional support that disturbances have an important global dimension in the period under

scrutiny. Far more so than what is observed in foreign exchange and money markets.



                                    VI. Concluding Comments

       This paper has presented evidence to suggest that there are important differences in the

responsiveness to external shocks and, more broadly, in the extent of international

synchronization across asset categories. Hence, the implications that one can draw about the

extent of globalization and the degree of capital market integration depends importantly on which

is the market examined. With the exception of the G-7, which includes heterogenous cycles

among the United States and Canada, Europe, and Japan, bond yield spreads exhibit--by far--the

highest degree of comovement both across countries for the entire sample and various

subsamples.26 One can speculate that, given that these spreads are dominated by sovereign risk,

they represent a more homogeneous asset class than the equity, currency and, money market

counterparts. A distant second in the extent of comovement in returns (again the exception being

the G-7 group) are equity markets; for the G-7 countries, however, equity markets are the most

correlated of the four asset markets we examine. Furthermore, in terms synchronicity, as

measured by the overlap of dates in which the largest declines were observed, equity markets

also show substantial responsiveness to external shocks.

       For nearly all the regions or country groupings, the exchange rate market, followed bonds

and equities (in that order) as the most correlated across countries. The policy interest rate, not

surprisingly--given the heterogeneity across countries in monetary policy and the extent of

credibility--comes as a distant fourth in terms of international comovement. Idyosynchratic

domestic shocks appear to be the dominant factor in explaining their behavior.

       In sum, studying the extent of capital mobility and the impacts of external shocks has

been most often too limited to focussing on a particular asset market. Our results taken together

suggest that even countries with little capital account restrictions may be subject to other forms

of capital market segmentation. Hence, the differences in the degree of capital mobility is

something that not only needs to be understood across countries, but across markets in a

particular country as well.
