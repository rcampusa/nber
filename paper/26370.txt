                                           ABSTRACT

A growing literature uses the Russell 1000/2000 reconstitution event as an identification strategy to
investigate corporate finance and asset pricing questions. To implement this identification strategy,
researchers need to approximate the ranking variable used to assign stocks to indexes. We develop
a procedure that predicts assignment to the Russell 1000/2000 with significant improvements relative
to previous approaches. We apply this methodology to extend the tests in Ben-David, Franzoni, and
Moussawi (2018).

A growing empirical literature relies on the annual reconstitution of the Russell 1000/2000 indexes

to identify exogenous variation in index assignment, which in turn is used to explore a host of

research questions in corporate finance and asset pricing.1 A key input in this identification strategy

is the ranking that Russell uses for index assignment. Because this variable is proprietary,

researchers approximate it using publicly available data. In this paper, we provide a novel

methodology for predicting Russell's assignment of stocks to the Russell 1000 and 2000 indexes

that results in lower assignment error than commonly used approaches.

         The annual reconstitution of the Russell 1000/2000 indexes, which takes place in June,

relies on a mechanical rule that exploits the ranking of stocks by market capitalization in the month

of May (FTSE Russell (2019)). In the reconstitutions up to the year 2006, the 1,000 largest stocks

became members of the Russell 1000 on the reconstitution date, usually on the last trading day of

June, and the next 2,000 stocks became members of the Russell 2000.2 Because market

capitalization at the close of the last trading day of May is arguably a random variable outside of

companies' control, the reconstitution event provides exogenous variation in index membership,

and hence researchers can use these events to study the impact of index membership on various

outcome variables. Moreover, the Russell 1000/2000 indexes are popular for benchmarking by

institutional investors. Stocks at the top of the Russell 2000 have a significantly larger weight in

 Several scholars have used the annual reconstitution of the Russell 1000/2000 indexes to identify exogenous variation
in institutional ownership and its impact on various outcome variables in the domains of corporate finance and asset
pricing. For example, Chang, Hong, and Liskovich (2015) focus on stock prices following index reconstitution.
Mullins (2014) and Appel, Gormley, and Keim (2016, 2019a) study corporate governance. Schmidt and Fahlenbrach
(2017) focus on the effect of institutional investors and firm value. Boone and White (2015) study information
production given different environments of institutional investors. Fich, Harford, and Tran (2015) investigate the
effect of institutional investors' monitoring in the context of acquisitions. Crane, Michenaud, and Weston (2016) study
institutional investors and payout policy. Bird and Karolyi (2016) relate institutional ownership to corporate disclosure
policy. Ben-David, Franzoni, and Moussawi (2018) explore the effects of ETFs on stock volatility.

 See Appendix A for the exact rank dates and reconstitution dates from 1989 to 2019. After 2006, Russell introduced
a banding rule to limit the turnover of stocks in the indexes. The banding approach precludes the possibility of
implementing a fuzzy regression discontinuity design because it eliminates any meaningful variation around the cutoff
between the two indexes (see Appel, Gormley, and Keim (2019a, 2019b)).

                                                           1
the Russell 2000 index than stocks at the bottom of the Russell 1000. Thus, given the large amount

of assets under management (AUM) that are benchmarked to the Russell 2000 (Chang, Hong, and

Liskovich (2015)), the reconstitution generates large heterogeneity in indexed ownership across

the two sides of the cutoff for index assignment.

       A hurdle in implementing this identification strategy is the fact that the market

capitalization that Russell uses to rank stocks in May is not publicly available. This variable does

not necessarily coincide with the standard measure of company market value in the finance

literature (i.e., the product of publicly traded shares and the market price based on data from the

Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP)). In particular, Russell combines different issues of

the same company and includes nonpublicly traded shares when computing company market value

(FTSE Russell (2019)). Because Russell does not publish its ranking variable, researchers rely on

imperfect proxies to predict the assignment of stocks into the two indexes at reconstitution.

       Getting closer to the true ranking variable that Russell uses is important for all researchers

using the Russell reconstitution event for identification. Irrespective of whether this identification

strategy is used in a regression discontinuity design (RDD), as in Wei and Young (2017) and

Glossner (2019), among others, or in an instrumental variable (IV) approach, as in Appel,

Gormley, and Keim (2016, 2019a), among others, the ranking variable that Russell uses in

assigning stocks to indexes is a key input in the regressions. The principal role of this unobservable

variable, therefore, motivates us to improve the approximation of the market capitalization that

Russell uses for index assignment.

       We proceed as follows. In Section I, we briefly summarize the main issue in implementing

the fuzzy RDD for the Russell indexes. In particular, the commonly used methodology is based on

predicting assignment into the Russell indexes based on CRSP market capitalization. However,



                                                  2
this procedure results in significant misassignment, as shown by Appel, Gormley, and Keim

(2019b), which could lead to a weak first stage in the fuzzy RDD procedure. In Section II, we

show that the predicted assignment can be materially improved based on publicly available

information. Our method constructs a new market capitalization ranking that builds on public data

sources and closely follows the Russell methodology (FTSE Russell (2019)). We show in Section

III that this exercise generates a better approximation of the actual market capitalization that

Russell uses to determine index assignment than simpler procedures that rely solely on CRSP

market capitalization in May prior to reconstitution. We describe the construction procedure in

detail and make the data available to other researchers along with its code.

Finally, in Section III, we use this new ranking variable in a fuzzy RDD framework to extend and

corroborate the analysis in Ben-David, Franzoni, and Moussawi (2018). Section IV concludes.



       I.      Russell 1000/2000 Reconstitution within a Fuzzy RDD Framework

       To demonstrate the use of the ranking variable in an econometric analysis, we consider the

fuzzy RDD procedure advocated by Wei and Young (2017) and Glossner (2019) for exploiting the

Russell reconstitution for empirical investigation. Because the actual running variable (market

capitalization ranking by Russell) is unobservable, a fuzzy RDD is a suitable approach as it

involves approximating the unobservable running variable with another variable.

       The fuzzy RDD consists of a two-stage procedure (see, for example, Lee and Lemieux

(2010), Roberts and Whited (2013)). In the first stage, the actual treatment indicator is regressed

on the predicted treatment , controls for polynomials of the fuzzy ranking variable , (that

is, the proxy for the unobservable ranking variable), and the interactions between the controls and

the predicted treatment to allow the polynomial to differ on the two sides of the cutoff:


                                                 3
                                                                   

           2000 , = 0 + 1 , +  2,             
                                  , +  3, , × , + , ,                                                            (1)
                                           =1                     =1


where 2000 , is an indicator variable equal to one if the stock is assigned to the Russell 2000

(i.e., treated) and to zero if it is assigned to the Russell 1000 index, and , is an indicator equal to

one if  , > 0 and to zero otherwise.

         In the second stage, the outcome variable of interest is regressed on the instrumented actual

treatment, controlling for the fuzzy assignment variable and its polynomials:

                                                               
                   , + 
        , = 0 + 1 2000                     2, ,
                                                                 , × 
                                                          +  3, 2000 , + , .
                                                                             3
                                                                                                                 (2)
                                      =1                     =1

         Prior literature proposes two approaches to approximate Russell's ranking variable. One

approach bases rankings on weights in the Russell indexes in June. However, the weights are based

on float-adjusted market capitalization, and thus they differ from the original ranking variable,

which is not float-adjusted. Moreover, for this proxy to be valid in an RDD context, one has to

assume that variation in market capitalization between the end of May and the end of June is

negligible and independent of index assignment. This assumption appears unwarranted.

Reiterating a claim in Chang, Hong, and Liskovich (2015, p. 222), Wei and Young (2017) argue

that using end-of-June weights to construct a proxy for the original ranking variable generates

selection bias. Indeed, these authors show that some relevant variables (including institutional

ownership itself) display a pre-existing discontinuity at the cutoff when the June rankings are used

(for more details, see also Appel, Gormley, and Keim (2019b)).

 In the literature, we find slightly different specifications of equation (2). Lee and Lemieux (2010) and Roberts and
Whited (2013) use                                                                      
                      =1 3,  , ×  , rather than =1 3, 2000, ×  , , whereas the specification that
we propose in equation (2) corresponds to equation (2) in Wei and Young (2017). In the tests below, we try both
specifications and the estimates are virtually identical.

                                                         4
        A second approach uses CRSP market capitalization in May, prior to reconstitution, as a

ranking variable. This approach is more appropriate as it avoids the look-ahead bias embedded in

the first approach, as discussed in Wei and Young (2017).4

        We add to these previous approaches by developing a new ranking variable with an

improved ability to predict index assignment, which makes fuzzy RDD feasible even in the

neighborhood of the cutoff. We discuss this variable and its construction next.



                                II.      An Improved Ranking Variable

A. Data and Variable Construction

        Russell ranks stocks based on their total market capitalization and uses the rankings to

assign stocks to the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 indexes. Russell does not provide the ranking

data that it uses to determine index membership in May of each year. Russell began providing the

total market capitalization data on which ranking is constructed in 2012, several years after the

introduction of the banding rule in 2007.5 The market capitalization used by Russell differs from

what researchers usually construct as the product of shares outstanding in CRSP at the PERMNO

level and the stock price at the end of May. In what follows, we describe how we account for part

of this difference.

        According to the detailed Russell U.S. 1000/2000 index reconstitution methodology (FTSE

Russell (2019)), two dates are relevant. The first is the "rank date," when all eligible securities are

ranked by their total market capitalization and index membership is determined. The rank date was



4
  The approaches in Chang, Hong, and Liskovich (2015), Wei and Young (2017), and Glossner (2018) also avoid
look-ahead bias by combining CRSP and Compustat and obtain significant predictive power around the cutoff.
5
 Mullins (2014) and Appel, Gormley, and Keim (2016) obtain market capitalization data for some of the pre-banding
years from Russell. However, both conclude that these data lead to a very noisy proxy for the true variable used by
Russell.

                                                        5
the final trading day of May until 2015, when it was changed to a day in mid-May. Second, the

"reconstitution date" is the effective date of the reconstitution, which has been performed annually

since 1989. The annual reconstitution date was the final business day of June until 2004, when it

was revised to the last Friday in June. In 2007, along with the new banding methodology, an

exception was made to this rule: reconstitution was effective after the close on the last Friday in

June unless the last Friday occurs on the 28th, 29th, or 30th (see the table in Appendix A for exact

rank and reconstitution dates between 1989 and 2019).

        On the rank date, the total market capitalization (nonfloat-adjusted) of all share classes is

used to determine index membership. On the reconstitution date, security membership in each

index becomes effective, and the weight of each security in each index is proportional to the float-

adjusted issue-specific market capitalization that Russell computes for each security.

        Section 5 of the Russell documentation (FTSE Russell (2019)) provides details on the

criteria for inclusion in the U.S. Russell indexes. To be included in the index, Russell imposes

restrictions regarding listing location and incorporation status and also imposes trading criteria

(e.g., minimum closing price of $1, minimum total market capitalization of $30 million, minimum

voting requirements, and minimum available shares or a float of 5%). Russell excludes preferred

and convertible preferred stocks, redeemable shares, participating preferred stocks, warrants,

rights, depositary receipts, installment receipts, and trust receipts.

        Section 6 of the Russell documentation provides details on the computation of each

company's total market capitalization on the rank date. The nonfloat-adjusted total market

capitalization is constructed as the sum of the products of total shares outstanding across all share

classes at the company level times the market price at the close of the rank day in May. Section

6.2 gives details on the classes of common shares included in the computation of total market



                                                   6
capitalization: all common stock share classes of nonrestricted exchangeable shares and

partnership units/membership interests are included, while preferred stocks, convertible preferred

stocks, redeemable shares, and other preferred stocks, warrants, rights, installment receipts, and

trust receipts are excluded from the total market capitalization calculation.6

         Starting with the universe of the Russell 3000 stocks, we proceed in several steps. We

explain these steps and their corresponding assumptions in detail below. Our methodology and

assumptions are also reflected in the code in Appendix B.

         CRSP and Compustat are our main sources of information. We match each Russell

constituent to its CRSP PERMNO using historical CUSIP information in CRSP MSENAMES and

to Compustat's GVKEY using Compustat Snapshot's CNSECURITY datasets.

         We rely on the CRSP database for information on reliable prices and shares outstanding

for all securities traded on a major exchange (variable PERMNO), as CRSP provides reliable

information on these measures for public stocks. We also use CRSP's mapping of the different

issues to their company identifier (variable PERMCO), which we employ to compute our proxy

for Russell's total market capitalization. In a few cases, Russell's mapping of issues to companies

differs from CRSP's, but we do not correct these cases to adhere to a rule-based method and avoid

ad hoc choices.7,8




6
 Starting in 2005, IPOs are also added on a quarterly basis. Section 6.7 in FTSE Russell (2019) provides the details.
Because the empirical analysis focuses on the annual reconstitution in June, these details are less relevant here.
7
 Among the cases in which Russell differs from CRSP in mapping issues to parent companies is TreeHouse Foods,
THS, with CUSIP 89469A10 and PERMNO 90775, which spun off from Dean Foods (PERMCO 14527) in 2005 and
was assigned a PERMCO of 46889 by CRSP. Russell, however, seems to combine the market capitalization of both
entities, which could explain THS being assigned to the Russell 1000 in June 2005. THS was reassigned to the Russell
2000 the following year. Lanier Worldwide (CUSIP 51589L10), which spun off from its parent Harris Corporation
(CUSIP 41387510) in 1999, is another example.
8
 One could be tempted to reverse-engineer the difference between the ranking resulting from our methodology and
Russell's assignments to infer the mapping of misclassified cases to share issuers and achieve full replication of
Russell assignments. However, the fact that these ex-post inferences would be made only for the few misclassified

                                                         7
          We next turn to Compustat for information on common shares of stocks that are traded

over-the-counter (OTC), nonpublicly traded stocks, and securities that are not in CRSP. For

companies that have one or more of their share classes listed in OTC markets, and for three

companies that are not in the CRSP database,9 we use the Compustat Securities Daily database to

aggregate the market capitalization of the multiple issues (variable GVKEY-IID) at the company

level (variable GVKEY). For companies that have multiple shares of common stock where one or

more of these share classes is closely held and not publicly traded, we use the aggregated shares

outstanding variable in Compustat Quarterly for the nearest quarter (variable CSHOQ), which

represents the total number of all common shares outstanding at fiscal quarter-end collected from

Forms 10-Q and 10-K.

          After carving out the proportion of CSHOQ attributable to nontraded share classes, we

multiply it by the weighted-by-share-class-size average price of publicly traded share classes to

compute the corresponding market capitalization.10 We then add the market capitalization of the

closely held share classes to the market capitalization of the traded share classes computed using

Compustat to obtain a second proxy for the total market capitalization used by Russell in ranking

stocks.

          In sum, we end up with two proxies for total market capitalization at the company level.

We rely primarily on the CRSP-based proxy for total market capitalization. We use the Compustat-

based proxy for total market capitalization only if it is higher than the CRSP-based figure.



cases would give no guarantee that the researcher has fully replicated Russell's methodology, in which case the
resulting ranking of companies would not necessarily be superior to the rule-based approach that we follow.

    CUSIPs: 03957A10, 26187710, and 71343P10.
10
   Because closely held share classes are likely to have superior voting or cash flow rights, one might argue that it
would be more appropriate to use the highest price in computing the market capitalization for those nontraded shares.
Using this approach leads to very similar ranking outcomes and does not change the statistical or economic
significance of the empirical findings in our RDD tests.

B.       Assessment of the Improvement in Index Assignment

         The new ranking variable improves the predicted assignment: the new variable has a 99.7%

success rate in predicting index assignments between Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Table I

provides descriptive statistics on the new variable's performance. Panel A compares the market

capitalization obtained using the new ranking variable to that based on other measures.11 The panel

shows that our variable almost always generates a higher estimate of market capitalization. For the

first three alternative measures of market capitalization, 75% to 80% of stocks' market

capitalization is virtually the same (up to 0.1% deviation) as the estimate obtained using our

variable. Only 5% to 7% of stocks' market capitalization generate deviations that are greater than

10%. Our new variable is closest to the total market capitalization obtained using Compustat

Quarterly shares outstanding (CSHOQ), with the estimates overlapping completely for 95% of the

firm-years. The deviations for the remaining 5% are mostly smaller than 1%. Nevertheless, as we

show in the discussion of Table II below, large differences in a few firms result in weaker

econometric performance.

                                        --- Table I goes about here ---

         Table I, Panel B compares the performance of our rank variable to that of rank variables

used in prior literature that are based primarily on CRSP market capitalization or other viable

alternatives based on Compustat. Our rank variable leads to a total of 61 misclassified assignments

to the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 during reconstitution over our sample period (i.e., 2000 to

2006). The CRSP- and Compustat-only rank variables produce many more misclassifications and


11
   The other variables in the comparison are total market capitalization using CRSP at the issue level (PERMNO),
total market capitalization using the Compustat Securities Daily database aggregated at the company level, total
market capitalization using the Compustat Securities Daily database aggregated at the company level, and total market
capitalization using Compustat Quarterly shares outstanding (CSHOQ).

are inferior to our rank variable in each of the reconstitution years in our sample. We use the rank

variable obtained from our reconstructed market capitalization directly in our regression

discontinuity analysis.

        We investigate further to better understand the reason for the few remaining discrepancies

between the Russell index assignments and those based on our rank variable. We notice that in a

few cases, Russell considers each class of stock separately, mainly when Russell believes that the

common stock share classes act independently of one another. In these cases, Russell differs from

CRSP in the issue-company aggregation, as Russell uses issue-level market capitalization instead

of total company-level market capitalization in determining index membership. For example, in a

few instances, stocks assigned to the Russell 2000 have company-level market capitalization

suggesting a Russell 1000 assignment but issue-level market capitalization suggesting a Russell

2000 assignment. In a few other cases, primarily related to recent spinoffs, Russell aggregates the

market cap of the parent and spun-off entities and ranks both entities as one. These cases do not

seem to follow a systematic pattern, so we cannot infer a rule-based systematic approach to account

for them.

        To study the power of this new ranking variable in predicting index assignment, we run

regressions based on equation (1). Following the recommendation in Lee and Lemieux (2010), in

Figure 1 we start by plotting the treatment probability (that is, the probability of membership in

the Russell 2000 after reconstitution) as a function of the ranking variable. The clear discontinuity

at zero testifies to the success of our ranking methodology in closely approximating Russell's

assignment approach.12

  For graphical convenience, the variable  , has been centered on the 1,000th position in terms of market
capitalization. Hence,  , > 0 corresponds to stocks predicted to end up in the Russell 2000, and  ,  0
corresponds to stocks predicted to end up in the Russell 1000.

           We next report results of the regression analyses in Panel A of Table II.13 The dependent

variable is an indicator for whether the stock is assigned to the Russell 2000 in the reconstitution

event. The main variable of interest, , is a dummy variable that indicates whether our market

capitalization variable is above 1,000. We report regressions for four different bandwidths (50,

100, 200, and 400) and specifications including polynomials of the first, second, and third degree.

The results show that our ranking variable has statistically strong predictive power for the

assignment probability in 11 out of the 12 regressions. The only regression with no statistical

significance is that with a bandwidth of ±50 and a third-order polynomial (column (3)). The lack

of significance in this specification is arguably due to the fact that the degree of the polynomial is

too high for the small number of observations.

           This analysis also allows us to benchmark our approach against those used by other

researchers. We note, however, that our analysis is conducted on somewhat different sample

periods from those in other papers, and thus coefficients are not fully comparable. Wei and Young

(2017) use a bandwidth of 100 with a linear specification (Table 5, column (2) in their paper).

They find a coefficient of 0.72. In the same specification, we obtain an estimate of 0.82 (our Table

II, Panel A, column (4)). In a specification with a bandwidth of 200 and a third-order polynomial

(their column (1)), their coefficient is 0.55, whereas the corresponding coefficient for us is 0.69

(our Table II, Panel A, column (9)). When we apply Wei and Young's (2017) procedure to our

sample period (2000 to 2006), the estimates are not distinguishable from ours. Appel, Gormley,

and Keim (2019b; their Table 2) use bandwidths of 50 and 100 with polynomials of the first to


13
     The two-stage least squares estimation includes additional first-stage regressions in which the dependent variables
are the assignment variable interacted with , and its polynomials. We do not report these regressions to save
space because they do not add relevant information.

                                                           11
third order. In that paper, five out of the six coefficients are statistically significant and negative.

In our Table II, Panel A, columns (1) to (6), all coefficients are positive and five out of the six are

statistically significant. Appel, Gormley, and Keim (2019b) also use a bandwidth of 250 and find

statistically significant coefficients ranging between 0.09 to 0.65. We use a slightly smaller

bandwidth of 200, and the coefficients range between 0.69 and 0.91.

                                   --- Table II goes about here ---

        We further compare the performance of our ranking variable to other candidates based on

simply using CRSP or Compustat market capitalization. In Table II, Panel B, we estimate equation

(1) for different bandwidths with rankings based on CRSP at the issue and company levels, as well

as on Compustat at the issue and company levels. The best-performing of these alternative ranking

variables seems to be that based on Compustat at the company level, consistent with the evidence

in Table I, Panel B on the number of misclassifications. However, the performance of this

alternative ranking variable in predicting assignment is still inferior to that of our ranking variable

in Panel A of Table II. The other variables perform even worse. For bandwidths of ±50 or ±100,

most of the slopes on  are either statistically insignificant or significant but negative. For

bandwidths of ±200, the coefficients on the first- and second-degree polynomials are positive, but

their magnitude is relatively low. For bandwidths of ±400, all of the coefficients are positive, but

the magnitudes are always smaller than the magnitude of the corresponding regression in Panel A.

Overall, the coefficients in the regressions in Panel A are larger than the coefficients in each of the

corresponding regressions (same bandwidth and polynomial order) in Panel B.

        To summarize, an assessment of the performance of our ranking variable shows that our

measure of total market capitalization has at least comparable and often superior performance in

predicting the Russell assignment than that of other viable candidates. Therefore, our variable can



                                                  12
help improve the significance of future studies that rely on Russell index assignments for

identification.

                  III.   An Empirical Application of the New Ranking Variable

     Ben-David, Franzoni, and Moussawi (2018) use the reconstitution of the Russell 1000/2000

indexes to identify exogenous variation in ETF ownership. The idea is that because most ETFs

passively track indexes, a mechanical and unanticipated change in index composition triggers

exogenous changes in ETF ownership at the stock level. In that paper, we use CRSP market

capitalization in May as a control variable, and thus our methodology is not exposed to the

criticism that June market capitalization rankings have attracted (Wei and Young (2017), Appel,

Gormley, and Keim (2019b), Glossner (2019)). Overall, the procedure closely follows prior

literature that also relies on the Russell reconstitution event (e.g., Appel, Gormley, and Keim

(2016)).

        In this paper, we apply the newly created ranking variable to extend the analysis in Ben-

David, Franzoni, and Moussawi (2018) within the framework of a fuzzy RDD. Before doing so,

we briefly summarize the methodology that we adopt in the 2018 paper.



A.      The Approach in Ben-David, Franzoni, and Moussawi (2018)

        In Ben-David, Franzoni, and Moussawi (2018), we carry out a two-stage least squares

estimation. The first stage consists of a regression of ETF ownership on an indicator for whether

the stock switched index membership in June. For the Russell 1000 sample, the indicator variable

flags stocks that switched to the Russell 2000; for the Russell 2000 sample, the dummy captures a

switch to the Russell 1000. In regression form, the first stage is given by equation (4) in the original

paper. In the second stage, we regress daily volatility (computed using daily returns within the



                                                  13
month) on the fitted value of ETF ownership at the beginning of the month from the first stage.

This regression is given by equation (5) in the original paper.

       We apply this approach to two separate samples that include stock-month observations

between June 2000 and May 2007, that is, all of the months following the annual reconstitutions

between 2000 and 2006. The first sample comprises all stocks that were in the Russell 1000 as of

May of each year, that is, prior to index reconstitution. The second sample comprises all stocks

that were in the Russell 2000 as of May. The sample composition is constant for all months

between June (the first month after index reconstitution) and May of the following year. The idea

underlying the tests is to compare the outcome variables (i.e., volatility) for stocks that changed

indexes versus stocks that remained in the same index, in a neighborhood of the cutoff for index

switching. Following common practice in the literature, we experiment with various bandwidths

around the cutoff (i.e., 50, 100, 200, and 400).

       To address the concern that index switching is not an exogenous event relative to the

dependent variable of interest, we draw inspiration from the RDD methodology. In an RDD,

assignment to the treatment group is conditionally exogenous when the econometrician can control

for polynomials of the assignment variable. Because the actual Russell rankings in May are not

available, we use CRSP market capitalization rankings in May as a proxy. Hence, in our

specifications, we control for polynomials of the CRSP May market capitalization rankings to

make the treatment variable conditionally exogenous.

       Additionally, one may be concerned that persistence in volatility could hardwire our

results. According to this argument, if lagged volatility increases the probability of switching

indexes and volatility is persistent, stocks that switch indexes may display higher future volatility.

However, this argument cannot explain why we find that stocks that switch from the Russell 2000



                                                   14
to the Russell 1000 display lower volatility (see Table V in the original article, columns (6) to

(10)). Moreover, this concern should not arise in the first place because we control for lagged

volatility in all of our specifications.



B.      A Fuzzy RDD to Study the Impact of ETFs on Stock Volatility

        In what follows, we use the newly created ranking variable within a fuzzy RDD to study

the impact of ETF ownership on stock volatility. We refer the reader to the original paper for the

motivation behind this analysis.

        We assume that index redefinition affects stock volatility through ETF ownership. Hence,

to study the relation of interest, we can just use volatility as a dependent variable in equation (2).

However, because we also wish to express the estimates as a relation between volatility and ETF

ownership, we proceed with two-stage least squares estimation. The first stage is a reduced form

that combines equations (1) and (2). Specifically, we regress ETF ownership on the variable ,

and polynomials of the ranking variable:

                                                           

             , = 0 + 1 , +                  2, ,        +  3, , × , + , .                          (3)
                                           =1             =1

        In the second stage, we regress daily volatility computed in the year after reconstitution on

instrumented ETF ownership in the December after reconstitution and polynomials of the ranking

variable:

                                                                

     , = 0 + 1  , +  2,             
                        , +  3, , × , + , ,                                                        (4)
                                              =1               =1




                                                   15
where the coefficient 1 measures the impact of an expected change in ETF ownership due to index

reconstitution, measured in standard deviation units, on stock return volatility after reconstitution,

also measured in standard deviation units.

        In this analysis, we use one observation per stock-year and pool Russell 1000 and 2000

stocks together. The sample period coincides with the reconstitutions between 2000 and 2006,

before the banding rule was introduced. ETF ownership is measured at the end of December after

reconstitution, and volatility is measured from daily returns in the year after reconstitution.

Variable definitions and summary statistics are presented in Appendix C.

        Before conducting the regression analysis, we provide a graphical summary of the data.14

Figure 2, Panel A presents ETF ownership (as of the December after reconstitution). ETF

ownership is expected to be significantly higher by about 40 bps for stocks predicted to end up in

the Russell 2000, that is, for rankings above zero, than for those predicted to enter the Russell

1000. The mean of ETF ownership in this sample is about 90 bps and the standard deviation is 84

bps. Hence, the increase is economically significant. When we use lagged ETF ownership in March

before reconstitution (Figure 2, Panel B), there is no discontinuity around the cutoff.

                                     --- Figure 2 goes about here ---

        In Figure 3, Panels A and B, we repeat the exercise for total institutional ownership net of

ETF ownership. Consistent with prior literature (e.g., Wei and Young (2017)), the panels show

that there is no positive jump in total institutional ownership net of ETFs in either the current year

or the preceding year. Hence, we conclude that the Russell reconstitution generates significant

changes in ETF ownership but not in institutional ownership in general.




14
  Based on the argument in Gelman and Imbens (2019) that high-order polynomials lead to noisy estimates, in the
graphs we plot linear polynomials estimated with a triangular kernel centered on the cutoff.

                                                      16
                                      --- Figure 3 goes about here ---

        Finally, we present volatility and lagged volatility in Figure 4, Panels A and B. Here,

volatility is higher to the right of the cutoff, that is, for stocks that are predicted to end up in the

Russell 2000. We again find no visible discontinuity in volatility around the cutoff in the year

before the reconstitution event.

        We next examine the relations of interest in a regression framework. Following equations

(1) and (2), we regress ETF ownership measured in the December after reconstitution on the

instrumented index assignment indicator. Table II, Panel A presents the results of the first-stage

regressions (predicting index assignment). We choose bandwidths around the cutoff ranging from

50 to 400 and present specifications with polynomials ranging from the first to the third order. The

regressions include time fixed effects to account for trends in ETF ownership, and we cluster

standard errors at the stock level.

        Table III, Panel A presents results for the second stage on the level of ETF ownership in

December, which we standardize by dividing by the standard deviation in the regression sample.

The estimates show that ETF ownership is significantly higher for the largest stocks in the Russell

2000 relative to the smallest stocks in the Russell 1000, by 52% to 96% (depending on the

bandwidth and polynomial degree) of a standard deviation of the dependent variable. Hence, index

assignment generates a large change in ETF ownership, consistent with Figure 2, Panel A (in which

ETF ownership is not standardized).

                                      --- Table III goes about here ---

        Finally, Panel B of Table III uses the (standardized) change in ETF ownership between

March before reconstitution and December after reconstitution as the dependent variable. This

specification addresses the concern that there could be pre-determined differences in ETF



                                                     17
ownership around the cutoff. (Panel B of Figure 2 already helps rule out this possibility.) We notice

that (instrumented) assignment to treatment corresponds to large changes (of about one standard

deviation) in ETF ownership after reconstitution.

       Table IV, Panel A reports the estimates of equation (4). We control for volatility in the

prior year to address the above-mentioned concern that volatility could affect the probability of

switching indexes. Across specifications, we find that volatility increases significantly with ETF

ownership, by 21% to 76% (depending on the bandwidth and polynomial degree) of a standard

deviation for a one-standard-deviation change in ETF ownership. Restricting attention to the

bandwidths above 50 for comparability, the magnitude of the median estimate is about 31%, which

is almost identical to the result presented in our 2018 paper of about 31% of a standard deviation.

                                  --- Table IV goes about here ---

       In Table IV, Panel B, we modify the specifications from Panel A so that the dependent

variable is the year-over-year change in daily volatility around the reconstitution date. In this case,

we do not include prior-year volatility among the controls. The estimates are consistent with Panel

A and show that volatility increases when ETF ownership rises as a consequence of index

reconstitution.

       We next run regressions in which volatility is the dependent variable in equation (2) and

report the results in Table IV, Panel C. The estimates are again significant. Across specifications,

volatility is about 20% of a standard deviation higher for stocks in the Russell 2000 than for stocks

in the Russell 1000. We present the daily volatility as well as a linear fit in Figure 4, Panel A (in

which volatility is not standardized).

       Gelman and Imbens (2019) argue that controlling for global high-order polynomials in

regression discontinuity analyses is a flawed approach because of noisy estimates, sensitivity to



                                                  18
the degree of the polynomial, and poor coverage of confidence intervals. They recommend instead

using estimators based on local linear or quadratic polynomials. Following their advice, in Table

IV, Panel D we modify the specifications of Panel C by including local polynomials of the first

and second degree. The results are virtually unchanged in terms of both magnitude and

significance.15

         To conclude, the fuzzy RDD confirms the results in our 2018 article in terms of both

significance and magnitude.



                                                IV.       Conclusion

         In this paper we provide an improved methodology for approximating the ranking variable

used by Russell to assign stocks to the Russell 1000/2000 indexes. The new ranking variable

produces a lower number of misclassified companies relative to other reasonable candidates and a

better prediction of the assignment probability than prior studies. Using this variable, we extend

and corroborate the findings in Ben-David, Franzoni, and Moussawi (2018).

         We provide the code for constructing this variable in Appendix B of this paper. The data

are available to other researchers wishing to apply this identification strategy per request.

Figure 3. Other institutions' ownership. The figure plots ownership by institutions other than
ETFs in December after reconstitution (Panel A) and in March before reconstitution (Panel B)
against market capitalization rankings. A rank of 0 corresponds to the 1,000th stock based on
market capitalization. Each bin captures the average of 20 ranks over the sample period. The
sample ranges between 2000 and 2006. The solid lines are fitted values from first-order
polynomials estimated with a triangular kernel centered on the cutoff.

                         Performance of Different Computational Approaches for the Assignment Variable
The table presents statistics on the performance of our new market capitalization ranking variable compared to other measures of market
capitalization. Panel A compares the market capitalization generated by the new variable to the market capitalization generated by
alternative variables. Panel B reports the number of misclassifications of Russell 3000 stocks into the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000
indexes during the seven reconstitution years between May 2000 and May 2006. On the rank date of each year, we compute four different
market cap measures: (1) the CRSP market cap at the issue level (PERMNO), (2) the total market cap for all issues mapped to the same
company in CRSP (PERMCO), (3) the total market cap using the Compustat Securities Daily database aggregated at the company level,
and (4) the market cap based on the Compustat Quarterly shares outstanding (CSHOQ). Our ranking methodology relies first on (2),
then (3) when (1) is missing, and (4) when it is higher than (2) and (3). Ranking is performed according to the ranking of the Russell
3000 using their various market capitalization measures computed at the end of the rank date. The number of Russell 3000 stocks on
the reconstitution date at the end of June is sometimes less than 3,000 because Russell follows a "no-replacement" rule.

                                                  First Stage: Predicting Index Membership
The table reports estimates of equation (1). The sample includes one stock observation per year. The dependent variable is index
assignment. Time fixed effects are included in all specifications. We report estimates from different bandwidths around the cutoff for
reconstitution (50, 100, 200, and 400 ranks) and specifications with different polynomials of the ranking variable (from the first to the
third degree). Standard errors are clustered by stock. The sample spans the Russell reconstitutions between 2000 and 2006.

The table reports estimates of equation (2). The sample includes one stock observation per year. In Panel A, the dependent variable is
ETF ownership in December after the Russell index reconstitution, expressed in standard deviation units. In Panel B, the dependent
variable is the March-to-December change in ETF ownership expressed in standard deviation units. Time fixed effects are included in
all specifications. We report estimates from different bandwidths around the cutoff for reconstitution (50, 100, 200, and 400 ranks) and
specifications with different polynomials of the ranking variable (from the first to the third degree). Standard errors are clustered by
stock. The sample spans the Russell reconstitutions between 2000 and 2006.

The table reports estimates of equations (2) and (4). The sample includes one stock observation per year. Panel A follows equation (4),
and the dependent variable is daily volatility computed in the year after the Russell index reconstitution and expressed in standard
deviation units. Panel B also follows equation (4), and the dependent variable is the year-over-year change in daily volatility around the
reconstitution. Panel C follows equation (2), and the dependent variable is daily volatility in the year after reconstitution. In Panels A,
B, and C, the polynomials are global. In Panel D, we implement the fuzzy RDD using local polynomials. For this estimation, we use
first- and second-degree local polynomials with a triangular kernel. All of the specifications include time fixed effects. We report
estimates from different bandwidths around the cutoff for reconstitution (50, 100, 200, and 400 ranks) and specifications with different
polynomials of the ranking variable (from the first to the third degree). Standard errors are clustered by stock. The sample spans the
Russell reconstitutions between 2000 and 2006.

              Appendix A: Historical Russell Rank Dates and Reconstitution Dates
We are grateful to FTSE Russell for providing a detailed calendar of its historical index
reconstitutions. According to Russell, US indexes were rebalanced quarterly between 1979 to
1986, semi-annually from 1987 to 1989, and annually after June 1989. For time periods prior to
when reconstitution was performed annually, security lists were ranked based on the month of
rebalancing. For example, for March 1979, the securities were ranked based on their total market
capitalization on March 31, 1979. When the reconstitution was first performed annually in June
1989, the reconstitution date was the final business day of June. In 2004, Russell revised the
reconstitution date to the last Friday in June. In 2007, the reconstitution was effective after the
close on the last Friday in June unless the last Friday occurred on the 28th, 29th, or 30th (if so,
reconstitution occurred on the prior Friday). In 2013, the reconstitution date rule was changed to
after the close on the last Friday in June unless the last Friday occurs on the 29th or 30th. If so,
reconstitution will occur the prior Friday.

                Appendix B: Code Logic to Generate the Russell Rank Proxy
The Russell 3000 constituent data between 2000 and 2006 are not available on Wharton Research
Data Services (WRDS) as of the publication of this article, but we make it available to researchers
who ask. We matched each Russell constituent to its CRSP PERMNO and Compustat's GVKEY
using historical CUSIP information in CRSP MSENAMES and Compustat Snapshot's
CNSECURITY datasets. The resulting dataset, Russell_1, is then merged with the CRSP,
Compustat Securities, and Compustat Quarterly information to compute the RANK variable,
which represents our proxy for the Russell true rank. CRSP and COMP libraries are the SAS
libraries for CRSP and Compustat datasets on WRDS, and %POPULATE is the SAS macro in the
WRDS Research Macro section.

                  Appendix C: Variable Definitions and Summary Statistics
The table presents summary statistics for the variables used in the regressions presented in
Tables 3 and 4. Note that the regressions in these tables are presented using standardized
variables. All variables are winsorized at the 1% and 99% levels.

Panel A: Variable Definitions
Institutional ownership in December: Institutional ownership is computed using the Thomson-
Reuters 13F Institutional Ownership database. For each stock, we sum the ownership by all
institutions in December and scale that number by the total shares outstanding of the stock.

ETF ownership in December: ETF ownership is computed using the Thomson-Reuters Global
Ownership database. We first identify all ETFs using the fund CUSIP and ticker information in
the OWNSECMAP and OWNFUNDTIC datasets, and then merge it with the list of ETF CUSIP
and tickers extracted from CRSP, Compustat, and the OWNSECINFO dataset (using the
SecClsCode = "ETF" condition). In December, we use the nearest fund holding reports and sum
the ownership by all ETFs in each stock and then scale that number by the total shares
outstanding of that stock.

Daily stock volatility: Using the CRSP daily stock file data, we compute the stock volatility
measure as the standard deviation of the log (1+ daily returns) for all daily observations between
the reconstitution effective date (July 1) and the next reconstitution effective date (June 30 of the
following year).
