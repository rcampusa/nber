       This paper reviews and analyzes forecasts of the Social Security mist funds, government
spending, medical expenditures. and other elements of aggregate income and spending.
According to these forecasts, the aging of the U.S. population will require some increases in taxes
to support the retirement system. It should reduce the saving rate, and the composition of output
Will change. By themselves, these changes seem manageable. However, the direct effects of
aging are completely dominated by the projected increases in medical expenditures. Although
medical costs interact with aging, most of the increases are not related to aging. Even the
moderately high forecast of medical spending will require that all increases in output between
now and 2020 be devoted to the consumption of medical services, allowing no increase in any
other component of consumption.

I. Introduction



      The developed countries are all forecast to have a demographic change to older

populations. The change is the combined result of the temporarily high fertility rates

that produced the baby boom and falling mortality rates that both increased the

probability of living to 65 and increased life expectancy at 65. Table 1 shows the
percentage of the population aged 65 or over (elderly) in seven developed countries and

projected percentages. The   percentage is expected to increase from 12% in 1990 to 16%

in 2020. Compared with some other countries the change in the U.S. is rather modest:

for example, the percentage is expected to increase from 11% to 21% in Japan.

       In the U.S. after 2020 the fraction of the population over age 65 is expected to

increase further as the baby boom generation fully ages past 65. However, the growth in

the oldest-old population (85 or over) is expected to be much larger: the percentage of

the population 85 or over is forecast to double by 2020 and increase by 275% by 2040

(Advisory Council, 1991a).

       These demographic changes may have profound effects on the economy because

the economic behavior of the elderly is very different from the nonelderly. The most

obvious difference is in their labor force participation: an older population will have

fewer workers per person, and so, cetpar., the economy will have lower output per

person. The elderly tend to dissave whereas the working-age population saves. Thus, an

older population will have a lower saving rate. The pattern of consumption by the

cldcrly is different: they consume more medical services and less private transportation.
But to the extent these goods are purchased in a normally functioning market, the

economy should accommodate to a change in the pattern of consumption. In the U.S.

the elderly are substantially supported by the government through the tax and transfer

system, in particular through Social Security (the public pension system in the U.S.),

through Medicare (the government health insurance system for the elderly), and through

Medicaid (the government health insurance system for the poor, whose primary users are

the elderly). Therefore, part of their income and some of their consumption do not arise

from market transactions, but from taxation and subsidized spending. Not only may

there be deadweight losses from this system, but an aging population will require

increasing taxation, which may strain the political consensus underlying the programs.

Thus, the future of the Social Security system has been questioned.

           This is especially troubling for the elderly because of the importance of Social

Security income. Table 2 shows the sources of income of the elderly in the U.S. 93% of

households in which an elderly person lived received Social Security income, compared

with just 31% with income from private pensions.' Social Security accounts for 38% of

the total income, but the distribution of income is such that it is much more important to

some households than this figure would suggest. The fraction of households with more

than 20% of their income from Social Security is 0.82; the fraction with more than half

of their income from Social Security is 0.55. That is, more than half the households have

more than half of their income from Social Security. These figures suggest than any

uncertainty about the future of the Social Security system is a matter of concern to the

elderly.



                                                2
      The goal of this paper is analyze some projections of the U.S. economy to the

year 2020. The main focus will be the effects of population aging arising from

compositional effects and from   increased   life expectancy at age 65. However, in the U.S.

the effects of rapidly rising medical expenditures interact with an aging population and

dominate the composition of consumption and government spending in the year 2020, so

they are the subject of considerable analysis. The analysis will find the effects on

households, firms, and government, and how the effects interact at the macro level.



2. Social Security Administration Forecasts.



       The Office of the Actuary of the Social Security Administration makes detailed

forecasts of the future of the Social Security system. The greatest effort is made for the

demographic variables, principally fertility rates and mortality rates, because in the long

run, trends in demographics have the greatest impact on the system. Earnings,
unemployment, inflation, and other macro variables are also forecast, and these variables

enter a complicated forecasting model which incorporates the Social Security law. The

results are forecasts of income and expenditures of the Social Security system, as well as

a great number of other variables. These forecasts will be the basis of the analysis of

this section.



2.1. Demographic aspects of the Social Security forecasts.




                                                3
       There are three groups of forecasts. Forecast I is a high income-low cost

projection based on assumptions of high fertility and low increases in life expectancy.

Forecast HI is a low income-high cost projection based on low fertility and high increases

in life expectancy. Forecast II, which is normally used, is a medium level projection.

       The forecasts depend critically on the assumptions about fertility and mortality.

Table 3 has summaries of the main assumptions. Between I and III, there is substantiai

variation in the assumptions, which has led many users of the forecasts to assume that I

and III bound the possible outcomes. However, there is no reason to suppose this. For

example, Manton, Singer and Stailard, 1993, and Vaupel, 1993, have population

forecasting models that under some circumstances predict much larger elderly

populations than the population under III.

       Table 4 has life expectancies conditional on reaching age 65. The fiscal stability

of the Social Security system depends critically on conditional life expectancy: a 1%
increase in life expectancy at 65   increases   expected costs by 1%. There is considerable
variation between I and Ill: for example, life expectancy of females in 2040 is 20%

higher under III than under I. This implies that costs will be 20% higher.

       We cannot assess the reasonableness of the demographic assumptions that

underlie the forecasts by comparing the predictions with actual outcomes because we
have not observed the process for enough years. However, if the forecasts vary

considerably from year-to-year, it would suggest that even small amounts of new

information have large impacts on the forecasts. This, in turn, would suggest that the

forecasts are not very reliable. Table 5 compares forecasts to the years 2000, 2020 and


                                                 4
2040 of life expectancy at age 65. The forecasts were made in 1989 and 1993 so we can

see how the forecasts evolved with new information. Especially for III there were rather
large declines predicted in life expectancy. Take 2000 for example. The forecast of life

expectancy of women 10 years in the future changed by about 3% in just four years.
       Although we cannot compare the demographic forecasts with actual outcomes, we

can compare some of the economic forecast with outcomes because of the shorter time

scale. Table 6 summarizes such a comparison for 4-year-ahead forecasts of sonic

economic variables. The table gives the number of observations (comparisons between

predicted and realized outcomes), the percentage of the realizations that fell between the

I and III forecasts, the percentage that were exactly the same as either I or ifi (on the

boundary) and the percentage outside the range bounded by I and III. For example,

there were 11 comparisons of the actual unemployment rate with the 4-year-ahead

forecast unemployment rate. 36% of the realizations fell within the range given by I and

III, 18% were equal to the I or 111 forecast, and 46% fell outside the range. Therefore,

one would estimate that I and III form a 36% confidence interval for 4-year-ahead

forecasts of the unemployment rate. From this point of view, it is apparent that I and III

do not form high-level confidence intervals of forecasts of the economic variables.

Whether this will prove to be true for the demographic variables will be seen in 20 or 30

 years, but in the meantime we should probably not treat I and UI as giving high-level

 confidence bounds. Although I will not repeat this caution later in this paper, it should

 be assumed that I have this in mind.

        The assumptions about fertility and mortality, along with other economic and


                                              5
demographic assumptions are used in a complicated forecasting model to find future

income, costs and so forth, and the number of Social Security beneficiaries and the

number of workers paying into the system (covered workers). The ratio of beneficiaries

to covered workers is important because it gives the number of retirees each worker

supports through the Social Security tax and transfer system. Table 7 shows that even

under II, the intermediated forecast, the ratio rises from 0.30 to 0.41 in 2020 to 0.51 in

2040. Without any other accompanying changes the implication is that the tax rate on

each worker will have to be raised substantially. Under III the ratio increases to 0.62 by

2040, implying that the tax rate would have to double.



2.2. Financial aspects of the Social Security forecasts.



       The Social Security system is composed of three funds. They are:



              The Old-Age Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Fund (OASDI).

      This fund has two pans: Old-Age Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability

      Insurance (DI). OASI primarily supports retired workers and their spouses and

      widows. It provides the old-age public pensions in the U.S., and it is what most

      people think of when they refer to Social Security. DI supports disabled workers.

      It is a much smaller program than OASI.



             The Federal Hospital Insurance Fund (HI). This is part A of the Medicare


                                             6
      system, which provides health insurance to the elderly.



                The Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Fund (SMI). This is part

      B of the Medicare system. It differs from HI in that the retired elderly voluntarily

      pay a premium to be enrolled. The premium is normally set to cover 25% of the

      cost of the program with the other 75% of cost coming from general Treasury

       funds. Almost all elderly subscribe to SM!.



       The financial status of OASDI and HI is generally stated in terms of the income

rate and the cost rate. The income rate is the percentage of the taxable payroll paid into

the funds through Social Security taxes.2 The cost rate is the percentage of the taxable

payroll paid in Social Security benefits. These are good measures because they are

invariant to scale effects aria if they differ, they directly show how tax rates would have

to change to balance the funds.

       Table 8 has the income and cost rates under I, II and Ill, and the balance, which

is the percentage of annual expenditures in the fund. In 1991 the income rate was 12.6

and the cost rate was 11.0, indicating that the OASDI fund was accumulating monies at

the rate of 1.6% of taxable payroll. The balance in the fund was 83% of annual

expenditures.
       Over the next 60 years the income rate is forecast to be approximately stable, but

the cost rate will increase. Under I, which is based on assumptions of high fertility and

high mortality, the fund remains positive over the forecast horizon, and even in 2040


                                              7
 when the baby boom generation is aged 80-90, the cost rate is only marginally greater

 than the income rate.

        Under   lithe cost rate   exceeds the income rate sometime between 2015 and 2020

 (not shown) but because   of accumulations the fund has a positive balance until sometime
 between 2040 and 2045 (not shown). The changes required to bring the fund into

 balance are not particularly large: in 2020 the tax rate would have to be increased by
 1% of taxable payroll to match income with cost.

       Even under III, which is based on low fertility and low mortality, the tax increases
in the early part of the forecast period are rather small: an increase of 3.0 in the income

rate would make income and expenditures the same in 2020.

       The long-run financial situation of the funds can be found from the summarized

income and cost rates. These are the expected present value of the income and cost

streams normalized by the expected present value of taxable payroll. Over 1991-2040 the

summarized income rate under H is 13.l0and the summarized cost rate is 13.80. This

means that the fund would just be in balance in 2040 if today the tax rate were

permanently increased by 0.7% of taxable payroll. Even under III the summarized cost

rate is just 2.3% of taxable payroll higher than the income rate. These figures indicate

that as far as the retirement part of Social Security is concerned, the aging of the

population will increase costs, but the increase is manageable.

      Table 9 has the cost rates for HI, and they have a rather different time path then

the cost rates for OASDI. (The income rate is constant under current law at 2.90.)

Even under lIthe cost rate more than doubles by 2020. Under Ill, the increase is 7.9%



                                             8
of taxable payroll: this is larger than the increase under III in OASDI, even though

OASDI is a much larger program.3

        The income and cost rates are normalized by taxable payroll, which is about 45%

of GNP. Table 10 shows OASDI and HI expenditures under ii as a percentage of GNP.

What is striking is how large the increase in NJ is forecast to be compared with the

forecast for OASDI: by 2040 HI is forecast to consume an additional 2.4% of GNP.

Even these forecasts are conservative, however, compared with some other expert

forecasts which J will discuss below.



3.   Forecasts by the Expert Panel.



        The 1991 Advisory Council on Social Security convened a panel of economists

and actuaries (the Expert Panel) to study the impact of population aging on households,

government, firms and the macro economy. It was evident, however, that such a study

would be incomplete without considering the evolution of health care costs because of

their high rate of growth and because of the interaction between health care costs and

population aging. This section will analyze some of the findings of the Expert Panel.4

        The panel requested that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)

make four forecasts or scenarios of health care costs. These forecasts used the main

demographic and economic assumptions of the Social Security Administration's forecast

II, but used assumptions about the evolution of health care costs different from those

imbedded in I, II, and Ill. The four health care forecasts all were based on forecasting


                                             9
 the cost and use of 18 different types of hea]th care resources. They all were based on

 use    by age categories so they included changes in cost due to changes in age

 composition. The main differences in the four scenarios come from the differences in

 the assumptions about the real rate of inflation of medical services and about the rate of

 use and intensity of use holding age constant.3

          Table 11 gives examples of the differences in assumptions and use for the four

 forecasts. Scenario 1 is the highest cost forecast. It assumes that the real rate of health

 care inflation from 1970 to 1990 (1.4%) will continue to 2000 and then fall to 1.2%. The

 rate of increase in real consumption per person will continue at the 1970-1990 rate

 (4.7% per year). Scenario 2 is the same as I except that the rate of increase in per

capita consumption falls to about 4% after 2000. Scenario 3 has lower rates of inflation

and "increase in use than have been observed over the last 20 years. The assumptions

about health care costs in 3 are approximately the same as those in SSA's I, II and III

forecasts discussed in section 2. Scenario 4 has no real medical cost inflation and no

increase in use or intensity given age. That is, it shows the effects of population aging
only.

         In 1990 about 12.2% of GNP was consumed in medical expenditures. By 2020

this is forecast to rise to 36.0% under scenario 1,31.5% under 2,22.7% under 3 and

13.7% under 4. A comparison of 4 with the other scenarios shows that most of the

increase in these scenarios comes from assuming that past increases in cost and use will

continue into the future: holding real prices, and age-adjusted use and intensity of use

per person constant, spending for medical care will increase by just 1.5% of GNP. This


                                              10
is the cet.par. aging component. Of course, increasing prices and use of medical services

along with population aging will have effects that are greater than the marginal increases

because    of interactions. Here the increases are great enough that the interactions are

not just second-order effects.

       It is already clear that scenario 3 and possibly 2 are not wildly improbable and

that scenario   4 will be a substantial underestimate.   The estimate of 1993 medical care

expenditures is 14% of GNP compared with 12,2% in 1990. If this rate of increase

continues until 2000, medical care expenditures will be about 19% of GNP, which is

larger than under any of the scenarios.

       In the rest of the paper I will give outcomes under scenarios 2 and 3. Neither the

panel nor I thought, however, that they necessarily bound the medical care expenditure
outcomes. The other forecasting assumptions (unemployment, general inflation,

demographics and so forth) are those of SSA's forecast II.



3.1. Impact on Government



          Table 12 has OASDHI income and cost rates for the two scenarios. Income is

roughly constant, but costs increase substantially: even under 3 the tax rate would
                                                                                    have


to increase by 6.7% of payroll. As we have already seen, only minority part of this is

caused by OASDI (2.9% in Table 8, II).

          The impact on governmental budgets from increasing health care costs and

demographics is shown in Table 13. It shows a decline in federal government purchases.


                                                11
This is caused by a decline in defense spending from 5.8% of GNP to 3.9% and some

decrease in spending for education resulting from the changing age structure of the

population. These decreases more than offset an increase in direct expenditures for

health care by the federal government. Of course, the increases in OASDI and HI are

much greater than the fall in government purchases so that the total federal budget as a

percentage of GNP will increase. A larger fraction of the federal government budget

will be transfers rather than direct purchases.

       Under either scenario, state and local government spending will increase due to

higher medical care expenditures even though there is some offset from reduced

education expenditures.



3.2. Impact on Households.



       Average real income of elderly households is forecast to increase by 47% by 2020,

mainly due to increases in Social Security benefits and pension income. Income of

nonelderly households is forecast to increase by 39%. When combined with the growing

elderly population, these forecasts imply that a substantially greater fraction of the

income in the economy will go to elderly households, about 10.6% compared with 7.4%

in j9g96

       Medical expenditures by househo]ds will rise substantially under either scenarios 2

or 3. Table 14 shows out-of-pocket medical care expenditures expressed as a percentage

of median before.tax income. In 1989 a couple with median income would have spent



                                             12
about 17% of its income on out-of-pocket medical expenses. As the table shows this

percentage is expected to grow substantially to 30% under scenario 2 and 23% under

scenario 3. Expenditures are expected to grow even more for singles.

      A major component of medical care expenditures by households is the premium

for SMI, even though the premium is only 25% of actual cost. Current law establishes

the SMI premium for each year until 1995. The first part of Table 15 shows what the

premium would be in 2020 if there is no change in the law, and it shows that the

premium would cover a small fraction of actual costs. Because the historical aim has

been that the premium cover 25% of costs, as it did in 1989. the second part of the table

shows the premium should it cover 25% of SMI costs. This is probably more relevant.

The premium will increase under scenario 3 by 359% real, and will require 7% and 9%

of the median incomes of couples and singles. If this expenditure is added to the out-of-

pocket of Table 14, under scenario 3 costs for couples will increase from 20% of median

income to 30% and of singles from 25% to 38%. This seems like a large burden indeed.



3.3. Impact on Firms.



       Firms will have increase liabilities for pensions because of the demographic

changes, but unless coverage expands greatly the increased burden should be no more

than what we have seen for OASDI. Furthermore, pension growth has been in defined

contribution pians, which place no liability on the firm once the contribution has been

earned.



                                            13
        However, firms will have substantial exposure to risks associated with medical

 care expenditures.   Table 16 shows estimated medical care expenditures paid for by

 private insurance: per capita the increase under scenario 3 is 226%. In that about 80%

 of medical insurance is associated with employment, firms can expect sharply higher

expenses for medical insurance. Of course, under this scenario, workers can expect that

 most, if not all, of the growth in total compensation will be in fringe benefits to cover

medical expenses.



3.4. Impact in the Aggregate.



       Sources of financing medical care expenditures should change. According to

Table 17, the percentage paid by Medicare will increase from 16.5% to 25.5% under

scenario 3, mainly the because of the demographic changes. This is equivalent to an

increases from 2% of GNP to 5.8% of GNP. Similarly, Medicaid will increase to 3% of

GNP. Even though the fraction of total expenses paid by private insurance and out-of-

pocket will fall, they will still increase as a fraction of GNP because of the rapid increase

in total medical costs. For example, private insurance will pay 6.7% of GNP in medical

care expenditures up from 4% in 1989.

       The fraction of personal consumption by the elderly will change because of

demographic changes, income changes and for other reasons. To get a rough idea of the

magnitude, the panel divided the population into the elderly and nonelderly. The 1988

Consumer Expenditure Survey was used to find differences in the consumption patterns



                                             14
of the two groups. If incomes do not change and consumption patterns are fixed, the

population changes will indicate how consumption of different commodities will change

between the two groups. For example, the nonelderly consume more motor vehicles

than the elderly, so aggregate consumption of motor vehicles should fall as the

population ages. To account for income changes the panel assumed the income elasticity

of each commodity group was 1.0. Therefore, consumption by commodity group for each

age group can be forecast from the income and demographic forecasts of SSA's

projection II. Consumption of medical services is not forecast in this way; it comes from

the scenarios furnished by HCFA.

      Table 18 shows the shares of personal consumption by the nonelderly and by the

elderly. In 1989, non-health consumption by the elderly was 12% of their total, which

was just their share in the population. However, they consumed 36% of the health care

services, mainly through the transfers in Medicare and Medicaid. These transfers are, of

course, not recorded as income; were they to be, the elderly would have a much larger

share of total income than indicated by money income. In total the elderly consumed

15% of private consumption in 1989.

       In 2020 the elderly are forecast to be 16% of the population. They will consume

15% of non-health persona! consumption, but 45% of the health care services. This

increase is due to the demographic changes. In total under scenario 3 the elderly will

consume 21% of total personal consumption even though they will be just 16% of the

population.

       With such large predicted increases in medical care expenditures, it is natural to



                                            15
wonder where the increased consumption will come from. To understand the magnitude

of the adjustment that would be required, the demands of government, consumption,

investment and the foreign sector were either forecast or assumed. For example, as

mentioned above, it was assumed that federal government purchases would fall from

7.7% of GNP to 6.2% (Table 13, scenario 3). Personal consumption except for health

crc expenditures were calculated form the assumption of an income elasticity of 1.0.

Health care expenditures come from the HCFA scenarios. The foreign sector is

assumed to be in balance, and gross investment to return to its historic level of 13% of

GNP.

       Table 19 has the result of these forecasts and assumptions. Personal consumption

was 66.3% of GNP in 1989. 30.9% was in goods and 35.5 in services. Among

consumption of services consumption of housing was 14.3% of GNP and consumption of

medical services was about 8.4%. Government purchases were 19.7%, gross investment

was 14.8% and exports were -0.9%. Under scenario 3, personal consumption will

increase to 77% of GNP with most of the increase coming from higher medical care

expenditures. Government purchases and gross investment will fall slightly. Because

there is no residual category that makes total demand equal total supply, demand does

not have to equal supply, and indeed scenario 3 shows total demand at 108.9% of supply.

Under scenario 2 demand will be 116.6% of supply.

       Of course, adjustments will bring supply and demand into equality. One way to

see the magnitude of the adjustments that will be required is to suppose that medical

care expenditures, investment, government spending and the foreign sector demands are



                                           16
met; then, all the adjustment will have to come from non-health personal consumption.

Table 20 shows the allocation of per capita GNP under this assumption. Total per

capita ONP increases from $20,340 to $27,890. Under scenario 2, $8790 will be spent on

health care expenses, $1450 on education, and so forth. Non-health personal

consumption, the residual category, will be $10,990, which is less than the 1989 level.

That is, all the growth in per capita GNP between 1989 and 2020 (38%) will be used to

finance increases in medical care expenditures. Jt is hard to see that this outcome will

be desired in the general population. Even under scenario 3, non-health consumption

grows at a much smaller rate than GNP.

       From two persliectives an older population could be expected to have a lower

average saving rate than a younger population. In the first perspective, increasing the

fraction of the population that is aged will increase the asset holdings of the aged

population. At a constant rate of asset decurnulation, a greater fraction of the savings of

the working-age population will be used to purchase the assets that the elderly are

selling. Thus, the average saving rate will fall.' In the second perspective, the life cycle

hypothesis of consumption implies that the working population saves and the retired

population dissaves; therefore, cer.par. increasing the fraction that is elderly should

 reduced the saving rate out of income. Of course, these two perspectives are really two

 ways of saying the same thing.

       Table 21 shows estimates of the assets of elderly in 1989 and 2020, and the

 resulting levels of asset decumulation. The most important assumption is about the rate

 of dissaving: it is taken to be 2.9% of bequeathable nonhousing wealth. This figure is


                                              17
 estimated from observed wealth changes of elderly households in the 1984 Survey of

 Income and Program Participation (SlIP), Waves 4 and 7 (Hurd, 1991). The economy

 was rather stable during the mid-1980's so the rate of wealth change may well represent

 the desired long-run rate of change. Furthermore, the 10-year averages from the

 Retirement History Survey (3.2%) are very similar to the averages from SIPP even

 though the economic conditions during the years of the Retirement History Survey

 (1969-1979) were quite different. Other panel data sets give estimates that overall are

 about this magnitude.8

        In 1989, the elderly held about $1.6 trillion of nonhousing bequeathable wealth.

At a rate of dissaving of 2.9%, they sold $46 billion of assets, which was 2.2% of after-tax

earnings. Under the assumptions given in the table, nonhousing assets of the elderly will

grow to $3.7 trillion by 2020 and the elderly wilt decumulate at a rate of $107 billion per

year. This is 3.0% of after-tax earnings, requiring 0.8% more of household saving. Thus,

the household saving rate is projected to fall from 4.6% to 3.8%.

       An alternative calculation based on saving rates out of income is the following:.

The average one-year rate of wealth decumulation in SIPP was 2.9% from mean wealth

of $75.9 thousand, implying an excess of consumption over income of $3.8 thousand. Net

income of the elderly in 1984 was $13,200 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1989), so the rate

of saving out of income by the elderly was -16.6%. I will take this to be the desired or

steady-state rate of saving by the elderly. By assuming that the saving rates of the

elderly and nonelderly are stable over time, the effects of population aging on the

aggregate saving rate can be found simply by changing the weights on the saving rates of



                                               18
each group. In 1989 the elderly were 12% of the population and their average

household income was 62.3% of average household income of the population. The

household saving rate out of after-tax income was 4.6%. Therefore, the saving rate of

the nonelderly households was 6.3%. in 2020 the elderly are forecast to be 16% of the

population. Under the assumption that the average income of elderly households grows

by 47% and the income of nonelderly households by 38% (Advisory Council, 1991), the

aggregate household saving rate will fall by 0.7% to 3.9% of after-tax household income.

This is very close to the estimate from the method based on the change in asset holdings.



      In view of the large variation over time in the household saving rate and the large

international variation, the fall in the household saving rate from 4.6% to 3.8% or 3.9%

does not seem like a large change.



4. Conclusion



       Excluding increases in medical care expenditures, at least to the year 2020, the

aging of the population in the U.S. seemsto be manageable: the required increases in

Social Security retirement benefits will require some but not large tax increases; the

change in the mix of consumption is rather modest; the estimated effects on the

aggregate saving rate are within the bounds of historical variation. The effects beyond

2020 are greater, but they are not of crisis proportions. These demographic changes and

the increased requirements for retirement income are dominated by increases in



                                            19
spending for health care. Even the forecasts to 2020 probably cannot be realized

because of the required reduction in other spending.

       Some of the reduction in other spending may be in saving and investment. We do

not know enough about saving determination at the household level to predict how a

large increase in medical care expenditures financed through Social Security taxation,

out-of-pocket and employers will affect saving rates; but it may noted that the fall in the

U.S. saving rate coincided with the large increase in health care spending.

1. These are almost all associated with previous employment in the private sector.

2. The taxable payroll includes most earnings and has a maximum ($57,000 in 1993).

The combined OASI and DI tax rate is 6.20% paid by the employee and 6.20% paid by

the employer. A self-employed person pays both.
3. A comparison of the cost rates shows that HI is only about one-fourth the size of

OASDI.

4. I was a member of the panel, and I did some of the calculations reported in this

section, particularly on the macro economy and saving rates.

5. Intensity of use refers to the cost of a specific encounter with the health care system.

For example, holding prices constant a visit to a doctor may change because the visit

takes longer, or more procedures are used.

6. Note that these figures cannot be used to make utility comparisons because elderly

households are considerably smaller than nonelderly households, and because no

accounting is made of nonmoney income.

7. It is of independent interest to estimate the increase in the stock of assets that will be

put on the market as the population ages.
