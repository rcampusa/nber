                                           ABSTRACT


      This paper conducts counterfactual historical analysis of several monetary policy rules by

contrasting actual settings of instrument variables with values that would have been specified by the

rules in response to prevailing conditions. Of particular interest is whether major policy mistakes,

judged ex post, would have been prevented by candidate rules. The rules studied include those of

Taylor and McCallum, previously considered by Alison Stuart, plus several additional combinations

of instrument and target variables. The time spans examined are 1962-1998 for the U.S. and U.K.,

and 1972-1998 for Japan. In addition to various substantive findings, the paper develops several

methodological arguments. A surprising result is that rules’ messages are evidently more dependent

upon the specification of their instrument than their target variable.

       Recent years have witnessed an upsurge of interest among monetary policy

analysts in the topic of simple and explicit rules for monetary policy. In this recent work

it is presumed that such rules would not be followed literally and slavishly by central

banks, but that they could be consulted for indicative purposes—perhaps by providing a

starting point for policy discussions. Tangible evidence of this interest is provided by

publications based on two 1998 conferences, both titled “Monetary Policy Rules,”

sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and by the Sveriges

Riksbank in collaboration with Stockholm University’s Institute for International

Economic Studies (IIES).1 Most of the work in these papers is based on some variant of

the now-famous Taylor rule, introduced in Taylor (1993), which specifies settings of a

nominal interest rate instrument in response to observed or predicted values of inflation

and the output gap (i.e., the percentage difference between output and its reference

value2).3 Some of the studies consider alternative instrument or target variables,4 and

very recently some criticisms of the Taylor rule have been expressed by Orphanides

(1998,1999), Meltzer (1999), and others. Accordingly, the purpose of the present paper

is to conduct counterfactual historical analysis of the type utilized by Stuart (1996) and

Taylor (1999b), and to compare and consider the messages provided by Taylor’s rule

with others featuring alternative instrument and/or target variables.

                                               1
       The type of historical analysis developed by Stuart (1996) and Taylor (1999b)

consists of contrasting actual settings of instrument variables during some historical time

span with the values that would have been specified by particular rules in response to

prevailing conditions. Discrepancies or agreements between rule-specified and actual

values can then be evaluated, in light of ex-post judgements concerning macroeconomic

performance during the span studied, to yield tentative conclusions concerning the merits

of the various rules. Of particular interest is whether major policy mistakes, judged ex-

post, would have been prevented by adherence to some of the candidate rules. Stuart

(1996) conducted such comparisons for Taylor’s rule and also one promoted by

McCallum (1987, 1993) that features a monetary base instrument and a nominal-income

growth target.5 The sample period utilized by Stuart was 1985.1-1996.2 for the United

Kingdom. In the present study experiences will be considered for the United States, the

United Kingdom, and Japan with the time span beginning in the early 1960s or (for

Japan) 1970s and extending through 1998.4. The investigation will also extend the range

of rules considered by combining interest rate and monetary base instruments with both

Taylor-type and nominal-income target variables.

       It should be said explicitly that no suggestion is intended to the effect that

historical analysis of the Stuart-Taylor type represents the only useful approach to policy-

rule evaluation. Most of the author’s own work, in fact, has involved simulations with

quantitative structural macroeconomic models (e.g., McCallum, 1988, 1993; McCallum

and Nelson, 1999a,b). The position advanced is merely that the Stuart-Taylor type of

study can also be useful, in addition to simulations with structural models. In this regard,

it is important to be clear about the nature of the exercise involved, i.e., to appreciate its

limitations and strengths—both of which are considerable. Accordingly, these will be

reviewed in Section 2, immediately following the paper’s first application of the Stuart-

Taylor procedure.

        The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 1 the alternative rules are

specified, notation is established, and some general issues are discussed. Applications to

the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan are then conducted in Sections 2-4.

Issues concerning the specification of target variables are taken up in Section 5 and issues

related to instrument variables in Section 6. A brief conclusion is presented in Section 7.



1. Specification of Rules

        The well-known Taylor rule can be expressed as follows:

(1)     Rt = r + ∆pat + 0.5(∆pat – π*) + 0.5 ~y t.

Here Rt is the short-term nominal interest rate that the central bank in question uses as its

instrument or “operating target,” i.e., the interest rate over which it exerts control at a

daily or weekly frequency. Next, r is the long-run average real rate of interest, ∆pat is an

average of recent inflation rates (or a forecast value) , and π* is the central bank’s target

inflation rate. Finally, ~y t is a measure of the output gap, the percentage difference

between actual and capacity output values. In Taylor’s original application (1993), the

values r = 2 and π* = 2 were specified, expressing the belief that 2 percent per annum is

an approximation to the long-run average real rate of interest in the United States, and

that 2 percent per annum is a reasonable specification for the Federal Reserve’s target



                                                3
inflation rate.6 Also, in Taylor (1993) the measure used for ∆pat is the average of GDP

deflator inflation rates over the past four quarters, while capacity output is represented by

a linear trend for the log of real GDP fit to quarterly observations for the years 1985-

1992. In Taylor (1999b), the Hodrick-Prescott (1997) filter is used instead to generate

residuals from “trend” that are taken to represent ~y t. The rule suggests, of course, that

monetary policy should be tightened (by an increase in Rt) when inflation exceeds its

target value and/or output exceeds capacity.

       Subsequent applications of the Taylor rule have modified or extended formula (1)

in several ways. Some have used proxies for expected future inflation in place of ∆pat

while others have done something similar for ~y t or used ~y t-1 instead. A common and

major change is to include Rt-1 on the right-hand side as a determinant of Rt; this

adjustment is intended to reflect the practice of interest rate smoothing, which is widely

believed to be prevalent in the behavior of many central banks.

       An important line of investigation has been pioneered by Orphanides (1997,

1999), who has attempted to base rule calculations on values of ∆pt (inflation) and ~y t that

were actually available to central bank policymakers at the time that historical instrument

settings were chosen. Orphanides (1997) recognizes that current-period values for ~y t

could not be known until after the end of period t,7 and also emphasizes the fact that

macroeconomic data is often substantially revised after its initial reporting. In

Orphanides (1999) it is argued that these problems are so severe that adherence to the


6
  It is not necessary that constants be used for these values, but they are in Taylor (1993)
and for additional postwar periods in Taylor (1999b).
7
  This type of operationality issue has been emphasized by McCallum and Nelson (1999a)
and McCallum (1999a).



                                               4
Taylor rule would not have prevented the inflation of the 1970s, as claimed by Taylor

(1999b). Partly for reasons to be mentioned in Section 5 and partly because of the

difficulty of doing otherwise, the present study will be based on data available in June

1999, not on real time data of the type recommended by Orphanides.

       The rule proposed by McCallum (1987, 1988, 1993) can be expressed as follows:

(2)    ∆bt = ∆x* – ∆vat + 0.5(∆x* − ∆xt-1).

Here ∆bt is the change in the log of the adjusted monetary base, i.e., the growth rate of

the base between periods t−1 and t. The term ∆x* is a target growth rate for nominal

GDP, ∆xt being the change in the log of nominal GDP. This target value ∆x* is specified

as π* + ∆y*, where ∆y* is the long-run average rate of growth of real GDP. The second

term on the right-hand side of (2), ∆vat, is the average growth of base velocity over the

previous 16 quarters, vt = xt − bt being the log of base velocity. This term is intended to

reflect long-lasting changes in the demand for the monetary base that occur because of

technological developments or regulatory changes (presumed to be permanent); it is not

intended to reflect cyclical conditions. These conditions are responded to by the final

term, which prescribes that base growth is adjusted upward (i.e., policy is loosened) when

∆xt-1 falls short of ∆x*. In McCallum (1988, 1993) values other than 0.5 are considered

for the coefficient attached to ∆x* − ∆xt-1 and variants of (2) that respond to discrepancies

of the level type, rather than the growth rate type, are investigated. Here, however, we

shall limit our attention to the particular formulation given in (2).

       A bit of discussion needs to be given to the topic of units of measurement. In

previous studies by McCallum, growth rate variables such as ∆xt have been measured as

changes in logs. Therefore such variables reflect quarterly changes, not annualized, and


                                               5
in fractional (rather than percentage) units. Accordingly, such variables need to be

multiplied by 400 to be commensurate with similar variables as measured by Taylor and

in most papers concerned with policy rules. Similar comments pertain as well to interest

rate measures. To maintain consistency among the different rules considered, we shall

here report all results in terms of annualized percentages, rather than in the quarterly

fractional units previously used in the work of McCallum.

        Another detail of rule specification concerns timing. In (2), both of the variables

on the right-hand side are based on variables realized in period t-1 or earlier; i.e., current-

period values are not utilized. The reason, as suggested in footnote 6, is to make the rule

specification realistically operational. In Taylor’s studies, the inflation variable ∆pat is

typically measured as referring only to previous-period values but it is assumed that ~y t

pertains to period t. Since it is rather clear that current-quarter values of real GDP cannot

be observed until well into the next quarter, in the present study ~y t will be measured as

the value of the output gap variable (however measured) pertaining to the previous

quarter.

        Clearly, the Taylor and McCallum rules differ in terms of both instrument and

target variables.8 There is no obvious reason, however, why these should be paired in

any particular combination. It would be quite natural, that is, to consider a rule with an

interest rate instrument and a nominal income growth target. Similarly, it would be

reasonable to consider a rule with a base growth instrument and a Taylor-style target

8
 Here I am using the term “target variable” to refer to a variable that the policy rule
responds to in a manner designed to reduce its deviations from some reference path.
Svensson (1999) objects to this usage, preferring to reserve the word “target” for




                                               6
specification. Accordingly, the investigation that follows will also consider, in addition

to (1) and (2), rules of the form

(3)    Rt = r + ∆pat − 0.5(∆x* − ∆xt-1)

and

(4)    ∆bt = ∆x* − ∆vat – 0.5ht,

where we define the “hybrid” target variable ht = (∆pat − π* + ~y t).9 Thus rule (4)

features responses to the same macroeconomic conditions as in Taylor’s rule (1) but with

a base instrument. Examination of the results involving (1)- (4) should then enable one to

determine whether differences in policy advice offered by (1) and (2) are due primarily to

their different instruments or targets.

2. United States

       We begin with the case of the United States. For xt, yt, and pt we use the

logarithms of nominal GDP, real (chain-linked) GDP, and their ratio. The monetary base

is the series computed by the St. Louis Fed, which incorporates adjustments for changes

in reserve requirements. In addition, an adjustment for sweep accounts has been made

for 1994-1998.10 Finally, Rt is the federal funds rate averaged over the quarter. All

variables except Rt are seasonally adjusted. The series are taken from the FRED data

base of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In what follows, ∆pat = 0.25(∆pt-1 + ∆pt-2

+ ∆pt-3 + ∆pt-4) while for ~y t we report the percentage excess ( in period t-1) of output


variables appearing in loss functions. For a brief discussion see McCallum and Nelson
(1999b).
9
  The term “hybrid” was used for this variable by Hall and Mankiw (1994).
10
   Specifically, 0.10 times the cumulative total of sweeps of transaction deposits into
MMDAs, reported by FRED, are added to the adjusted base series. Here 0.10 represents
the marginal reserve requirement ratio.



                                              7
over a “trend” reference value provided by the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, as in Taylor

(1999a). The effect of the latter choice will be discussed below, in Section 5.

       Figure 1 plots values of Rt implied by the Taylor rule (1) with π* = 2 and r = 2

together with actual values over 1960-1998.11 From an inspection of this figure, it can be

seen that the actual interest rate was lower than the rule-implied value throughout the

1970s, indicating that monetary policy was too loose, according to the rule. Beginning in

1981 policy was then too tight until 1987, the first year considered in Taylor’s original

study (1993). Over 1987-1995 policy was about right, according to the figure, but since

1996 has been somewhat too tight.

       As mentioned above, it is important to recognize the limitations and virtues of the

type of comparison provided by Figure 1. If in a particular period the actual value of Rt

was lower than the rule-specified value, then the rule’s indication is that policy was too

loose in that period, given the prevailing conditions. There is no suggestion that the

actual setting of Rt in that period was too low unconditionally. Indeed, the presumption

of Stuart (1996) and Taylor (1999b), which is adopted here, is that prevailing inflation

would have been lower during the 1970s if Taylor’s rule had been followed in practice.

So the Rt settings that would have been appropriate, according to rule (1), would have

been lower than those indicated by the solid line in Figure 1.12 Thus the solid line in

Figure 1 does not pretend to represent an optimal or even desirable path for Rt over the

period. But that does not prevent the comparison of the two lines from indicating that,

conditional upon prevailing conditions, actual Rt values were set lower than the rule

11
  Because our data base is for 1960.1-1998.4, rule-implied values begin with 1961.2
because of the lags needed to determine ∆pat.




                                             8
would have called for in virtually every period during the 1970s. From the standpoint of

rule (1), therefore, monetary policy was too loose during the 1970s. That is the only type

of conclusion provided by Figure 1, and other such plots presented below.

       Thus the principal weakness of this type of comparison is that it does not provide

an indication of what an “optimal” policy would have been or even of what time path

crucial variables would have followed under the rule being examined. But there is an

offsetting virtue. Any designation of optimality—indeed, any specification of how Rt or

other variables would have evolved historically under any specified policy rule—is

necessarily dependent upon the specific model of the economy used to predict how ∆pt

and ~y t would have responded to Rt settings. The Stuart-Taylor procedure, by contrast,

does not require adoption of any specific model. This is a highly significant virtue,

because there is no professional agreement concerning the proper specification of the

“correct” model of the economy.13

       We now return to the main line of analysis and move on to rule (2). For its

application, we take ∆x* = 5, combining a 2 percent inflation target with an assumed

long-run average output growth rate of 3 percent per year.14 The comparison of base

growth values implied by rule (2) with actual historical values is presented in Figure 2.15


12
   If ∆pat had been lower in each period, the Rt values prescribed by (1) would have been
lower.
13
   For an elaboration on this last point, see McCallum (1999, pp. 1490-1). As mentioned
in the introduction, the purpose of the present digression is not to object to counter-
factual simulation studies, based on specific models, but only to argue that different
procedures have different strengths and weaknesses.
14
   The value of 3 percent for output growth was used in McCallum (1987, 1988)—
together with an inflation target of 0 percent—and in subsequent studies. The actual
average over 1960-1998 was 2.97 percent.
15
   Rule values begin with 1964.2 because of the lags needed to calculate ∆vat.


                                             9
There it will be seen that policy was too loose—actual base growth was greater than

specified by the rule—during the second half of the 1960s and much too loose throughout

the 1970s. This discrepancy was gradually reduced between 1981 and 1987. Then policy

was slightly too loose during 1990-1992 and too tight during 1994-1995, according to the

rule. Since 1995 it has been about right, on average, although the final observation of

1998 suggests slightly excessive base growth at that date.

       Figure 3 gives results for rule (4), which combines the base instrument (as in (2))

with the hybrid target variable (as in (1)). Somewhat surprisingly, the broad overall

characterization of the results can be described with the same words used for the base

rule (2). The main difference is that the rule-indicated path of ∆bt has less quarter-to-

quarter variability than in Figure 2. The reason, evidently, is that (4) does not respond to

quarter-to-quarter movements in the growth rate of output (real GDP), which are quite

volatile. The basic message provided by the hybrid target variable is much the same as

that provided by nominal GDP growth because the HP filter yields quite small values for

the output gap, as will be illustrated below. Therefore, ht and ∆xt behave alike except for

the volatility introduced into the latter by the ∆yt component.

       Results with rule (3), featuring the interest rate instrument with a nominal GDP

growth target variable, are shown in Figure 4. Now the broad overall signals are much

like those of Figure 1, the Taylor rule, except with a more erratic path because of the

output growth component of the target variable. So the comparison among the four

figures suggests that the choice of an instrument variable matters more for the trend of

monetary policy than the choice of a target variable. It should be emphasized, however,

that this preliminary conclusion pertains only to the nominal GDP growth and hybrid



                                             10
variables, with the output gap component of the latter determined by the HP filter

method.



3. United Kingdom

       Before delving more deeply into the comparisons among the rules, let us now

look at the basic cases using data for the United Kingdom. Again xt, yt, and pt are

nominal GDP, real GDP, and their ratio. For the monetary base bt we use the Bank of

England’s M0 measure, seasonally adjusted, which requires no adjustments for reserve

requirements because the latter are small enough to be negligible.16 The interest rate

utilized is a one-month treasury-bill rate, averaged over the quarter. For the United

Kingdom, we use a value of 2.25 for r , 2 for π*, and 2.25 for ∆y*. Thus ∆x* = 4.25.

The output gap measure is the percentage departure of real GDP from trend, obtained

from the residuals from a regression of the log of real GDP on a linear trend fitted over

the years 1960-1998.

       Results using the Taylor rule (1) are shown in Figure 5. The indication there is

that monetary policy was much too loose during the 1970s, with the rule calling for an

interest rate of 38 percent in 1975.3, as compared with an actual value of 10.4.17 From

1983 through 1987 policy was slightly too tight, according to the rule, and since 1987 has

been just about right, except perhaps in 1994.




16
   Data for M0 are published by the Bank of England for 1969.3-1998.4. Earlier values
were obtained from Capie and Webber (1985) and spliced on.
17
   Of course if rule (1) had been followed throughout, actual inflation would probably
have been much less severe and the values of Rt indicated by the rule would have been
much lower.



                                             11
       The McCallum rule (2) gives a somewhat different story, as is shown in Figure 6.

It agrees that policy was much too loose during the 1970s, but suggests that it stayed too

loose most of the time until 1990 (when the U.K. entered the European Union’s exchange

rate mechanism in October, dropping out in September 1992). Since 1992, policy was

slightly loose, according to Figure 6, until 1997 when it became just about right. The

main difference in the messages of Figures 5 and 6 is that the latter suggests that policy

was too loose during the mid-1980s. Ex-post, this suggestion seems correct, as U. K.

inflation rose prior to 1990 to excessive heights—probably as a consequence of the

episode of “shadowing the D-mark” that occurred during 1986-1988.

       As in the case of the United States, the messages from rules (3) and (4) tend to

agree when the instrument used is the same, not the target variable. Thus in Figure 7 we

have base growth figures implied by rule (4), with the hybrid target variable, and the

policy messages are much the same as in Figure 6, but with less quarter-to-quarter

variability of the indicated ∆bt values. And in Figure 8, plotted for an interest instrument

and a ∆xt target, we find substantial agreement with the indications of Figure 5, which

pertains to the Taylor rule. Agreement is incomplete, however, since this rule does not

call for looser policy in the mid-1980s.



4. Japan

       In the case of Japan, our rules will be applied only to the period 1972.1-1998.4,

rather than a time span beginning in the early 1960s. The reasons are that Japanese data

for constructing a monetary base series does not exist for years prior to 1963; that Japan

kept a fixed exchange rate with the U. S. dollar prior to 1971; and that there was a



                                             12
marked break in the growth rate of Japanese real GDP around that time.18 For the

subsequent period we use r = 3, a higher value than for the United States or the United

Kingdom, because real output growth was higher in Japan. Nevertheless, for ∆x* we

adopt a value of 5, corresponding to an average long run real output growth rate of 3

percent and (again) a target inflation rate of π* = 2 percent. In measuring the output gap

~y we cannot use either the HP filter or a linear trend because output in 1998 was quite
  t


far below capacity, in the judgement of most observers. Instead, we have measured the

fractional gap over 1972.1-1992.2 as the residual from a regression of the log of real

GDP on a linear trend (fitted to 1972.1-1992.4 observations), and have assumed that

trend or capacity output grew at a rate of 2.5 percent per annum since 1992.2. This

procedure yields a gap that grows to a figure of 11.2 percent for 1998.4.

          The Bank of Japan now publishes four monthly data series on the monetary base,

beginning in 1970, with and without adjustments for seasonality and reserve requirement

changes. The monthly series with both adjustments was averaged to generate values for

1970.1-1998 and data from McCallum (1993) was spliced on to cover 1963.1-1969.4.

(Values prior to 1967.4 were not used in the study, however.) For Rt the overnight call

rate (uncollateralized) was used and official GDP statistics provided the basis for the

remaining variables.

          Application of Taylor’s rule (1) to Japan for 1972.1-1998.4 is depicted in Figure

9. There the indications are that policy should have been much tighter during 1973-1974

and somewhat tighter over 1975-1978. Since then, policy was slightly too tight most of

the time over 1982-1987, and then about right until 1994. Since then it has been too tight

     For these reasons McCallum (1993) begins its rule study with the quarter 1972.1.


                                              13
most of the time, but not in 1997. At the end of 1998, the call rate was almost 4

percentage points too high, the Taylor rule-indicated value being –3.6 percent. Of

course, the latter value is not feasible, but it indicates that the rule calls for much more

stimulative policy than actually prevailed in late 1998.

       This last message is also provided by the base rule (2), as shown in Figure 10, but

to an even greater extent. Indeed, this rule suggests that monetary policy has been too

tight most of the time since the middle of 1990. Like (1), it points to a too-loose stance

over 1972-1978. Interestingly, in light of the “asset-price bubble” of the late 1980s,

Figure 10 indicates that monetary policy was slightly too loose during 1986-1988.

       We now turn to rules (3) and (4). In the case of Japan, Figure 11 shows that the

latter again gives much the same signals as does the other rule with the ∆bt instrument,

rule (2). And again the hybrid target variable yields a smoother path for base growth than

does (2). As for the interest rate rule with a nominal GDP growth target, rule (3), the

Figure 12 results are more similar to those in Figure 9 than in Figure 10. The extent to

which rule (3) calls for added stimulus in recent years is even less than in Figure 9,

however. The rule does call for easier policy in the last half of 1998, but finds policy

about right during 1995-1997.

5. Issues Concerning Target Variables

       One of the main preliminary indications of the foregoing discussion is that rather

similar policy signals are provided by rules with ∆xt and ht target variables, provided that

the instrument variable is the same. This notion needs to be strongly qualified, however,

as will now be discussed. The main point is that the similarity of ∆xt and ht signals

observed in Sections 2-4 depends upon the use of output gap measures that do not yield



                                              14
large numerical magnitudes over the time span studied. In the case of the United States,

the measure used was based on residuals from the HP filter. The standard deviation of

these values over 1960-1998 is only 1.63, in percentage points. If instead the output gap

measure was based on residuals from a linear trend (for the log of real GDP), the standard

deviation would be 4.15 and the impact of the gap measure would be significantly

greater. In that case the Taylor rule vs. actual comparison, comparable to Figure 1,

would be as shown in Figure 13. Here the monetary policy message is not drastically

different from that of Figure 1 for the subperiod 1966-1990, although the need for tighter

policy during the 1970s would be more clearly indicated. But for the early 1960s and the

late 1990s the message would be quite different, with lower interest rates indicated by the

gap based on the log-linear detrending. According to the Figure 13 version of the Taylor

rule, the federal funds rate was too high by about 300 basis points throughout 1995-1998!

       It is the author’s belief that reliance of a policy rule upon any output gap measure

is risky, for different measures give quite different values and there is at present no

professional consensus on an appropriate measure—or even a concept. Linear detrending

depends rather sensitively on the time period selected for fitting of the trend, as is

illustrated in Figure 14 where gap measures based on log-linear trends fitted over 1960-

1998 and 1980-1998 are shown, together with values based on the HP filter. It might be

suggested that this problem could be alleviated by quadratic detrending, but quadratic

trends are themselves rather sensitive to the time period selected for fitting. The latter

claim is supported by Figure 15, which shows gap measures based on quadratic trends for

the log of real U.S. GDP fitted over the time periods 1960.1-1998.4 and 1980.1-1998.4.

As can be seen, these measures often differ by as much as 3 percentage points.




                                              15
       With respect to the HP filter, the problem is that this procedure produces a “trend”

that is so flexible that it follows the time path of actual GDP rather closely, thereby

yielding measures of the output gap that would appear to underestimate (in absolute

terms) the economically relevant gap values.19 To illustrate this point, Figure 16 shows

how the HP filter handles U.S. observations on real GDP during the 1920s and 1930s.

According to this figure, U.S. output had fully returned to “trend” by 1934 and the

incidence of above-trend output was approximately the same as below-trend output

during the 1930s, suggesting that the Great Depression actually did not occur!

       More fundamentally, McCallum and Nelson (1999a) argue that any gap measure

based on an output detrending procedure, which excludes the effects of current shocks

from the measured gap, is conceptually inappropriate. The point is that (e.g.) positive

technology shocks serve to increase the capacity or natural-rate value of output, not the

value of actual output relative to the latter; but many univariate detrending procedures

presume just the opposite. To overcome this difficulty, McCallum and Nelson (1999a)

propose a measure based on the assumption of a Cobb-Douglas production function and

utilizing values of manhours employed per member of the civilian workforce. This

measure treats technological change appropriately, at least arguably, but relies upon

debatable assumptions about labor supply and does not have a well-defined zero value.

       As mentioned above, the recent work of Orphanides (1997, 1999) has attracted

considerable attention. In the earlier of the cited papers, Orphanides constructed data

series for 1987-1992 reflecting values of macroeconomic variables that were actually


19
   The present discussion presumes adoption of the standard value of 1600 for the HP
filter’s smoothing coefficient in work with quarterly data.




                                              16
available at the time of FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) policy decisions in the

past. These series do not, accordingly, reflect data revisions and measurements that have

taken place after the FOMC meetings at which instrument settings (usually values of the

federal funds rate) were actually decided. In this context, the measurement of “potential”

or “natural-rate” output is especially problematical. This study indicated that the

magnitude of the informational problems were serious enough that “real-time policy

recommendations differ widely from those obtained with the revised published data

employed [by researchers] later on” (Orphanides, 1997, p. 3). The broad overall policy

messages offered by the Taylor rule for 1987-1992 are not overturned, however, by the

results of the 1997 study.

       The results in Orphanides (1999) are more drastic. In this later paper, the time

span studied goes back until 1966.1 and so includes the major inflationary buildup and

continuation that Taylor (1999b) refers to as “The Great Inflation.” Orphanides’s

dramatic conclusion is that adherence to Taylor’s rule throughout the period would not, in

constrast to Taylor’s (1999b, pp. 338-9) contention, have prevented the Great Inflation.

       Developing an appropriate evaluation of Orphanides’s (1999) analysis is not a

trivial undertaking. Certainly the data reconstruction represents a major contribution to

economic policy analysis, and Orphanides’s arguments are very carefully constructed and

exposited. In my judgement, they do not imply that simple monetary policy rules cannot

be useful when constrained by real-time data availability. Instead, I believe, the (1999)

study shows in a dramatic fashion that reliance on an inappropriate concept of potential

(or reference) output can be ruinous, i.e., can result in a monetary policy rule that is

counterproductive. But some rules do not rely upon such measures, as the examples of




                                              17
Sections 2-4 above illustrate.20 Also, the truly dramatic results in Orphanides (1999)

stem from a potential output concept revision, rather than a data revision. Thus, although

the data-revision problem is not of negligible significance, it is not as profound as a quick

reading of Orphanides (1999) might suggest. To the author, it seems satisfactory to

abstract from that problem for the purposes of the present study.

        Given the foregoing argument, and also the findings of Sections 2-4, a natural

step would be to investigate the performance of rules that use inflation as the target

variable, i.e., the cyclical variable responded to by the instrument. Accordingly, we now

present figures based on the two policy rules

(5)     Rt = r + ∆pat + 0.5(∆pat – π*)

(6)     ∆bt = ∆x* - ∆vat – 0.5(∆pat – π*),

which can be compared with (1) and (4). The results are shown in Figures 17-22. For the

United States, the interest rate rule in Figure 17 calls for Rt values quite close to those of

Figure 1. Also, the base growth rule in Figure 18 yields settings for ∆bt that are rather

close to those shown in Figure 3, in which the rule responds to the hybrid target variable.

Likewise, the plots in Figures 19 and 20 for the United Kingdom are rather similar to

those in Figures 5 and 7. In the case of Japan, however, the policy advice for recent years

provided by the inflation-target rule in Figure 21 is quite different than that in Figure 9.

In particular, in the absence of an output gap signal, rule (5) calls for Rt settings

somewhat higher than actual values during 1997 and 1998. The base rule (6) results in

20
  This conclusion is basically consistent with Orphanides’s warning against “activist”
policy rules, by which he means rules that place emphasis on measures of the level of an
output gap concept. Orphanides finds that a rule featuring “natural growth targeting,”




                                               18
Figure 22 remain more stimulative than the actual record for recent years, but to a lesser

extent than in Figure 11.

       One attractive aspect of the inflation target variable ∆pat relative to the nominal

income variable ∆xt-1 is that the former features smaller quarter-to-quarter movements

and therefore imparts a smoother, less choppy path to the instrument variables in (5) and

(6), in comparison to (2) and (3). One reason for this, certainly, is that ∆pat reflects four-

quarter averaging while ∆xt-1 does not. Accordingly, it should be of some interest to see

how the nominal income variable would perform if averaged over periods t-1 through t-4.

Results with that modification are presented in Figures 23-28. In these plots, it can be

seen that the choppiness of rules with a nominal GDP growth target is reduced

substantially, although the implied instrument settings remain slightly more variable than

with the inflation target. Are there any compensating advantages of the averaged ∆x

values relative to the averaged ∆p values? For the United States and the United

Kingdom, the policy advice seems to be basically the same in Figures 23-26 as in Figures

17-20. In the case of Japan, however, the nominal income targets in Figures 27-28 give

more stimulative signals than with inflation targeting (Figures 21-22), which seems

desirable. But the magnitude is not very large.



6. Issues Concerning Instrument Variables

       One of the more surprising aspects of the results in Sections 2-4 is that the policy

diagnoses provided by the various rules seem to be more dependent upon the instrument


which is rather similar to nominal income growth targeting as in rules (2) or (3) above, is
not strongly subject to the difficulties that he emphasizes.



                                              19
variable utilized than upon the choice of target variable. This indication seems

inconsistent with most analysts’ beliefs about monetary policy design. Reflection upon

the role and nature of the rules makes this finding understandable, however, in the

following manner. First, the way in which the rules are utilized in a study such as the

present one implies that the rule-specified instrument settings are actually being used as

magnitudes of indicator variables, not instruments. That is, one could view the resulting

values for quarterly settings of Rt or ∆bt as intermediate targets to be obtained by day-to-

day or week-to-week manipulation of other variables actually serving as the central

bank’s instrument.21 Second, the policy stance—i.e., degree of tightness or ease—

represented by rule-specified settings of Rt or ∆bt depends upon the magnitude of those

variables relative to some reference value that can vary from period to period. In the case

of the Taylor rule (1) the reference value is r + ∆pat, which serves to convert Rt

movements into movements in a real interest rate measured relative to r , since Rt –

( r + ∆pat) = (Rt − ∆pat) − r . With the McCallum rule (2), the reference value for ∆bt is

∆x* - ∆vat. In this case, ∆bt – (∆x* − ∆vat) reflects the difference between ∆bt and the

value of base growth that would yield an inflation rate of π* if output growth were equal

to its long-run average value and base velocity growth were equal to its average over the

past 16 quarters (a value that is implicitly being used as a forecast of the average over the

indefinite future).




21
  A study that proceeds in this fashion is McCallum (1995), which considers how the
U.S. federal funds rate could be manipulated on a week-to-week basis to hit quarterly
intermediate targets for monetary base growth with the latter set so as to keep nominal
income growth close to a specified target value.



                                             20
           In each case, in other words, there is a necessary reference variable that must be

specified to convert raw values of Rt or ∆bt into measures of monetary ease or tightness.22

Accordingly, the precise specification of these reference variables is of considerable

importance to a rule’s performance. If rules are to be relatively simple, it is necessary

that the specification of these reference values be simple—hence Taylor’s specification

of a constant “equilibrium” real rate of interest or McCallum’s constant “long-run growth

rate of output.” Evidently, however, the properties of any rule will depend critically upon

how these reference values are specified. Consequently, it would appear that future

research should perhaps devote more attention to this aspect of policy rule specification.

To date, most of the attention of researchers has instead been directed to the choice

among target variables, details of their specification, and the magnitude of coefficients

attached to them.




22
     This statement applies to all of the rules, of course, not just (1) and (2).



                                                  21
7. Conclusion

       Let us close with a brief summary of the findings developed above, based on

historical policy-rule studies for the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. The

basic results come from comparisons of actual values with rule specifications regarding

either interest-rate or monetary-base instrument settings, together with nominal GDP

growth or Taylor-style hybrid (inflation plus output gap) target variables. For the United

States, all of the rules considered would have called for tighter monetary policy during

the 1970s, although the base-instrument rules would have done so more strongly than

those with the Fed’s actual funds-rate instrument. There is some disagreement among the

rules concerning the 1980s and 1990s, although all of the candidate rules indicate that

policy has not been highly inappropriate since 1987, at least. For the United Kingdom,

the various rules agree regarding the excessive inflation of the 1970s, but the base-

instrument rules suggest that policy was too loose during the middle and late 1980s

whereas the interest-instrument rules do not. In the case of Japan, interest centers on the

record since 1990. Most of the examined rules indicate that policy was too tight in 1998,

but the base rules suggest excessive tightness for the entire period 1990-1998, while the

interest rate rules do not. All in all, the recommendations provided by the base rules

seem somewhat more appropriate from an ex-post perspective.

       Some of the study’s suggestions are methodological, rather than substantive. In

particular is it argued that reliance on output gap measures is risky, because various

measures of potential or natural-rate output levels differ widely and there is no

professional consensus regarding the most appropriate measure or even concept to be

used. Most univariate detrending procedures, which are frequently utilized, would seem




                                             22
to be fundamentally inappropriate, because they assign the effects of technology shocks

primarily to the gap between output and its reference value, rather than to the latter

variable itself. Omission of the output gap term from a rule with the hybrid target

converts it into an inflation targeting rule; it is shown that such rules give good advice in

most of the episodes. So, too, do nominal income growth rules that average recent

values.

          A somewhat surprising finding is that rules’ messages are evidently more

dependent upon the specification of their instrument than their target variable.23 This

finding can be understood as resulting from the necessity of specifying a reference value,

relative to which instrument settings are implicitly compared, in representing policy

tightness or ease. For rules to be sufficiently simple, these reference-value specifications

must themselves be simple, but different implicit assumptions about macroeconomic

behavior are accordingly built into the rule. The paper suggests, accordingly, that

investigation of these implicit assumptions could be an important topic for future research

concerned with alternative monetary policy rules.




23
     Provided that strong dependence upon an output gap measure is avoided.
