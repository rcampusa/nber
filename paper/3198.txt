       WAGES, PRICES, AND LABOR MARKETS BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR


                                     ABSTRACT
           Two opposing views of the antebellum economy are tested. One is
      that aggregate economic activity was severely diminished and that
      unemployment was substantial and prolonged during several downturns.
      The alternative interpretation is that antebellum fluctuations were more
      apparent than real; nominal wages, not labor quantities, did most of the
      adjusting. We analyze data on real wages for laborers, artisans, and clerks
      across four regions (Northeast, North Central, South Atlantic, and South
      Central) during 1821 to 1856. Various time-series econometric methods
      reveal that shocks to real wages persisted even five years after an
      innovation, but that their impact eventually vanished. The persistence of
      shocks was less for agricultural labor than for other occupations, less for
      growing regions than for more mature ones, less for unskilled than for
      skilled labor, and probably less before 1860 than after. Although nominal
      wages and prices never strayed far from each other over the long run, the
      persistence of shocks was considerable during the 1821 to 1856 period.
      We, therefore, find evidence to support the first view of the antebellum
      economy, although the degree of unemployment in cities and industrial
      towns remains unknown.
