Currency Hedging: Managing Cash Flow Exposure

                                          ABSTRACT

Foreign currency derivative markets are among the largest in the world, yet their role in emerging
markets is relatively understudied. We study firms' currency risk exposure and their hedging
choices by employing a unique dataset covering the universe of FX derivatives transactions in
Chile since 2005, together with firm-level information on sales, international trade, trade credits
and foreign currency debt. We uncover four novel facts: (i) natural hedging of currency risk is
limited, (ii) financial hedging is more likely to be used by larger firms and for larger amounts,
(iii) firms in international trade are more likely to use FX derivatives to hedge their gross --not
net-- cash currency risk, and (iv) firms are more likely to pay higher premiums for longer
maturity contracts. We then show that financial intermediaries can affect the forward exchange
rate market through a liquidity channel, by leveraging a regulatory negative supply shock that
reduced firms' use of FX derivatives and increased the forward premiums.

1       Introduction
The use of foreign currency in trade and finance is prevalent in emerging markets economies
(EMEs).1 Foreign currency dominance can be a prominent source of risk associated to currency
mismatches in cash flows and balance sheets rendering countries susceptible to changes in market
sentiment, sudden stops and currency crises. Foreign exchange derivative contracts allow firms
the possibility to hedge currency risk. Importantly, the FX derivative market--one of the largest
markets worldwide--has seen an impressive development over the last decades surpassing spot
transactions both in advanced and emerging economies (Figure A.1). Yet their growth in EMEs
has received less attention and little is known about firms' use of currency derivatives in these
economies. Which firms use FX derivatives? Do they fully hedge their currency risk? What
shapes these decisions? And, at a broader policy level, does the development of the FX derivatives
market affect firms' FX hedging decisions?
     In this paper, we build a unique dataset on FX derivatives, trade credit and foreign currency
borrowing in Chile to track firms' currency exposure and their hedging policies at monthly
frequency over 2005-2018. We employ this detailed data to uncover four novel facts about firm's
use of FX derivatives. First, we show that firms engaging in international trade and borrowing
in foreign currency are significantly exposed to the currency risk, as the use of "natural hedging"
is limited.2 Second, we document that the use of FX derivatives is primarily driven by larger
firms that are more likely to hedge larger amounts. Third, we show that, while hedging tends
to be partial, firms tend to hedge payables and receivable separately, instead of hedging their
net positions. Four, firms pay larger premiums for hedging transactions with longer maturities.
Finally, we use a policy reform that reduced the supply of U.S. dollars forwards to firms in
2012/13 and show that the liquidity of the FX derivatives market is a key determinant of firms'
hedging policies and the forward premium paid by firms.
     We study firms' use of foreign currency hedging instruments by employing a unique dataset
that merges information of foreign currency derivatives, foreign debt, international trade and
sales and employment information for the universe of firms in Chile between 2005 and 2018. In
particular, our data in foreign currency derivatives contains detailed transaction-level information
at a daily frequency on all forward, futures, options, and swap contracts traded over the counter
(OTC) in Chile over this period (i.e. ID for the contract, ID of firm, signing date, maturity date,
ID of counterpart, currency denomination, forward exchange rate, etc.). We merge these data
with foreign credit data which includes bond issuance, direct loans, and foreign direct investment
in and by local firms, all of which are denominated in US dollars. International trade data comes
from the Chilean Customs Agency and includes information on currency of invoice, delivery day

      Authors have emphasize different aspects of the foreign currency dominance in international trade, capital
markets, funding for banks and non-financial firms, reserve currency and implications related to original sin,
exchange rate regimes and fear of floating, and among others,(Eichengreen and Hausmann (1999); Calvo and
Reinhart (2002); C´ espedes et al. (2004); Goldberg and Tille (2016); Rey (2015); Gopinath (2015); Bruno and
Shin (2015) Ilzetzki et al. (2019).)

      We use the terms "natural hedging" and "operational exposure" interchangeably along the paper to refer to
whether firms match their payables and receivables in foreign currency.

                                                       2
and the trade credit received in each transaction at the firm-level. Importantly, our detailed
trade data allows to observe not only the level of firms' exports and imports but also their trade
credit and, thus, firms' actual exposure to the currency risk in these trade contracts.
    The richness of our panel data allows us to track all firms' receivables and payables in foreign
currency over time, as well as their use of FX derivatives. As such, we obtain a close character-
ization of firms' direct exposure to the exchange rate risk and whether they manage such risk
by using natural or financial hedges. Our analysis constitutes an advance over previous studies
in the literature that only focused on sub-samples of listed firms or surveys and--lacking infor-
mation on FX derivatives contracts, amount of foreign currency debt and trade credit--cannot
directly assess firms' cash flows exposure and the use of FX derivatives to hedge it.
    We start by uncovering four main facts regarding the use of FX derivatives. First, we show
that future claims and liabilities in foreign currency are only slightly correlated, suggesting
that firms do not match these cash flows in order to be "naturally hedged". For instance, the
correlation of exports and imports trade credit, is only 2%. This low correlation could arise
from significant differences in the maturity of exports and imports financing. Indeed, our data
indicates that the mean maturity of trade credit from exports is a 50% longer than that of imports
(197 vs 91 days).3 We also find that money market hedging ­that would allow export receivables
to be hedged using foreign currency debt­ would also be hard to implement in terms of financial
planning, as the mean maturity of foreign debt is about 3 years longer than the median maturity
of exports.
    Second, we document that firms employing FX derivatives are larger (in employment, sales,
debt, export and imports) and that exporters and/or importers relying on trade credit are more
likely to use FX derivatives. Our empirical results show that one percent increase in trade credit
due to exports leads to a 2.4% increase in the probability of employing FX derivatives, and trade
credit due to imports increases this probability by 5%. These results are robust to controlling
for firm fixed effects, year and industry fixed effects interacted, and excluding multinational
firms and the mining sector. Exploiting the transaction level information of our data, we show
that larger transactions (exposures) from trade credit are more likely to be hedged, which could
indicate that engaging in a FX derivative contract involves a fixed cost.
    Third, at the intensive margin, we document that firms tend not to hedge net trade credit
exposure with FX derivatives, but instead hedge their gross trade position exposures. Consis-
tently, the unconditional correlation between net trade credit and net FX derivatives position is
relatively low (40%), while the individual correlations between FX purchases and payables due to
imports, and between FX sales and receivables due to exports are twice higher and exceed 80%.
These results suggest that firms tend to buy USD forward when imports are financed through
trade credit and--perhaps more interestingly--sell USD forward when exports generate future
USD receivables. Our finding that firms use FX derivatives to separately hedge foreign currency

   3
     Our data also reports information on trade credit with financial institutions, which account for less than 15%
of total trade credit. This credit has typically longer maturities, but the difference in maturity between trade
credit for imports and exports remains. The mean trade credit for imports with banks is 120 days, whilst it is
259 days for exports.

                                                        3
claims and liabilities--instead of hedging a net position--is not surprising when considering that
the maturities of trade credits from exports and imports differ substantially.
    Fourth, we dig deeper and exploit the transaction-level information of our data. The trans-
action level analysis allows us to characterize as well the forward premium of forward contracts.
We document a positive (negative) premium for FX purchases (sales) which is increasing (de-
creasing) in maturity, reflecting the increasing spread a financial intermediary would obtain in
order to intermediate longer maturity FX derivatives contracts.
    In the last section of the paper, we exploit a quasi-natural experiment that reduced the
market supply of FX forwards and assess how this shock affected firms' hedging policies.4 In
particular, we employ a regulatory change to Pension Funds' (PFs) hedging requirements in
2012/2013 and document that it reduced the sales of FX forwards to banks, which in turn, also
reduced the supply of FX forwards to firms. We identify this supply shock by employing a
difference-in-different approach in which we saturate the regressions with firm-time and bank-
time fixed effects (as in Khwaja and Mian 2008, Amiti and Weinstein 2018 and Alfaro et al.
2021). Our econometric results indicate that banks more exposed to PFs reduced their supply of
FX derivatives to firms relatively more. As a result, importers and foreign currency debt holders
were most affected and decreased their outstanding long FX derivatives positions by 46% within
a year. In line with the reduction in the supply of FX derivatives to firms, we find that the
forward premium paid by firms purchasing FX derivatives forwards increased. At the extensive
margin, we find that the share of firms participating in the FX derivative market and their overall
hedging activity were reduced. A back of the envelope calculation indicates that the fall in the
flow of contracted FX derivatives--4 billion USD--was in magnitude equal to 75% of Chilean
imports.
    Our analysis of the effects of this regulatory change suggests that the liquidity of the FX
derivatives market can substantially affect firms' hedging policy and, as a result, their resilience
to exchange rate volatility. Hence, economies with less liquid FX derivatives markets offer firms
less ability to hedge their currency risk and, thus, are more exposed to exchange rate volatility
given the limitations of natural hedging.

   Related Literature.-- Our paper relates to the literature studying firms' hedging motives.
As shown by the pioneering works of Smith and Stulz (1985) and Froot et al. (1993), from a
theoretical perspective, hedging can add value to the firm due to the presence different types of
market imperfections, such as financial frictions, information asymmetries between management
and stockholders, transaction costs, management ownership of firms' shares, and convex tax
schedules.
   The empirical literature has focused on understanding the use of currency derivatives. A first
generation of papers relied on information of net positions of listed or multinational firms, or
survey data ­mostly­ for developed economies. Notably, Allayannis et al. (2001) use geographic
dispersion of U.S. multinationals (number of countries/regions of operation) and show that op-
   4
     Along the paper, we refer to non-financial firms simply as firms. In case we refer to financial firms --as
investment companies--we mention it explicitly.

erational hedging is limited. The literature also documents that the use of FX derivatives is
more prevalent in firms with exchange rate exposure (Korea, Bae et al. 2018; Euro countries,
Lyonnet et al. 2016; Germany, Kuzmina and Kuznetsova 2018; Brazil, Rossi-J´       unior 2012; Chile,
Miguel 2016; Colombia, Alfonso-Corredor 2018 and Mexico, Stein et al. 2021 among others). Our
detailed data allows us to take the analysis one step further by studying granular information
for the universe of firms and FX derivative contracts, and measuring more precisely variables
for which only proxies were available in previous studies. This detailed information allows us
to document that even firms with international trade and foreign currency debt exposure do
not fully exploit natural hedges and use financial derivatives to partially hedge gross positions.
Additionally, the use of a policy reform allows us to study the liquidity of the FX derivatives
market and, thus, how its development affects firm's hedging decisions.
    We document that firms that use FX derivatives are larger and hedging is partial, which points
in the direction of (but not restricted to) the existence of fixed costs to risk management. This
result echoes findings in international trade and finance costs (trade, Melitz, 2003; multinationals
(MNCs), Helpman et al., 2004; Alfaro and Chen, 2018; foreign borrowing, Salomao and Varela,
2021). Our findings are also consistent with Geczy et al. (1997) who use 372 Fortune-500 firms
with ex-ante foreign currency exposure to argue that there are economies of scale in implementing
and maintaining risk management programs, as firms who have used other type of derivatives
are more likely to later use FX-derivatives.
    Overall, our findings highlight that the timing of operational and financial milestones--the
signing of a contract, sale and delivery of a product or service, and payments--in the day-to-day
operation of a firm, is key to understanding its foreign currency risk exposure. This refers not
only to foreign currency cash-flows, but also domestic currency obligations. Longer deliveries
and transportation times in international transactions exacerbate these differences increasing
the need for working capital (Antr`   as and Foley, 2015). Moreover, important costs remain in
local currency (wages, taxes, others), and they matter for cash flow management. Thus, natural
hedging may still render firms vulnerable to currency fluctuations associated, for example, to
working capital obligations. Our results also suggest that firms turn foreign currency exposure
into local currency but keep their transactions in USD probably due to the use of the dollar as unit
of account and network effects. The misalignment in timing between payables and receivables
in foreign currency, and their interaction with domestic currency obligations, opens the need to
use financial hedges for gross transactions and underscores the importance of liquidity and the
FX derivatives markets.
    Finally, our findings relate as well to the literature exploring the role of financial interme-
diaries in shaping exchange rate markets. Notably, the role of financial intermediaries in crisis
periods has been recently put forward by Correa et al. (2020) who stress the role US Global
systemically important banks, Liao and Zhang (2020) who study institutional investors' hedging
choices and how they affect spot and forward exchange rates, and Du et al. (2018a) who point to
the effect of banking regulation on CIP deviations. By exploiting a regulation change to Pension
Funds hedging requirements which resulted in a supply shock to the short side of FX-derivatives
market, we show that firms hedging decisions were affected, and their exchange rate exposure

                                                 5
was temporarily increased.5
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the FX derivative market in Chile and
datasets. Section 3 presents the main stylized facts. Section 4 advances additional results related
to changes in regulation. The last section concludes.


2       Data
We use firm- and contract-level data from Chile between 2005 and 2018, which comprises census
data on: over-the-counter FX derivatives, foreign currency debt, international trade (cash and
trade credit on exports and imports), and employment. Our data comes from four different
datasets: FX derivatives, foreign debt, customs data and tax data. We are able to merge these
datasets due to the extended (and mandatory) use of the unique tax identifier number (Registro
 ´
Unico  Tributario, RUT) for all Chilean residents. Each of the datasets contain the following
information.

    1. FX Derivatives. We observe daily information from 1997 to 2018 on the census of FX
       derivative contracts with a Chilean resident on either side of it. To match the coverage
       of other data sets, we start the analysis in 2005. This information is reported directly to
       the Central Bank of Chile (CBC) by all entities who participate in the "Formal Exchange
       Market" (FEM, or "Mercado Cambiario Formal" in Spanish), namely, hedge funds, insur-
       ance companies, pension funds, the government and, more prominently, commercial banks.
       We observe the following characteristics for every contract: RUT of reporter (FEM entity
       ID), RUT of counter-party (another FEM entity or a real-sector corporation), an ID for
       the contract, signing date, maturity date, economic sector of both parties, currency, for-
       ward price, and settling type (deliverable/non-deliverable). Our focus in this paper is on
       contracts which have a non-financial sector firm on one side of the contract and contracts
       with maturity longer than seven days.6

    2. Debt. We observe foreign debt of Chilean residents, normally used to compute Balance of
       Payments statistics. In particular, we observe end-of-month stocks of loans, bond debt--
       currency denomination, maturity, interest rate, and coupon payments­and foreign direct
       investment between 2003-2018. Local currency debt is obtained from credit registry data.

    3. Customs data. We rely on data from the Chilean Customs Agency which gathers in-
       formation about the census of imports and exports for 1998-2018. In particular, for each
       international trade transaction we observe: date, RUT, country of origin for imports and
       industry for exports, 8-digit HS product code, currency of invoicing, value and quantity of
       import/export, and type of payment (cash or trade credit). The information on the type

    5
      In line with Avalos and Moreno (2013), we show that Pension Funds are large players who had an important
role in developing the currency derivatives market.
    6
      Contracts with maturity less than 7 days represent 1.4% of the original dataset, close to 56.000 observations.

                                                         6
        of payment is important to our analysis, as trade credit creates uncertainty by exposing
        firms to future exchange rate fluctuations, while trade paid in cash does not. Notably, we
        observe many aspects about trade credit: who is financing the credit and the maturity of
        operations.

   4. Firm-level activity: We use firm-level yearly information from the Chilean Tax Authority
      ("Servicio de Impuestos Internos", SII). In particular, RUT (used to link plants belonging
      to the same firm), sales (bracket), number of workers, address, economic activity and age.7

   Note.-- This figure shows in the left axis the outstanding volume (in billions of USD) of gross FX derivatives
positions of all non-financial firms in Chile (solid black line), and the volume of gross FX derivatives positions of
all non-multinational corporations (dashed gray line). The dotted line (read in the right axis) shows the number
of firms in a given month holding stocks of FX derivatives.


    The FX derivatives market in Chile has expanded rapidly over the last 15 years. As Figure
1 shows, the number of non-financial firms using FX derivatives has increased by more than
two-fold, and their gross FX derivatives position has increased by four-fold, from 8 to more
than 35 billion US dollars. Outstanding gross FX derivative positions reaches nowadays close to
45% of GDP. Panel A in Table 1 reports the market activity over the period 2005-2018 for the
whole market (columns 1-5) and for non-financial firms (columns 6-11). We have information
on roughly 1.9 million contracts, out of which 0.7 million contracts involve a non-financial firm
(columns 1 and 7). Forwards are firms' most traded FX-derivative, representing nearly 90% of
all contracts. Their median maturity is 88 days, with longer maturities for sales than purchases

(Panel B). Also, around 80% (60%) of all sales (purchases) are settled with no delivery. The
second most used derivatives are swaps (both cross-currency and FX swaps), which account for
around 8% (5%) of purchases (sales) by non-financial firms. In the rest of the paper, we focus
our analysis on non-financial firms, which for convenience, we hereafter simply refer to as firms..
    To better identify firms' currency exposure and hedging decisions, we focus on transactions
(trade, trade credit, foreign currency debt and FX derivatives) between U.S. dollars and Chilean
Pesos. This restriction is without loss of generality, as the U.S. dollar is the dominant foreign
currency in Chile and the majority of foreign currency transactions are with respect to this
currency (more 85%).8 We show in the Appendix (Tables A.1, A.3, and A.5) that our results
hold true when we consider all currencies in our analysis. The lion's share of outstanding positions
belongs to domestically-owned firm (more than 90%). Importantly, the use of FX derivatives is
spread across all economic activities. The sectors using FX derivatives the most are retail trade,
farming, electricity, water supply and gas, non-metallic manufacturing, financial intermediation,
mining and transport and communication, which together account for more than 90% of long and
short FX positions in 2016. In our main specification, we exclude MNCs for two reasons: MNCs
could use FX derivatives to hedge the value of dividends in foreign currency to hedge translation
exposure, and subsidiaries or headquarters abroad may undertake the financial hedging. To check
the validity of our results, along the paper, we undertake several robustness exercises with and
without MNC. Also, as mining sector accounts for an important share of Chilean exports, we
conduct robustness exercises with and without this sector.
    Beyond the granularity of the data, Chile offers a good case to study due to the stability of
its macroeconomic and institutional framework. As detailed in the next section, the derivatives
market is dominated by over-the-counter transactions (OTC) as in most developed economies;
see BIS(2016, 2019). Moreover, Chile has shown a combination of responsible fiscal policy, freely
floating exchange rate, and an inflation targeting regime implemented by an independent Central
Bank (Albagli et al., 2020) for almost three decades.9 Last by not the least, in recent years there
is no evidence of persistent covered interest parity (CIP) violations except for a brief period amid
the Global Financial Crisis (Morales and Vergara, 2017).




   8
      In particular, in 2016, 94% of long FX positions and 87% of short FX positions had as counterpart the U.S.
dollar. This was followed by the Euro with almost 5% and 6% long and short FX positions, respectively.
    9
      Chilean sovereign debt during our period of analysis is investment grade (A1 by Moody's, A by Fitch, and
A+ by S&P); the external debt represents around 60% of total GDP; the inflation targeting regime has been in
place for 30 years and on average has met the target; the floating exchange rate regime has been in place for
almost 20 years and exchange rate interventions have been exceptional; no capital controls are in place; and the
country exhibits strong financial regulation after the 1982 domestic financial crisis.

3       Firms' Use of FX Derivatives
This section unveils four novel facts about firms' use of FX derivatives. We first document that
firms involved in international trade and/or holding foreign currency debt are exposed to the
currency risk. We show that these firms are not "naturally hedged", as they do not match their
payables and receivables in foreign currency (Fact 1). We then explore firms' use of financial
hedging and show that firms using FX derivatives are larger and firms in trade tend to hedge
larger amounts (Fact 2). Next, we document that firms are likely to hedge gross positions--
payables and receivables separately--rather than net FX currency exposures (Fact 3). Lastly,
we show that the forward premium increases in the maturity of the transaction (Fact 4).

                                                                    9
FACT 1: Firms' use of natural hedging is limited

We start studying whether firms match their payables and receivables in foreign currency and/or
the cash flows related to these exposures. We then assess one potential reason that limits natural
hedging: differential maturity of payables and receivables in foreign currency.

    Cash-flows and outstanding exposures.-- We conduct two exercises to assess whether
firms match their payables and receivables in foreign currency and, thus, the extend they use
natural hedging. In our first exercise, we consider the cash-flows at maturity, and check whether
payables and receivables due in the same period of time (month) are correlated. This exercise
is a highly demanding test of natural hedging, because it checks whether a firm could be in fact
using inflows in foreign currency to pay outflows in foreign currency, regardless of when exposures
were originated. In our second exercise, we study the correlation between the outstanding value
of receivables and payables in foreign currency to check whether these balances are aligned--a
less stringent test.
    Notably, to identify the currency risk exposure from international trade, we focus on trade
credit rather than just imports and exports values, as measured typically by customs data. The
distinction between trade credit and trade -broadly defined- is critical for our analysis, as cash
flows instantaneously paid out do not entail currency risk. Instead, what entails currency risk is
the trade credit, which carries uncertainty about the future value of payables and receivables in
foreign currency.
    In our first exercise, we consider the the cash flows maturing in month m and check the
correlation between payables and receivables maturing in the same month,

maturing in month m, Mi,m is (log) cash outflows maturing-in-m, and F CDi,m          (log) is the cash
flow from maturing debt in month-m. We include firm-level fixed effects--i --that absorb all
firm and industry time-invariant characteristics, and industry and year fixed effects interacted--
j,y -- to control for industry-year specific shocks (such as demand shocks) that could affect firms
in different industries heterogeneously.10 We cluster the standard errors at the firm level. The
coefficient of interest is , which captures the extend to which the value of cash-flow payables and
receivables in foreign currency are aligned. A value of  equal to one would imply full natural
hedge, as all cash inflows and outflows in foreign currency would be fully correlated across time.
Instead,  equal to zero would imply no correlation and, thus, no room for natural hedge.
    Results are presented in Panel A of Table 2. Column 1 presents the results when only import
trade credit is included as a regressor. The estimated coefficient is statistically significant, but it

     In particular, we use the economic sector categories defined by SII, which divide the economy into 22 sectors

is quantitatively very small. In particular, a one percent increase in cash-flow from imports trade-
credit associates with only a 0.027% increase in cash-flow from exports trade credit. Column 2
excludes mining firms and shows that the coefficient remains statistically significant and similar
in size (0.023%). In column 3, we add foreign currency debt to import trade credit and, thus,
consider all foreign currency payables. Yet the estimated coefficient is still similar in size.
     To check that our result are robust and do not hide substantial heterogeneity across groups
of firms, we divide firms into four mutually excluding categories: (i) firms that trade (exports
and/or imports), do not hold foreign currency debt and do not employ FX derivatives; (ii) firms
that trade, use foreign FX derivatives and do not hold foreign debt; (iii) firms that trade and
hold foreign currency, but do not use FX derivatives; and (iv) firms that trade, hold foreign debt
and use foreign currency derivatives. We create dummy variables for each of these categories,
interact them with import trade credits and re-estimate equation (1) with these interactions on
the right hand side. Importantly, the estimated coefficients for these interaction terms remain
very small (columns 4-7) and are stable across specifications, namely when we include MNC
(column 4), include mining (column 5) and exclude both mining and MNC (column 6). Finally,
in column 7, we restrict our sample to firms that both export and import, and our results remain
unchanged. Overall, the results presented in Panel A provide little support to the hypothesis of
natural hedging, as a firm's cash flow value of payables and receivables in foreign currency are
only slightly correlated.
     In our second exercise, we consider the monthly correlation between the balance of outstand-
ing import trade credit and outstanding export trade credit. These less stringent regressions
simply correlate the value of a firm's outstanding accounts payable and receivable in foreign
currency, but they do not consider that these balances could imply different maturities and,
hence, a firm might not be--in fact--naturally hedged even if outstanding positions coincide. In
particular, we re-estimate equation (1) by regressing the outstanding export trade credit, (X T C )
on the outstanding from import trade credit and debt, (M T C + F CD).
     Panel B of Table 2 presents the results. Column 1 presents a simple correlation between
a firms' trade credit for export and imports. The estimated coefficient remains statistically
significant but, as above, is quantitatively very small. In particular, a one percent increase in
imports trade-credit associates with only a 0.023% increase in exports trade credit. Column
2 excludes mining firms and column 3 adds foreign currency debt to import trade credit. In
both cases, the coefficient remains statistically significant, but quantitatively very small (0.023
and 0.028, respectively). Columns 4-7 show that this pattern does not change when considering
heterogeneous groups of firms. In the Appendix, we present additional robustness and show that
these results remain valid when including FX swaps and other currencies than the dollar (Table
A.1) and considering quarterly data (Table A.2).
     In sum, the results presented in Table 2 provide little support to the hypothesis of natural
hedging. Firms in our sample do not seem to be using cash inflows and outflows in foreign
currency to operationally hedge the currency risk. Instead, these firms seem to be exposed
to the currency risk, which in turn, creates room to use financial hedging. Next, we assess a
potential reason that would explain limited natural hedging.

   Maturity and the timing of flows.-- We assess a potential explanation for limited nat-
ural hedging: different maturity of inflows and outflows in foreign currency. In particular, if
payables and receivables in foreign currency have significantly different maturities, it could be


                                                         12
difficult--from a risk management point of view--to align these flows. It is worth remarking that
this section does not aim to provide one conclusive explanation of why firms do not significantly
engage in natural hedging, which would require additional (and currently unavailable) informa-
tion. Instead, we document some novel patterns that could explain the limits to natural hedging
reported above.
     We start by documenting main descriptive statistics for imports/exports trade credit and
foreign borrowing. As Table 3 shows, trade credit from imports is paid on average in 91 days,
while exports take 137 days. Foreign debt exhibits even longer maturities, with an average of
3.7 years. The different maturity between trade credit from imports and exports and foreign
currency debt suggests that it would be difficult for firms to carry out operational hedging. This
type of hedging would imply significant managerial skills and planning to match the maturities
of multiple contracts.11

     Note.-- Only considers operations in international credit which are labeled as being financed either by
  counterparty in the international trade transaction or a banking or financial institution. Statistics are ex-
  pressed in days. Last column shows number of observations used throughout the 2005-2018 period.

    To explore this idea further, we focus on trade flows and examine the extent in which cash
flows of accounts payable/receivable coincide at maturity, regardless of contracting dates. More
precisely, consider equation (2) which captures the coincidence between cash inflows and outflows
from maturing trade-credit for each firm in a given month. In particular, for firm i and month
m, COi,m measures the coincident amount of cash flows (hence, the min operator) in opposing
directions that mature in m as a fraction of total cash flows maturing in the same period. The
statistic--multiplied by two to be bounded between 0 and 1--is defined by:
                                                         CF     CF
                                                  min{Xi,m  , Mi,m
                                      COi,m   =2×    CF        CF
                                                                   ,                                           (2)
                                                    Xi,m + Mi,m
         CF                                                                                CF
where Xi,m  denotes the cash inflow maturing in month m from past export trade credit and Mi,m
the cash outflow maturing in m from past import trade credit for firm i. The lower the value
of this indicator, the lower is the coincidence between trade credit from exports and imports
  11
     Notably, these different maturities make it unlikely for firms to engage in "money market hedge", which
refers to an operation where a firm matches its receivables (payables) in foreign currency by borrowing (lending)
in the same currency and maturity. For example, an exporter could borrow in foreign currency to hedge the
currency risk implied in the future receivables. If the currency appreciates, she would receive lower income, but
she would also have a lower debt repayment in foreign currency.

                                                       13
and, thus, lower is the realized natural hedge of the firm. Inversely, the higher COi,m is, the
higher the level of natural hedge.12 Figure 2 plots the mean, median and interquartile range of
COi,m in the cross-section of firms for each month in the sample. The median coincidence is
about 20%, and the percentiles 25 and 75 are close to 7% and 50%. This low coincidence ratio
for the majority of firms in our sample suggests that Chilean firms do not match their trade
receivables and payables cash flows. Instead, natural hedging seems to be limited and, thus,
firms are exposed to the currency risk.

FACT 2. Larger firms hedge; and tend to hedge larger amounts.

Last section showed that the use of natural hedging is limited and hence, firms retain currency
risk. In this section, we explore which firms employ FX derivatives to hedge this risk and which
transactions they are more likely to hedge.

    Larger firms hedge.-- We start assessing the characteristics of firms using FX derivatives.
As shown in Panel A of Table 4, these firms are larger in size (employment and sales) and this
difference is statistically significant and persistent over time (i.e. we observe a similar pattern
in 2006 and 2016). Firms using FX derivatives typically engage in international trade and/or
hold foreign debt. This is shown in Panel A of Figure A.4 in the Appendix, where we plot
the number of firms using FX derivatives by group of mutually exclusive firms (i.e. firms using

  12
     For example: if a firm has $100 cash inflow and $100 cash outflow due in period m, COi,m takes the value
of 1. If instead, the firm has a maturing $100 cash-inflow and $0 cash outflow, then our measure of coincidence
takes the value of zero.

                                                                                              14
FX derivatives and engaging in trade, firms using FX derivatives and holding FC debt, firms
using FX derivatives and engaging in trade and holding FC debt, and firms using FX derivatives
with no trade or FC debt activity). Panel B confirms this pattern by plotting the value of the
FX outstanding position.13 We document similar differences in size across different samples by
firms' type: when restricting the comparison to firms that do not participate in international
trade (Panel B), when considering trading activity (Panel C) and foreign debt (Panel D) as
proxies of firm size. In all cases, firms using FX derivatives are larger.14

   Firms in international trade tend to hedge larger amounts.-- The richness of our
data allows us to explore further the transactions that firms hedge. In particular, we study
whether firms are more likely to hedge large or small transactions. To this end, we match by
  13
      The correlations between number of firms using FX derivatives and gross derivative positions and the ex-
change rate are -0.15 and 0.44, respectively.
   14
      Our results echo existing literature showing that firms engaging in international trade are larger (Melitz
2003; Bernard et al. 2007; Helpman et al. 2004; Alfaro and Chen 2018). Similarly, Salomao and Varela (2021)
show that there is selection into foreign currency borrowing, as only high productivity firms employ this financing.

                                                          15
maturity and size, trade credit transactions with FX derivatives transactions, and assess their
characteristics. It is worth mentioning that this matching process is not perfect as we do not
observe whether a firm obtains a FX derivative to hedge a particular transaction. While we
do observe all FX derivatives transactions and trade credit exposure, all we know is a firm's
trade credit and its FX derivatives, but we do not know whether a FX derivative contract x
was purchased to hedge trade credit exposure y . Hence, we rely on a matching procedure which
we conduct, for comparability issues, on the sub-sample of firms with no foreign debt.15 In
particular, we match FX contracts with trade credit data using the information on (a) firm ID,
(b) maturity dates of both operations, and (c) notional amount. We use the Coarsened Exact
Matching (CEM) algorithm by Iacus et al. (2012). For a given firm ID, the CEM algorithm
exact-matches maturity dates and creates temporary coarser bins in the dominion of notional
amounts. Then, it implements exact matching in these coarser bins. Once the match is created,
then keeps the original un-coarsened amount.
   Figure 3 shows the histograms for imports and exports trade credit operations. The horizontal
axis shows the (log) trade credit value of each international trade operation, divided in two groups:
those that are found to have a matching hedging transaction (green bars), and those that are
found not to (red bars). We show imports trade credit operations in the left panel and exports
trade credit in the right panel. The figure indicates that, conditional on not finding a matching
FX-derivatives transaction (red bars), smaller international trade transactions are more likely
to be observed. Put it differently, this figure suggests that imports and exports trade credit of
smaller values are less likely to be hedged than larger value transactions.16
   Finally, we test formally whether larger amounts of trade credit correlate with the use the
matched hedging transactions. We estimate equation (3) at the contract-c level, in which we
regress the amount of the (log) transaction value in international trade on the binary variable

ones (complete sample period 2005-2018). Similarly, Panel B indicates that hedged trade credit

      We exclude firms with foreign debt from this exercise for two main reasons. First, because debt contracts
are usually large-amount and long-term operations, it is difficult to match one or several FX derivatives to one
operation. (We discuss foreign currency debt and swap contracts in the next section.) Second, firms with access
to foreign capital markets might also hold assets denominated in foreign currency and, therefore, may not be
hedging currency exposure through derivatives. Since we do not observe firms' assets denominated in foreign
currency, we opt not to use information from these firms. Hence, by choosing a sub-sample of more homogeneous
firms, we aim to be more conservative in our findings.
   16
      Further, if we compare the notional value of FX derivatives contracts grouped by whether our matching
method finds a matching international trade transaction, there is no statistical difference in size between FX
derivatives with and without a matching trade exposure. This fact suggests that our method is not mechanically
leaving out smaller or larger transactions. The corresponding figure can be found in Figure A.6 in the Appendix.

FACT 3. Firms' use of FX derivatives is related, at the extensive margin, to international trade
and, at the intensive margin, to gross--rather than net--exposures.

In this section, we characterize firms' use of FX derivatives at the extensive and intensive mar-
gins. At the extensive margin, we show that firms in international trade are more likely to employ
FX derivatives. At the intensive margin, we show that firms using FX derivatives hedge gross--
rather than net--currency risk exposures, which is consistent with the limited use of natural
hedging.


   The extensive margin.-- We start by studying the decision of a firm to use FX derivatives
by using nested versions of the following linear probability model:

age points (column 2). Column 3 shows only a marginal correlation (and of the opposite sign)
between foreign debt and the probability of using FX derivatives.17 In column 4, we include
all three variables--export and import trade credits and foreign currency debt--and show that
the estimated coefficients for trade remain statistically significant and similar in size. Finally,
in columns 5 and 6, we control for exports, imports and foreign currency debt interacted, and
show that the estimated coefficients for trade credit remain similar to our previous estimates.
In the main specifications we exclude multinational and mining corporations, yet all results are
robust to this decision and across time sub-samples as seen in columns (6) and (7). Our main
specification focuses on dollar denominated FX forwards, which represent the lions' share of all
FX derivatives, but the results hold after including swap contract and different currencies (see
Table A.3 in the Appendix).

   The intensive margin.-- We now turn to examine the intensive margin of firms' use of
FX hedging. We first study whether the outstanding balance of firms' FX derivatives positively
correlates with their foreign-currency receivables and payables. In particular, we compute the
  17
     The small correlation between foreign debt and the probability of using FX derivatives remains true even
after separating outstanding stocks of debt according to their maturity. In most cases, the correlation becomes
statistically non-significant.

end-of-month position (short and long) of FX derivatives (in logs), F Xm             , and re-estimate
equation (4) using this measure as dependant variable. Panel A of Table 7 reports the results
for sales (short positions) and Panel B the results for purchases (long positions).
    Panel A shows that sales of FX derivatives positively correlate with holding trade credit
from exports (columns 1 and 4). Interestingly, the covariate imports trade credit is also positive
and statistically significant (columns 2 and 4). Yet this positive correlation is driven by firms
that both import and export. To see this, we further split the sample between imports by
exporters, and imports by non-exporters, and re-estimate our regression. Column 5 shows that
the coefficient for imports is only statistically significant for imports by exporters. The estimated
coefficient for export trade credit, once all controls are included in the analysis (column 7),
indicates that a one percent increase export trade credit associates with a 0.046% increase in
sales of FX derivatives. Note that foreign debt is not correlated with sales of FX derivatives in
none of the specifications.
    In Panel B, we present the results for purchases of FX derivatives. As expected, trade
credit from imports is strongly related to buying dollars forward. The estimated coefficient
implies that a one percent increase in imports correlates with a 0.15% increase in purchases of
FX derivatives in the same month. Interestingly, the coefficient of foreign currency debt is non-
statistically significant, suggesting that firms borrowing in foreign currency tend--on average--to
not purchase FX derivatives to hedge their FC debt levels. This result holds true for all debt
maturities (see Table A.4 in Appendix)
    These regressions indicate that firms' FX derivative gross position (short or long) are asso-
ciated with their gross exposure in foreign currency stemming from international trade credit.
That is, importers hold long positions in FX derivatives (they "buy the forward dollar"), while
exporters hold short positions in FX derivatives ("they sell the forward dollar"). The evidence
presented in Tables 6 and 7 are robust to the inclusion/exclusion of multinational corporations,
firms related to the mining sector as seen in columns (6) and (7), and including FX-swaps and
currencies different from the US dollar (see Table A.5 in Appendix).18

   Aggregate trade credit and FX derivatives.-- The results in Table 7 suggest that the
gross balances of imports and exports trade credit correlate with gross FX derivatives positions
at the firm level. We now assess whether this correlation of gross positions is present at the
aggregate level. With this end, we aggregate all export trade credit, all import trade credit
and compare them with the FX derivatives short and long positions. Figure 4 presents these
correlations. The correlation between exports trade credit and short FX positions--presented in
Panel A--is high and reaches 0.79. Similarly, the correlation between imports trade credit and
long FX positions--presented in Panel B--reaches 0.82. For comparison, in Panel C, we plot
the correlation of net trade credit with net FX derivatives position. Interesting, the correlation
using net exposures is much lower than the gross correlations and only reaches 0.48. Lastly, we

  18
     Table A.6 in the Appendix shows that higher cash flow coincidence correlates with lower use of FX derivatives
at the extensive margin and lower FX purchases. More complex firms (proxied by the number of exporting
countries) are more likely to use FX derivatives and sell their foreign currency receivables forward.

conduct an additional test and assess these correlations from an ex-post perspective. That is, we
consider cash flows at maturity date of FX contracts and obligations from derivatives positions,
the same conclusion holds. Notably, the correlation between imports trade credit maturing in
month m and FX long derivatives maturing in period m remains high at 0.9, and the correlation
between exports trade credit maturing in m and FX short derivatives maturing in the same
period is close to 0.8.

and FX purchases (Panel B.), and net trade credit and (negative) net FX position (short minus long positions,
Panel C.). Expressed in millions of dollars. Sample used in this figure excludes firms with foreign debt, to avoid
biasing upwards the estimation of the use of FX derivatives. Correlations between series are 0.79 for exports,

mining companies. Inclusion of these firms does does not affect the results and can be seen in Figure A.5 in the

FACT 4. FX derivatives contracts are priced differently according to maturity.

Focusing our analysis at the transaction level, we now explore patterns in the contracted forward
exchange rates in each FX derivatives contract. Denote by Fc,d,N the agreed forward exchange
rate in an FX contract c, signed in day d and which matures in N days. Then, Fc,d,N contains
both, the expected currency depreciation and any premium. Also, denote by F XPc,d,N the
forward premium in contract c, day d for maturity N , which can defined either for sales or
purchases operations (see Shapiro 1996). Both the spot (Sd ) and the forward exchange rates are
defined in pesos per US dollar.19

    19
      The lion's share of the FX derivatives contracts in our data are OTC instruments, which opens the possibility
for different spreads and for financial intermediaries to potentially price discriminate across customers. Typically,
a bank sells dollars forward at a higher exchange rate than what it pays to buy them at the same maturity; this
is referred to as the Bid-Ask spread (Bekaert and Hodrick, 2017).

                                                                                                                      22

    Figure 5 plots F XPc,d,N for purchases (blue) and sales (red) for years 2006 (panel A) and
2016 (panel B), against maturity (in days) N in the horizontal axis. The forward premium for
sales of foreign currency is downward slopping and decreases significantly with maturity. This
downward slope implies a discount that increases in maturity for selling foreign currency forward
and, hence, exporters benefit more from selling their receivables in the short term than in the
long term. Inversely, the forward premium for purchases is upward sloping and the premium
increases with the maturity of the contract. Importers then pay a higher premium (per day)
when they buy dollars at longer maturities.

where A is the notional (log) amount of purchases/sales of FX derivatives contracts with maturity
N (in log of days), settled with D = delivery/compensation (1/0), for contract c, signed by firm i,
with counter-party bank b in day d, and Xi,y are firms' sales. We include in the regression bank-
month fixed effects (b,m ) to control for bank-idiosyncratic expectation exchange rate changes.
As above, we include firm and month fixed effects and cluster the standard errors at the firm


                                                                       23

bank and month.

                   Note.­ Dependent variable defined as in equation (5) and specifications
                are based on equation (6). Notional amount is defined as the (log) of the
                amount hedged in a given contract. Maturity is calculated as days from sign-
                ing of the contract to its maturity (Nc,i,b,d ). Standard errors clustered at
                the firm level in parentheses. Statistical significance: * p <0.1, ** p <0.05,
                *** p <0.01


    Table 8 presents the results. Columns 1 and 2 show firms' purchases of FX derivatives.
Column 1 shows that maturity positively and significantly correlates with the forward premium,
which implies that larger maturities are associated with a higher (per day) average forward
premium. Importantly, this correlation persists even after controlling for time varying trends
­such as month and bank-month FE interacted that control for trends in the exchange rate­, the
notional amount of the derivative and the delivery type instrument (column 2). Interestingly,
larger firms--measured by firms' sales volume--pay on average lower forward premium. Columns
3 and 4 show that the forward premium negatively correlates with FX sales. That is, when a
firm wants to sell dollars forward, it gets a lower average daily premium the longer the maturity
of the instrument. These results suggest that the financial intermediary is charging a higher bid-
ask spread for transactions farther in the future, both for sales and purchases of FX derivatives.
Interestingly, the contract notional amount does not seem to have a robust influence on the
forward premium charged neither for purchases nor for sales.
    In the next section, we study whether the level of development and liquidity of the foreign
exchange rate market can affect firms' hedging decisions. In particular, we exploit a regulatory
change to Pension Funds Managers (PFs)--which resulted in a temporary halt in their selling of
FX derivatives in 2012/2013--to assess whether a negative supply shock affects firms' hedging

choices. Finally, we revisit the potentially affected stylized facts in this section and document
their sensibility to the shock.



4                                                 A Market-Level Supply Shock
In 2012, the Chilean Pensions Supervisor Authority (Superintendencia de Fondos de Pensiones)
relaxed the regulation on FX hedging of investments abroad by Pension Funds (PFs). This
regulatory change had a large impact on the FX derivatives markets as PFs substantially de-
creased their sales of FX derivatives. These lower sales translated into a significant decrease in
the supply of FX derivatives from banks towards firms. In this section, we analyze how banks
transmitted this temporary liquidity shock and how it affected firms' hedging patterns. We start
by presenting the regulatory change in the FX derivative markets and next describe the empirical
strategy to identify the impact of the shock on firms' hedging decisions and prices in the forward
market.20

    In the Appendix, we develop the sketch of a model that rationalizes the findings of this section and shows
how the liquidity of the FX derivative market affects firms' FX derivatives decisions.

4.1     The Regulatory Change of the FX Derivative Markets
Pension funds are the backbone of the funded pension system in Chile. All non-military formal
workers save a mandatory 10% of their wages to finance their retirement income. They are the
largest holders of gross positions of FX derivatives. By the end of 2018, they held 41.3 billions of
U.S dollars in FX-derivatives, which is equivalent to 30% of the commercial banking credit and
15% of GDP (Panel A in Figure 6). Importantly, they are the agents with the largest net short
FX derivatives position and, at times, the only net suppliers of U.S. dollars in the forward market
(Panel B in Figure 6). As such, they are the natural counter-party of the corporate sector, which
in net holds long positions. The supply of PFs' net short position is intermediated to firms via
commercial banks through OTC FX derivatives.
    Regulation dictates an upper limit, for each Fund, to the share of portfolio invested abroad
that is not hedged. In May 2012, the Pension Supervisor consulted the Central Bank of Chile
on their view of new limits for un-hedged portfolio invested abroad. After favorable assessment,
on June of the same year, the regulator determined that starting on December 1st 2012, PFs
would be allowed to increase their share of non-hedged portfolios from 15%-50% (depending on
the investment Fund) to a general 50% (see Table A.7 in the Appendix).21 In practical terms,
this change in regulation implied that PFs were holding larger short position in FX derivatives
than required by the new regulation.
    This regulatory change translated into a temporary negative supply shock to the FX deriva-
tives market. Upon the reform, PFs reduced their sales of FX derivatives and, thus, lowered the
availability of FX forwards. Lower supply of FX derivatives affected firms seeking to take long
FX positions (e.g. importers and foreign currency borrowers), as banks--who are the most com-
mon intermediaries--refrain from holding currency risk and passed this negative liquidity shock
onto firms. The change in supply from PFs was important to the market, as shown in Figure 7.
PFs' sales of FX derivatives to individual banks is depicted in gray lines. The blue line shows the
total sales of FX derivatives of PFs to the banking system. In line with the announcement of the
regulatory change (May 2012), the sales of FX derivatives by PFs started decreasing and saw its
largest drop at the moment of the implementation of the regulatory change in December 2012.
The drop between the moment before the first announcement, to six months after the regulation
took place, was more than five billion USD.
    In the rest of this section, we examine how this supply shock to banks translated into a supply
shock to firms, and how it affected their hedging decisions.

erations    in      foreign  currency    derivatives   and     currency      risk   hedging,      available  at
https://www.spensiones.cl/portal/institucional/594/w3-article-8717.html.                     Additionally, the
change in regulation incorporated the notion of hedging the currency of the underlying asset which generates
currency risk. Before it, assets denominated in foreign currencies different than the US dollar were hedged in
the accounting currency of the portfolio which included them, usually the US dollar. Appendix A.8 presents
additional details.

4.2     Identification Strategy
In this section, we present the identification strategy and discuss possible concerns regarding
the empirical analysis, such as identification of the supply shock, exogeneity of the regulatory
change and heterogeneous effects across banks. It is worth noting that, because the reform
reduced the supply of FX derivatives in the market, we focus our analysis to firms' purchases of
FX derivatives.
    The identification strategy of the effect of changes in market conditions on firms currency
risk management is based on the 2012 change in regulation for PF's. To better identify the effect
of the shock, we restrict our analysis to the six months before and after the regulatory change.
Furthermore, since the reform was announced in May 2012 and PFs could have anticipated it,
and started reducing their supply of FX derivatives before the implementation in December 2012
(as suggested in Figure 7), we define the "before" period as the six months earlier, from December
2011 to May 2012. We define the "after" period from December 2012 to May 2013. That is, we
intentionally leave the months from June 2012 to November 2012 out of the analysis, as these
months could be considered partially treated due to the anticipation to the reform by some PFs.
This characterization has the additional advantage that it compares the same months (December
to May) and deals with seasonality that could arise from firms' operating in different economic


                                                                                                           27
activities. We refer to this analysis as the "six-month window". To test that our results are not
driven by the length of the window, we conduct robustness tests with a "four-month window",
which covers December 2001- March 2012 and December 2012-March 2013 for the before and
after periods.
    An important concern of the empirical analysis is that a decrease in firms' demand for FX
derivatives, rather than a negative supply shock, could arise from changes in firms' hedging
policies. Because in Chile FX derivatives are mostly transacted through OTC market with
the banking sector, we can follow Khwaja and Mian (2008), Amiti and Weinstein (2018) and
Alfaro et al. (2021) and exploit firms' multi-bank relationship to control for firms' demand of
FX derivatives.22 In particular, we keep firms that have hedging activities with more than
two banks and include in our regressions firm-time fixed effects. This allows us to control for
firms' time-varying demand of hedging instruments and capture only the supply shock due to
the regulatory change on pension funds. Furthermore, this identification strategy allows us
to recover the decrease in the supply of FX derivatives of each individual bank and, hence,
observe the heterogeneous impact of the regulatory shock across banks. As additional test, we
check (and confirm) that the estimated coefficients for banks correlate with their pre-reform
exposure to pension funds. More precisely, we show that banks that used to purchase more
FX derivatives from PFs before the shock--and, hence, were more exposed to the regulatory
change--experienced a larger decrease in the sales of FX derivatives to firms after the regulation.
    The analyzed change in regulation was arguably exogenous to firms' individual hedging de-
cisions. The general context around the regulatory change, and its timing make it unlikely that
firms hedging decisions were endogenous to the policy change by the Pension Funds Supervisor.
Furthermore, as mentioned above, we focus our analysis in the period before the announcement
of the policy, so we can avoid any anticipation effect from firms and, hence, simultaneity bias.


4.3     Empirical Results
In this section, we study whether the decrease in the supply of FX derivatives issued by PFs
affected firms' hedging activity by conducting four econometric exercises. First, we estimate a
standard difference-in-difference model where we estimate the average response of firms across
all banks. Second, we saturate our regressions with time-varying firm and bank fixed effects
to control for changes in firms' hedging demand and capture banks' individual changes in the
supply of FX derivatives to firms. Additionally, we assess whether these changes associate with
changes in the forward premium and, hence, the price of FX derivatives. Third, we conduct a
back-of-the-envelope calculation to assess the aggregate impact of the regulatory change on firms'
hedging policies. Four, we study whether the supply shock affected firms' hedging decisions at
the intensive and extensive margins.

  22
     In Khwaja and Mian (2008), Amiti and Weinstein (2018) and Alfaro et al. (2021) the identification relies in
disentangling the bank lending channel (the bank-specific shock) from the firm borrowing channel (the ability of
firms to borrow from alternative sources). Our question is similar, but is not concerned with loans contracts but
with hedging.

                                                       28
    Average Effect Across Banks.-- We start our analysis with a standard difference-in-
difference estimator, in which we estimate the average impact of the regulatory change on firms'
hedging positions across banks. With this end, we define a dummy variable P ost which takes
the value of zero before the regulatory change and one after it. More precisely, we estimate:


                                       Long
                                    F Xi,   = 1 P ost + i + i, ,                                           (7)
                                                           Long
where  denotes the period before and after the reform, F Xi,    is the (log) average outstanding
long derivatives position of firm i in period  . Further, we estimate this regression using the
annual growth rate of FX outstanding position as dependent variable.

   Table 9 presents the results. The estimated coefficients are negative and statistically signifi-
cant in all specifications and indicate that, within the six months of the regulatory change, firms
contracted their purchases by almost 25% (Panel A, columns 1-2) and reduced their growth rate
by half (Panel A, columns 4-6). Our results are robust to including mining and MNC (columns
1 and 3) and to considering a four months window (Panel B).

    Banks' Individual Supply Changes of FX Derivatives.-- The above analysis presents
suggestive evidence that firms decrease their use of long FX derivatives after the regulatory
change. Yet the regressions did not control for changes in firms' hedging demand over time and,
hence, they could be attributing these changes in firms' demand to the regulatory change on
PFs. To assess whether the estimated coefficients correspond to the supply shock and not a
lower demand of FX derivatives from firms, we conduct an additional exercise where we saturate
our regressions with time-varying firm fixed effects and banks fixed effects. We exploit firms'
multi-banking relationships to identify the supply shocks. This identification strategy allows us
to obtain banks' individual coefficients that capture the change in the supply of FX derivatives
available to firms, once firms' demand for FX derivatives is already controlled for. In particular,
we consider the following specification

                                 D(F Xi,b, ) = i, + b, + i,b, ,                                 (8)
where D(F Xi,b, ) is the change in firm i's outstanding FX-purchases from bank b between before
( = 0) and after ( = 1) the regulatory change, i, is a firm-time fixed effect, b, is a bank-
time fixed effect and E [b,i, ] = 0. The empirical model in equation (8) separates the channels
for outstanding hedging contracts between bank b and firm i. If hedging varies because a firm
was hit by a firm-specific shock, our model will capture the decline in hedging demand in i, .
Alternatively, if a bank can no longer sell forward the dollars it buys from firms and, therefore,
cuts its supply of forward dollars, the model will capture that in b, . Following Amiti and
Weinstein (2018) we refer to the former as the "firm-specific demand channel", and to the latter
as the "bank-specific supply channel". The parameter of interest for the specific shock we analyze
is ^b, . That is, the supply channel of the regulatory change in the FX derivatives market.
    Table 10 presents the estimated coefficients     ^b, . The results in Panel A show that the
regulatory change reduced banks' supply of FX derivatives to all firms (column 1) and firms in
international trade (column 3). Most of the individual coefficients of banks are negative and
statistically significant, meaning that each of these banks reduced their supply of FX derivatives
to firms. Columns 2 and 4 show the cumulative market share of banks. We do not report
market share of each bank in order to protect their actual identity. However, column 1 in Panel
A shows that banks that reduced their FX derivatives supply (i.e. negative and statistically
significant coefficient) account for 90% of the sales of FX derivatives to firms (excluding sales by
the base bank ~  b). This shows that the shock had not only a substantial effect on the supply of
FX derivatives from PFs to banks, but also from banks to firms.
    We next consider the same framework of analysis to assess the effects of the change in reg-
ulation on the forward premium F XPi,b,t . In particular, we re-estimate equation (8) using the
forward premium D(F XPi,b, ) as dependent variable, where D(F XPi,b, ) is the change in the
median forward premium paid by each firm between before ( = 0) and after ( = 1) the regu-
latory change. We report the results in Panel B of Table 10. The decrease in the supply of FX
derivatives led to an increase in the forward premium paid by firms. Furthermore, this increase
is significant at the market level: banks for which we find a positive and significant coefficient

^b, account for 76% of the total sales of FX derivatives from banks to firms (columns 1 and 2).

This result is robust to considering only firms in international trade (columns 3 and 4).
   Table 10 showed that the decrease in the supply of FX derivatives to firms was heteroge-

neous across banks. Even though the shock was large enough to affect the whole market, it is
reasonable to expect that banks which were more exposed to PFs, adjusted relatively more after
the regulatory change. Thus, one should observe a negative correlation between banks' ex-ante
exposure to PFs and their reduction of FX derivatives to firms. We present this correlation in
Figure 8. The horizontal axis is banks' ex-ante exposure to pension funds and the vertical axis
is our estimated coefficients of Table 10, the bank-specific-supply effect. Every circle represents
a bank, and its size is proportional to their market share as suppliers of FX derivatives to firms.
The thick (thin) circles represent the estimated coefficients for which we can (cannot) reject the
null hypothesis of   ^b,t being different from zero at the 10% significance level. The correlation
between   ^b,t and banks' ex-ante exposure to PFs, albeit not large, is negative and statistically
significant, confirming that more exposed banks decreased their supply of FX derivatives to firms
after the regulatory change.23

increased by 0.7% and 0.77% for all firms and firms in international trade respectively, because
of the supply shock.

   The 2012 change in regulation implied a contraction in the supply of FX derivatives. The
regulatory change allowed pension funds to have larger non-hedge positions and, hence, they
reduced their sales of FX derivatives to banks. Without being able to hold significant open
positions, banks passed on the reduction on the sales of FX derivatives to firms. This reduction
was heterogeneous and higher for banks more exposed purchases of FX derivatives from pensions
funds before regulatory change.24 In the next section, we assess whether firms adjusted their
currency exposures and FX derivatives choices after the shock.


4.4     Financial Market Development and Firm Hedging
This section studies how the negative supply shock affected firms' FX derivatives choices. In
particular, we revisit some of the stylized facts presented in Section 3 and assess how the shock
affected the intensive and extensive margin of FX derivatives.

   Changes at the Extensive and Intensive Margins.--. To study the impact at the
extensive and intensive margin, we estimate an augmented version of equation (4) by interacting

     Notably, in Appendix A.3 we document a CIP violation starting after the change in regulation which reached
its maximum level six months after, and which affected mostly short term maturities.

where the dependent variable Yi,m is defined in three different ways (columns in Table 12): (i)
a dummy variable that takes the value of one if the firm uses FX derivatives (column 1), (ii)
(log) outstanding purchases of FX derivatives (column 2), (iii) (log) outstanding sales of FX
derivatives (column 3).
    Column 1 in Table 12 shows that the negative supply shock reduced the probability of using
FX derivatives. In particular, the estimated coefficient for the post-reform dummy--P ost --
implies that firms had a 2% lower probability of using FX derivatives after the regulatory change.
Column 2 presents the results on the intensive margin for FX purchases, and indicates the shock
lowered firms' purchases of FX derivatives. The dummy interacted with imports is negative and
statistically significant indicating that the shock made import hedging more difficult. Column 3
presents the results on FX sales and shows that these were also lower in the post-reform period.
Notably, exporters refrained from selling their cash inflows in the forward markets. This last
result may seem counter-intuitive as the change in regulation can be understood as a negative
supply shock affecting mostly buyers of US dollars in forward markets. Yet most exporters are
also importers, who usually hedge gross exposures separately. That is, they sell the dollars from
their exports and buy the dollars needed for their imports. However, disruptions on one side of
the market implies that these firms can no longer hedge imports trade credit as easily, and hence
may refrain from selling their FX currency revenues. This speaks to the interconnection between
both sides of the market and liquidity necessary for an OTC market to properly function.
    Results presented in this section show that the ease in the cap of non-share portfolios of pen-
sion funds in 2012 translated into a decrease in the supply of FX derivatives to banks, which--in
turn--passed on to firms. This negative supply shock led to an increase in the forward premium
in the FX market to firms, making it more costly for them to hedge their currency exposure.
At a result, the use of FX derivatives decreases both at the extensive and intensive margins. At
the extensive margin, the probability of using FX derivatives drops after shock. At the intensive
margin, importers reduce their FX purchases. Interesting, exporters reduce their sales of FX
derivatives and seem to prefer to hold their cash flows.

5    Conclusion
This paper exploits a unique dataset covering the universe of FX derivative transactions in Chile
over more than a decade to dissect which firms employ foreign currency derivatives and how they
use it to hedge the currency risk. The granularity of our data allowed us to uncover four new
facts.
    First, we showed that firms, even those that could exploit it further, are not "naturally
hedged", as their receivables due to exports and payables due to imports are only marginally
correlated. Notably, this correlation remains small even when controlling for foreign currency
debt. We then assessed a plausible reason for low natural hedge: different maturity between
payables and receivables in foreign currency. We documented that indeed the trade credit for
imports has a much lower maturity than it has for exports, suggesting that it would actually
be very difficult for firms to be naturally hedged. Second, we showed firms that employ FX
derivatives to be larger and employ these instruments to hedge larger transactions. Third, when
assessing the use of FX derivatives at the extensive and intensive margins, w found that, at both
margins, trade credit for exports and imports associate with a higher probability and use of FX
derivatives. Interestingly, the size of the estimated coefficients is rather small, which suggests

                                                      35
that firms hedge a small part of the trade credit and still have a large unhedged positions. Finally,
we reported a maturity premium.
   In the last section of the paper, we used a reform that decreased the liquidity in the FX
derivative market for purchases purposes and showed that reduction in the supply of USD forward
substantially lowers the use of FX derivatives for hedging imports. This exercise suggests that
the more developed is the FX derivative market, the more firms would be able to hedge their
imports arguably limiting systemic risk associated to currency exposure.

Notes.-- This figure shows the histograms of transaction-level matched data between FX deriva-
tives contract and Imports/Exports transactions (only FX), at the firm, maturity date, amount
level. The horizontal axis is the size of the transaction of FX derivatives. This exercise uses firms
which participate in international trade and the FX derivatives market, but hold no foreign debt.

where i t,t+n and it,t+n correspond to the n-year risk-free interest rates quoted at date t in U.S.
dollars and Chilean pesos, respectively. Also, denote St the spot exchange rate, and Ft,t+n the
n-year outright forward exchange rate signed in t. Finally, denote by xt,n the measure of CIP
deviation, i.e. the on-shore spread (Morales and Vergara, 2017). In particular, for the domestic
rate, we use the 3-month prime deposit rate, and for the foreign rate, the 3-month libor rate.

A.4     A Stylized Model of Market Thickness
In this section, we develop a simple model to illustrate how market liquidity is key for the FX
derivatives market. Notably, this is not a theory of optimal hedging, but a stylized matching
model which illustrates how the regulatory change we explore in Section 4 affected both, buyers'
and sellers' (other than PFs) decisions to engage in financial hedging. This model builds on the
stylized facts found in Section 3 that natural hedging is limited (Fact 1), buyers of FX derivatives
are usually importers, and sellers are usually exporters (Fact 3) .
    Hence, in this stylized model we consider a buyer of FX derivatives (usually an importer with
trade credit exposure or a borrower in foreign currency), a financial intermediary which acts as
market maker (usually a bank), and sellers of FX derivatives (usually an exporter with trade
credit exposure, or Pension Funds). Figure A.8 displays the interaction between these agents.
Notably, a firm may be both a seller and a buyer of FX derivatives, as firms hedge their gross,
not net, positions (Fact 3).

                   Figure A.8: OTC intermediation in FX derivatives market

     Consider an importer with trade credit exposure, and hence a hedging need with indexed by
 b , which summarize different contract characteristics (maturity,currency, etc.). The index b is
modelled as a random realization in the unitary circle on the left. If the importer firm hedges
its currency risk buying a FX derivative from the bank, it gets a surplus

                               sM    s - s)M
                                j = (¯     j ,         M
                                                       j  U (0, 1)                             (11)

where s¯, s define a support for the benefits of hedging, and Mj indexes firms by the gains from
hedging and allows us to speak about the number of firms who decide to engage in financial
hedging. The bank supplying the FX derivative is assumed to get a fixed fee  M < s. The
bank can bear the currency risk implied in this contract at a cost. Hence, it will try to offset
the original exposure buying a FX derivative to exporters of PFs. Bank pays a search cost fS
which allows it to observe the number of agents willing to sell a FX derivative nX , and the
fact that they are equi-spaced in the unitary circle. The bank, however, does not observe the
exact position of the closest FX derivatives seller s . If b = s (with respect to an arbitrary but
common zero), then the bank bears a cost that is proportional to the distance z = | p - s |, µz .
We can think this proportional cost µz as the residual currency risk which banks tend to avoid

                                                 53
if they can. Hence, a bank will only sell FX derivatives to an importer if this distance is small
enough relative to the benefit  M .
    Then, conditional on selling a FX derivative to importer-j , the bank makes positive profit from
this contract if  M  µz , which immediately defines a threshold distance (residual mismatch)

                                                     M
                                                 z =
                                                     µ

    below which the bank always makes positive profits. Also, from the fact that the nX sellers
                                                                                              1
of FX derivatives are equi-spaced in the unitary circle, the bank knows that z  U (0, 2n       X)
                                                   b
and hence, it knows that if it decided to take on    it will be ale to match it with probability
        X M
p = 2n µ . Notably, the probability of finding a matching exposure in the sellers' market is
a function of the number of participants (contracts by exporters and PFs) in such market. We
refer to this notion as "market thickness".
    Further assume that importer-j pays a small entry fee fE to participate in the FX derivatives
market, and a cost CN > fE should instead it decide to engage in natural hedging. Then, the
expected profits of the importer from using FX derivatives are given by,
                                                         M
                              M                      X

                                                                   j -  ) - fE                 (12)

while the profits of engaging in natural hedging are E (j   |N H ) = sM

                                       Figure A.9: Market thickness
   Note.-- This figure shows the joint determination of entrants in the OTC FX derivatives market. Blue line
represents equation (13), red line represents equation (14), dashed red line represents (14) with a negative shock
to the mass of the FX derivatives sellers.


    So far, it is clear that the thickness in the counterparty market directly affects the probability
of a firm engaging in financial hedging. That is, the thickness in the market of sellers of forward-
dollars--the availability and heterogeneity of different currency/maturity contracts--affects the
probability that a forward-dollar-buyer firm, who is assumed to pay an entry cost, engages in
financial hedging. The same is true for sellers of FX derivatives about the market thickness in
the buyers of forward dollars. The interplay of equilibrium conditions (13) and (13) (in blue and
red respectively) is depicted in Figure A.9, where the intersection point A defines equilibrium
market thicknesses (nX         M
                          0 , n0 )).
    The regulatory change examined in Section 4 can be interpreted in this model as an exoge-
nous decrease in market thickness in the sellers market, nX        X
                                                              0 - n1 , or going from point A to point
B . By Equation (13) we know that the number of buyer firms will decrease (for sensible param-
eterization). What our stylized model highlights is that this decrease in the market thickness
of buyers of FX derivatives results in further decrease in the market thickness of sellers of FX
derivatives, beyond the initial drop due to the absence of Pension Funds' sell of short positions.
This extra drop in market thickness can be seen in the figure as the distance nX           X
                                                                                    1 - n2 . This, in
turn, is in line with the evidence in Table 12, column 3, which shows a negative coefficient for
the sales of FX derivatives after a supply shock to this market.
