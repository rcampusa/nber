I. Introduction

       The starting point of this paper is the observation of Flood, Hodrick, and Kaplan (1986)

that stock returns are predictable. Flood, Hodrick, and Kaplan (1986) argued that one could not

test for bubbles in stock prices without controlling for the rational movements in stock prices that

are caused by fluctuations in expected rates of return. They used annual data and demonstrated

that dividend yields, the ratio of the annual dividend to the current stock price, provided

statistically significant forecasts of future stock returns, especially at the two-year horizon.

Subsequent research by Campbell (1991) and Hodrick (1992) demonstrates that a vector

autoregressive approach with monthly data generates significant time-varying forecasts of stock

returns at any future horizon and has better small-sample properties than the direct long-horizon

approach.

       While theories of stock return predictability have been available since Merton (1973), the

links between the theories of stock return predictability and the empirical analysis of this issue

have been weak. 1 The intuition of Merton’s model is that risk-averse consumer-investors want

to hedge against adverse changes in their consumption and investment opportunity sets. Thus,

the cross-section and time-series patterns of expected asset returns are determined by more than

just the covariances of the returns on the assets with the return on the market portfolio, as in the

static capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Expected returns also depend on the covariances of

the returns on the assets with the state variables that describe the consumption and investment

opportunity sets. The generality of this specification provided little basis for a tight econometric

test of Merton’s theory.

       Predictability of international equity returns is inconsistent with the static CAPM. Some

researchers, Harvey (1991), Bekaert and Hodrick (1992), and Ferson and Harvey (1993) for



                                                 3
example, have characterized the predictability of country returns and developed tests of

conditional CAPM’s in which the conditional expected return on an asset is related to the

conditional expected return on the market portfolio with a conditional, time-varying beta. The

main problem with this approach is that it lacks a sound theoretical foundation.            Once the

conditional distributions are allowed to vary, Merton’s (1973) logic indicates that additional

hedge portfolios, other than the market, may be priced. This paper develops a formal test of an

international, intertemporal, asset-pricing model in which state variables may be priced.

       Our analysis builds on the work of Campbell (1993, 1996).               The failure of the

consumption-based, asset-pricing literature of the 1980’s motivated Campbell (1993) to develop

a theoretical model that avoids direct measurements of consumption. Campbell (1996) extended

this theoretical model and generated empirically testable specifications directly linking the cross-

section of expected stock returns to time variation in expected returns on the market portfolio.

Campbell (1996) applied his model to a cross-section of returns on 25 portfolios of U.S. stocks

taking the value-weighted U.S. market return as the market portfolio. 2 While the theory was

marginally rejected, the pricing errors of the model were small on most portfolios. Most of the

explanatory power of the model was in the market portfolio, as is predicted by the CAPM.

       The purpose of this paper is to determine whether variation in expected returns on the

world market portfolio induces significant hedging motives, which are reflected in average

returns across countries. We extend Campbell’s (1996) model to an international environment,

and we utilize recent evidence of Lamont (1998) to specify the state variables in the forecasting

equation.

       Our analysis is effectively a constrained arbitrage-pricing model. Korajczyk and Viallet

(1989) and Ferson and Harvey (1993) have tested multi-factor, international, arbitrage-pricing




                                                 4
models. The problem with these specifications is that one must pre-specify the identity and

number of factors with little theoretical guidance. Our framework imposes the restriction that

the factors affecting the cross-sectional asset pricing must be those that forecast market returns.

       As with many studies of international asset pricing, we assume that national equity

markets are integrated, with no barriers to investment, transaction costs or differential taxes. We

will also assume a representative agent framework, which raises the issue of aggregation across

countries and the failure of purchasing power parity, see Adler and Dumas (1983).

       Section II provides a review of Campbell’s (1996) model. Section III describes the data.

Section IV discusses forecasting of real and excess nominal stock returns and compares the

results of our analysis with Lamont’s (1998) analysis. Section V discusses the econometric

aspects of the asset-pricing model, while section VI provides the estimation and testing of the

model. Section VII contains concluding remarks.

II. A Review of Campbell’s (1996) Model

       Campbell’s (1996) model uses a representative agent framework, and hence, it shares the

weaknesses of the consumption CAPM and Euler equation methods that were developed in the

1980’s to test intertemporal asset-pricing models. 3 Nevertheless, there is an advantage to the

approach because Campbell uses log-linearization to eliminate observations on consumption

from the asset-pricing model.      Ultimately, the model relates expected returns on assets to

covariances of returns with the market portfolio, as in the traditional static CAPM, and to

covariances of returns with changes in the expected future returns on the market portfolio. 4

       The representative agent’s budget constraint is written in real terms as

                                    Wt +1 = Rm ,t +1 (Wt − Ct ),                                  (1)




                                                    5
where Wt is real wealth, Ct is real consumption, and Rm,t+1 is the gross return on aggregate

wealth, which is the return on the market portfolio.

        Campbell (1996) divides equation (1) by Wt and log-linearizes the resulting expression in

a first-order Taylor approximation around the mean log consumption-wealth ratio, c – w. The

result is

                            ∆wt +1 = rm ,t +1 + k w + (1 − (1 / ρ))( ct − wt ),                    (2)

where lower case letters are natural logarithms of upper case counterparts, ρ / 1 – exp(c – w),

and k w is a constant.

        When the log consumption-wealth ratio is stationary, equation (2) implies that the

innovation in logarithm of consumption can be written as the innovation in the discounted

present value of the return on the market minus the innovation in the discounted present value of

consumption growth:

                                                                 ∞
                            c t +1 − Et ct +1 = ( Et +1 − Et ) ∑ ρ j rm ,t +1 + j
                                                                j =0
                                                                  ∞
                                                                                                   (3)
                                              − ( Et +1 − Et )∑ ρ ∆ct +1 + j
                                                                        j

                                                                 j =1



Equation (3) indicates that an unanticipated increase in consumption today must be due to an

innovation in the return on wealth, either today or an expected increase in the future, or it must

coincide with a planned reduction in the growth rate of consumption in the future.

        Campbell (1993, 1996) next uses a log-linear Euler equation to eliminate expected future

consumption growth from the right-hand side of equation (3). The consumer’s preferences are

modeled as in Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1989) with separate parameters for the

coefficient of relative risk aversion, γ, and for the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, F. The

objective function is defined recursively by



                                                          6
                                    U t = [(1 − β )Ct(1 −γ ) / θ + β ( E tU t(+11−γ ) )1 / θ ]θ /(1 −γ ) ,                (4)

where 2 / (1 - ()/[1 – (1/F)]. Campbell (1996) notes that θ can have either sign, θ → 0 as γ →

1, θ → 4 as σ → 1, and θ → 1 as γ → 1/σ.

          Epstein and Zin (1989) solve for the Euler equations associated with maximizing

equation (4) subject to the budget constraint given in (1). When asset returns are conditionally

homoskedastic and log-normally distributed, the Euler equations may be written in log-linear

form as

                                                Et ∆ct +1 = µm + σEt rm ,t +1                                             (5)

and

                                                                Vii    V
                                    Et ri ,t +1 − r f ,t +1 +       = θ ic + (1 − θ )Vim .                                (6)
                                                                 2     σ

In equation (6), rf,t+1 is the riskless real interest rate, Vii = var(ri,t+1 - Etri,t+1 ), Vic = cov(ri,t+1 -

Etri,t+1 , ct+1 - Etct+1 ), and Vim = cov(ri,t+1 - Etri,t+1 , rm,t+1 - Etrm,t+1 ).

          Equation (5) indicates that consumption growth is linearly related to the expected return

on the market portfolio, and this fact is used in conjunction with the linearized budget constraint

to eliminate consumption from the asset-pricing model.                                        Equation (6) indicates that the

continuously compounded risk premium on an asset plus one-half of the asset’s variance is

determined by the covariances of the asset’s return with consumption and with the return on the

market.

          By substituting equation (5) into equation (3), Campbell (1996) derives

                                                                                                      ∞
                         c t +1 − Et ct +1 = rm ,t +1 − Et rm , t +1 + (1 − σ )( E t +1 − Et ) ∑ ρ j rm ,t +1 + j .       (7)
                                                                                                     j =1



Equation (7) indicates that the innovation in consumption, which enters the asset-pricing

equation (6), can be eliminated by focusing on the innovations in the return on the market


                                                                     7
portfolio and in the discounted expected future returns. Intuitively, consumption responds one-

for-one to the current return on the market portfolio because the objective function is

homogeneous of degree one. The response of an innovation in consumption to an innovation in

expected future returns depends on income and substitution effects. When the elasticity of

substitution, F, is less than one, the income effect dominates causing current consumption to rise.

When F is greater than one, the substitution effect dominates; and current consumption falls.

         By substituting from equation (7) into the asset-pricing equation (6), we find

                         cov( ri ,t +1 − E t ri ,t +1 , ct +1 − E t ct +1 ) ≡ Vic = Vim + (1 − σ )Vih ,                  (8)


where Vih ≡ cov[ ri ,t +1 − Et ri ,t +1 , ( E t +1 − Et ) ∑ j =1 ρ j rm ,t +1 + j ] , which is the covariance of the return on
                                                                 ∞




an asset with the revision in expectations about discounted future market returns.

         After substituting equation (8) into equation (6) and using the definition of 2, the asset-

pricing equations become

                                                                 Vii
                                    Et ri ,t +1 − r f , t +1 +       = γVim + (γ − 1)Vih .                               (9)
                                                                  2

Equation (9) demonstrates that an asset’s risk premium (adjusted for one-half its own variance)

depends on the asset’s covariance with the market portfolio, with weight (, and on its covariance

with the innovation in discounted expected future market returns, with weight (( - 1).

         The coefficient of relative risk aversion determines the compensation that investors

demand for covariance risks. When ( = 1, the model’s predictions coincide with those of the

static CAPM. When ( > (<) 1, investors require higher (lower) expected returns on assets that

covary positively with innovations in discounted expected future returns. Campbell (1996) notes

that a positive covariance carries a mixed blessing. On the one hand, investors like assets that

have good payoffs when expected future returns are high. But, on the other hand, investors



                                                                      8
dislike the fact that such assets provide poor hedging against deterioration in future investment

opportunities. When ( is greater than one, the latter effect dominates the former.

       While the derivation of equation (9) follows Campbell (1996) in assuming conditional

homoskedasticity, Campbell (1993) discusses several conditions under which such an equation

can be derived in a more realistic environment of conditional heteroskedasticity. 5 The most

straightforward approach is to assume that the elasticity of substitution, F, equals one. In this

case, equation (9) holds in terms of conditional expected returns with all second moments

replaced by conditional second moments.          Below, we derive and test the unconditional

implications of such a specification. 6

III. The Data

       Table 1 presents some summary statistics for the primary data set that will be used in our

study. We use monthly data from 1970:1 to 1998:4. The first variable is the real return on the

MSCI world market portfolio (RRET). The units are percent per month, so the mean return of

0.546% corresponds to an annualized value of 6.55%. The next four variables are the additional

state variables that are the predictors of real returns. The first is the logarithm of the annualized

payout-ratio of world dividends relative to world earnings (LOGDE).             The second is the

logarithm of the annualized world dividend-price ratio (LOGDP). The third is the relative bill

rate (RREL), which is the one-month U.S. interest rate minus its previous twelve-month moving

average, in percent per month. The fourth variable is the Treasury bond term spread (TSPD)

between the 30-year U.S. interest rate and the one-year U.S. interest rate, in percent per month.

       The next seven variables in Table 1 are the dollar rates of return on the MSCI G7 country

portfolios in excess of the one-month U.S. Treasury bill rate of return. The countries are the

United States (US), Japan (JP), Germany (GE), the United Kingdom (UK), France (FR), Canada



                                                 9
(CA), and Italy (IT). These variables are also measured as percent per month. The mean excess

rates of return range from Italy’s 1.056% per annum to the U.K.’s 6.732% per annum. The U.S.

has the lowest standard deviation, and Italy has the highest.

IV. The Forecasting Model

       The first task in developing testable restrictions from equation (9) is to determine that the

real return on the world equity market portfolio is forecastable. Since the theoretical model

requires multi-period forecasts of the equity return, it is useful to stack the equity return as the

first element of a k-dimensional vector of state variables, zt , and use a vector autoregression

(VAR) as in the following:

                                          z t +1 = Az t + εt +1 .                              (10)

The representation of the VAR as a first-order system is not restrictive, as the variables can

always be stacked into a first-order companion form. We report the results of the first-order

specification as this is the order chosen by the Schwarz (1978) criterion.

       Panel A of Table 2 presents a five-variable, first-order vector autoregression. The first

variable is the real return on the MSCI world market portfolio (RRET). The other four variables

are the payout ratio, LOGDE; the dividend yield, LOGDP; the relative bill rate, RREL; and the

term spread, TSPD. We use RREL and TSPD because we are pricing the excess dollar returns

on the G7 equities.

       Lamont (1998) finds that the payout ratio is an important predictor of the U.S. S&P 500

excess return. Rozeff (1984), Campbell and Shiller (1988), Fama and French (1988), and Flood,

Hodrick and Kaplan (1986) emphasize the importance of the dividend yield in forecasting stock

returns at short and long horizons. Campbell (1991) and Hodrick (1992) use the relative bill rate.




                                                  10
Fama and French (1989) find that the term structure of interest rates predicts stock and bond

returns.

           For the return forecasting equation, the value of the chi-square statistic with five degrees

of freedom is 15.56, which indicates that real equity returns are predictable at standard levels of

statistical significance. Nevertheless, the adjusted R2 for the real return equation is only 3.3%.

This pattern of strong statistical significance with low percentage predictability is to be expected

in monthly data. In efficient markets, most of the observed return will be unexpected, unless

economic agents are extremely risk averse.

           The most important features of the other forecasting equations are the coefficients on the

own lags, which indicate that there is strong positive serial correlation in the log payout ratio, the

log dividend-price ratio, and the term premium. There are also important off-diagonal terms

indicating significant dynamics between the dividend yield, the payout ratio, the relative bill rate,

and the term spread.

           Panel A of Table 2 also reports the Cumby-Huizinga (1992) L-tests for residual serial

correlation of the first eight lags in each equation. Except for the relative bill rate equation, a

first-order VAR appears to be a good approximation to the data-generating process.

           Panel B of Table 2 reports unconstrained excess return forecasting equations for the G7

countries. Here again, the evidence for predictability of the excess returns is not overwhelmingly

strong. These equations are provided as a comparison to the constrained equations that will enter

the asset-pricing model.

           Table 3 reports the covariances and correlations of the innovations in the VAR. The

correlations are in bold above the diagonal. The innovation variance of the real stock return is

much larger than the other innovation variances, and the innovation in the real stock return is




                                                   11
highly negatively correlated with the innovation in the log dividend yield. The log dividend

yield is positively correlated with the log payout ratio and the relative bill rate.

        Our results on the predictability of returns present a striking contrast to those of Lamont

(1998). We explore these differences in Table 4, which adopts a quarterly measurement interval

for comparison purposes. 7 Lamont (1998) forecasts the excess nominal return on the S&P 500

and reports a significantly higher R2 for the sample period 1947:Q1 to 1994:Q4.             We use

Lamont’s (1998) data and our programs to produce the first line of Table 4, which coincides with

the first line of Lamont’s (1998) Table VI. Aside from the higher R2 in the return equation,

Lamont (1998) also reports that the dividend-payout ratio positively forecasts returns, which he

interprets as a business-cycle effect. The argument is that the payout ratio is countercyclical as

earnings fluctuate more than dividends across business cycles.            Since expected returns are

thought to be countercyclical, being higher in recessions than in booms, the coefficient linking

the payout ratio to returns should be positive. Line 2 of Table 4 demonstrates that this effect

persists in Lamont’s data for the sample period 1970:Q2 to 1994:Q4, which is the part that

overlaps most with our sample.         Line 3 of Table 4 demonstrates that the effects are not

diminished by the inclusion of the term spread in the regression. Line 4 of Table 4 presents an

analogous regression to line 3, but the data are changed. Line 4 uses the excess nominal return

on the MSCI-US portfolio, which has a correlation of .997 with the S&P 500 return, and

employs the associated MSCI-US dividend and earning series. LOGDE loses significance, and

its sign changes from positive to negative. The R2 for the return equation also falls from .12 to

.06. Line 5 of Table 4 demonstrates that extending the sample to 1998:2 causes the dividend

yield to lose significance.    The last line of Table 4 presents the forecasting regression for the




                                                  12
MSCI-World excess nominal return, which is similar to the forecasting equation for the real

return in Table 1.

Innovations in Forecasts of Future Stock Returns

The next step in the analysis is to calculate the innovation in the discounted expected future stock

returns, since this is the other factor in the asset-pricing framework. To generate the innovation

in the discounted present value of the market equity returns from the VAR, define the k-

dimensional indicator vector e1, whose first element is one and whose other elements are zero.

Because Et zt + j = A j z t , the innovation in the discounted expected future value of the stock

market returns is

                                         ∞                       ∞
                          ( Et +1 − Et ) ∑ ρ j rm ,t +1 + j = e1′∑ ρ j A j εt +1
                                         j =1                   j =1

                                                         = e1′ ρA( I − ρA) −1 ε t +1                 (11)
                                                         = λh′εt +1 .

       The last line of equation (11) defines the vector 8h to be a nonlinear function of the VAR

coefficients equal to e1NDA(I - DA)-1. The subscript h is used to identify this coefficient with the

hedging demands of investors.

       The differences in the variances of the innovations and the correlations between

innovations make it hard to interpret the estimation results for a VAR factor model unless the

factors are orthogonalized and scaled in some way. To deal with this problem, Campbell (1996)

employs Sims’s (1980) triangular orthogonalization of the innovations.                 He also scales the

innovations such that they have the same variance as the innovation to the real return. We adopt

a similar procedure. Thus, the orthogonalized innovation in the real return is unaffected, and the

orthogonalized innovation in the payout ratio is the component of the payout ratio that is

orthogonal to the real return.      The orthogonalized innovation in the dividend yield is the



                                                       13
component of the dividend yield that is orthogonal to the real return and the payout ratio, etc.

Since fluctuations in the payout ratio are dominated by fluctuations in earnings, the

orthogonalized innovation is essentially an earnings shock that is uncorrelated with returns. The

orthogonalized innovation in the dividend yield becomes a dividend shock, and the innovations

in the relative bill rate and the term premium become shocks to short-term and long-term interest

rates that are orthogonal to returns, earnings and dividends.

       Table 5 reports the coefficients of 8h for the raw innovations and for the orthogonalized

innovations using a D = 0.9949. Asymptotic standard errors are reported in parentheses under

the coefficients. We find that shocks to the dividend yield, the relative bill rate, and the term

premium have positive influences on the innovation in discounted expected future returns, while

the innovation in the stock return and the payout ratio have a negative effect. Although none of

the coefficients is particularly large relative to its standard error, the P2 (5) statistic that tests

whether all five coefficients are zero is 10.940, which has a p-value of .053. Hence, the group of

variables as a whole does have some predictive power.

       Campbell (1996) notes that the coefficient on the orthogonalized innovation to the real

return in the 8h vector represents the percent of an innovation in returns that is expected to be

reversed over the long run.        Our point estimate implies considerably less reversion in

international stock returns than Campbell finds in post-war U.S. data. Our coefficient is -0.23,

whereas Campbell reports a coefficient of -0.92. We also find somewhat different results on the

importance of the term premium.         Here, we find a coefficient on the orthogonalized term

premium of 0.65 while Campbell reports 0.21. Since the scale of the orthogonalized variables is

quite similar because our variance is 16.42 versus Campbell’s 17.04, fluctuations in the term




                                                 14
premium are much more important for the international equity markets than for the U.S.

domestic market.

       Panel B of Table 5 reports the covariances and correlations of the two sources of risk in

the asset-pricing model, e1Nε t+1 and 8h Nεt+1 . We find that innovations to discounted expected

future real returns are slightly more than half as variable as innovations to current returns,

whereas Campbell (1996) finds them to be approximately equal, and we find a correlation

between the two factors of -.324, whereas Campbell’s is -.915. The decline in the correlation

between e1Nε t+1 and 8h Nεt+1 may be due to the decline in the importance of the dividend yield in

predicting future stock returns.

V. The Econometric Asset-Pricing Model

       The next task is to develop the econometric specification to test the asset-pricing model.

We use Hansen’s (1982) generalized method of moments (GMM), which requires that the

econometrician define a set of orthogonality conditions specified by the theoretical model.

       Three basic sets of orthogonality conditions are used. The first set is derived from the

requirements that the errors in the VAR equations are required to be orthogonal to the right-

hand-side forecasting variables:

                                   Et [ε t +1 ⊗ (1, z ′t )′] = 0.                                 (12)

       The second set of orthogonality conditions involves the equations that define the

innovations in the excess country returns. Here, as in Panel B of Table 1, the excess rate of

return for country i at time t+1 is projected onto the same information set, (1, zt N), that is used to

forecast the real return on the world market portfolio:

                                   ri , t +1 − r f ,t +1 = µi + δ i′z t + ηi , t +1 .             (13)

       Thus, the orthogonality conditions for the i-th country excess rate of return are


                                                          15
                                           Et [ηi ,t +1 ⊗ (1, z ′t ) ′] = 0.                                               (14)

        The third set of orthogonality conditions involves the asset-pricing equations. Since the

asset-pricing equations are written in terms of conditional expectations at time t, and the

innovations to the first two sets of orthogonality conditions are defined above, the asset-pricing

equations (9) can be written as

                                              Etηi2,t +1
                    Et ri ,t +1 − r f ,t +1 +            = γEt (ηi , t +1e1′ε t +1 ) + (γ − 1) Et (ηi ,t +1 λh′ε t +1 ).   (15)
                                                2

 By substituting for the expected return and using realizations for conditional expectations, we

can define the innovation in the i-th asset-pricing equation relative to the time t information set

as

                                                ηi2, t +1
                    ui ,t +1 = µi + δi′z t +              − γ (ηi ,t +1 e1′ε t +1 ) − (γ − 1)(ηi ,t +1 λh′ε t +1 ).        (16)
                                                   2

        In the first set of empirical results, we only impose the orthogonality conditions

                                                       E (ut +1 ) = 0,                                                     (17)

where ut+1 is the vector of the ui,t+1 ’s. We do not impose additional restrictions because all of the

orthogonality conditions of the model must be estimated simultaneously.

        With seven country returns and five forecasting variables, there are thirty orthogonality

conditions in the first set, forty-two in the second set, and seven in the third for a total of

seventy-nine. There are also thirty parameters in the first set, forty-two in the second, and one in

the third for a total of seventy-three parameters. Thus, the entire system of equations has six

more orthogonality conditions than parameters, and the test of the overidentifying restrictions of

the model is a P2 (6).




                                                                 16
VI. Estimation of the Model

          Table 6 reports the seventy-three parameter estimates of the model associated with the

VAR forecasting equations, the G7 excess-return forecasting equations, and the asset-pricing

equations, as well as the constrained prices of risks. As might be expected, there is little change

in the parameters of the VAR forecasting equations or the excess return forecasting equations

relative to their respective unconstrained estimates that are reported in Table 1.            The key

parameter of the model is the coefficient of relative risk aversion, (. Its estimated value is 5.06,

with a standard error of 2.54. Often, in the consumption-based asset-pricing literature and in

Campbell (1996), the estimated coefficients of relative risk aversion are implausibly large, but

our value is quite reasonable.

          The overidentifying restrictions of our model are not rejected, since the P2 (6) statistic has

a value of 1.23, which corresponds to a p-value of 0.975. Thus, Campbell’s dynamic asset-

pricing model explains the cross-section of the G7 country equity returns. When we estimate the

model without imposing the constraint that the coefficient on Vih is (( - 1), the estimated value of

the coefficient is 3.056 with a standard error of 12.330. The resulting chi-squared test that the

coefficient on Vih equals the coefficient on Vim minus one has a value of 0.004. The fact that the

coefficient on Vih is insignificantly different from zero suggests that more restricted models may

adequately represent the data.

Test of Restricted Models

          There are several conditions that allow the predictions of the dynamic model to collapse

to the predictions of the CAPM. This section investigates whether we can reject these conditions

or not.




                                                   17
        The first way that the dynamic model reduces to the CAPM is if ( = 1, since then

expected returns are determined only by the covariance of an asset with the market portfolio. A

GMM likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis that ( = 1 involves estimation of the model under

this restriction with the same GMM weighting matrix as is used without the restriction. The

difference in the values of the criterion functions is a P2 (1) = 4.512, which coincides with a p-

value of .033 indicating that it is unlikely that ( = 1.

        The second way that the model reduces to the CAPM is if the covariances of the asset

returns with the hedge portfolio are all zero. The test of these restrictions is a P2 (7) = 54.035

with a p-value less than .0001 indicating very strong evidence that the covariances with the

hedge portfolios are important in pricing the cross-section of asset returns.

        The third way that the dynamic model can be reduced to the CAPM is if each Vih is

proportional to its Vim with the same factor of proportionality. The test of these restrictions is a

P2 (6) = 4.512. Hence, we are unable to reject that the dynamic model collapses to the CAPM for

this set of assets. The importance of the hedge portfolios in the pricing of the assets indicates

that the hedge portfolios might be important in pricing other assets in which the proportionality

does not hold.

Estimated Prices of Risks

        The asset-pricing model implies that expected returns on assets adjust to reflect the

covariances of asset returns with the return on the market portfolio and with the other underlying

factors that forecast the market portfolio. These covariances are the asset’s risk characteristics,

and the compensations or prices of the risks are constrained by the model. The price of risk that

arises from the traditional covariance of an asset’s return with the market return is ( + (( - 1)8h1 ,

where 8hk represents the k-th element of 8h . The price of the k-th risk that arises from the



                                                   18
covariance of an asset’s return with the innovation in a variable that forecasts the market return is

(( - 1)8hk . Thus, this model provides a clear link between the coefficient of relative risk

aversion, (, and the prices of risks that arise from covariances between asset returns and various

factors.

           The prices of risks are given in Panel C of Table 6 for the orthogonalized innovations.

The covariance of a return with the return on the market portfolio indeed commands the largest

price of risk, which justifies the important role of this variable in the traditional CAPM. The

estimated price the risk caused by covariance of the return with the market return is 4.065 with a

standard error of 1.541. The covariance of a return with the term premium also incurs a large

price of risk, a value of 2.411 with a standard error of 1.834. The prices of other covariance risks

are an order of magnitude smaller than these coefficients and have standard errors larger than the

coefficients. The results for the prices of risks for the market return and the term premium are

comparable to those estimated by Campbell (1996), but he finds much larger prices of risks for

the dividend yield and the relative bill rate. These findings are consistent with Korajczyk and

Viallet (1989) and Ferson and Harvey (1993) who also find significant risk prices for factors

other than the risk generated by covariance with the return on the international market portfolio.

           It is also possible to estimate unconstrained prices of risks. That is, the asset-pricing

model is simply postulated to be

                                                         Etηi2,t +1     5
                             Et ri ,t +1 − r f ,t +1   +            = ∑ π k Et (ηi ,t +1ε k ,t +1 ),   (18)
                                                           2          k =1



where the Bk parameters represent the five unconstrained prices of risks associated with

covariances between the asset returns and the innovations in the factors that forecast the market

return. This specification is essentially a five-factor asset-pricing model as in Ross’s (1976)

arbitrage pricing theory (APT). Table 7 presents the estimated parameters of this model, and the


                                                                  19
unconstrained prices of risk are given at the bottom. Compared to the results of the constrained

model, there is a slight reduction in the price of risk associated with the covariance of an asset’s

return with the real return on the world market portfolio. There are large changes in the prices of

the other covariance risks, which are also very imprecisely estimated. Because this model uses

the same orthogonality conditions as the constrained model and estimates four additional

parameters, the overidentifying restrictions of this unconstrained model also are not rejected.

The P2 (2) statistic has a value of 0.133, which corresponds to a P-value of 0.936.

Pricing Errors from the Dynamic Model

       Table 8 provides the average adjusted excess rates of return for the seven country

portfolios for two samples, which have units of percent per month. The first is our base sample

of 1970:01 to 1998:04. The second is a sub-sample from 1975:01 to 1995:12, which corresponds

to the Fama-French (1998) sample. The average adjusted return corresponds to

                                                    1 T −1                ηi2,t +1 
                           Ave. Adj. return i =         ∑ i, t +1 f , t +1 2 ,
                                                  T − 1 t =1 
                                                                r − r     +                    (19)
                                                                                     

where the estimated residuals are used. This is simply the average risk premium, which is

adjusted for the Jensen’s inequality effect that arises because we are using log returns instead of

gross returns. The dynamic pricing model predicts that the average adjusted return contains two

parts: a part corresponding to risk induced by covariance with the world market portfolio, (Vi,m,

and a part corresponding to risk induced by covariance with the innovation in discounted

expected future returns, (( - 1)Vi,h. The model does very well at pricing the average adjusted

returns. The pricing error for the U.S. is only 0.001 percent per month or 0.012 percent per

annum. The Canadian pricing error is the largest at –0.045 percent per month for the basic




                                                   20
sample or –0.54 percent per annum. The pricing errors are even smaller, in general, for the

Fama-French (1998) sub-sample.

        Since the estimates of Vi,h are uniformly negative, each equity return covaries negatively

with the innovation in discounted expected future market returns. As we noted above, when ( >

1, investors view such negative covariation as desirable for hedging purposes. Hence, these

terms contribute negatively to the assets’ required rates of return.

CAPM Specification Tests

        Our inability to reject the restrictions of the CAPM and the imprecision in the estimates

of the unconstrained prices of risks, for the factors other than the market portfolio, suggest that

the traditional CAPM may be an adequate representation of the expected returns on the seven

country portfolios in the sense of having comparable pricing errors.                                       To investigate this

conjecture, we set up the following system of equations:

                                              rm , t +1 = µm + ε m ,t +1
                                    ri ,t +1 − r f , t +1 = µi + ηi , t +1                                                (20)
                                                                  ηi2, t +1
                                              u i , t +1 = µi +               − γ (ηi , t +1ε m ,t +1 ),
                                                                     2

for i = 1, …, 7. The system is estimated by making each of the error terms orthogonal to a

constant. Since there are nine parameters in the system of equations and fifteen orthogonality

conditions, the test of the overidentifying restrictions is a P2 (6).

        This version of the CAPM is estimated in Panel A of Table 9. For the full sample, the

estimated value of ( for is 3.776, with a standard error of 1.478. The P2 (6) statistic that tests the

overidentifying restrictions of the model is 1.079, which corresponds to a p-value of 0.982.

Hence, the CAPM is not rejected by the data. The average returns are larger in the sub-sample,

but inference about the validity of the CAPM is similar.



                                                          21
       The pricing errors of the CAPM for the two samples are given in Panel B of Table 9. The

largest pricing error is again smaller than 0.05 percent per month.

       Predictability of returns is generally inconsistent with the CAPM. Only if (=1, or if Vih

is proportional to Vim, does Campbell’s (1996) theory collapse to a conditional CAPM. If the

static CAPM is true, the pricing errors should not be predictable with conditioning information.

We test this predictability restriction by examining the additional orthogonality conditions that

the asset-pricing errors from the CAPM model should be orthogonal to zt . Since there are seven

assets, five elements in zt , and no additional parameters to estimate, we can calculate a P2 (35)

statistic directly from the value of the GMM objective function for these thirty-five orthogonality

conditions. The value of this statistic is 69.553, with a p-value of 0.0005. This indicates

considerable evidence against the static CAPM.

       Of course, we also did not require the pricing errors of the dynamic model to be

orthogonal to the zt information set. When we calculate the analogous P2 (35) statistic for these

restrictions on the dynamic model, we find a test statistic of 178.87, with a p-value smaller than

.00001. Thus, the dynamic model also fails this test of dynamic asset pricing.

High Book-to-Market Returns

       Fama and French (1998) further demonstrate the inadequacy of the static international

CAPM by constructing portfolios of stocks for each country based on book-to-market ratios. 8

They find that portfolios with high book-to-market (HBM) ratios are particularly troublesome for

the CAPM to price. The average returns on high book-to-market firms are significantly higher

than those predicted by the CAPM. Our version of these results is presented in Table 10, which

excludes Canada because of data availability. Notice that the average adjusted returns on the

HBM portfolios are considerably higher than the returns on the value-weighted MSCI market




                                                22
portfolios, except in the case of Italy. For example, the average adjusted return for the German

HBM portfolio is 0.213 percent per month higher than the German market portfolio. For the

U.K. the incremental value is 0.369. Table 9 indicates that this range is also the magnitude of the

pricing errors from the CAPM, as well. The estimation uses the estimated value of ( from the

analogous sample for the CAPM estimation with the country market portfolios, and the mean

parameters for the HBM return equations are estimated prior to examining the pricing equations.

       Table 11 examines whether the dynamic model can successfully price the HBM country

portfolios. The answer here, too, is negative. The pricing errors from the dynamic model are

approximately equal to the pricing errors from the CAPM.

VII. Conclusions

       This paper develops the implications of stock-return predictability for cross-sectional

international asset pricing using the framework developed by Campbell (1996). The dynamic

model explains the average returns on the dollar-denominated excess returns on the market

portfolios of the G7 countries quite well, but the static CAPM does also. The hedging terms of

the dynamic model are non-zero, yet we are unable to reject that they are proportional to

covariances with the market portfolio, in which case they have no direct role in the cross-

sectional international asset pricing.   Because the static CAPM is inconsistent with return

predictability, which exists in the data, our specification tests demonstrate that instrumental

variables can predict the asset-pricing errors from the static CAPM. Unfortunately, these same

specification tests reveal that the dynamic model fails along the same dimensions. Neither

model can price the high book-to-market country portfolios that Fama and French (1998)

construct.




                                                23
        A rational explanation of the data requires a bridge between the intertemporal

predictability of international equity returns and the cross-section of asset returns. Harvey

(1991) and Ferson and Harvey (1993) develop an eclectic, empirical approach. Harvey (1991)

postulates a conditional CAPM, and Ferson and Harvey (1993) develop conditional beta-pricing

models in which expected returns equal the sum of several betas times their associated prices of

risks. They allow the betas to vary over time depending on local information, but they require

the prices of risks to vary only with global information. The problem with such approaches is

that they are not tightly linked to theory.

        Fama and French (1996) argue that the static CAPM is flawed, but they develop multi-

factor explanations of the data. In domestic U.S. asset pricing, they allow expected returns to

depend on sensitivities of returns to three factors. The first is the excess return on a broad

market portfolio. The second is the difference between the return on a portfolio of small-

capitalization stocks and the return on a portfolio of large-capitalization stocks. The third is the

difference between the return on a portfolio of high book-to-market stocks and the return on a

portfolio of low book-to-market stocks. For international asset pricing, Fama and French (1998)

use two factors: the excess return on the world market portfolio, and the difference in returns

between the world high and low book-to-market portfolios. Since the Fama-French (1998)

model successfully prices the problematic returns on high book-to-market country portfolios, a

risk-based theoretical explanation for the presence of the second risk factor seems plausible.

But, Fama and French (1998) note that their tests do not cleanly identify the consumption-

investment state variables that would link their analysis to intertemporal asset-pricing theories.

        The Campbell (1996) model provides a tight theoretical framework that allows us to test

the implications of a truly dynamic asset-pricing model of international equity returns. We




                                                 24
demonstrate that this particular dynamic model provides only a marginal improvement over the

static CAPM. Our extension of the model to price international assets involves some strong

assumptions. Perhaps the strongest is the assumption of a representative international investor.

Adler and Dumas (1983) note that failure of purchasing power parity implies that an

international representative investor does not exist. They demonstrate that in such a world

expected equity returns depend on hedging terms involving foreign exchange rates. Vassalou

(1997) provides some tests of unconditional restrictions implied by this approach by developing

indexes of exchange rates and inflation rates. She finds support for the pricing of foreign

exchange risk in equity returns. Dumas and Solnik (1995) postulate a version of the Adler-

Dumas model that allows time-varying world prices of foreign-exchange risk that are postulated

to depend on the conditioning information of the econometrician. They, too, find that

conditioning information is important and that foreign-exchange risk is priced. De Santis and

Gerard (1998) develop tests of the Adler-Dumas model using a conditional approach that

estimates parametric conditional means and covariances. Since there is strong evidence against

purchasing power parity, modifying the model to allow for different real returns in different

countries is an extension that we are pursuing.

       Another weakness of our approach is its assumption that the value-weighted real stock

return correctly measures the return on real wealth. Both Jagannathan and Wang (1996) and

Campbell (1996) stress the importance of labor income and human capital in asset pricing.

While Jagannathan and Wang (1996) and Campbell (1996) treat labor income as tradeable in a

domestic asset-pricing context, such an assumption appears untenable in a multicountry model.

Unfortunately, the required extension of the Campbell (1996) model to allow non-traded human

wealth in different countries appears non-trivial.




                                                  25
       As Flood, Hodrick, and Kaplan (1986) note, asset return predictability is not inconsistent

with rational, maximizing behavior.       Indeed, modern asset-pricing theories link this return

predictability to hedging motives of investors. Different sensitivities of asset returns to the

underlying state variables that generate time-varying market returns cause risk premiums on the

assets to differ. This paper investigates the links between return predictability and the cross-

section of country returns. Hedging demands may play a role in cross-sectional asset pricing, but

there are still many puzzles that remain to be investigated.

Panel A contains a five variable VAR in the real return on the MSCI world market portfolio (RRET), the logarithm
of dividends relative to earnings (LOGDE), the logarithm of the dividend-price ratio (LOGDP), the one-month
Treasury bill interest rate minus its twelve-month moving average (RREL), and the 30-year minus one-year
Treasury bond term spread (TSPD). The sample period is 1970:01 to 1998:04. Regressions in Panel B project
excess dollar returns on the G7 countries onto the same information set as the VAR. The joint predictability test
examines the predictive power of the five lagged variables. The Cumby-Huizinga (1992) L-test is a joint test that
the first eight autocorrelations of the residuals are all zero.

This table compares equity return forecasting equations using quarterly data. The first three rows use data
from Lamont (1998), and the dependent variable is the excess return on the S&P 500. The last three rows
use excess return data from the MSCI-US or the MSCI-World indexes. For Lamont’s data, the regressors
are the lagged excess return (RET), the logarithm of S&P dividends relative to S&P earnings (LOGDE),
the logarithm of the S&P dividend-price ratio (LOGDP), the one-month Treasury bill interest rate minus
its twelve-month moving average sampled at the end of the quarter (RREL), and the long-term
government bond yield minus the T-bill yield (TSPD). For the MSCI regressions, the regressors are the
lagged MSCI return (RET), the logarithm of MSCI dividends relative to MSCI earnings (LOGDE), the
logarithm of the MSCI dividend-price ratio (LOGDP), the three-month Treasury bill interest rate minus
its four-quarter moving average (RREL), and the 30-year minus one-year Treasury bond term spread
(TSPD).

                         Table 5: Innovations to the Long-Run Stock Return

Panel A reports the coefficients of the vector defining the innovation in the discounted present value of
the future world stock market returns in equation (11). The variables of the VAR are the real return on the
MSCI world market portfolio (RRET), the logarithm of dividends relative to earnings (LOGDE), the
logarithm of the dividend-price ratio (LOGDP), the one-month Treasury bill interest rate minus its
twelve-month moving average (RREL), and the 30-year minus one-year Treasury bond term spread
(TSPD). The sample period is 1970:01 to 1998:04. The P2 (5) test examines whether the five coefficients
are jointly equal to zero. The second set of coefficients is orthogonalized by triangularizing the
innovations and scaling them to have the same variance as the innovation in the real return. Panel B
reports the covariances and correlation (in bold) of the innovation in the real return and the innovation in
the discounted expected future returns.

          Table 8: Pricing Components and Errors from the Dynamic Asset Pricing Model

This table reports the average adjusted percentage monthly excess rates of return, defined in equation
(19), for the seven countries for two samples. The first is our base sample of 1970:01 to 1998:04, and the
second is a sub-sample from 1975:01 to 1995:12, which is used by Fama and French (1998). The pricing
model predicts that the average adjusted return contains two parts: a part corresponding to covariance
with the market portfolio, (Vi,m, and a part corresponding to covariance with the innovation in discounted
expected future returns, (( - 1)Vi,h. The pricing error is the difference between the data and the model’s
prediction.

        Table 9: Estimation, Pricing Components and Pricing Errors from the Static CAPM

This table contains the parameter estimates from the static CAPM pricing model. Panel A reports the
parameters from equation (20) and the test of the model’s six overidentifying conditions. Panel B reports
the average adjusted percentage monthly excess rates of return, defined in equation (19), for the seven
countries for two samples. The first is our base sample of 1970:01 to 1998:04, and the second is a sub-
sample from 1975:01 to 1995:12, which is used by Fama and French (1998). The pricing model predicts
that the average adjusted return is explained by covariance of a return with the return on market portfolio,
(Vi,m. The pricing error is the difference between the data and the model’s prediction.

1
    Hodrick (1981) and Stulz (1981) extended the Merton (1973) analysis to develop international,

intertemporal asset pricing models.
2
     The model also incorporates human capital as an additional asset.
3
     The Euler equation approach of Hansen and Singleton (1982) provided researchers with

econometric tools that allowed tests of models in which expected returns on stocks were allowed

to fluctuate, but the approach requires correct specification of a representative agent’s utility

function and direct observations on the consumption of this agent. Both aspects are problematic.
4
    Campbell (1996) also allows for an additional factor in the asset-pricing model related to

human wealth. He argues that the return on the real wealth portfolio is appropriately measured

as the value-weighted sum of the return on assets and the return on human wealth. Jagannathan

and Wang (1996) also include labor income in their analysis. While there may be an asset-

pricing role for labor income, in a global economy the variable would have to be some measure

of the world’s labor income. We have made no attempt to measure such a variable.

5   Chang and Hung (1999) independently develop an international version of Campbell’s (1996)

model allowing for time-varying conditional second moments.
6
    While it is tempting to substitute F = 1 in equation (7) and conclude that intertemporal

considerations are not important in this case, which would imply that equation (9) is wrong, the

correct derivation follows Giovannini and Weil (1989) who note that L’Hopital’s rule must be

applied because θ → 4 as σ → 1.
