Optimal Fiscal Policy without Commitment: Beyond Lucas-Stokey

                                             ABSTRACT

According to the Lucas-Stokey result, a government can structure its debt maturity to guarantee commitment
to optimal fiscal policy by future governments. In this paper, we overturn this conclusion, showing
that it does not generally hold in the same model and under the same definition of time-consistency
as in Lucas-Stokey. Our argument rests on the existence of an overlooked commitment problem that
cannot be remedied with debt maturity: a government in the future will not tax on the downward slopping
side of the Laffer curve, even if it is ex-ante optimal to do so. In light of this finding, we propose a
new framework to characterize time-consistent policy. We consider a Markov Perfect Competitive
Equilibrium, where a government reoptimizes sequentially and may deviate from the optimal commitment
policy. We find that, in a deterministic economy, any stationary distribution of debt maturity must
be flat, with the government owing the same amount at all future dates.

1     Introduction
In a seminal paper, Lucas and Stokey (1983) consider a closed economy with no capital
in which the government finances exogenous spending with taxes and debt. They argue
that if the government can issue a sufficiently rich maturity of bonds, then the optimal
policy is time-consistent. That is, if given the opportunity to reevaluate policy ex-post,
the government would choose the ex-ante optimal policy. This result has led to a large
literature that builds on this analysis, such as Alvarez et al. (2004), Persson et al. (2006),
and Debortoli et al. (2017), among others.
    In this paper, we overturn this conclusion, showing that it does not generally hold in
the same model and under the same definition of time-consistency as in Lucas-Stokey.
Our argument rests on a simple example in which a commitment problem arises that
cannot be remedied with debt maturity. In this example, the government wants to roll
over some initial short-term debt. If initial debt is small enough, optimal policy under
commitment requires future governments to choose low tax rates on the upward sloping
portion of the Laffer curve, and the policy is time-consistent. In contrast, and more
interestingly, if initial debt is large enough, optimal policy under commitment requires
future governments to choose high tax rates on the downward sloping portion of the Laffer
curve. This is optimal ex-ante since the reduction in future consumption decreases short-
term interest rates today, allowing today’s government to roll over debt at a lower cost.
However, a problem arises since the government tomorrow strictly prefers to repay any
rolled over debt with a lower tax rate on the upward sloping portion of the Laffer curve,
as this maximizes consumption and welfare ex-post. Therefore, the optimal policy under
commitment cannot be sustained under lack of commitment: the government in the future
would never choose the preferred future tax rate of the government today, independently
of the inherited government debt maturity.
    Our argument does not rely on the presence of non-concavities in the government’s
program and multiplicity of solutions at any date. Our example uses commonly applied
isoelastic preferences in which the program is concave and the constraint set is convex at
all dates. We show that under these preferences, the Lucas-Stokey procedure for guar-
anteeing time-consistency need not always work. More specifically, the procedure takes
the optimal commitment allocation and then selects a sequence of debt portfolios and
Lagrange multipliers (on future governments’ budget constraints) to satisfy future gov-
ernments’ first order conditions under this allocation. Assuming future debt portfolios are
positive at all maturities, this procedure guarantees time-consistency if the constructed
future Lagrange multipliers are all positive. However, the procedure is invalid if some

                                              1
constructed multipliers are negative, since the shadow cost of debt cannot be negative
along the equilibrium path. When the constructed multiplier is negative, today’s govern-
ment and the future government disagree as to which tax rate should be chosen to satisfy
the future budget constraint, and optimal policy is not time-consistent. From a practical
viewpoint, this observation means that implementation of the Lucas-Stokey procedure to
guarantee time-consistency may be valid, but it must be checked quantitatively. In some
economies, the procedure works, whereas in others—like in our example—it does not.1
    Given the limitations of the Lucas-Stokey analysis, we propose an alternative approach
to studying fiscal policy under lack of commitment. Rather than analyzing whether the
optimal commitment policy survives a one-time future reoptimization, as in Lucas-Stokey,
we characterize the Markov Perfect Competitive Equilibrium (MPCE). In our setup, the
government without commitment chooses taxes and debt at every date, taking into ac-
count how current policy affects the price of bonds through expectations of future policy.
Moreover, the government may decide not to follow the optimal commitment policy. We
characterize the entire set of MPCE’s in a deterministic economy, including those with
potentially discontinuous policy functions both on and off the equilibrium path.2 Since we
allow for any unconstrained structure of maturity issuance, the payoff relevant state—the
government’s portfolio of inherited maturities—is an infinite-dimensional and potentially
complicated object. We focus our attention on the stationary maturity distribution that
emerges when the inherited portfolio of maturities equals the issued portfolio.
    Our main result is that any stationary maturity distribution under lack of commitment
must be flat, with the government owing the same amount at all future dates. The fact
that a flat maturity distribution is stationary is not surprising. Under a flat maturity
distribution, the government lacking commitment can choose a tax rate to repay the debt
immediately due without rebalancing its portfolio. The chosen tax rate coincides with the
optimum under full commitment, and therefore maximizes government’s welfare. What
is less obvious is why no other maturity distribution is stationary. The reason is that a
government that inherits a non-flat maturity distribution would always take advantage
of the situation to front-load or back-load taxes in order to change interest rates. When
the government does this, the issued maturity distribution does not coincide with the
inherited one, implying that the inherited distribution is not stationary.
    For example, suppose that the government inherits more long-term liabilities than
   1
     Our example suggests that validation should depend intuitively on the extent to which optimal taxes
are on the downward sloping part of the Laffer curve. See Trabandt and Uhlig (2011) for quantitative
work analyzing the shape of the Laffer curve in advanced economies.
   2
     In this regard, our approach is similar in spirit to that of Cao and Werning (2018) in their analysis
of Markov equilibria in the hyperbolic consumption model.


                                                    2
short-term ones. Rather than issue the same maturity distribution as the inherited one,
the government can change taxes so as to increase short-term interest rates. This re-
laxes the government budget constraint by decreasing the market value of outstanding
long-term liabilities, making the government strictly better off. The opposite is true if
the government inherits more short-term liabilities than long-term ones. In this case, a
policy that decreases short-term interest rates makes the government strictly better off
by increasing the market value of newly issued liabilities.
    We apply this simple logic to analyze the behavior of the government inheriting any
infinite-dimensional maturity distribution. We show that only if the inherited maturity
distribution is flat is the government unable to take advantage of imbalances in debt
positions to relax its budget constraint. As such, any stationary maturity distribution
must be flat.
    Our analysis thus provides a theoretical argument for the use of consols in debt man-
agement based on the sequential optimization of fiscal policy by the government. The use
of consols has been pursued historically, most notably by the British government during
the Industrial Revolution, when consols were the largest component of the British govern-
ment’s debt (see Mokyr, 2011). Moreover, the introduction of consols has been discussed
as a potential option in the management of U.S. government debt (e.g. Cochrane, 2015).
    Related Literature
    The main contribution of this paper is to highlight the limitations of the Lucas-Stokey
analysis, and to offer an alternative approach to the study of optimal fiscal policy under
lack of commitment. Our work also contributes to a literature on optimal government debt
maturity in the absence of government commitment. We depart from this literature in
two ways. First, we consider the optimal maturity without imposing arbitrary constraints
on the bonds available to the government.3 Second, our model is most applicable to
economies where the risk of default and surprise in inflation are not salient, but the
government is still not committed to a path of taxes and debt maturity issuance.4 In this
regard, our paper is related to the quantitative analysis of Debortoli et al. (2017). We
differ from this work in two respects. First, we do not arbitrarily confine the set of bonds
available to the government, as they do. Second, we consider a deterministic economy and
   3
      Krusell et al. (2006) and Debortoli and Nunes (2013) consider a similar environment to ours in the
absence of commitment, but with only one-period bonds, for example.
    4
      Other work considers optimal government debt maturity in the presence of default risk, for example,
Aguiar et al. (2017), Arellano and Ramanarayanan (2012), Dovis (2019), Fernandez and Martin (2015),
and Niepelt (2014), among others. Bocola and Dovis (2016) additionally consider the presence of liquidity
risk. Bigio et al. (2017) consider debt maturity in the presence of transactions costs. Arellano et al. (2013)
consider lack of commitment when surprise inflation is possible.

ignore the presence of shocks.5 These two departures allow us to achieve exact theoretical
characterization of the stationary maturity distribution. Our finding that the maturity
distribution is exactly flat is consistent with their quantitative result that the maturity
distribution is approximately flat.
    Our paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we describe the model. In Section
3, we show that the availability of rich debt maturities does not guarantee the time-
consistency of optimal policy, using the same definition of time-consistency as in Lucas-
Stokey. In Section 4, we move beyond Lucas-Stokey and formally define an MPCE. Section
5 establishes that any stationary maturity distribution under lack of commitment is flat.
Section 6 concludes, and the Appendix provides all of the proofs and additional results
not included in the text.


2       Model

2.1     Environment
We consider an economy identical to the deterministic case of Lucas-Stokey. There are
discrete time periods t = {0, 1, ..., ∞}. The resource constraint of the economy is

                                                ct + g = nt ,                                        (1)

where ct is consumption, nt is labor, and g > 0 is government spending, which is exogenous
and constant over time.
   There is a continuum of mass 1 of identical households that derive the following utility:
                                    ∞
                                    X
                                           β t u (ct , nt ) , β ∈ (0, 1) .                           (2)
                                     t=0


u (·) is strictly increasing in consumption, strictly decreasing in labor, globally concave,
and continuously differentiable. We also assume that ucc (c, c+g)+ucn (c, c+g) < 0 so that
the marginal utility of consumption is decreasing in consumption in general equilibrium.
                                                                     
As a benchmark, we define the first best consumption and labor cf b , nf b as the values
of consumption and labor that maximize u (ct , nt ) subject to the resource constraint (1).
    Household wages equal the marginal product of labor (which is 1 unit of consumption),
    5
     Angeletos (2002), Bhandari et al. (2017), Buera and Nicolini (2004), Faraglia et al. (2010), Guibaud
et al. (2013), and Lustig et al. (2008) also consider optimal government debt maturity in the presence of
shocks, but they assume full commitment.

a representative household at t, which is a promise to repay 1 unit of consumption at
t + k > t. qt,k is the bond price at t. At every t, the household’s allocation and portfolio
  ct , nt , {bt,k }∞

                   k=1 must satisfy the household’s dynamic budget constraint:

                              ∞
                              X
                       ct +         qt,k (bt,k − bt−1,k+1 ) = (1 − τt ) nt + bt−1,1 .               (3)
                              k=1


Bt,k R 0 represents debt issued by the government at t with a promise to repay 1 unit of
consumption at t + k > t. At every t, government policies τt , gt , {Bt,k }∞

                                                                           k=1 must satisfy
the government’s dynamic budget constraint:
                                                    ∞
                                                    X
                         gt + Bt−1,1 = τt nt +            qt,k (Bt,k − Bt−1,k+1 ) .6                (4)
                                                    k=1


   The economy is closed, which means that the bonds issued by the government equal
the bonds purchased by households:

                                             bt,k = Bt,k ∀t, k.                                     (5)

   Initial debt {B−1,k }∞             ∞
                        k=1 = {b−1,k }k=1 is exogenous. We assume that there exist debt
limits to prevent Ponzi schemes:
                                                   
                                            bt,k ∈ b, b ∀t, k.                                      (6)

In our recursive analysis, we will consider economies where these limits are not binding
along the equilibrium path. The government is benevolent and shares the same preferences
as the households in (2).
   6
    We follow the same exposition as in Angeletos (2002) in which the government rebalances its debt
in every period by buying back all outstanding debt and then issuing fresh debt at all maturities. This
is without loss of generality. For example, if the government at t − k issues debt due at date t of size
Bt−k,k which it then holds to maturity without issuing additional debt, then all future governments at
date t − k + l for l = 1, ..., k − 1 will choose Bt−k+l,k−l = Bt−k,k , implying that Bt−1,1 = Bt−k,k .

2.2      Primal Approach
We follow Lucas-Stokey by taking the primal approach to the characterization of compet-
itive equilibria, since this allows us to abstract away from bond prices and taxes. Let

                                                      {ct , nt }∞
                                                                t=0                                                 (7)

represent a sequence of consumption and labor allocations. We can establish necessary
and sufficient conditions for (7) to constitute a competitive equilibrium. The household’s
optimization problem implies the following intratemporal and intertemporal conditions,
respectively:
                                 un (ct , nt )            β k uc (ct+k , nt+k )
                     1 − τt = −                and qt,k =                       .      (8)
                                 uc (ct , nt )                 uc (ct , nt )
Substitution of these conditions into the household’s dynamic budget constraint implies
the following condition:
                                         ∞
                                         X                                    ∞
                                                                              X
 uc (ct , nt ) ct + un (ct , nt ) nt +         β k uc (ct+k , nt+k ) bt,k =         β k uc (ct+k , nt+k ) bt−1,k+1 . (9)
                                         k=1                                  k=0


Forward substitution into the above equation and taking into account the absence of Ponzi
schemes implies the following implementability condition:
   ∞
   X                                                                    ∞
                                                                        X
         β k (uc (ct+k , nt+k ) ct+k + un (ct+k , nt+k ) nt+k ) =             β k uc (ct+k , nt+k ) bt−1,k+1 .    (10)
   k=0                                                                  k=0


By this reasoning, if a sequence in (7) is generated by a competitive equilibrium, then
it necessarily satisfies (1) and (10). We prove in the Appendix that the converse is also
true, which leads to the below proposition that is useful for the rest of our analysis.

Lemma 1 (competitive equilibrium) A sequence (7) is a competitive equilibrium if
and only if it satisfies (1) ∀t and (10) at t = 0 given {b−1,k }∞
                                                                k=1 .


   Note that this result rests on the fact that the satisfaction of (10) at t = 0 guarantees
the satisfaction of (10) for all future dates, since bonds can be freely chosen so as to satisfy
(10) at all future dates for any given sequence (7).

3     Lucas-Stokey Revisited
In this section, we apply the Lucas-Stokey definition of time-consistency, and we provide
an example that overturns their conclusion that the optimal policy can be made time-
consistent with the appropriate choice of maturities. We first establish that optimal policy
under commitment may require future tax rates to be on the downward sloping side of the
Laffer curve. We then show that this implies that optimal policy is not time-consistent,
despite the availability of rich maturities.


3.1    Policy under Commitment
Consider an economy with isoelastic preferences over consumption c and labor n, where

                                                            nγ
                                     u (c, n) = log c − η                                    (11)
                                                            γ

for η > 0 and γ ≥ 1, which corresponds to a utility function analyzed in Werning (2007).
    Under these preferences, (1) and (8) imply that the primary surplus, τ n − g, is equal
to c (1 − η (c + g)γ ). To facilitate the discussion, define claf f er as the level of consumption
that maximizes the primary surplus:

                             claf f er = arg max c (1 − η (c + g)γ ) .                       (12)
                                             c


claf f er is the level of consumption associated with the maximal tax revenue at the peak
                                                                       1/γ

                                                  . We assume that g < η1     to guarantee that

c          > 0. The primary surplus on the right hand side of (12) is strictly concave in c and
equals 0 if c = 0 (100 percent labor income tax) and −g if c = cf b (0 percent labor income
tax). More broadly, if c > claf f er , then the tax rate is below the revenue-maximizing
tax rate and the economy is on the upward sloping portion (left hand side) of the Laffer
curve. If c < claf f er , then the tax rate is above the revenue-maximizing tax rate and the
economy is on the downward sloping portion (right hand side) of the Laffer curve.

   Since initial debt is non-negative, the left hand side of (14)—which can be equivalently
written in relaxed form as a weak inequality constraint—is concave, implying that the
constraint set is convex. This leads to the following lemma that characterizes the unique
optimum under commitment.

  3. There exists b∗−1,1 ∈ (0, b) such that the solution admits c1 > claf f er if b−1,1 < b∗−1,1
     and c1 < claf f er if b−1,1 > b∗−1,1 .

   The first part of the lemma states that consumption—and therefore the tax rate—is
constant from date 1 onward. Since initial debt due from date 1 onward is constant (and

                                                     8
equal to zero), tax smoothing and interest rate smoothing from date 1 onward is optimal.
The second part of the lemma characterizes the solution in terms of first order conditions
for a positive Lagrange multiplier µ0 on the implementability constraint (14). These
conditions are necessary and sufficient for optimality given the concavity of the problem.
Implicit differentiation of (15) and (16), taking into account second order conditions,
implies that initial consumption c0 exceeds long-run consumption c1 , which means that
the initial tax rate is below the future tax rate. Back-loading tax rates is optimal since the
reduction in future consumption relative to present consumption allows the government
to roll over its initial short-term debt at a lower interest rate.
    The last part of the lemma states that if initial short-term debt b−1,1 is sufficiently
high, then future consumption c1 is below claf f er , implying that the future tax rate τ1 is
above the revenue-maximizing tax rate at the peak of the Laffer curve τ laf f er . This result
stems from the fact that the government under commitment accommodates increases in
initial short-term debt b−1,1 with a reduction in future consumption c1 and an increase
in the future tax rate τ1 . Mathematically, higher b−1,1 tightens the implementability
constraint (14) which increases the Lagrange multiplier µ0 on this constraint. From (16),
a higher value of µ0 leads to a lower value of c1 , and beyond a certain level b∗−1,1 , c1 declines
below claf f er and τ1 rises above τ laf f er . Conceptually, for c1 > claf f er and τ1 < τ laf f er ,
the reduction in future consumption c1 accommodates an increase in initial short-term
debt b−1,1 by increasing future revenues and decreasing short-term interest rates. Once
c1 declines beyond claf f er and τ1 rises above τ laf f er , the increase in initial short-term
debt b−1,1 is accommodated with lower short-term interest rates only. If c1 < claf f er and
τ1 > τ laf f er , the government at date 0 could instead choose a value of c1 > claf f er and
τ1 < τ laf f er yielding the same future revenue to repay its issued debt. However, doing so
is suboptimal and would lead to higher short-term interest rates, significantly reducing
the resources raised at date 0 by issuing this debt.
    A natural question regards what factors drive the value of b∗−1,1 , since a higher b∗−1,1
implies a higher debt threshold for future taxes to be on the decreasing side of the Laffer
curve. We can establish through computational examples that the value of b∗−1,1 is in-
creasing in β, decreasing in η, and increasing in γ. Intuitively, taxes are more likely to be
on the downward sloping side of the Laffer curve from date 1 onward if either the govern-
ment is impatient and cares little about future tax distortions (β is low) or if instead tax
capacity is limited and low interest rates are required to roll over initial debt (η is high
or γ is low).

3.2    Time-Consistency of Policy
We now show that the policy under commitment may not be time-consistent. We follow
Lucas-Stokey and consider what happens if at date 1, policy is reevaluated and chosen by
a government with full commitment from date 1 onward. As in Lucas-Stokey, we define an
optimal policy as time-consistent if the government at date 1 chooses the same allocation
as the government at date 0.
    Given an inherited portfolio of maturities, the government at date 1 solves the following
problem:
                                         ∞
                                                                     (ct + g)γ
                                         X                                    
                                                   t−1
                            max                β          log ct − η                    (18)
                          {ct ,nt }∞
                                   t=0
                                         t=1
                                                                         γ
                                             s.t.
                            ∞                              
                           X
                                 t−1                γ  b0,t
                               β      1 − η (ct + g) −        = 0.                      (19)
                           t=1
                                                        c t


Letting µ1 represent the Lagrange multiplier on (19), first order conditions with respect
to ct are:                                                    
                1             γ−1        b0,t              γ−1
                  − η (ct + g)    + µ1        − ηγ (ct + g)      = 0 ∀t ≥ 1.         (20)
               ct                         c2t
An optimal policy is therefore time-consistent if the solution to (18) − (19) coincides with
the solution to (13) − (14).

Proposition 1 (time-consistency of optimal policy) If b−1,1 < b∗−1,1 , then the op-
timal date 0 policy is time-consistent. If b−1,1 > b∗−1,1 , then the optimal date 0 policy is
not time-consistent.

    If b−1,1 < b∗−1,1 , then the optimal date 0 policy can be sustained under lack of commit-
ment with the government at date 0 issuing a flat maturity distribution with b0,k = b0,1
∀k ≥ 1. Under such a flat distribution, the government at date 1 optimally chooses to
smooth tax rates into the future. Moreover, given that date 1 tax rates under commit-
ment are on the upward sloping portion of the Laffer curve, the choice of such tax rates
is time-consistent. The date 0 and date 1 government agree about the optimal tax rate
to repay this debt.
    If instead b−1,1 > b∗−1,1 , then the optimal date 0 policy cannot be sustained under
lack of commitment. If the government at date 0 tried to induce the date 1 government
into a smooth policy from date 1 onward by issuing a flat maturity distribution with
b0,k = b0,1 ∀k ≥ 1, the date 1 government would never choose a value c1 < claf f er and

                                                          10
τ1 > τ laf f er and would instead repay the inherited debt with a value c1 > claf f er and
τ1 < τ laf f er . Choosing a lower tax rate on the upward sloping portion of the Laffer curve
increases consumption and increases welfare ex-post. Thus, while the date 0 government
can commit the date 1 government to a smooth path of revenue and interest rates, it
cannot commit the date 1 government to a particular tax rate. As such, the optimal date
0 policy is not time-consistent.


3.3    Why the Lucas-Stokey Argument Fails
It is instructive to consider why the original arguments of Lucas-Stokey fail in this ex-
ample. In developing their argument, Lucas-Stokey consider the optimal allocation under
commitment from the perspective of date 0, which satisfies the following first order condi-
tion for t ≥ 1 (the analog of (16) starting from any arbitrary initial maturity distribution):
                                                                            
              1                               b−1,t+1
                 − η (ct + g)γ−1 + µ0            2
                                                      − ηγ (ct + g)γ−1           = 0 ∀t ≥ 1.   (21)
              ct                                ct

   Lucas-Stokey claim that the optimal policy under commitment at date 0 that satisfies
(21) could be made time-consistent at date 1. They argue that this is possible with the
appropriate choice of maturities that satisfy the date 1 implementability condition (19)
and the date 1 first order condition (20) for some Lagrange multiplier µ1 . Their procedure
thus combines (20) and (21) to yield:
                                                                                     
                        b0,t                                   b−1,t+1
               µ1            − ηγ (ct + g)γ−1       = µ0               − ηγ (ct + g)γ−1
                                                                                          ,    (22)
                         c2t                                     c2t
which determines the issued maturity distribution at date 0 as a function of four objects:
the inherited maturity distribution, the optimal allocation, µ0 , and µ1 .
    According to Lucas-Stokey logic, given an optimal allocation and value of µ0 from
the perspective of date 0, a value of µ1 and a portfolio of bonds {b0,k }∞    k=1 that satisfy
(19) and (22) exist, and therefore, the policy is time-consistent. To see why their logic
fails, suppose for illustration that the implied values of {b0,k }∞
                                                                  k=1 are all non-negative, so
that the constraint set represented by (19) at date 1 is convex. If the implied value of
µ1 is positive, then Lucas-Stokey logic holds and the optimal policy is time-consistent. If
instead the implied value of µ1 is negative, then Lucas-Stokey logic fails and the optimal
policy is not time-consistent. Intuitively, the solution to (18) − (19) under a positive
debt portfolio {b0,k }∞k=1 would never admit a negative multiplier—since the shadow cost
of inherited debt is positive—which is why the Lucas-Stokey construction fails in this


                                                     11
case.
   Our specific example illustrates a situation in which µ1 < 0 and the Lucas-Stokey
construction fails. (19) and (22) in our example can be written as

                                b0,1 = c1 (1 − η (c1 + g)γ ) , and                          (23)
                                            
                                          µ0
                              b0,1   = 1−      ηγc21 (c1 + g)γ−1 ,                          (24)
                                          µ1
respectively, for µ0 and c1 that satisfy (15)−(17). If b−1,1 < b∗−1,1 , the solution to (23)−(24)
admits µ1 > 0, and the optimal policy is time-consistent. If instead b−1,1 > b∗−1,1 , the
solution to (23) − (24) admits µ1 < 0, and the optimal policy is not time-consistent.
    There are two important points to note regarding this example. First, our example
does not rely on the presence of non-concavities in the government’s program and mul-
tiplicity of solutions at any date. Our isoelastic preferences imply that the government’s
welfare is concave and the constraint set is convex, which guarantees that the solution
to the government’s problem at dates 0 and 1 is unique. We conjecture that considering
cases with multiplicity (for instance examples with negative debt positions, which make
the implementability condition no longer a convex constraint) could make it even more
challenging for today’s government to induce commitment by future governments.
    Second, our example does not rely on the presence of an infinite horizon, which we
only choose here to be consistent with Lucas-Stokey. A T -period version of this example
would yield the same conclusion, namely that in some cases, the optimal policy under
commitment does not coincide with that under lack of commitment. In the Appendix,
we evaluate such a finite horizon economy. We show that the same conclusions hold, and
we explicitly characterize policy under lack of commitment using backward induction in
the cases where the optimal policy is not time-consistent.


4     Markov Perfect Competitive Equilibrium
Given the limitations of the Lucas-Stokey analysis, we propose an alternative approach
to studying fiscal policy under lack of commitment. Rather than analyzing whether the
optimal commitment policy survives a one-time future reoptimization, we characterize
the MPCE in which the government without commitment chooses taxes and debt at
every date, taking into account how current policy affects the price of bonds through
expectations of future policy. Such a government without commitment may not choose
the optimal commitment policy. In this section, we formally define our equilibrium, and


                                                12
then, using the primal approach, we provide a recursive representation of the equilibrium.


4.1    Equilibrium Definition
Formally, let Bt ≡ {Bt,k }∞                       ∞
                              k=1 and qt ≡ {qt,k }k=1 . In every period t, the government
chooses a policy {τt , Bt } given Bt−1 . Households then choose an allocation and portfolio
  ct , nt , {bt,k }∞

                   k=1 . An MPCE consists of: a government strategy ρ (Bt−1 ) which is a
function of Bt−1 ; a household allocation and portfolio strategy ω (Bt−1 , ρt , qt ) which is a
function of Bt−1 , the government policy ρt = ρ (Bt−1 ), and bond prices qt ; and a set of
                                         ∞
bond pricing functions ϕk (Bt−1 , ρt ) k=1 with qt,k = ϕk (Bt−1 , ρt ) ∀k ≥ 1 which depend
on Bt−1 and the government policy ρt = ρ (Bt−1 ). In an MPCE, these objects must satisfy
the following conditions ∀t:

  1. The government strategy ρ (·) maximizes (2) given ω (·), ϕk (·) ∀k ≥ 1, and the

4.2    Recursive Representation
Given our definition, an MPCE is characterized by an equilibrium consumption and labor
                                                             ∞
sequence (7) and an equilibrium debt sequence {bt,k }∞
                                                 
                                                       k=1 t=0 , where each element at
date t depends on history only through Bt−1 , the payoff relevant variables. Given this
observation, in an MPCE, one can define a function hk (·)

                               hk (Bt ) = β k uc (ct+k , nt+k ) |Bt                       (25)

for k ≥ 1, which equals the discounted marginal utility of consumption at t + k given Bt
at t. This function is useful since, in choosing Bt at date t, the government must take
into account how it affects future expectations of policy, which in turn affect current bond
prices through expected future marginal utility of consumption.
    Note that choosing {τt , Bt } at date t from the perspective of the government is
equivalent to choosing {ct , nt , Bt } where one can write, with some abuse of notation,
Bt = {bt,k }∞
            k=1 , and this follows from the primal approach delineated in Section 2.2. Re-
moving the time subscript and defining B ≡ Bt−1 = {bk }∞    k=1 as the inherited portfolio of



                                               13
bonds, we can write the government’s problem recursively as

                               V (B) = max0 u (c, n) + βV (B0 )                         (26)

                                         c + g = n, and                                 (27)
                                                        ∞
                                                        X
             uc (c, n) c + un (c, n) n − uc (c, n) b1 +   hk (B0 ) (b0k − bk+1 ) = 0,   (28)
                                                        k=1


where (28) is a recursive representation of (9). Let f (B) correspond to the solution to
(26) − (28) given V (·) and hk (·) ∀k ≥ 1. It therefore follows that the function f (·)
necessarily implies functions hk (·) ∀k ≥ 1 which satisfy (25). An MPCE is therefore
composed of functions V (·), f (·), and hk (·) ∀k ≥ 1 that are consistent with one another
and satisfy (25) − (28).


5     Stationary Distribution of Debt Maturity
We focus on characterizing an economy in which the debt maturity distribution is station-
ary with bt+1,k = bt,k , ∀t, k, so that government debt maturity is time-invariant. Given the
Markovian structure of the solution to the MPCE defined by (26)−(28), such a stationary
maturity distribution is associated with tax rates, consumption, and interest rates that
are constant over time. In this section, we show that any stationary maturity distribution
must be flat, with the government owing the same amount of resources to the private
sector at all future dates. To establish this result, we first impose a useful assumption in
Section 5.1. In Section 5.2, we use this assumption show that a flat maturity distribution
is stationary. Finally, in Section 5.3, we show that no other maturity distribution can be
stationary.


5.1    Preliminaries
Before proceeding with our analysis, we impose a useful assumption. Using our recursive
notation introduced in Section 4, define W ({bk }∞

                                                                    ∞

                 k=0                                                       k=0


    Given Lemma 1, the program in (29)−(31) corresponds to that of a government under
full commitment with b−1,k = bk+1 .
                                                                                        
    Assumption 1. Consider the solution to (29)−(31) with bk+1 = b ∀k ≥ 0. ∀b ∈ b, b ,
if the solution exists, then the solution is unique and admits {ck , nk } = {c∗ (b) , n∗ (b)}
∀k ≥ 0, where

            uc (c∗ (b) , n∗ (b)) c∗ (b) + un (c∗ (b) , n∗ (b)) n∗ (b) = uc (c∗ (b) , n∗ (b)) b,             (32)
                                         and c∗ (b) + g = n∗ (b) .                                          (33)

    This assumption states that if a government under full commitment is faced with a flat
maturity distribution, then there is a unique optimum in which the government chooses a
constant allocation of consumption and labor in the future.7 This assumption is intuitive.
Under a flat maturity distribution, every time period in the program in (29) − (31) is
identical in the objective function and in the constraint set, which suggests that the
optimal solution is a time-invariant allocation. A sufficient condition for Assumption 1 is
that the function uc (c, c + g) (c − b) + un (c, c + g) (c + g) is concave in c for all b, which
is the case, for example, if the utility function satisfies (11) as in our example in Section
3 and if b = 0 so that debt is non-negative.


5.2     Flat Maturity Distribution is Stationary
We begin by establishing that if the maturity distribution is flat, then it is stationary.
                                                        
Lemma 3 Suppose that B satisfies bk = b ∀k for some b ∈ b, b . Then,

   1. In all solutions to (26) − (28), c = c∗ (b) and n = n∗ (b), and
   7
    Assumption 1 requires that the solution exists. If the upper bound on individual maturities b exceeds
the highest primary surplus that can be raised at the peak of the Laffer curve, then there is no solution
under a flat maturity for some high values of debt.

                                                         15
  2. There exists a solution to (26) − (28) that admits b0k = b ∀k.

    The first part of the lemma states that in any MPCE, if the government inherits a flat
maturity distribution with bk = b ∀k, then the unique optimal response of the govern-
ment is to choose consumption and labor that coincide with the commitment optimum.
The second part of the lemma implies that one optimal—but not necessarily uniquely
optimal—strategy for the government is to choose b0k = b ∀k so that debt is not rebal-
anced and the maturity distribution continues to be flat in the future. As such, there
exists a stationary MPCE with a flat maturity distribution. Importantly, this lemma
implies that in any MPCE for which B is a flat maturity distribution, it is necessary that

                                      V (B) = W (B)                                     (34)

so that there is no welfare loss for the present government due to lack of commitment by
future governments.
    The logic behind this lemma is that a government inheriting a flat maturity distribu-
tion with bk = b ∀k can always decide to not rebalance its debt portfolio and to choose
the tax rate associated with {c∗ (b) , n∗ (b)}. Forward induction on this observation com-
bined with Assumption 1 means that the government is able to achieve the commitment
optimum with this strategy while inducing allocation {c∗ (b) , n∗ (b)} in all future periods.
Note that the government can induce the commitment allocation in the future in any
MPCE, including those where the government’s continuation strategy off the equilibrium
path given off equilibrium maturities does not coincide with the commitment solution.


5.3    No Other Maturity Distribution is Stationary
We now turn to the possibility that another maturity distribution is stationary. We show
in this section that this is not possible by contradiction using an induction argument. The
first step of the induction argument establishes that if a non-flat maturity distribution
were stationary, then the debt immediately due, b1 , would be necessarily equal to the
primary surplus. The second step of the induction argument establishes that if a non-flat
maturity distribution were stationary with bk equal to the primary surplus for all k ≤ m,
then bm+1 would necessarily be equal to the primary surplus. It follows then by induction
that bk equals the primary surplus for all maturities k and that the maturity distribution
is flat, leading to a contradiction.
     To pursue this induction argument, we establish a preliminary result that allows us
to construct perturbations as part of the induction argument. To interpret this lemma,

                                             16
observe that since consumption is constant over time under a stationary maturity distri-
bution, the price of a bond maturing in k periods is β k .

Lemma 4 Suppose that given B, there exists a solution to (26) − (28) with a stationary
maturity distribution b0k = bk ∀k and b0l 6= b0m for some l, m. Then there exists another
solution to (26) − (28) with b0k = bb ∀k where
                                         ∞
                                         X
                                  bb =         β k−1 (1 − β) bk .                       (35)
                                         k=1


    This lemma states that under any MPCE with a stationary maturity distribution
that is not flat, the government can choose the same tax rate but issue a flat maturity
distribution with the same market value and achieve the same welfare. The proof of
this lemma is facilitated by Lemma 3, which characterizes the continuation equilibrium
following this choice of a flat maturity. Since current and future taxes and consumption
remain unchanged from the issuance of a flat maturity, bond prices and welfare are also
unchanged.
    Lemma 4 implies that if there exists a stationary maturity distribution that is not flat,
then the corresponding welfare is equal to that achieved under a flat maturity distribution
with the same market value. Moreover, from (34), welfare under this MPCE equals that
under commitment associated with a flat maturity distribution with the same market
value:
                                                        u(c(bb), n(bb))
                       V (B) = W ({bk }∞    ) |
                                         k=1 bk =b ∀k =                 .               (36)
                                                           1−β
                                                 b


    Lemma 4 is useful since it characterizes welfare under a stationary maturity distribu-
tion that is not flat. Moreover, it allows us to consider off-equilibrium welfare following a
deviation in maturity issuance strategy by the government, which is useful for establishing
the first step of our induction argument in the next lemma.

Lemma 5 Suppose that given B, there exists a solution to (26) − (28) with a stationary
maturity distribution b0k = bk ∀k and for which {c, n} 6= cf b , nf b . Then, B must satisfy
                                                         

b1 = bb for bb defined in (35).

    This lemma states that in any stationary maturity distribution in which the tax rate
is not zero (so that consumption and labor do not equal the first best), short-term debt
b1 equals the annuitized value of total debt bb. Therefore, the primary surplus equals the
short-term debt b1 and net debt issuance is zero.


                                                  17
    The proof rests on showing that if the primary surplus is in excess of, or below,
this short-term debt b1 , then the government can pursue a deviation from a smooth
consumption path to boost welfare. For example, if the primary surplus is in excess
of what the government immediately owes, then pursuit of a smooth consumption path
would require the government to buy back some of its long-term debt. Rather than
following a stationary debt issuance strategy, the government can back-load consumption
to increase short-term interest rates and reduce the value of the long-term debt which it
buys back. Since the deviation is beneficial, the maintenance of a stationary debt maturity
distribution is not optimal if the primary surplus exceeds b1 .
    If instead the primary surplus is below what the government immediately owes, then
pursuit of a smooth consumption path would require the government to issue fresh debt in
order to repay current short-term debt. Rather than following a stationary debt issuance
strategy, the government can front-load consumption to decrease short-term interest rates
and increase the value of newly issued debt. Since the deviation is beneficial, the mainte-
nance of a stationary debt maturity distribution is not optimal if the primary surplus is
below b1 .
    Note that in constructing these deviations, we utilize Lemmas 3 and 4 which allow
us to characterize the change in welfare if the government issues a flat government debt
maturity today as part of its deviation. As such, we can explicitly show that these
deviations increase welfare by relaxing the government’s budget constraint.
    Note that the reason why our argument does not hold under a stationary distribution
of debt maturities with zero taxes is that in this case, it is not possible to relax the
government budget constraint further.
    We now use analogous arguments to establish the second step of the induction argu-
ment.

Lemma 6 Suppose that given B, there exists a solution to (26) − (28) with a stationary
maturity distribution b0k = bk ∀k and for which {c, n} 6= cf b , nf b . If bl = bb ∀l ≤ m, then
                                                         

B must satisfy bm+1 = bb for bb defined in (35).

   This lemma considers the stationary maturity distribution when all bond maturities
below m equal the primary surplus of the government (the annuitized value of government
debt). When this is the case, then the bond of maturity m+1 must also equal the primary
surplus of the government.
   The argument, which relies on a proof by contradiction, starts from the fact that
under a stationary maturity distribution, government’s welfare satisfies (36), and thus
equals welfare under commitment with a flat maturity distribution with the same market

                                              18
value. Now if the amount owed at date m + 1 does not also equal the primary surplus,
then there exists a feasible deviation from a stationary debt issuance strategy that can
increase welfare above (36), leading to a contradiction.
    More specifically, if bl = bb ∀l ≤ m but bm+1 6= bb, a feasible strategy for the gov-
ernment today is to continue to choose the same consumption and labor allocation today
{c(bb), n(bb)} but to deviate by not retrading the inherited maturities (i.e., letting the bonds
mature to next period). Such a deviation is feasible whatever the expectations of future
policy and their impact on current bond prices since the government is not rebalancing
its portfolio.
    Without needing to specify the exact form of the continuation equilibrium, we can show
that this deviation must necessarily increase welfare. The argument rests on putting a
lower bound on the welfare of future governments following the deviation based on the
feasible policies at their disposal. More specifically, note that after the initial deviation,
future governments also have the opportunity to pursue the same strategy of choosing
consumption and labor equal to {c(bb), n(bb)} and not rebalancing the portfolio of maturi-
ties. This is true up until some future date m periods in the future. Based on this logic,
the welfare of the government today from pursuing the deviation must weakly exceed

                             m−1
                             X
                                    β l u(c(bb), n(bb)) + β m V (B
                                                                 b (m))                    (37)
                              l=0


      b (m) satisfies bb (m) = bk+m ∀k ≥ 1. Thus, for the initial deviation to be weakly
where B                     k
dominated, this requires (37) to be weakly exceeded by (36), so that

                                       b (m)) ≤ u(c(b), n(b)) .
                                                    b     b
                                    V (B                                                   (38)
                                                   1−β

However, since bm+1 6= bb, the arguments of Lemma 5 imply that (38) cannot hold, leading
to a contradiction. Intuitively, m periods into the future after following a strategy of
no rebalancing, the primary surplus is above or below the debt immediately due. At
this point in the future, pursuing a strategy that back-loads or front-loads consumption
strictly increases welfare relative to a smooth consumption policy with a stationary debt
issuance strategy. Therefore, the immediate deviation prior to reaching this m’th period is
beneficial, and the maintenance of a stationary debt maturity distribution is not optimal.

Proposition 2 (flat maturity) Suppose that conditional on B, there exists a solution
to (26) − (28) with a stationary maturity distribution b0k = bk ∀k and for which {c, n} 6=


                                                 19

    cf b , nf b . Then it is necessary that bk = bb ∀k so that the maturity distribution is flat.

    This proposition represents the main result of the paper. It states that if the maturity
distribution is stationary and if the equilibrium does not entail first best consumption and
labor, then the maturity distribution is flat. The reasoning for the proposition follows
from induction arguments which appeal to Lemmas 5 and 6. Intuitively, if maturity
distribution is not flat, then there are opportunities for the government take advantage
of these imbalances to decrease the market value of its inherited portfolio or increase the
market value of its newly-issued portfolio. Note that this result holds in any MPCE and
does not appeal to any assumptions regarding the behavior of future governments.
    Our result relies on the stationary maturity distribution not being associated with
first best consumption and labor. Under such a stationary distribution, taxes would be
zero, the market value of debt would be sufficiently negative to finance the stream of
government spending forever, and the marginal benefit of resources for the government
would be zero. For this reason, the stationary maturity distribution is not determined in
this circumstance. We can trivially rule out this case if there are exogenous bounds on
government debt which prevent such asset accumulation for the government.

Corollary 1 Suppose that b > −g. Then if conditional on B, there exists a solution to
(26) − (28) with a stationary maturity distribution b0k = bk ∀k, it is necessary that bk = bb
∀k so that the maturity distribution is flat.

    Finally, returning to Lemma 3, note that Proposition 2 also implies that starting from
a flat maturity distribution, the unique continuation equilibrium requires the issuance of
a flat maturity distribution. Therefore, in any MPCE, a flat government debt maturity
is an absorbing state, and all flat maturity distributions are stationary.
                                                                            
Corollary 2 Suppose that B satisfies bk = b ∀k for some b and that {c, n} 6= cf b , nf b .
Then, in all solutions to (26) − (28) b0k = b ∀k.

    Starting from a flat maturity distribution, the current government would like to guar-
antee a constant level of consumption and labor going forward. Choosing a maturity
distribution that is not flat cannot guarantee such a continuation equilibrium, since fu-
ture governments will deviate from a smooth policy in order to relax the government
budget constraint. For this reason, the government chooses a flat maturity distribution,
and a flat maturity distribution is an absorbing state.
    A natural question concerns whether an MPCE can converge to a stationary distri-
bution over time. A complete analysis of MPCE’s in an infinite horizon economy with

                                                 20
an infinite choice of debt maturities is analytically infeasible in the cases where the com-
mitment and no-commitment solutions do not coincide; this is because Lucas-Stokey
techniques do not apply. In the Appendix, we analyze transitions in a T -period economy
and we present examples where the economy transitions to a flat maturity distribution in
finite time.8


6       Concluding Remarks
An important literature on optimal fiscal policy without commitment has built on the
Lucas-Stokey conclusion that a government can structure its debt maturity to guarantee
commitment by future governments. In this paper, we overturn this result, using the
same model and the same definition of time-consistency as Lucas-Stokey under standard
assumptions on preferences.
    Motivated by this finding, we propose an alternative approach to studying fiscal policy
under lack of commitment. Rather than analyzing whether the optimal commitment pol-
icy survives a one-time future reoptimization, as previous work has done, we characterize
the equilibrium when the government reoptimizes sequentially and may deviate from the
optimal commitment policy. We consider an MPCE in which the government chooses pol-
icy as a function of the infinite-dimensional portfolio of government bonds that it inherits
in every period. Our analysis applies to the entire set of MPCE’s, including those with
potentially discontinuous policy functions both on and off the equilibrium path. We find
that any stationary distribution of debt maturity must be flat, with the government owing
the same amount at all future dates. Our analysis thus provides a theoretical argument
for the use of consols in debt management based on the sequential optimization of fiscal
policy by the government.
    In our framework, we have considered a situation in which a government’s objective
in its debt issuance strategy is to minimize its financing costs. In practice, government
debt management offices also pursue other objectives, such as supporting financial sta-
bility. For example, this can be achieved either by providing liquidity to segments of the
market that lack it or through the bond auction process, which itself may serve a purpose
of aggregating financial market information. How these factors matter for the optimal
maturity management of government debt is an interesting question for future research.
    8
    These results are consistent with the quantitative analysis of Debortoli et al. (2017) who consider
a stochastic infinite horizon with limited debt maturities, and who find that the maturity distribution
transitions to an approximately flat one.

                  Appendix A. Proofs of Section 2

Proof of Lemma 1
The necessity of these conditions is proved in the text. To prove sufficiency, let the
                                                              ∞
government choose the associated level of debt {bt,k }∞
                                                  
                                                         k=1 t=0 which satisfies (9) and a
tax sequence {τt }∞
                  t=0 which satisfies (8). Let bond prices satisfy (8). (9) given (1) implies
that (3) and (4) are satisfied. Therefore household optimality holds and all dynamic
budget constraints are satisfied along with the market clearing, so the equilibrium is
competitive.


                  Appendix B. Proofs of Section 3

Proof of Lemma 2
We prove this lemma in four steps.
  Step 1. We first establish that the problem is concave and the solution unique.
Consider the relaxed problem in which (14) is replaced with
                                                   ∞
                        b−1,1                 X
                   1−         − η (c0 + g)γ +     β t (1 − η (ct + g)γ ) ≥ 0.          (B.1)
                         c0                   t=1


We can establish that (B.1) holds as an equality in the relaxed problem, implying that the
relaxed and constrained problems are equivalent. If instead (B.1) held as an inequality in
the relaxed problem, the solution to the relaxed problem would admit ct = cf b ∀t. Given
                                    γ−1
(11), cf b satisfies ηcf b cf b + g      = 1, and substitution of ct = cf b into (B.1) yields
                                                            
                                  1                   1
                                            −b−1,1 −     g       ≥0
                                 cf b                1−β

which is a contradiction since b−1,1 > 0. Therefore, (B.1) holds as an equality in the
solution to the relaxed problem and the solutions to the relaxed and constrained problems
coincide. Since the left hand side of (B.1) is strictly concave in ct given that b−1,1 > 0
and since the objective (13) is strictly concave, it follows that the solution is unique.
    Step 2. We now establish the first two parts of the lemma. Letting µ0 > 0 correspond


                                                  24
to the Lagrange multiplier on (B.1), the first order condition for c0 is (15). The first order
condition for ct for all t ≥ 1 is

                        1
                           − η (ct + g)γ−1 + µ0 −ηγ (ct + g)γ−1 = 0.
                                                               
                                                                                              (B.2)
                        ct

Since the left hand side of (B.2) is strictly decreasing in ct , it follows that the solution to
(B.2) is unique with ct = c1 ∀t ≥ 1, where (16) defines c1 . It follows from the fact that
the program is strictly concave and constraint set convex that satisfaction of (15) − (17)
is necessary and sufficient for optimality for a given µ0 > 0. We are left to verify that
c0 > c1 . Note that the left hand side of (15) is strictly increasing in b−1,1 and strictly
decreasing in c0 for a given µ0 > 0. Therefore, c0 is strictly increasing in b−1,1 for a given
µ0 > 0, where c0 = c1 if b−1,1 = 0. It follows then that since b−1,1 > 0, c0 > c1 .
    Step 3. We now establish the last part of the lemma. We first show that the solution to
the system in (15)−(17) admits c1 which is strictly decreasing in b−1,1 . Let F 0 (c0 , µ0 , b−1,1 )
correspond to the function on the left hand side of (15), let F 1 (c1 , µ0 ) correspond to the
function on the left hand side of (16), and let I (c0 , c1 , b−1,1 ) correspond to the function
on the left hand side of (17). Since the solution to this system of equations is unique, we
can apply the Implicit Function Theorem. Implicit differentiation yields

                                   dc1     −Fc00 Ib−1,1 + Fb00 Ic0
                                         =             F 0 F 1 Ic
                                                                   .                          (B.3)
                                  db−1,1   Fc00 Ic1 + µ0F 1c1 0
                                                            µ0



From the second order condition for (15) and (16), Fc00 < 0 and Fc11 < 0. Moreover, by
inspection, Ic1 < 0 and Fµ10 < 0. Finally, note that Fµ00 Ic0 = [Ic0 ]2 > 0. This establishes
that the denominator in (B.3) is positive. To determine the sign of the numerator, let
us expand the numerator by substituting in for the functions. By some algebra, the
numerator is equal to
                                                                                    
1       1                     γ−2       b−1,1 1                 γ−2   1            γ−1
      − 2 − η (γ − 1) (c0 + g)     +µ0 − 4 − ηγ (γ − 1) (c0 + g)    − 2 ηγ (c0 + g)      < 0.

This establishes that c1 is strictly decreasing in b−1,1 .
    Step 4. Given step 3, we complete the proof of the last part of the lemma by es-
tablishing that there exists b∗−1,1 ∈ (0, b) for which the solution to (15) − (17) admits
c1 = claf f er . We first establish that b∗−1,1 exceeds 0. Note that if b−1,1 = 0 then the so-
lution admits c1 > claf f er . This is because (15) − (17) imply that the solution admits




                                                 25
c0 = c1 . Substitution into (17) yields

                                      c1 (1 − η (c1 + g)γ )
                                                            = 0.                                  (B.4)
                                             1−β

This equation admits two solutions: c1 = 0 and c1 = η −1/γ − g, and the optimal policy
satisfies c1 = η −1/γ − g, since welfare is arbitrarily low otherwise. Given the definition of
claf f er in (12) and the strict concavity of the objective in (12), it follows that claf f er must
be between 0 and η −1/γ − g, which means that c1 > claf f er .
     Now let us consider the system of equations (15)−(17) for b−1,1 = b∗−1,1 and c1 = claf f er .
                                                                        γ−1
To see that this solution exists, note that claf1f er − η claf f er + g      > 0 since claf f er < cf b .
Therefore, a value of µ0 > 0 which satisfies (16) exists. Multiply (15) by c0 and substitute
(17) into (15) to achieve
                                                                                             
                γ−1                                          β                           γ 

                                                                                      +g        = 0.

                                                                                          (B.5)
Note that given the value of µ0 > 0 satisfying (16) for c1 = claf f er , a solution to (B.5)
which admits c0 > 0 exists. This is because the left hand side of (B.5) goes to
                                                                           

as c0 goes to 0, where we have used the fact that g < η1          . As c0 goes to infinity, the
left hand side of (B.5) becomes arbitrarily negative. Therefore a solution to (B.5) for
c0 > 0 exists. Given that b−1,1 enters linearly in (17), it follows that a value of b−1,1 which
satisfies the system also exists. This establishes the last part of the lemma.


Proof of Proposition 1
We consider each case separately.
    Case 1. Suppose that b−1,1 < b∗−1,1 . From Lemma 2, the date 0 solution admits
ct = c1 > claf f er ∀t ≥ 1. To show that this solution is time-consistent, suppose that the
date 0 government chooses {b0,k }∞ k=1 satisfying


                              b0,k = c1 (1 − η (c1 + g)γ ) > 0 ∀k ≥ 1                             (B.6)

for c1 defined in (15) − (17). The fact that b0,k > 0 follows from the fact that the highest
value of c1 > claf f er is below that associated with b−1,1 = 0 which satisfies (B.4). Now

                                                   26
consider the solution to (18) − (19). Analogous arguments as those in steps 1 and 2 of the
proof of Lemma 2 imply that the unique solution satisfies (19) and (20) for some µ1 > 0.
Therefore, to check that the date 1 solution admits ct = c1 ∀t ≥ 1 for c1 which satisfies
(16), it is sufficient to check that there exists some µ1 > 0 satisfying (20). Using (B.6) to
substitute in for b0,k in (20), we find that

                                        1 − ηc1 (c1 + g)γ−1
                       µ1 = −                                      > 0,                   (B.7)
                                1 − η (c1 + g)γ − ηγc1 (c1 + g)γ−1

where we have appealed to the fact that c1 < cf b (from (16)) to assign a positive sign
to the numerator in (B.7) and the fact that c1 > claf f er to assign a negative sign to the
denominator in (B.7). This establishes that the date 0 solution is time-consistent.
    Case 2. Suppose by contradiction that the optimal date 0 policy is time-consistent.
This would require (20) to hold for ct = c1 ∀t ≥ 1 for c1 < claf f er which satisfies (16). For
a given µ1 , satisfaction of (20) thus requires that b0,k = b0,1 ∀k ≥ 1. Equation (19) thus
implies that (B.6) for b0,k > 0 holds, and substitution of (B.6) into (20) implies that

                                        1 − ηc1 (c1 + g)γ−1
                       µ1 = −                                      < 0,                   (B.8)
                                1 − η (c1 + g)γ − ηγc1 (c1 + g)γ−1

where we have appealed to the fact that c1 < cf b (from (16)) to assign a positive sign to
the numerator and the fact that c1 < claf f er to assign a positive sign to the denominator.
However, conditional on {b0,k }∞
                               k=1 for b0,k = b0,1 > 0 ∀k ≥ 1, the solution to (18) − (19)
must admit a positive multiplier µ1 > 0, and this follows by analogous arguments as those
in step 1 in the proof of Lemma 2, which contradicts (B.8). Therefore, the date 1 solution
does not coincide with the date 0 solution.


                  Appendix C. Proofs of Section 5

Proof of Lemma 3
Note that if bk = b ∀k, then from Assumption 1, the solution under commitment admits
{ct , nt } = {c∗ (b) , n∗ (b)} ∀t, and this solution can be implemented with b0k = b given (32)−
(33). Since the MPCE satisfies the same constraints of the problem under commitment
plus additional constraints regarding sequential optimality, it follows that

                                        u (c∗ (b) , n∗ (b))
                             W (B) =                        ≥ V (B)                       (C.9)

if bk = b ∀k. Now consider optimal policy under the MPCE in (26) − (28) given bk = b ∀k.
A government has the option of choosing c = c∗ (b) and n = n∗ (b) together with b0k = b
∀k. This satisfies the resource constraint (27) and the implementability constraint (28).
Therefore, it follows that

                             V (B) ≥ u (c∗ (b) , n∗ (b)) + βV (B) .                          (C.10)

Equations (C.9) and (C.10) imply that

                                        V (B) = W (B) .                                      (C.11)

By Assumption 1, W (B) is uniquely characterized by {ck , nk } = {c∗ (b) , n∗ (b)} ∀k.
Therefore, it follows that any solution to (26) − (28) given bk = b ∀k admits c = c∗ (b)
and n = n∗ (b).


Proof of Lemma 4
Conditional on B, if a solution admits b0k = bk , then this means that B is an absorbing
state with B = B0 and consumption and labor are constant and equal to some {c, n} from
that period onward. Therefore, hk (B0 ) = β k uc (c, n) ∀k ≥ 1 for hk (B0 ) defined in (25).
As such, (28) can be rewritten as
                                                               ∞
                                                               X
        uc (c, n) c + un (c, n) n − uc (c, n) b1 + uc (c, n)         β k (b0k − bk+1 ) = 0   (C.12)
                                                               k=1


which combined with (35) and the fact that b0k = bk implies that

                              uc (c, n) c + un (c, n) n = uc (c, n) bb.                      (C.13)

Now consider the solution to the following problem given bb:

                                  u (c, n)
                           max             s.t. c + g = n and (C.13) .                       (C.14)
                            c,n    1−β

It is necessary that V (B) be weakly below the value of (C.14). This is because the
solution to V (B) also admits a constant consumption and labor (as in the program in
(C.14)) and since the constraint set in (C.14) is slacker, since the program ignores the
role of government debt in changing future policies. Note furthermore that the value of



                                                 28
(C.14) equals W ({bk }∞
                      k=1 ) |bk =b
                                 b ∀k , where this follows from Assumption 1. Therefore,


                                        V (B) ≤ W ({bk }∞
                                                        k=1 ) |bk =b
                                                                   b ∀k .                    (C.15)

Now consider the welfare of the government in the MPCE if, instead of choosing b0k = bk
∀k, it instead chooses b0k = bb ∀k with c = c∗ (bb) and n = n∗ (bb). It follows from
Lemma 3 that under this perturbation, hk (B0 ) = β k uc (c∗ (bb), n∗ (bb)) ∀k ≥ 1, which im-
plies that the resource constraint (27) and implementability constraint (28) are satisfied
under this deviation. Because the continuation value associated with this deviation is
W ({bk }∞k=1 ) |bk =b
                    b ∀k , it follows that for this deviation to be weakly dominated:


                                        W ({bk }∞
                                                k=1 ) |bk =b
                                                           b ∀k ≤ V (B) .                    (C.16)

Given (C.15) and (C.16), it follows that W ({bk }∞
                                                 k=1 ) |bk =b
                                                            b ∀k = V (B). Therefore, given
                                                       0
B, there exists another solution to (26) − (28) with bk = bb ∀k which achieves the same
welfare.


Proof of Lemma 5
Before proving this lemma, define claf f er analogously as in Section 3:
                                                                          
                             laf f er                 un (c, c + g)
                         c              = arg max c +               (c + g) ,                (C.17)
                                               c      uc (c, c + g)

and let blaf f er correspond to the value of the maximized objective in (C.17). It follows
that a solution to (29) − (31) exists if bk = b ∀k ≥ 1 if b ≤ blaf f er .
   Given this definition, we can proceed to prove this lemma by contradiction. By Lemma
4,
                                                        u(c∗ (bb), n∗ (bb))
                         V (B) = W ({bk }∞  ) |  b ∀k
                                         k=1 bk =b    =                             (C.18)
                                                             1−β
 for bb defined in (35). Now suppose that b1 6= bb. Given the definition of bb, this means that
bb ∈ (b, b) and that bb ≤ blaf f er . We consider two cases separately.
      Case 1. Suppose that bb < blaf f er , and suppose that the government locally deviates
 to b0k = eb 6= bb ∀k so that from tomorrow onward, consumption is c∗ (eb) and labor is n∗ (eb),
 where this follows from Lemma 3. This means that hk (B)      e = β k uc (c∗ (eb), n∗ (eb)) under the
 deviation. In order to satisfy the resource constraint and implementability condition, let




                                                       29
the government deviate today to a consumption and labor allocation {e  e} which satisfies

                                                        1−β

where we have appealed to the definition of bb in (35). For such a deviation to be weakly
dominated, it must be that

                            V (B) ≥ u (e  e) + βW ({bk }∞
                                       c, n             k=1 ) |bk =e
                                                                   b ∀k .                               (C.21)

Clearly, the value of the right hand side of (C.21) equals V (B) if eb = bb. Therefore, it must
be that eb = bb with {e  e} = {c∗ (bb), n∗ (bb)} maximizes the right hand side of (C.21) subject
                      c, n
to (C.19), and (C.20). More specifically, we can consider the solution to the following
program
                max u (e   e) + βW ({bk }∞
                        c, n                  k=1 ) |bk =e
                                                         b ∀k s.t. (C.19) and (C.20) .    (C.22)
                 c,e
                 e n,e
                     b

For the deviation to not strictly increase welfare, eb = bb must be a solution to (C.22). By
Assumption 1, W ({bk }∞ k=1 ) |bk =e
                                             ∗    ∗                       ∗  ∗         ∗ e   ∗ e
                                   b ∀k = u(c , n )/ (1 − β) where {c , n } = {c (b), n (b)} are
the unique levels of consumption and labor which maximize welfare given eb and are defined
in (32) and (33). Letting µ1 represent the Lagrange multiplier on the implementability
condition for the program defining W ({bk }∞     k=1 ) |bk =e
                                                            b ∀k in (29) − (31), it follows from first
order conditions that

        µ1                                                                                       = 0.
               +ucc (c∗ , b∗ )(c∗ − eb) + ucn (c∗ , n∗ )(c∗ − eb + n∗ ) + unn (c∗ , n∗ )n∗

Since {c∗ , n∗ } 6= {cf b , nf b } by the statement of the lemma, (C.23) implies that µ1 6= 0.
Using this observation, implicit differentiation of (32) and (33) taking (C.23) into account
implies
                                                               uc (c∗ , n∗ )

                  1−β              1−β        uc (c∗ , n∗ ) + un (c∗ , n∗ )

    Now consider if eb = bb so that {e  e} = {c∗ , n∗ }. In that case, use (C.28) to substitute
                                     c, n
into (C.27) to achieve:

                                     ucc (c∗ , n∗ ) + ucn (c∗ , n∗ ) b
                            µ0 µ1                                   (b − b1 ) = 0.              (C.29)
                                      uc (c∗ , n∗ ) + un (c∗ , n∗ )

If it were the case that bb 6= b1 , then (C.29) would require that ucc (c∗ , n∗ ) + ucn (c∗ , n∗ ) = 0,
which contradicts the fact that ucc (c∗ , n∗ ) + ucn (c∗ , n∗ ) < 0. Therefore, bb = b1 .
     Case 2. Suppose that bb = blaf f er . In this case, consider an analogous perturbation as
in case 1 which reduces bb locally. For such a perturbation to be weakly dominated, the
analog of (C.29) requires

                                     ucc (c∗ , n∗ ) + ucn (c∗ , n∗ ) b
                             µ0 µ1                                  (b − b1 ) ≥ 0               (C.30)
                                      uc (c∗ , n∗ ) + un (c∗ , n∗ )

It follows from (C.25) that µ1 > 0 since any reduction in inherited debt can facilitate


                                                      31
higher consumption and higher welfare. Since ucc (c∗ , n∗ ) + ucn (c∗ , n∗ ) < 0, satisfaction of
(C.30) requires
                                   µ0 (bb − b1 ) ≤ 0.                                     (C.31)

Given that {e       e} = {c∗ , n∗ } = {claf f er , claf f er + g}, it can be verified from (C.17) that if
                 c, n
b1 < (>) bb = blaf f er , then (C.26) implies that µ0 > (<) 0. This follows from the fact that
claf f er < cf b and the term in parentheses multiplying µ0 in equation (C.26) is equal to 0
if b1 = blaf f er and is increasing in b1 . Therefore, (C.31) cannot hold unless bb = b1 .


Proof of Lemma 6
 Suppose that bl = bb ∀l ≤ m. Given B, let B(1)         b      represent the portfolio which sets
bbk = bk+1 so that no retrading takes place. Note that in such a portfolio, bb1 = b2 .
 Define B(2)
          b    analogously as the portfolio involving no retrading at the next date, so that
bbk = bk+2 under B(2),
                     b     and define B(l)
                                         b    ∀l ≤ m analogously. In any MPCE for which
 b1 = bb, a possible deviation sets {c, n} = {c∗ (bb), n∗ (bb)} and b0k = bk+1 so that no retrading
 takes place, where this deviation satisfies the resource constraint and implementability
 condition given (32) − (33). For such a deviation to be weakly dominated, it is necessary
 that:
                              V (B) ≥ u(c∗ (bb), n∗ (bb)) + βV (B(1)).
                                                                 b                           (C.32)

Forward induction on this argument implies that

                                    m−1
                                    X
                          V (B) ≥          β l u(c∗ (bb), n∗ (bb)) + β m V (B(m)).
                                                                            b                    (C.33)
                                     l=0


Combining (C.18) with (C.33), we achieve

                                           V (B) ≥ V (B(m)).
                                                      b                                          (C.34)

Now consider optimal policy starting from B(m).
                                              b      Note that since bl = bb ∀l ≤ m, then
following the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma 4, a feasible strategy starting from
B(m)
b      is to issue a flat debt maturity with all bonds equal to bb. Such a strategy ensures
a constant consumption and labor allocation forever equal to {c∗ (bb), n∗ (bb)}. As such, it
follows that (C.34) holds with equality and that choosing a flat maturity distribution
going forward is optimal.
    Now we prove by contradiction that bm+1 = bb. Suppose it were the case that bm+1 6= bb.
This means that starting from B(m),
                                b      the immediate debt which is owed by the government


                                                     32
does not equal bb. If this is the case, then the same arguments as those in the proof of
Lemma 5 imply that there exists a deviation from the government’s equilibrium strategy
at B(m)
   b    which can strictly increase the government’s welfare. However, if this is the case,
(C.34) which holds with equality is violated. Therefore, it must be that bm+1 = bb.


Proof of Proposition 2 and Corollaries 1 and 2
The proof of Proposition 2 follows directly by induction after appealing to Lemmas 5 and
6.
    To prove the first corollary, note that for the statement of Proposition 2 to be false, it
is necessary that {c, n} = {cf b , nf b }. However, if this is the case, then (C.12) implies that
                                                      ∞
                     fb un (cf b , nf b ) f b        X
                    c +                   n   = −g =     β k−1 (1 − β) bk ≥ b              (C.35)
                        uc (cf b , nf b )            k=1


which contradicts bk > −g.
    To prove the second corollary, note that from Lemma 3, it is necessary that the con-
tinuation equilibrium starting from a flat government debt maturity entail consumption
and labor equal to {c∗ (b), n∗ (b)} forever. The arguments in the proof of Lemmas 5 and
6 imply that if the government were to choose a non-flat maturity distribution going for-
ward, future governments would not choose {c∗ (b), n∗ (b)} forever. Therefore, all solutions
to (26) − (28) admit b0k = b ∀k.


              Appendix D. Finite Horizon Analysis
In this section, we explore the transition path of debt maturity in a finite horizon. We
consider a three-period quasilinear economy that we analytically characterize using back-
ward induction. The initial debt maturity distribution is declining in the horizon and
maturities beyond a certain horizon are equal. The proofs for the results of this section
are in the Online Appendix.
    Suppose that preferences satisfy (11) and are quasilinear with γ = 1. The horizon is
                                                                                               
finite with t = 0, 1, 2. We impose bounds on government debt where bt−1,k ∈ −g, cf b
∀t, k for cf b = 1/η given by the preference structure.9 In this setup, claf f er defined in (12)

    These debt limits are non-binding along the equilibrium path, but they allow us to characterize
continuation equilibria off the equilibrium path.

                                                                2η
     We consider an economy in which b−1,1 ≥ b−1,2 = b−1,3 ≥ 0. Thus, the initial debt
maturity distribution is declining in the horizon and maturities from date 1 onward are
equal. We observe that in this environment, the solution under commitment admits c1 =
c2 , and this follows by analogous logic as in the example of Section 3. Furthermore, using
the same arguments from that section, we can construct examples in which initial debt
                                                      
{b−1,1 , b−1,2 , b−1,3 } with elements within −g, cf b implies a solution under commitment
with c1 = c2 < claf f er .10
     We characterize the path of consumption and debt using backward induction. At date
2, the government inherits debt b1,1 and chooses a value of consumption that satisfies the
implementability condition:
                                     c2 (1 − η (c2 + g)) = b1,1 .                   (D.37)

Conditional on b1,1 , the value of consumption c2 satisfying (D.37) is unique since c2 ≥
claf f er , where this follows by analogous logic as in Section 3. A government lacking
commitment at date 2 would never choose a tax rate on the downward sloping portion of
                                                                                                 
the Laffer curve; a tax rate on the upward sloping portion associated with c2 ∈ claf f er , cf b
raises the same revenue and makes the government strictly better off.
     Taking this into account, the government at date 1 maximizes welfare by solving the
following problem, where we have substituted in for labor nt using the resource constraint
(1):

    Note that analogous arguments to those of Section 3 imply that (D.39) can be written
in relaxed form as a weak inequality constraint. The next lemma characterizes the solution

    For example, if b−1,1 = cf b > b−1,2 = b−1,3 = 0, we can show that c1 = c2 < claf f er if the discount
factor β is sufficiently low.

to this problem by providing conditions on c1 and c2 which must hold given any inherited
debt {b0,1 , b0,2 } at date 1.

Lemma 7 For any {b0,1 , b0,2 }, the solution to (D.38)−(D.42) satisfies the following weak
inequality constraints:

                                c1 + βc2 ≥ claf f er + βclaf f er , and                           (D.43)
                                       c2 ≥ claf f er .                                           (D.44)

    This lemma provides necessary, but not sufficient, conditions to characterize the so-
lution to (D.38) − (D.42). These conditions put a lower bound on the discounted sum
of consumption from date 1 onward. (D.44) is clearly implied by (D.42) and stems from
the lack of commitment at date 2.
    Satisfaction of (D.43) stems from the lack of commitment at date 1. More specifically,
(D.43) implies that it is not possible for c1 < claf f er and c2 < claf f er ; all future tax
rates cannot be on the downward sloping portion of the Laffer curve. This is true even
in the relaxed version of (D.38) − (D.42) which ignores (D.42). If it were the case that
c1 < claf f er and c2 < claf f er , then a deviation to c1 > claf f er or c2 > claf f er which raises
the same revenue continues to satisfy the (relaxed) implementability condition (D.39) and
strictly increases welfare.11 In addition, note that (D.43) does not impose a clear lower
bound on c1 ; a solution to (D.38) − (D.42) could in principle admit c1 < claf f er , however
this would require c2 > claf f er . Intuitively, a government at date 1 could choose a tax
rate on the downward sloping portion of the Laffer curve at date 1 in order to increase
short-term interest rates and buy back its outstanding long-term debt b0,2 at a lower price,
which would allow for a higher value of c2 .
    Now consider the problem of the government at date 0. Using Lemma 7, we can
  11
    More specifically, if the primary surplus at date 1 is below b0,1 , then a deviation to c1 > claf f er
relaxes (D.39) by reducing the short-term interest rate. If the primary surplus at date 1 exceeds b0,1 ,
then a deviation to c2 > claf f er relaxes (D.39) by increasing the short-term interest rate.

    This program corresponds to the date 0 program under commitment subject to addi-
tional constraints (D.47) and (D.48). Recall that the program under commitment admits
a solution with c1 = c2 . Note that this program which adds constraints (D.47) and
(D.48) ignores the bounds on the date 0 government’s debt issuance and only considers
necessary, as opposed to sufficient, conditions for the values of c1 and c2 to be chosen by
future governments. As such, welfare in the MPCE must be weakly below the solution to
(D.45)−(D.48). In the Online Appendix, we characterize the solution to (D.45)−(D.48),
and we verify that this solution corresponds to the unique MPCE in the three-period econ-
omy. This leads to the following main result of this section.

Proposition 3 (MPCE in finite horizon) The unique MPCE admits a sequence
{c0 , c1 , c2 } that satisfies (D.45) − (D.48) and admits b0,1 = b0,2 . If the solution under
commitment admits c1 = c2 < claf f er , then the MPCE and commitment solution do not
coincide, and the MPCE admits

                         b0,1 = b0,2 = claf f er 1 − η claf f er + g
                                                                             
                                                                                  .   (D.49)

    This proposition states that the unique MPCE is characterized by the constrained
date 0 problem (D.45) − (D.48) and admits a flat maturity distribution b0,1 = b0,2 , where
these values of debt correspond to the natural debt limit characterized by (D.49) if the
solution under commitment admits c1 = c2 < claf f er .
    In the case where the solution under commitment admits c1 = c2 > claf f er —so that
(D.47) and (D.48) do not bind—this result is immediate and follows from the arguments
in Lucas-Stokey. Optimal tax rates under commitment mirror initial maturities, and are
therefore stationary beyond a particular horizon. This eventual stability is guaranteed
with a transition to a flat maturity under no commitment, since otherwise the date 1
government would not choose c1 = c2 .

                                                       36
    In the cases where the commitment and no-commitment solutions do not coincide, the
argument is more subtle. The date 0 government clearly desires a stable tax rate from
date 1 onward given its initial maturities. However, if this desired tax rate exceeds the
revenue-maximizing tax rate defining the peak of the Laffer curve, the date 0 government
realizes that it cannot commit the date 1 and date 2 governments to its desired policy.
Facing this binding upper bound on future tax rates captured by (D.47) and (D.48),
the government chooses all future tax rates to equal the revenue-maximizing tax rate.
To achieve this future outcome, it issues a flat maturity distribution associated with the

    This example suggests that our results from the main text are robust to the consid-
eration of a finite horizon economy. We have also verified through numerical examples
that Proposition 3 continues to hold with preferences that admit γ > 1 in a horizon that
exceeds three periods. Details available upon request.

Proof of Lemma 7
(D.44) is implied by (D.42). Let us consider a relaxed representation of (D.38) − (D.42)
in which we ignore (D.41) and we replace (D.39) with a weak inequality constraint:
                                                                  
                           X
                                      t−1                     b0,t
                                  β          1 − η (ct + g) −        ≥ 0.            (E.50)
                          t=1,2
                                                               ct

We establish that the solution to the relaxed problem satisfies (D.43) and we verify that
(D.39) and (D.41) are satisfied under this solution.
    Step 1. Analogous arguments as in step 1 of Lemma 2 imply that since b0,1 ≥ −g and
b0,2 ≥ −g, (E.50) holds as an equality in the relaxed problem. Note furthermore that if
b0,1 ≥ 0 and b0,2 ≥ 0, the constraint set is convex so that the solution is unique.
    Step 2. The choice of c1 is characterized by the following first order condition for
µ1 ≥ 0 which represents the Lagrange multiplier on (E.50):
                                                         
                                      1              b0,1
                                         − η = µ1 η − 2 .                            (E.51)
                                      c1              c1

We can show that
                                                    b0,1
                                               η−        ≥ 0.                        (E.52)
                                                     c21
Suppose that (E.52) does not hold. In that case, b0,1 > 0 > −g, which means that
(E.50) is a binding constraint with µ1 > 0, implying that the right hand side of (E.51)
is negative. For the left hand side of (E.51) to be negative, this requires that c1 > cf b .
Substituting this fact back into the right hand side of (E.51), this means that

                                             b0,1 > ηc21 > cf b ,

which is a contradiction since b0,1 ≤ cf b . Therefore, (E.52) is necessary.
   Step 3. The choice of c2 is characterized by the following first order condition for




                                                     38
κ ≥ 0 which represents the Lagrange multiplier on (D.42):
                                                      
                               1                  b0,2
                                  − η + κ = µ1 η − 2 .                                (E.53)
                               c2                  c2

Analogous arguments using this condition as in step 2 imply that

                                             b0,2
                                        η−        ≥ 0.                                (E.54)
                                              c22

Combination of (E.52) and (E.54) taking into account the definition of claf f er in (D.36)
and (E.50) which binds and implies (D.43).
   Step 4. We are left to check that (D.41) is satisfied. There are two cases to consider.
   Case 1. Suppose that (D.42) holds as an equality in the solution to the relaxed
problem. In that case, c2 = claf f er and (D.40) implies that

                      b1,1 = claf f er 1 − η claf f er + g        ∈ −g, cf b
                                                                                


so that (D.41) is satisfied.
    Case 2. Suppose that (D.42) holds as a strict inequality in the solution to the relaxed
problem. In this case, the solution is characterized by (E.51) and (E.53) for κ = 0. Given
(E.52) and (E.54), it follows that (E.51) and (E.53) can only be satisfied for c1 ≤ cf b
and c2 ≤ cf b . Since c2 > claf f er , (D.40) implies that

                         b1,1 < claf f er 1 − η claf f er + g          < cf b .
                                                                  


To check that b1,1 ≥ −g, suppose it were the case that the solution to the relaxed problem
admitted b1,1 < −g. In this case, satisfaction of (D.40) would require that c2 > cf b which
contradicts the fact that c2 < cf b . Therefore, (D.41) is satisfied.


Proof of Proposition 3
We proceed by characterizing the solution to the relaxed problem in (D.45) − (D.48).
We then complete the proof by showing that the solution to this problem is the unique
MPCE which admits b0,1 = b0,2 .
  Step 1. Let us consider the relaxed version of (D.45) − (D.48) which ignores (D.48)




                                              39
and which replaces (D.46) with a relaxed constraint
                                                             
                            X
                                   t                  b−1,t+1
                                   β 1 − η (ct + g) −           ≥ 0.                        (E.55)
                           t=0,1,2
                                                        ct

Analogous arguments as in step 1 of Lemma 2 imply that since b−1,t ≥ 0 ∀t, (E.55) is
a binding constraint in the relaxed problem and admits a positive Lagrange multiplier
µ0 > 0. Let us consider the solution to this relaxed problem and then verify that constraint
(D.48) is satisfied.
   Step 2. Analogous arguments as in step 2 of Lemma 2 imply that since b−1,t ≥ 0, the
constraint set in the relaxed problem is convex, which means that first order conditions
with respect to ct are necessary and sufficient to characterize the unique optimum. Letting
βφ correspond to the Lagrange multiplier on constraint (D.47), first order conditions are:
                                                 
                            1               b−1,1
                               − η = µ0 η − 2       , and                                   (E.56)

                                                   
                        1                   b−1,t+1
                           − η + φ = µ0 η −            for t = 1, 2.                        (E.57)
                        ct                    c20

(E.56) − (E.57) imply that since b−1,2 = b−1,3 , the solution admits c1 = c2 . This means
that (D.48) is satisfied, since if φ > 0, then c1 = c2 = claf f er , otherwise c1 = c2 ≥ claf f er .
Note furthermore that since µ0 > 0, ct < cf b with

                                              b−1,t+1
                                         η−           ≥0                                    (E.58)

for t = 0, 1, 2 where this follows from the fact that b−1,t ≤ cf b using analogous arguments
as in step 2 in the proof of Lemma 7.
    Step 3. By Lemma 7, an MPCE cannot achieve higher welfare than the solution to
(D.45)−(D.48). We now establish that the solution to (D.45)−(D.48) is supported by an
                                 
MPCE with b0,1 = b0,2 ∈ 0, cf b . Suppose that the date 0 government selects b0,1 = b0,2
which satisfy
                                    b0,1 = c1 (1 − η (c1 + g))                         (E.59)

where c1 corresponds to the values of consumption satisfying (E.57). Let us assume and
later verify that this choice of debt satisfies

so that it is feasible (since claf f er 1 − η claf f er + g < cf b ). Consider the continuation
equilibrium from date 1 onward characterized by the solution to (D.38) − (D.42) and
analyzed in the proof of Lemma 7. By step 1 in the proof of that lemma, if b0,1 = b0,2 ≥ 0,
the solution is unique and characterized by the date 1 implementability condition (D.39)
and the date 1 first order conditions (E.51) and (E.53) for some positive µ1 . c1 = c2
satisfying (E.57) clearly satisfy (D.39). To check that (E.51) and (E.53) are satisfied for
positive µ1 under these values, set κ = 0 (so that c1 = c2 from (E.51) and (E.53)), and
let us verify that the implied µ1 is positive. Substituting (E.59) into (E.51), we achieve

                                              1 − ηc1
                              µ1 = −                        >0
                                       1 − η (c1 + g) − ηc1
where we have appealed to the fact that c1 ∈ [claf f er , cf b ). Therefore, the date 1 govern-
ment selects the same allocation as the date 0 government. We now verify that (E.60)
holds. There are two cases to consider.
    Case 1. Suppose that the date 0 solution admits c1 = c2 = claf f er . In that case
                                           
b0,1 = b0,2 = claf f er 1 − η claf f er + g so that debt issuance is feasible.
    Case 2. Suppose that the date 0 solution admits c1 = c2 > claf f er . Since the right
                                                                     
hand side of (E.59) is strictly below claf f er 1 − η claf f er + g < cf b , it follows that
b0,1 = b0,2 < cf b . To verify that b0,1 = b0,2 ≥ 0, note that (D.46) given c1 = c2 and
b−1,2 = b−1,3 can be rewritten as
                                                                      
                              b−1,1                              b−1,2
             1 − η (c0 + g) −       + β (1 + β) 1 − η (c1 + g) −         = 0.           (E.61)
                               c0                                 c1

From (E.58), the left hand side of (E.61) is decreasing in c0 and c1 . Following similar
arguments to step 2 in the proof of Lemma 2, equations (E.56) − (E.57) , imply that
c0 ≥ c1 = c2 since b−1,1 ≥ b−1,2 = b−1,3 ≥ 0. Substituting these inequalities into (E.61),
which is declining in c0 and c1 , yields

                                     1 − η (c1 + g) ≥ 0.                                (E.62)

Therefore, b0,1 satisfying (E.59) is weakly positive. Therefore, the solution to (D.45) −
(D.48) represents an MPCE in which the date 0 government issues a flat maturity with
b0,1 = b0,2 .
    Step 4. We complete the proof by showing that there does not exist an MPCE which
does not achieve the same welfare as (D.45) − (D.48) and that b0,1 = b0,2 is necessary
in the MPCE. If there existed an MPCE which did not provide welfare characterized by


                                              41
(D.45) − (D.48), then the MPCE would provide strictly lower welfare than the solution
to (D.45) − (D.48), where this follows from Lemma 7. However, in this situation, the
government at date 0 could deviate to choose b0,1 = b0,2 which satisfy (E.59) for c1 = c2
which correspond to the values of consumption satisfying (E.57). By step 3, this choice
would lead the date 0 government to achieve the same welfare as (D.45)−(D.48) and make
it strictly better off. Therefore, any MPCE coincides with the solution to (D.45)−(D.48).
We complete this step then by proving that b0,1 = b0,2 is necessary to induce the date
1 government to pursue the same policy which satisfies (D.45) − (D.48). There are two
cases to consider analogous to the cases considered in step 3.
    Case 1. Suppose that the date 0 solution admits c1 = c2 = claf f er . Suppose by
contradiction that some value b0,1 6= b0,2 could induce the date 1 government solving
(D.38) − (D.42) to choose c1 = c2 = claf f er , where satisfaction of (D.39) requires

                      b0,1 + βb0,2 = (1 + β) claf f er 1 − η claf f er + g
                                                                             
                                                                                  .          (E.63)

For (E.51) and (E.53) to be satisfied, this would require κ > 0, since otherwise (E.51) and
(E.53) would imply c1 6= c2 since b0,1 6= b0,2 in the date 1 problem. Analogous arguments
as in step 2 and 3 of the proof of Lemma 7 imply that (E.52) and (E.54) must hold.
However, note that
                                                     b0,t

if ct = claf f er and b0,t = claf f er 1 − η claf f er + g , where we have appealed to the defini-
                                                                                                   
tion of claf f er in (D.36). Since (E.63) implies that either b0,1 > claf f er 1 − η claf f er + g
                                         
or b0,2 > claf f er 1 − η claf f er + g and since the left hand side of (E.64) is strictly de-
creasing in b0,t , it follows that (E.52) and (E.54) cannot simultaneously hold, which is a
contradiction. Therefore, b0,1 = b0,2 uniquely guarantee that c1 = c2 in this case.
     Case 2. Suppose that the date 0 solution admits c1 = c2 > claf f er . Suppose by
contradiction that some value b0,1 6= b0,2 could induce the date 1 government solving
(D.38) − (D.42) to choose c1 = c2 > claf f er . In this case, (E.51) and (E.53) would need
to be satisfied with κ = 0. However, this is not possible since b0,1 6= b0,2 implies c1 6= c2 .
