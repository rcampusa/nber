               Does Anticipated Monetary Policy Matter?


                               ABS TRACT



     Recent theorizing with business cycle models which incorporate features

of the Friedman—Phelps natural rate model along with rational expectations

lead to the following policy conclusions. Anticipated changes in aggregate

demand policy will have already been taken into account in economic agents

behavior and will thus envoke no further output or employment response.

Therefore, deterministic feedback policy rules will have no impact on output

fluctuations in the economy. These policy implications of what Modigliani

has dubbed the Macro Rational Expectations (MRE) hypothesis are of such

importance that a wide range of empirical research is needed for its verifi-

cation or refutation.

     Recent empirical work has tested the "neutrality" implication of the MRE

hypothesis that an icipated monetary policy does not affect output or unemploy-

ment. Although this empirical work has frequently been favorable to the MRE

hypothesis, it suffers from several deficiencies that create suspicion about

the robustness of the results. This paper is an attempt to conduct an econometric

investigation of the implications of the MRE hypothesis which does not suffer

from these deficiencies. The results here strongly reject the neutrality

implications of the MRE hypothesis: unanticipated movements in monetary policy

are not found to have a larger impact on output and unemployment than antici-

pated movements. This evidence casts doubt on previous evidence that is cited

as supporting the view that only unanticipated monetary policy is relevant to

the business cycle.

                             INTRODUCTION




        Recent theorizing has focused on business cycle     models which
incorporate features of the natural rate model of Friedman(1968) and

Phelps (1970) with the assumption that expectations are rational in

the sense of Muth (1961). An important conclusion from this research


[ucas
         (1972),   Sargent and Wallace (1975) and Barro (l976]is that anti-

cipated changes in aggregate demand policy will have already been taken

into account in economic agents' behavior and will thus evoke no further

output or employment response. Therefore, deterministic, feedback,

policy rules will have no impact on output fluctuations in the economy.

This    leads   to the implied policy prescription that the monetary author-

ities should pursue a price level stabilization target, and a constant
money growth rule is one candidate for such a policy (e.g., Wallace
(1976)), These policy implications of what Modigliani (1977) has
dubbed the Macro Rational Expectations OIRE) hypothesis rims counter to
much previous macroeconomic theorizing (as well as the views in policy
making circles), It is thus of such importance that a wide range of
empirical research is needed for its verification or refutation.
        Recent   empirical work (Barro (1977, 1979), Barro and Rush (1978),

Grossman (l979), Le4deian (1978) and        Small   (1978)) has   tested   the

"neutrality"       implication of the MRE hypothesis that anticipated monetary
policy does       not matter: or to be more precise, that deviations of both

output    and    unemployment from their natural levels should be correlated

with    only unanticipated changes in monetary policy. Although this
                            —2—


empirical work has frequently been favorable to the MRE hypothesis,

 as will be shown below, it does suffer from several deficiencies that

 create suspicion about the robustness of the results. There is thus

 a need for further empirical research which does not suffer from

these deficiencies, and this has stimulated this paper's attempt to

provide additional econometric evidence on this issue.


     The next section of the paper discusses the previous empirical re-

search on this subject, and the econometric methodology in the empirical

tests of this paper. The following section then presents the outcome

from these empirical tests and. a final section contains concluding re-

marks.

                       A DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGY



        The tests discussed here are based on a model of the form:



            =    +                         +
                                 —
                                     Mt)
                    1=0

where

        = unemployment or real output at time t,

        =   natural level of unemployment or real output at time t — — esti-
            mated either as a time trend or as a linear combination of such
            variables as minimum wages or a measure of military conscription,

   Mt = money growth, at time t,

   M = anticipated           Mt conditional on information available at time t—l,

        =   coefficients,
        =   error   term.,


     The first thing to note about th.s equation is that the               coefficients are

not identified unless we impose some assumption on the correlation of the

error   term, ,      and   the right—hand—side variables.1 If (1)    is   not a true
reduced form because current or lagged M_Me are correlated with the error
term, then estimates of the 's             will not be consistent using usual least

squares     estimation methods.


   'This is easily seen in a case iorked out by Abel and Mishkin (19T9)
where only the contemporaneous unanticipated variable is included in
an equation like (l)
The implicit assumption made in all the empirical work cited in the In—

troduction holds that all the right—hand—side variables are exogenous

and hence      are     uncorrelated with the error term. However this    assumption
is never subjected to tests in this work and so we must be careful in

interpreting the evidence on the s's.

       Rational        expectations implies that the anticipations of Mt will be

formed optimally, using all available            information, and as is usual   in

this literature, models are assumed to be linear. An equation which

can be used to generate optImal, linear            forecasts is thus

(2)   MtZty+ut

where Z. = a           vector of   variables available at time t—l,


          -r   =a      vector of coefficients,

         u     =   error term which is assumed to be uncorrelated with. anp in-
                   formation available at t..l (which includes Z
                                                               t or u   ti'   for
                   all I >   1 and hence      Is white noise).


An optimal forecast for Mt than simply involves taking expectations of

equation (2) conditional on information available at t—l.

Hence:


(3) M = Zty

and   substituting into equation (1) we have:
                       N
                   +               — z.y) +

ESTIMATION ISSUES


       There   are two methods that have been used to estimate the equation

(4)   model.    Barro (1977) uses a two'—step precedure where the money growth

equation (2) is estimated by ord.inarr least squares COLS) over the sample period,

and the residuals from this regressIon are then used as the unanticipated

movements in money growth: i.e., y in (1) is assumed to equal the OLS esti—

mate of y in (2).       Tests of the neutrality proposition then involve adding

current and lagged actual money growth variables to equation (14) and testing

with OLS the null hypothesis that their coefficients are equal          to   zero.

       There   are several problems with. this methodology. Most important is
the econometric criticism of     this appraoch. As Durbin     (1970) and     Sims    (1977)
have   shown, using residuals from    one regression as variables in another re-

gression, as occurs in the above approach, is econometrically dangerous               and

has   often led to misleading results.2 The specific problem with this two—

step procedure is not that the parameter estimates will be inconsistent, but

is rather that the resulting test statistics are inappropriate. This pro-

cedure implicitly assumes that the covariance of the           and.    estimates are

zero. When there are off—diagonal elements in the information matrix of the

joint estimates, as here, then ignoring       them   as is done in the two step pro-

cedure will lead to test statistics that do not have the correct asynrptotic

distribution. Misleading inference is then a possible outcome of using this

two—step methodology.

       In addition, this methodo1or does not allow a full testing of the im-

plications of the MRE hypothesis. This hypothesis embodies two propositions:

1)    that   expectations are rational and 2) that anticipated aggregate demand




      2See Frjedaxi (1959) and   the d.tscussion in Laid..ler (1977)
                                       —6-.


Oi1C,     in this case monetary' policy', does not matter. The two step pro-

cedure is only     capable   of testing for the second proposition of neutrality

under   the   maintained hypothesis of rational expectations. It cannot test

for the rationality of expectations directly.

      The second method for estimatIng the equation (4) model involves

joint, non—linear estimation of the equations (2) and (it) system, imposing

the constraints that the             are   equal in (2) and (liV).   This procedure is

superior to the two-step procedure although it is far more expensive to

compute. Not only will more efficient parameter estimates of 's and y

result because both (2) and (1.) make use of information from each other in

the estimation process, but the tests will be more efficient as well. In

addition, this non—linear procedure generates valid tests of both impli-

cations of the MRE hypothesis.

      A   joint test of both        the neutrality' and   rational expectations propo-.
sitions    involves the following. If            the constraints due to the neutrality
proposition     were relaxed, then output and unemployment deviations from their

natural levels could also be correlated with the anticipated movements in

monetary policy. The resulting model would be:



(5)
        y = y +Z.(Mtj                M) +E.Mi +

and. imposing rational expectations using (2) in order to specify Me, we

have3


         equivalent way of constructing this test is to write (6) as
                        N                   N
                =
                     y+ Eo(Mt —           ÷

where .1 = ô.1 and 0.  = 3.—ô.. The test is then generated using this equi—

valent equation instead of (6). This procedure is analogous to that used
by' Barro (197T).

The joint test involves a likelihood ratio test for whether the (2) and

() system    satisfies the rationality constraints that the y are equal in

both equations as well as the neutrality constraints (5 = a) that exclude

the anticipated M's from (1). One way to proceed is to estimate with full—

informatjon—maxjum...ljkelihood (FliviL) the constrained (2) and (14.) system,

as well as the unconstrained (2) and (6) system 'there &=O and y=y are

not imposed. Then the- likelihood ratio statistic



                         —2 log (Lc,L

is distributed asymptotically as x2(q): where q is the number of con—

straints, LC = likelihood

likelihood of the estimated unconstrained system. Comparison of this sta-

tistic with the critical values of 2(q) then tests the null hypothesis.

       Leiderman (1978) and Barro and Rush             (1978)   use the above estimation

procedures   in testing       their model. Their results do confirm Barro's (1977)

earlier   findings with the less desirable two—step methodolor: there were
no   significant rejections of the constraints at the 5%                 level.
       The test procedures used in this paper proceed in a libt1y' different
way   than those described above. The primary reason is purely algorithmic.
A substantially larger number of parameters are estimated in the non—linear
models of   this   study than in Leiderman (1978) or Barro and Rush (1978),
making it   unfeasible       to use their FIML estimation packages. However, non—
                                   —8-.



linear least    squares packages   are available that can handle models as corn-.
plex as    those estimated in this paper,   and. one is used here.     In addition
use of    non—linear   least squares estimation allows   a   desirable degrees of

freedom correction which results in more conservative likelihood ratio

statistics; this would not have been possible with FI packages.

      Non—linear least squares estimation of the constrained (2) and (4)

system proceeds with the same identifying assymption used in the previous
research on this topic that the unemployment or output equation is a true

reduced form.5 This implies that the covariance of the error terms from

(2) and ()     is   zero. Failure to correct for heteroscedasticity both with-

in and across the equations in the system would also result in inappro-

priate test statistics, and heteroscedasticity corrections can have a

major impact on the conclusions der±ved from regression estimates.6

GoldIeld—Quandt (1965)     tests   do not reveal the presense of heteroscedasti—

city within the (2) and (1) equations estimated here, and it is only neces—

say' to correct for it across equations. This is done by estimating the




      used the NLIN procedure in SAS (STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SYSTEM). It is
described in Council and Heliwig (1979).


   51n the case where only contemporaneous MMe appears in equation (4),
the imposition of this assumption, even if it is untrue, will not invali-
date the test statistics on the rationality and neutrality hypotheses.
See Abel and Mishkin (1979). However, it is not clear that this desirable
result that the above assumption does not matter to the tests of interest
here carries over to the case where lagged M_Me enter equation (4).

   6For example, see the discussion of Shiller's (1979) results in Mishkin
(1978).

sun   of    squared residuals from equation (ii). Then the (2) and        (4) system
is estimated by non—linear generalized least squares (GLS) with E. A new
a
    matrix can then be estimated in the same way, and the system reestimated

again   with    non—linear GLS. This iterative procedure is continued until

there    is little change in the E matrix, resulting, approximately, in maxi—
mum   likelihood estimates, 8
       If the same procedure is followed for estimating the unconstrained
    staten,   then this, generates the following likelihood ratio statistic which.

    tests   the null hypothesis:


(7)         n log [det C/dt EU]




   8The iterative procedure will converge to maximum likelihood estimates
since this system has a Jacobian that is triangular. Thus theorems whish
show that iterative three—stage—least—squares is equivalent to FINL apply
to this non—linear case as well because the determinant of the Jacobian

             system,

             systeim.
          Although   this   likelihood ratio statistic will be distributed asymp—
totically      as   2(q) where q is the number of constraints, it may be mislead-
ing in a small sample like         that used here. The problem is that 'in the max-

imum likelihood calculation of the E"          matrix no correction is made for
substantial        relative differences in the degrees of freedom in estimates of

each unconstrained equation.9"° To avoid this problem, the likelihood

ratio statistics reported here are constructed as follows: The constrained



equals one. High computation costs required that iterations were continued
only until the estimated variance of each eauation in the system differed
by less than 5 percent. Some experimentation indicated         that further
                                                                     itera-
tions would have only altered         the likelihood ratio statistics in the text
by at most a couple of percent. This would lead to only a negligible
effect on the inference drawn from these statistics.

   9For example in model number 2.1 in Table 2, the unconstrained money
growth equation is estimated with 79 degrees of freedom, while the uncon-
strained output equation is estimated with only 70 degrees of freedom. This
is a difference of over io%. In the case of Model number 5.1A in Appendix
2, this problem is even more severe: the degrees of freedom for the un-
constrained money growth and. output equations are now 79 and 32, respect—
ively, a difference of over 50%.

   10Another way of         stating this problem is to say that the weIghting mat—
matrix used for GLS,('), will have a biased estimate of the variance of
one equation relative to another. This occurs because the estimated vari-
ances are the maximum likelihood estimates (the sum of squared residuals
divided by the number of observations in each equation) rather than the un-
biased estimates (the sum of squared residuals divided by the degrees of
freedom).

       If the   joint hypothesis of rationality and         neutrality   were rejected,
we would. want to ask whether this rejection were due to expectations not

particularily     relevant issue because   recent research tFischer (1977) and



    For the models reported in the text, the likelihood ratio statistics
are not appreciably different when they are calculated using (7) rather
than (9). For example, in the 2.1 model the likelihood ratio statistic
for the joint hypothesis calculated fr (7) is 22.81 versus the value
22.69 reported in Table 3. In the models found in Appendix II which use
up more degrees of freedom, the a.ifference between the statistics calcu-
lated from (7) rather than (9) is more appreciable: for example in model
5.JJ. the likelihood ratio statistic for the joint hypothesis calculated
from (7) is 76.33 versus the value 66.90 reported in Table 6A.


   14My discussion of the estimation techniques used in Mishkin (J.980 a, b)
was not as detailed as that above. However, note that the procedures used
in estimation and calculation of the likelihood ratio statistics in those
papers are the sane as here.

Phelps and Taylor (1977)]       has developed models in which expectations are
rational and    yet   the nature of wage    contracts   result in non—neutrality.

Constructing a likelihood ratio test for the neutrality constraints alone

under   the maintained hypothesis of rational expectations         just proceeds as

above,   where the rationality cross—equation constraints are         imposed    and
the   constrained system is (2) and       (4),   while the unconstrained system is
(2)   and (6)   with y =   y imposed. A separate test for rational expecta-
tions (without maintaining the hypothesis of neutrality) proceeds sun!—
larly,   where the constrained system is (2) and (6) imposing the rational-
ity   constraints, y =     y, and the unconstrained system is (2) and (6) with
                                            16
the rationality constraints relaxed.

       There is oie other small    sple problem that can arise in estimation
here. In cases where the number of lags (N) in the unemployment or output

equation   is large, many degrees of freedom are used. up in estimation and
yet   there is no allowance for    this   loss of degrees of freedom in    the   like-
lihood ratio statistics. This leads to the danger that spurious rejections

of the nuil hypothesis might occur because the small sample distribution

of the test statistics differ substantially from the asymptotic distribu-

tions in this case.17 In order to avoid this problem, the models discussed




   l6Research in progress with Andrew Abel discusses the identification of
parameters in the systems estimated avove and shows when seperate tests of
neutrality and rationality are feasIble. The identification conditions for
the seperate tests are met in the models of this paper. This research also
shows that the nesting of hypothesis tested above could proceed with a dif-
ferent ordering, but that used here makes more economic sense.

      1TThe type of problem I am   worried about here becomes more obvious if we
look   at the following example. In an OLS regression a test of restrictions

can be carried out with a finite sample test, the F, or with an asymptotic
test, thelikelihood ratio. Asymptotically, the test statistics have the
same distribution, but misleading inference with the likelihood ratio sta-
tistic can easily result in small samples. The F—statistic iscalculated
as,.

the likelihood statistic is:   nlog(SSRc/SSRu
where df = the degrees of freedom of the unconstrained model, n = thenum—
ber o.observations, q = the number of constraints. For over 100 degrees
of freedom qF(q, df) is nearly distributed as 2(q), and for small er—
centage differences, SSRC — SSR is approximately equal        to
                                                           log(SSR /SSR ).

Inference with the F—statistic in the case  of over 100 degrees of freedom
then involves approximately the comparison  of df(log(SSRd/sSRu)) with the
x2(q.) distribution. Even in the case where df is large, if n/df is sub—
stantially greater than, one the likelihood ratio statistic will reject. the

ployment or output model with no PDL constraints and. N = 20, the degrees
of freedom of the unconstrained model for the joint or rationality tests
is ill while the number of observations is 1814. The n/dr of 1.7 in the
case demonstrates that there potentially is a serious small sample bias
in the likelihood ratio test when this many degrees of freedom are used up.

l8Likelihood ratio tests of the polynomial distributed, lag (PDL) con-
straints do not reject the null hypothesis that these constraints are
valid. For model 2.1 x2(14) = 3.314, and for 2.2 x2(14)    1.56, the cri-
tical value of x2(14) at the 5% level is 9.11.9. For 14.1 x2(1T) = 12.914
and for 14.2 x2(17) = 13.76, while the critical value of x2(l7) at 5%
is 27.59.

     One remaining issue concerning estimation needs to be discussed. In

this paper we are particularly interested in obtaining correct test sta—

tjstjcs for our models, so it is critical that the suprious regression

phenomenon [Granger and Newbold (19711.)] be avoided..19 Therefore, partic-

ular attention must be devoted to the serial correlation properties of

the error term, ,   of   equation (11.) and (6). This is especially important

because no theoretical argument guarantees that it will be white noise and

evidence in Barro and Rush (1978) indicates that it has appreciable serial

correlation when postwar quarterly data is used. In the estimation here,

the error terni, c, is assumed to be a fourth order AR process. This spe-

cification for the error term was chosen because fourth order autoregressions

usually eliminate most serial correlation in quarterly, macro time—series.

Indeed, Durbin—Watson statistics and the residual autocorrelations of the

estimated model indicate that this serial correlation correction is suc—
                                                    20
cessful in reducing the residuals to white noise.

range from 1.82 to 2.15, none of which indicates the presense of first
order serial correlation. Furthermore, the Box—Pierce.(1970) Q—statistic

THE SPECIFICATION OF THE MONEY GROWTH EQUATION



       As the debate between Small           (1979)    and      Barro    (1979), as well as Ger-

many and    Srivastava   (1979), have shown, the specification of the money

growth equation (2) is critical to the ability to explain the postwar

movements in unemployment with only unanticipated movements in money growth.

Indeed, Barro (1977, 1978), Leiderman (1978), Germany and. Srivastava (1979)

and    Small's   (1978) specification of the money growth equation are flawed.

       Rational   expectations    theory implies that the anticipated. money growth

variable in equation (1) is an optimal, one—period—ahead forecast, condi—

tjonal on available information. Thus an appropriate prediction equation

should    rely only on lagged     explanatory variables on the right—hand—side of

(2).     The money growth specification used in the studies discussed here
violates   this principle because it includes                   the current value of the de-
viation of    federal expenditures      from normal (FEDV) as an explanatory van—
able. In predicting money growth at time t,                        the      market does not have
complete knowledge of the actual value         this FEDV variable at time t,
                                                   of

and this    leads to a ndsspecification in the money growth equation which
is   potentially serious. It is easy to show that this type of niisspecifi—



     21Another way to    see this point is as follows. The money growth equa-
tion with   FEDVt is
                          MGt =         +                 +

where, MGt is money growth at t, z is, as in the text, a vector of vari-
ables knom at time t—l and y and'S are coefficients. Then unanticipated

work,         and for similar reasons it will also inva1.date tests of the pro-

positions embodied by the NRE hypothesis. Hence, this misspecification

casts doubts on this previous empirical work.

         In this paper, the specification of the money growth equation is

approached in quite a different way from that used by Barro (1977) and the

other studies mentioned above. The reason for this is as follows. It is

difficult on prior grounds to exclude any particular piece of information

available at time t—1 as a useful predictor of a policy variab2.e.

or example, even though there is no strong theoretical reason for expect—

ing a particular variable to enter the Z vector of money growth equation

(2), it might       be   a useful predictor of money growth because the personali.




ithere     is the expectations operator conditioned on information avail-
able at time t—1. The above expression is not equivalent to the residuals
from the money growth equation, for it differs by an expression involving
the unanticipated FEDVt. Clearly then, using residuals from the money
growth equation to proxy for unanticipated money growth is valid when only
lagged variables are included in this equation or if there are no errors
in forecasting FEDVt. The issue of how important an issue this is empiri-
cally depends on the magnitude of the forecasting errors for FEDVt rela-
tive to       the uts.
              an
           efficient markets framework with equation (2) and an equation
(14) where only the contemporaneous N_Ne enters, Abel and Mishkin (1979)
have shown that the test of the equJ.ity of y in (2) and (14)       is

rational yet we might expect the rejection of the cross—equation, market

this test invalid.

ties   involved in policy making could be such that they react to this vari-

able for their om inscrutable reasons. Thus, the economic theory that a

researcher uses to explain his money growth specification might be rela-

tively unimportant in deciding on the validity of his particular specifi-

cation versus another researcher's.

       The discussion above suggests that an atheoretical statistical pro-
                                                                                   a
cedure might be superior to economic theory for deciding on the equation

(2)    specification. The procedure used here amounts to running multivari—

ate, Granger (1969)     tests.   Note that the issue here is the predictive

content of information — — which is what Granger tests are really meant to

analyze — — and it does not involve the tricky concept and issue of econo-

mic causality which has led to so much confusion in the literature.23 The

multivariate time—series specifications for equation (2) are chosen using

the following criterion. Money growth can be regressed on its oni four

lagged    values (again   to insure white noise residuals) as well as on four

lagged    values   of a wide ranging set of macro variables, such as: the

quarterly Ml or M2 growth rate, the inflation rate, the growth rate of nom-

inal GNP, the growth rate of real GNP, the unemployment rate, the treasury
bill rate, the growth rate of real government expenditure, the high employ—
inent surplus, the growth rate of'    the   federal debt and the balance of pay-
ments on    current account. This particular list of variables was chosen



   23See Zeilner (1979) for a discussion of Granger "causality" and
the pitfalls of these tests.

because they are     readily available         information which many       researchers   (see

Fair (1978) and     the    references therein) have cited as being of potential

use   in   explaining policy responses, in particular             that   of monetary   policy.
The four lagged values of each of these variables are retained in the

equation only if they are         jointly     significant at the five percent level or

higher. The major advantage of this procedure is that it imposes adis—

cipline on the researcher that prevents his searching for an equation (2)

specification that leads to results that confirm his prior on the validity

of the MRE hothesis.

      Note that the resulting forecasting equations derived from this pro-

cedure                                              that are available
           will only contain explanatory variables in
at time t—l. Thus the objection to the forecasting specifications in the
previous empirical work on the                hypothesis will not        be present here.

In addition, this approach leads to a very different specification for the

money    growth equation than has       been used     previously, and     the   resulting es-
timates of the (2)        and. (ii.) system   will   thus   provide new information.

SPECIFICATION OF TI LAG LENGTH IN T NPE EQUATION (1)



     A riniary objective of this study is to obtain more information on

the robustness of results with the M1E model of equation (1). As has been

discussed by McCalluzn (1979), the theoretical framework underpinning equa-

tion (1) does not specify what the lag length, N, should. be on unanticipated '

money growth. The standard   criterion   for chosing this lag length is empi-

rical: for example, Barro (197'7) and Rush (1978) choose the lag length on

the basis of excluding lagged unanticipated money growth. variables if their

coefficients are not significantly different from zero in the model of

equation (1). This yields a lag length which is fairly short -    - two   years

or under.

     There are several reasons why this paper does not restrict itself to

estimation of models with only this short lag length. Research which

studies an equation of the form of (1) with other variables besides money

growth as the aggregate demand policy variables finds that unanticipated

aggregate demand variables lagged as far back as twenty quarters are sig-

nificantly correlated with output and unemployment.2 Thus, it is plausi-

ble that estimating models with longer lags on unanticipated money growth

might reveal interesting new information.

    Furthermore, if the MRE hypothesis is not valid, then choosing the lag

length   from a model   like   equation (1) is inappropriate if we are interested

In testing this hypothesis. There is a general econometric principle which

supports testing of models with longer lag lengths. The addition of irrele-

vant variables    to an estimated model only' has the disadvantage of a poten-
tial decrease    in the power of the likelihood ratio tests so that we would
be less likely to reject the null hypothesis if it were untrue: it will

not result in incorrect test statistics. Kowever, excluding relevant

variables will render test statistics invalid. With this view, experiment-

ing with plausible, less restrictive, models is an appropriate strategy for

analyzing the robustness of results.

     Now   with the preliminaries out of the way, we can turn    to the empirical

tests.

                                 THE RESULTS




       The tests of the NBE hypothesis in the text use seasonally adjust-.

ed, postwar quarterly data over the 1951...76 period and       the     joint esti—

ination procedures outlined in the previous section. Following Barro and

Rush (1978), the data are seasonally adjusted and Ml growth is chosen

as the monetary variable. The data are discussed in more detail in the

data   appendix. Again in pursuit of information on robustness, both out-
put and    unemployment    models are estimated in this paper (i.e., where
is   the   quarterly   unemployment rate    or the log of real GNP).    The natural

level of unemployment or output, y is estimated as a time trend here as

in Barro (1978). A more complicated Barro (1977) specification, has

been avoided, because as is indicated by Small (1979) and Barro (1979),

its validity is doubtful.

       The first step in pursuing the MBE tests is to specify          the   variables

in the money growth equation (2). The multivariate, Granger procedure

outlined in the previous section yields an Ml money growth equation that

has the following variables in the Z—vector:             lagged values of Ml growti,

the 90—day treasury      bill   rate and the   high—employment surplus. The
resulting ordinary least squares results with standard errors in paren-
theses are    as follows:

in   equal halves indicate that this model has the desirable property that
stability of the coefficients cannot be rejected at the 5                     % level.25

tical F at 5 percent is 1.88.

       The F—statistic tests the null hypothesis that the coefficients
on the 4 lagged values of each of these variables equals zero. The marginal
significance level is the probability of finding that value of F or higher
under the null hypothesis. For M1G, RTB, and SURPLUS, the F—statistic
is calculated as F(4,79). For the other variables the F—statistic is
F(4,75).

       Table   2 contains estimates of the quarterly output and unemployment

equations which have been estimated from         the   (2) and (14)   system, impos-
ing the cross—equation constraints that the -r          are equal     in   both equations.
The   resulting y estimates are   not     reported in Table 2 and the        tables that

follow    because they are similar   to   the results in (10) and provide little
new information. A specification with the current and              seven    lagged values
of unanticipated Ml money growth is analyzed           first   for two reasons: This
lag   length has been previously used on quarterly         data by Barro and      Rush

(1978),   and the coefficients of unanticipated money growth lagged more

than seven quarters are found to be insignificantly different from zero.

      Despite the use of a substantially different specification for the

money growth equation, the Table 2 results are quite close to those of

Barro and Rush (1978). The models here fit the data well as in Barro and

Rush, and the unanticipated money growth        variables      also have significant

explanatory power, with many of their coefficients' asymptotic t—statis—

tics greater than four in absolute value. Even more striking is the

similarity of    the parameter estimates. Not only        do   the Table 2 models
display   the same pattern of serial correlation in the residuals as the

Barro and Rush results, but also the lag structure has the same humped

pattern and peaks at identical lags.

        The fact that the Table 2 results      are so   close to those of Barro

and Rush    in an important   finding.     Because the econonietrician's life is

made difficult by the absence of direct measures of expectations for most

variables in the economy, poor specification of expectations formation

is alwars    a   danger in this line of research. Although, misspecification

of money growth equation (2) would lead to an error—in—variables bias in

the coefficients of the unemployment or output equation, the question is

how severe this bias would be. Money growth is apparently quite hard to

forecast     so that the variance of the true forecast error could. be sub—
stantial. In addition, Feige and Pierce (1976) have made the argument
that autoregressive expectations models might be "economically rational"
because other information might have little incremental predictive

power once the past history of the variable to be predicted is taken into

account.26 This argument implies that the variance of the measurement

error in the money growth expectations model used here may             be   small in

relation to the variance of the forecast error. If this occurs, then the

errors—in—variable bias m be negligible and             should   not be an important

problem in this research.

     The    similarity of   the results in Table 2 and. those of Barro and        Rush
lends   some support to this view, because, except for past money growth,




     26Note that Sims (1977) has shown that there are some dangers in the sta-
tistical techniques used by Feige and Pierce (1976). Therefore, we should
be cautious in interpreting their empirical evidence as supporting this
conclusion.
                                    — 26 —




quite   different information is included in the money growth equation

here. Other research with a similar system to that estimated here also

finds that changing the specification of the time—series model used to

decrjbe money growth expectations does not lead to substantial differ-

ences in the results.27

       The likelihood ratio tests in Table 3 are not too unfavorable to the

I'ffiE hypothesis. The tests for the 2.1 output model do not call for re-

jection of either neutrality or rationality propositions, nor the joint

hypothesis, The marginal significance level of each test is defined as

the probability of finding that value of the likelihood ratio statistic

or higher under the null hypothesis, where a value less than .05 would

indicate a rejection of the null hypothesis at the five percent level,

None of the marginal significance levels for the model 2.1 tests is be-

low .05. The unemployment model 2.2 is not quite as supportive of the MRE

hypothesis: the joint hypothesis and rationality are                not   rejected at the

5%   level,   yet neutrality is barely rejected at 5%         in   this case.

      We can achieve a deeper understanding of the test results in Table 3

by   studring   the   estimated output and   unemployment equations where current

and lagged    anticipated money growth are      added   as explanatory variables.
Table ii. contains the results from the (2) and         (6)   system,     estimated
iteratively,    with rational expectations imposed. The 11.1 results illus-

trate why the neutrality proposition is not rejected in the output equa—



     2TSee Mishkin (l980a). Mishkin (1978) analyzes an efficient—markets
model similar to equation (1) where unanticipated short rates are an ex-
planatory variable. In this model, use of an autoregressive specification
to describe short rate expectations leads to results similar to those ob-
tained with the use of a forward rate to describe short—rate expectations.
This is even stronger evidence that the view promoted above is credible,
since forward rates are a more direct measure of expectations.

tion. The coefficients on anticipated money growth have no obvious

pattern, are never significantly   different   from zero and are in seven

out of eight cases smaller in absolute value than their asymptotic stan-

dard errors. However in the unemployment equation, some coefficients on

anticipated money growth are significantly different from zero at the

five percent level, and this leads to the rejection of neutrality in

Table 3. Here, the last two lag coefficients on anticipated money growth

are the most significant with asymptotic t-.statistics exceeding 2.5.

This creates the suspicion that even longer lag lengths for unanticipated

and anticipated money growth may' lead. to strong rejections of the NEE

hypothesis.

     Table 5 contains estimates of the output and unemployment equations

in which longer lags (twenty) of unanticipated money growth are used as

explanatory variables, Although in neither case are coefficients on un-

anticipated money growth. lagged more than 7 quarters significantly dif-

ferent from zero, as is evident in Table 6, strong rejections of the MRE

hypothesis now occur. The unemployment model rejects the joint hypothe-

sis of neutrality and rationality, while the seperate test of the compo-

nent hypotheses indicate that the main contributor to the rejection is the

neutrality constraints: rationality' of expectations is not rejected at

the 5% level while neutrality is. The results on the output model are

even more negative. The probability of obtaining that value of the like-

lihood ratio statistic or higher under the null joint hypothesis is only

1 in 5000. Here the contribution of each set of constraints to this re-

jection is nearly equal with both the rationality and neutrality con-

straints rejected at the 1% level. Because excluding relevant variables

from a model will result in inconsistent test statistics, but including

irrelevant variables will             at   worst only' reduce the power of the tests,

the Table 6      results     are damaging      to   the view that empirical evidence sup-

ports the MRE hypothesis. Indeed it appears                     that the only' reason that
the earlier      2.1 and 2.2 models are not unfavorable to the MRE hypothesis

is due to misspecification which yields inconsistent test statistics.

       Table 7    and   8   contain   the estimates of the Table 5         models   which. add

twenty' lags of anticipated money' growth to the list of explanatory van—

bles. As we would expect from Table 6,                  anticipated    monetary policy mat-

ters in these results. Masy of the coefficients on anticipated money

growth are significantly different from zero at the 1% level, with some

asymptotic t—statistics even exceeding four in absolute                    value,    Of course

these coefficients could be statistically' significant, yet unimportant

from an economic viewpoint. This is                  clearly'   not the case in Tables 7   and
8.    Not only do   the anticipated coefficients tend to                be greater in abso-

lute valuethan their unanticipated counterparts, but generally they also
have higher asymptotic t—statistics. In fact, in Tables 7 and 8, only one
out of twenty—one 8—coefficients is statistically' significant versus

nearly' half of the 5—coefficients. Contrary to what is implied by the E

hypothesis, anticipated monetary' policy does not appear to be less iinpor—

tant than unanticipated monetary' policy'; rather the opposite seems to be

the   case. 28

      2
       Most structural macroeconometric models in use do not make a dis-
tinction between anticipated and unanticipated monetary policy and are not
capable of lending an interpretation to the lag patterns of the tS's versus
the 8's in Table 7 and 8.             It
                              is not obvious what form these lag patterns
should take in a model where expectations are rational, yet anticipated

     Output and unemployment equations were also estimated using M2 growth
rather than Ml growth as the policy' variable. These results, which are

not reported here in the interests of conserving space, indicate that Ml

growth versus M2 growth in the estimated models does not lead to different

conclusions.29 However, using unanticipated. M2 growth rather than Ml

growth does lead to some deterioration in the fit of the equations as well

as lower asrniptotic t—statistics. The use of seasonally' adjusted versus

seaaonally unadjusted data also does not appear to be    an   important issue

in the empirical work here. For example when seasonally unanadjusted Ml

data is used to estimate output and unemployment models rather than sea-

sonally' adjusted data, the results are not appreciably different.3° Other

eirjcal work which uses a model resembling the constrained (2) and 4)

system also does not find that using seasonally adjusted versus unadjust—




monetary policy matters. Econometric models of this type are just now be-
ing developed, Taylor (forthconiing) for example, but to my knowledge sim—
ulation results which display the-reducedform. and 5 coefficients are
not yet available.

     29For example, the 2.lA M2 model does not lead to rejection of the
joint hypothesis. Here the specification of the M2 time—series model was
also generated with the multivariate Granger (1969) procedure discussed in
the text. The likeUhood ratio statistic is x2(l5) = 18.1 with a marginal
significance level of .26. However, the M2 results for the additional models
explored in this paper are also as negative to the E hypothesis. For ex-
ample, the .i..1A model with M2 data leads to a likelihood ratio statistic for
the joint hypothesis of 2(28) = 58.90 with a marginal significance level of

          Because a fourth order autoregression is not su.ficient to reduce the
seasonally unadjusted Ml growth to white noise, values of the unadjusted Ml

                              CONCLUSION




      The title of this paper asks the question "Does Anticipated Monetary

 PolicyMatter?" The empirical analysis here responds with a strong yes.
A closer look at models with money growth as the aggregate demand policy
variable reveals that the neutrality proposition of the NRE hypothesis is
rejected, particularjly when long lag lengths are allowed to enter output
and unemployment equations. Furthermore, contrary to the implications of

the MRE hypothesis, unanticipated movements in monetary policy do not have

a larger impact on output and unemployment than anticipated movements.

     The other proposition embodied in the NPE hypothesis, that expectations

are rational, fares better in the empirical tests here. Although the ration—

ali-ty hypothesis does not come out unscathed — — there is one rejection at

the 1 percent level— — none of the other rationality tests in the text re—

                               32
ject at the 5 percent level.        When the MPE component hypotheses of ration-

ality and neutrality are tested jointly, strong rejections occur in the out-

put and unemployment models with long lag lengths. In one case, the proba-

bility    of finding that value of the likelihood ratio statistic under the null
joint hypothesis   was only 1 in 5000.

          do not cite the rationality test results in Appendix II because, as
the discussion in Section II indIcates, they may not be as reliable, In
further work on the NRE hypothesis (Mishkln (l98Oc)) with inflation and nom-
inal GNP growth as aggregate demand policy variables, the results are even
more favorable to the rationality hypothesis: there are no rejections at the
5% level o the rati,onality' constraints, The    results
                                                       on neutrality, however
are less favorable, with even stronger rejection of the
than are found here.                                       neutrality constraints

       There is one qualification of the results that warrants further dis-

cussion. This paper has followed the previous research in this area by

using the identifying assumption that the output and unemployment equa-
tions are true reduced forms. It is not clear whether the invalidity of
this assumption might lead to rejections of           the MRE hypothesis even if it

were true. Thus, the results here are by no           means a definitive rejection
of   this hypothesis. However, this work does cast doubt on previous evi-

dence — — also of a reduced form nature — — that is cited as supporting

the   view   that   only   unanticipated   monetary policy is relevant to the busi-
ness cycle.
