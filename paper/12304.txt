                                           ABSTRACT


This paper examines the influence of health conditions on academic performance during
adolescence. To account for the endogeneity of health outcomes and their interactions with risky
behaviors we exploit natural variation within a set of genetic markers across individuals. We present
strong evidence that these genetic markers serve as valid instruments with good statistical properties
for ADHD, depression and obesity. They help to reveal a new dynamism from poor health to lower
academic achievement with substantial heterogeneity in their impacts across genders. Our
investigation further exposes the considerable challenges in identifying health impacts due to the
prevalence of comorbid health conditions and endogenous health behaviors.

1         Introduction

The discovery of the human genome, a sequence of approximately three billion chemical “letters”

that make up human DNA, the recipe of human life, is considered to be a milestone in the history

of science and medicine that might have the potential to influence social science research. Consider

the following question that has been investigated in the psychology, education, economics, sociology

and public health literatures: Does health status aﬀect educational outcomes? While numerous

studies report that students who are obese or depressed perform poorly relative to their classmates,

factors other than health could be responsible for this repeatedly observed, but potentially spurious

association. To credibly claim that obesity and depression have a deleterious eﬀect on student

performance in schools one must first overcome the inherent endogeneity when considering health

and education. Further, accurate measures of health are diﬃcult to obtain and overcoming biases

arising from measurement error represents a second hurdle for applied researchers.

        This study overcomes these challenges by considering an instrumental variables approach, where

the instruments are selected based on a growing body of evidence in several neuroscientific fields

that have identified genetic markers which possess significant associations with specific diseases

and health behaviors. While there has long been scientific evidence suggesting that the association

between genetic factors and health is substantial,1 only recently has it been possible to collect mea-
    1
   The importance of genetic factors to behavioral characteristics and health outcomes has been
noted throughout history and the passage of physical and disease traits from parents to oﬀspring
was first explicitly studied and modeled by Gregor Mendel in the 19th century. Since this work
more sophisticated studies of laboratory animals as well as comparisons between monozygotic and
dizygotic twins demonstrate that behavioral characteristics and economic as well as health outcomes

                                                    2
sures of genetic markers. Since genetic markers are formed at conception, they are predetermined

to any outcomes including those that occur during pregnancy and at birth. Genetic markers truly

fit the definition of “nature”. Using this “nature filter”, the health variables being instrumented

will be isolated from most nurture influences or choice-based inputs such as schools parents choose

for their kids, neighborhood families select to reside in, peers kids choose to associate with, among

other factors that threaten the identification of education production function parameters.2 When

the variations in health variables that include clinical measures of depression, ADHD and obesity

are due only to the diﬀerences in genetic coding, these variations are much less likely to be correlated

with the environments surrounding an individual, allowing us to recover consistent estimates of the

impacts of a vector of health measures on academic performance.3 While our identification strategy

relies on scientific findings, the results suggest that social environments might have to be invoked in

order to understand the root of heterogeneous impacts of health on academic performance, which
were in part linked to genetic inheritance. Most recently, Cutler and Glaeser (2005) compare
the correlation of health behaviors between monozygotic and dizygotic twins and conclude that
approximately 72% of the variation in obesity and 30% of the variation in cigarette smoking are
due to genetic factors.
   2
     This does not exclude the potential of bias from assortative matching, which we discuss in
Section 5.2.2. However, the bias is likely limited as evidence from numerous studies in evolutionary
biology indicates that mate choice is not based simply on genetic quality. Rather increasing evidence
(surveyed in Mays and Hill, 2004) suggests that mate selection is driven predominantly by genetic
diversity which is desired since it increases reproductive success.
   3
     These impacts should be viewed as reduced form parameters and our analysis will clarify the
diﬃculties in estimating the structural health parameter. In Section 5.2.2 we discuss issues surround-
ing identification that include intergenerational transmission, potential dynastic eﬀects, assortative
matching and ideal data requirements. We also discuss how using genes as instruments to identify
the impacts of health oﬀers several benefits over alternative empirical approaches, most importantly
we can directly test the identifying assumptions.


                                                   3
seems to place the question squarely back under the realm of social sciences.

      Specifically, our empirical identification strategy is based on a large body of evidence in several

fields that explain the role of specific genes in the operation of a region of the brain along the medial

forebrain bundle which is responsible for reward and pleasure.4 This region is distinct from those

that are known to process and retain knowledge. Evidence that diﬀerent regions of the brain are

activated (or correlate) with diﬀerent economic decisions has been found using fMRI technology in

a study of intertemporal choices (McClure, Laibson, Loewenstein and Cohen, 2004). The growing

evidence in the biomedical literature that presents a significant association between certain genes

in this reward system with particular health behaviors and health status such as smoking, alcohol

usage, obesity, ADHD, depression and schizophrenia can not be denied.

      It is worth stating explicitly that the goal of this analysis is not to report a causal link between

genes and health broadly defined. While we exploit the strong neural correlations between a set of

genetic markers and certain health outcomes and behaviors, we do not wish to delve into the often

complicated and sometimes controversial debate on how genes aﬀect behavior. For example, the

popular press is occasionally filled with stories on the discovery of a gene that specifically codes for

obesity or depression that are often quickly refuted by medical authorities.
  4
    This evidence summarized in Section 2 suggests that possessing the genetic markers considered
in our study indeed increases the sensitivity of individuals being diagnosed with certain health
disorders. Second, there is no detectable evidence that the markers we consider are correlated with
other genetic factors that associate with either innate ability or the development of intelligence.
Note, we are not ruling out the possibility that these genes aﬀect outcome measures of intelligenece
but rather we are assuming that these genes neither directly enter or correlate with the genes
directly involved in the education production process.


                                                     4
      This study extends the burgeoning literature in economics that seeks to explain the strong

correlation between education and health in three directions.5 First, we present empirical evidence

on a causal link running from health to academic performance. Due to biases associated with

omitted variables, few studies have either empirically estimated the causal impact of health on

education outcomes6 nor focused on mental health conditions despite evidence that their incidence

is substantially larger than physical disorders in adolescence.7 Exceptions include Currie and Stabile

(2005) which presents evidence from sibling fixed eﬀects regressions that the negative impacts on test

scores and educational attainment from a specific mental disorder, hyperactivity are quantitatively

larger than those from physical health limitation. Behrman and Lavy (1998) as well as Glewwe

and Jacoby (1995) use market instruments such as prices for health. They respectively find that

the impact of child health on cognitive achievement varies as a function of the assumptions made

concerning parental choices and that much of the impact of child health on school enrolment proxies

for unobserved variables. Using an experimental approach, Kremer and Miquel (2004) overcome
  5
     This correlation has been explained in three ways that are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
The first hypothesis is that education increases health through productive or allocative eﬃciency
(Grossman, 1972, Kenkel, 1991). The second hypothesis is the converse that poor health results
in little education (Perri 1984, Currie and Hyson 1999). Finally, others have suggested that this
correlation could be caused by a third unobserved variable (e.g. discount rate) that aﬀects both
education and health (Fuchs 1982).
   6
     Grossman and Kaestner (1997) note that the majority of the empirical literature reports cor-
relations and focuses on the eﬀect of education on health. Strauss and Thomas (1998) present a
survey of the literature on the relationship between health and income.
   7
     Currie (2005) provides details and points out that the 1999 U.S. Surgeon General’s Report on
Mental Health stated "approximately one in five children and adolescents experiences the signs and
symptoms of a DSM-IV disorder during the course of a year".



                                                  5
the omitted variable bias problem by randomly assigning health treatments to primary schools in

Kenya. Their analysis displays a mixed picture as improved health from the treatment significantly

reduced school absenteeism but did not yield any gains in academic performance.

      Second we take a close look at empirical measures of health. The dynamic relationships between

health disorders and health behaviors revealed through our analysis clearly present a major empirical

challenge. This challenge has not been clarified earlier since the majority of the literature linking

health to education focuses on a single measure or proxy of an individual’s health such as birth

weight due to data limitations.8 Since an individuals’ health consists of many physical and mental

health measures including standing heart rate, blood pressure, mental clarity, etc. that constitute

a rich vector which not only would be diﬃcult to convert to a single index, but would such a single

index exist it is unlikely to be well proxied by measures such as BMI or birthweight.

      Third, we make a clear separation of health outcomes from health behaviors. This distinction

is not apparent in earlier empirical studies which estimate equations derived from models that

either exclusively treat adolescents as a "child" whose parents make all her health and education

choices or indistinguishable from "adults" that make all the decisions by themselves. In contrast, we

introduce a model that treats adolescents as "adolescents" since they only make a subset of all the

decisions. For example, we postulate that a teenager would make decisions such as whether or not

to smoke or have sex, while their parents make important human capital investment decisions such

as which neighborhood to reside in, which school their child should be sent to, the type of health
  8
   For example, see Behrman, Rosenzweig, and Taubman (1994), Currie and Hyson (1999),
Behrman and Rosenzweig (2004) or Almond, Chay and Lee (2005).

                                                  6
insurance to purchase and number of visits to health care providers. This hybrid in decision-making

is not only more realistic but helps disentangle the impact of health status (a state variable) from

health behavior (a control variable) that are treated as equivalent in the earlier literature. Since

health behaviors only explain a very limited amount of the variation in health status, they are

poor proxies for health status (which increases biases due to endogeneity) since they may reflect

non-health preferences such as the type of peers. Further some health behaviors result from rather

than cause certain particular health state, which has important policy implications. For example,

adolescents may decide to smoke since the nicotine in cigarettes may help self-medicate against

craving for food or some mental illnesses. Accounting for the pathway between health status and

health behavior is necessary for proper interpretation of our coeﬃcient estimates and could reveal

their dynamism that has been understudied in earlier work.

   Our empirical analysis reaches four major conclusions:

   1) Genetic markers show a great deal of promise as a set of instrumental variables. The markers

and their two by two polygenic interactions that we consider are strongly associated with each health

behavior and status in the study. Moreover, statistical tests demonstrate that these instruments

only aﬀect academic performance through the health outcomes.

   2) The impact of poor health outcomes on academic achievement is substantial. Depression

and inattention both lead to a decrease of 0.5 GPA points on average, which is roughly a one

standard deviation reduction. However, there is substantial heterogeneity in the impact of health

on academic performance across gender. The academic performance of female students is strongly


                                                 7
and negatively aﬀected by poor physical and mental health outcomes. The estimated magnitudes

are substantially smaller for male students and not a single poor health condition has a statistically

significant impact.

   3) To accurately estimate the impact of health status, it is important to account for endogenous

health enhancing or health deteriorating behaviors. We find that treating the stock of lifetime

smoking as exogenous leads to substantially diﬀerent impacts of adverse health status on education.

Cigarette smoking is endogenous and we find that accounting for this choice reduces the negative

impact of depression inattention and ADHD by over 50% for the full sample and females. In

addition, ignoring the endogeneity of smoking leads to obesity being positively and significantly

related to achievement for males.

   4) The presence of high comorbidity of health disorders is striking, thus the importance of

accounting for it. Comorbidity is defined as having two or more diagnosable conditions at the

same time. For example, research has suggested that between 50 to 65 percent of children with

ADHD have one or more comorbid conditions such as depression (Pliszka et al., 1999). Unless the

exogenous genetic or environmental factors can be clearly disentangled between these disorders,

estimating the causal impact of one disorder in the absence of related health states may not provide

accurate results. In our analysis, we estimate a large and significant positive impact of obesity on

academic performance in males and inattention (AD) for the full sample when we do not account

for the full health vector. Further, the significant impact of hyperactivity (HD) changes signs when

one controls for the full vector of health states. Since many individuals suﬀer from more than one


                                                  8
disorder, ignoring related illnesses may lead to some misleading conclusions.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide an overview of the

scientific literature linking genes to health behaviors and health outcomes. An overview of the data

we employ in this study is provided in section 3. The framework that guides our understanding

of how education and health interact in adolescence is described in section 4. We discuss the

identification strategy and estimating equations in this section. Our results are presented and

discussed in Section 5. A concluding section summarizes our findings and discusses directions for

future research



2     Scientific Primer on Genetic Markers

Since it was not possible to collect data on genetic markers, empirical researchers in the social

sciences traditionally chose to either ignore or assumed the unobserved heterogeneity conferred

by variation in genetic inheritance is fixed over time for the same individual or across siblings or

twins. Yet recent advances in fields of molecular and behavioral genetics, most notably through the

decoding of the human genome (Venter et al., 2002) permits researchers to elucidate how diﬀerences

in the genetic code correlate with diﬀerences in specific behaviors or outcomes across individuals.

While researchers were able to identify the genetic code for a number of inherited traits and diseases

such as eye color, cystic fibrosis, and Huntingdon’s disease, most products of inheritance have been

found to be polygenic, caused by the interaction of numerous genetic markers. The health outcomes



                                                  9
and behaviors we consider are thought to be polygenic with researchers associating approximately

160 genes with obesity (Perusse et al., 2005) and 42 genes with ADHD (Comings et al., 2000). For

these disorders researchers have focused their attention on genes involved in the reward pathway of

the brain. This pathway is closely linked to primal drives such as feeding and sex, and has been

shown to have a powerful eﬀect on decision making among higher mammals including humans.

For example, in a well-known study (Olds, 1956), rats that were given the choice of food versus

stimulation of their reward system by electrodes ended up starving to death rather than lessening

the stimulation of their pleasure center.

      Since the reward system of the brain has been found to be closely linked to numerous human

activities such as addiction much research has focused on how variation in diﬀerent components of

the pathway might make an individual more or less predisposed to addiction. In general, this system

operates when activities such as feeding or sex are undertaken. A region of the brain known as the

ventral tegmental area (VTA) is activated and neurons (brain cells) in the VTA release signaling

molecules known as neurotransmitters (in this case dopamine9 ) to another area of the brain known

as the nucleus accumbens (NA). These signals pass through the synapses (small gaps separating

neurons) until they eventually reach the frontal cortex, where most “decisions” are made. Increases

in the synapse of either neurotransmitters or receptor neurons for them allow for a much stronger

signal to be sent.10 Since the response of these neurons to nicotine and other substances has been
  9
     Dopamine has been called the “pleasure” chemical of the brain because people who are electri-
cally stimulated in the limbic dopaminergic centers of the brain report intense feelings of well-being
and sometimes orgasm.
  10
     Certain food and drugs such as nicotine or caﬀeine can have an especially powerful eﬀect on the

                                                 10
shown to vary between individuals, it has been hypothesized that genetic diﬀerences could explain

why diﬀerent individuals report diﬀerent levels of “highs” when smoking cigarettes, which is the

underlying idea of having a genetic predisposition. In addition, since the VTA-NA pathway is

important in regulating pleasure and, therefore, emotion, a number of behavioral traits including

depression and ADHD have been linked to this pathway.

   The particular genetic markers included in this study were chosen based upon a large and growing

body of research showing a correlation between their variation and traits such as smoking behavior

and depression, controlling for other relevant factors. These markers include the, i) Dopamine

Receptor D2 locus (DRD2), ii) SLC6A3 locus (DAT), iii) Tryptophan hydroxylase locus (TPH) and

iv) CYP2B6 locus (CYP). Each person inherits from each parent, a single copy known as an allele

for each marker. Alleles can diﬀer by the particular building blocks, or base pairs, that make up

all DNA or the number of repeats, or base pairs in a row that repeat themselves. An individual

who inherits 2 of the same (diﬀerent) allele is considered to be homozygous (heterozygous) for that

marker. Specifically, correlations between diﬀerent allelic combinations also called polymorphisms

and variation in behaviors and outcomes are studied to assess predispositions.

   The DRD2 gene is believed to code for the number of D2 dopamine receptors on neurons in the

brain, including those in the VTA. The D2 receptor is one of at least five physiologically distinct
reward center of the brain as they mimic or potentiate the eﬀects of neurotransmitters that occur
there naturally. This process is often described as a molecular “hijacking” of the reward path-
way. For example, nicotine has been shown to increase levels of synaptic dopamine by stimulating
dopamine release in the VTA (Di Chiara and Imperato, 1988) and inhibiting dopamine reuptake in
the reward pathway (Carr et al., 1992).


                                                11
dopamine receptors (D1-D5) found on the synaptic membranes of neurons in the brain. The DRD2-

A1 allele has been associated with a reduced density of dopamine receptors.11 Several researchers

postulate that the reduced density of dopamine receptors explains the higher associations individuals

with DRD2-A1 alleles (A1/A1 or A1/A2) have with compulsive and addictive behaviors including

smoking, depression and obesity, relative to individuals with two DRD2-A2 alleles.12

      The dopamine transporter (DAT) gene (SLC6A3) encodes a reuptake protein that regulates

synaptic levels of dopamine in the brain.13 Variability in the length of the DAT gene is believed to

positively influence levels of the reuptake protein in the brain.14 Individuals with shorter variants of

the SLC6A3 gene have diminished dopamine reuptake and greater availability of synaptic dopamine.

Since there is more synaptic dopamine it has been suggested that these individuals receive smaller

benefits from substances that stimulate dopamine transmission.

      The tryptophan hydroxylase gene (TPH) is a member of the serotonergic neurotransmission

system and plays a crucial role in the regulation of mood and impulsivity. This particular gene

is involved in the biosynthesis of serotonin, another neurotransmitter that operates in conjunction
 11
     This finding was first reported in Blum et al. (1991).
 12
     See Audrain-McGovern (2004) and Epstein et al. (2002) and the references within for evidence
on these associations.
  13
     Bannon, Granneman, and Kapatos (1995) present an overview of the SLC6A3 gene. The
SLC6A3 gene has been implicated in Parkinson’s disease (Seeman and Niznik (1990)), attention
deficit disorder (Cook et al. (1995)), and Tourette’s syndrome (Connors et al. (1996))
  14
     The length is associated with the number of variable tandem repeats on each marker. Each
repeat increases the amount of reuptake protein. The majority of individuals have SLC6A3 alleles
with lengths of 9 or 10 base pairs, where the length is positively associated with levels of DAT
protein. Note the SLC6A3 loci may also take the form of 7- repeat, 8-repeat, 11-repeat or 12-
repeat; each of which is extremely rare in both the population and our sample.


                                                  12
with the brain’s reward system. Serotonin activity has been linked to a number of behavioral and

physical conditions including depression, appetite, and addictive behavior.15

      The CYP genes as a group code for enzymes present in various body organs, primarily the liver

which break down a number of drugs and toxins, including nicotine. Polymorphisms of the CYP2A6

gene in particular have been linked to across population diﬀerences to smoking, alcoholism, and
                                            16
response to anti-depression medications.

      Finally, diﬀerent allelic combinations when interacted can potentially have powerful eﬀects. For

example, the level of endogenous synaptic dopamine depends not only on the amount of dopamine

released but also on the number of receptors that dopamine can bind to (proxied by the DRD2 gene)

as well as the amount of reuptake protein (proxied by the length of the SLC6A3 allele). Similarly,

one could imagine that the rate of metabolism determined by the CYP2B6 gene interacts with both

the TPH and DRD2 genes.

This paper uses data primarily from the Georgetown Adolescent Tobacco Research (GATOR) study.

GATOR is a unique longitudinal data set of adolescents that combines information from a series

of 5 questionnaires given over four years of high school (1999-2003) along with the four genetic

markers described in the preceding section.

      The study began in 1999 when researchers selected five high schools from the same county in

Northern Virginia.17 The county contains over 950,000 residents and is one of the most aﬄuent in

the US with a median household income of $70,000 in 1995.18 School administrators provided the

names and mailing addresses of the complete 9th grade class roster of students for each of these

schools. To recruit study participants project information packets which included an explanatory

cover letter from the school principal, consent forms, and a brief demographic/response form were

mailed to 2120 students’ homes.19 To increase participation rates, up to three waves of mailings

were sent and telephone calls were placed to encourage parents to respond. Of the 72% of the

parents/guardians (1533 of 2120) who responded to the mailings, three quarters (1151) provided

written consent for their adolescent to participate in the study. 99% of the 1151 adolescents who

had parental consent to participate provided assent themselves.20

      Biological samples were collected using buccal swabs from which DNA was extracted via standard

phenol-chloroform techniques. DNA was extracted from buccal cells to avoid a selective exclusion

of subjects with blood and injection phobia. Since the method to genotype varies across markers
 17
     A total of 21 high schools exist in this county. Using data from the NCES CCD we did not
find any significant diﬀerences in student demographics or standard school input measures between
schools included and excluded from the sample.

     The average household income is twice that of the nation and only 8.7% of households had

     Students who the principals indicated special class placement, such as a severe learning disability
or diﬃculty speaking and understanding the English language were excluded from the study. In
total 273 students or 11% of the total population were excluded.

     See Audrain et al. (2002) for more details regarding the data collection. We compared the
students who consented to the school population using data from the NCES Common Core of Data
and found no significant diﬀerences in race and gender.

diﬀerent assays were conducted.21

      In all assays, 20% of the samples were repeated for quality control. Quality control procedures

included positive and negative controls with each assay and independent repeat genotyping for 20%

of the results. The rate of discordance was less than 5%, and ambiguous results were not reported.

In total, full genetic information was obtained for 1032 subjects.

      The GATOR study also contains basic information on demographic characteristics (i.e. race,

gender, etc.), academic performance as measured by GPA (waves 3-5 only), reports on physical

activity and information on smoking activity by family and residence members. In the initial

survey this information was collected during mandatory grade 9 health and physical education

classes. These surveys were administered by a GATOR staﬀ member to students who provided

assent. Participants received $5 gift certificates to media stores to acknowledge their time and

participation in this study.

      The participants were resurveyed in the fall and spring of the 10th grade and in the spring of

the 11th and 12th grade, for a total of five data collection waves. The rates of participation at the

    For example in conducting SLC6A3 genotyping the following assay was conducted. DNA (25
ng) was mixed with primers (20 pmol), GeneAmp PCR buﬀer (10 mM tris-HCl pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl,
1.5 mM MgCl2 , and 0.0001% gelatin; Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT), Amplitaq DNA polymerase
(2.5 μ; Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT), and 2’-deoxynucleotides-3’-triphosphates (144μM; Pharmacia,
Piscataway, NJ) in 50-μl total volume. The reaction conditions included an initial melting step
(940 C; 4 min) followed by 35 cycles of melting (940 C; 1 min), annealing (650 C; 1 min), and extending
(720 C; 1 min). The VNTR repeat was then determined with a 4% agarose gel electrophoresis (3:1
nusieve:agarose). The authors would be happy to provide full details on the assays for the other
markers by request. Note each assay was validated by confirming a polymorphic inheritance pattern
in seven human family lines encompassing three generations.



                                                  15
follow-ups from baseline were about 95%, 96%, 93% and 89% respectively. Similar to the initial

data collection, surveys were completed during a classroom common to all students in the presence

of a member of the research team.22

      Students were identified on the completed survey by an identification number and during each

wave a member of the research team read aloud a set of instructions, emphasizing confidentiality to

promote honest responding, and encouraged questions if survey items were not clear. To minimize

missing data, make-up days were scheduled for those adolescents who were absent during the regular

survey administration. Further, surveys were mailed to the homes of students who had either

switched schools or dropped out of school.

      The GATOR data contains numerous questions on health and health behavior. Each survey

contained standard epidemiological questions related to self-reported experimentation with, and

current use of, cigarettes. Each participant who reported having smoked a cigarette provided addi-

tional information on both recent and lifetime cigarette use. From this information, we constructed

two variables that represented whether an adolescent was currently smoking cigarettes and years

of being a cigarette smoker. A current smoker was defined as having smoked a cigarette within

the past month and over one hundred cigarettes over the lifetime. Using this information on being

a current smoker with self-reported smoking histories we constructed a conservative measure of

number of years of smoking.
 22
    Students without parental consent completed classroom assignments during the administration
of these surveys. Classroom teachers and school administrative personnel did not participate in the
survey portion of the research, nor were they permitted to view participants’ responses.


                                                 16
      With the exception of the survey in the fifth wave, participants completed The Center for Epi-

demiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), a 20-item self-report measure of depressive symp-

toms. Items on the CES-D are rated along a 4-point Likert scale to indicate how frequently in the

past week each symptom occurred (0 = never or rarely; 3 = very often). The sum of these items

is calculated to provide a total score where higher scores indicate a greater degree of depressive

symptoms. To determine whether an individual may be depressed, we followed findings from ear-

lier research with adolescent samples (Roberts, Lewinsohn, and Seeley, 1991) who suggest using

gender and age appropriate dichotomous cutoﬀ scores (> 24 for female adolescents, > 22 for male

adolescents) to ascertain the presence of clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms.

      The Current Symptoms Scale-Self Report Form (CSSF), a well-standardized, 18-item self-report

measure were used to assess symptoms of Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from

DSM-IV (Barkley and Murphy, 1998) in the second wave survey.23 This form allows participants to

rate their recent behavior regarding how often they experience symptoms of inattention (9 items)

and hyperactivity-impulsivity (9 items) on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = never or rarely; 3 = very of-

ten). Typical diagnostic criteria (endorsement of at least moderate severity on at least six symptoms

from either the inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity subscale) was used to determine the likely

presence or absence of clinically significant ADHD symptoms. In the final wave of the GATOR
 23
    Barkley and Murphy (1998) describe the scoring algorithmn. The American Psychiatric Asso-
ciation defines ADHD as a heterogeneous neurobehavioral syndrome that begins in childhood and
is applied to individuals who display developmentally inappropriate levels of attention problems
or hyperactivity-impulsivity, along with impairments in functioning at home, school, or in social
settings. It is important to state explicitly that we are not focusing on diagnosed cases but rather
on responses to questions which are used to construct a diagnosis known only to researchers.

                                                  17
survey participants provided self reports of their height and weight. These measures were used to

construct body mass index and we applied standard definitions for being obese (BMI>30).24

      In total we have information on academic performance as measured by GPA (collected in waves

3-5 only), genetics, health outcomes and health behaviors for 893 study participants. Approximately

90% of these students (807 students) completed the survey in all three years. The top panel of Table

1 presents summary statistics of the time invariant characteristics of the 893 participants in our

study. The sample is predominately Caucasian and the largest minority population are Asians. The

percentage of African Americans and Hispanics in the student body of the schools in our sample

vary between 2.07% to 12.20% and 5.54% to 19.3% respectively. The overall sample’s AD and HD

subscale averages fell within standard ranges (inattention mean = 5.9; hyperactivity/impulsivity

mean = 6.6) for adolescent samples. Over 40% of the students report that at least one of their

parents was either currently smoking or was an active smoker during their childhood.

      The bottom panel of Table 1 presents information on time varying controls and outcomes.

Neither GPA nor percentage of students who have a household member that smokes have any

substantial change in summary statistic over the three years when GPA was collected. In contrast,

the number of individuals who currently smoke and have tried smoking rises rapidly during this

period. The percentage of daily smokers in the 10th grade and 12th grade is similar to national

averages calculated using the NELS88 (Miller, 2005). The percentage of depressed adolescent in our

sample is slightly higher than the 1999 estimate of the fraction of the adolescent population being

    We examine the robusteness of our results to alternative cutoﬀs for obesity, ADHD and depres-
sion.

clinically depressed (12.5%) from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Summary

statistics on one year lagged smoking and depression are included since we use these predetermined

measures in our empirical analysis. Similar to our ADHD measure, we need to use predetermined

variables since one could postulate that the answers from the psychological questionnaires used to

diagnose these conditions could be influenced by current academic performance or another factor

which simultaneously aﬀects responses and current academic performance (e. g. divorce).

      The GATOR data also contains information on smoking patterns and smoking history within

the household and across a complete set of family members. Finally, we supplemented the original

data with information from other sources to improve measures of the students’ neighborhood and

school.25



4       Empirical Framework

4.1      The Dynamics From Health to Education

In this section, we present a three-stage model that guides our empirical analysis. The first two

stages of our model incorporate elements from three competing theories in three distinct disciplines

that explain the heterogeneity in health behaviors across individuals. Economics contributes the

standard model of health investment (starting with Grossman, 1972). This model postulates that

individuals make inter-temporal decisions trading oﬀ immediate satisfactions for future benefits.
 25
   Data at the school level was obtained from the CCD and neighborhood information was obtained
from US census records at the zip code level.

                                                19
Diﬀerent time discount factors and value of life could result in diﬀerent health choices. Psycholo-

gists claim that the heterogeneous health behaviors arise from diﬀerent environment or situational

factors that individuals encounter. Natural scientists hypothesize that genetic variations in single

or multiple genes are associated with health diﬀerences across the population.

      Stage 1, at the beginning of period T (T0 ), adolescents choose whether or not to (continue to)

engage in a risky behavior such as smoking, drinking alcohol or using narcotic drugs given their

demographics, discount rates, the value of life, genetic markers and home and school environments

as well as their current health status (HiT −1 ). Adolescent i at time T0 chooses action or behavior

k if the immediate satisfaction it provides exceeds the aggregation of the current cost and the

perceived future cost to her. The immediate satisfaction that adolescent i derives from action k

could be aﬀected by her current health status26 and their genetic predispositions. The immediate

cost of taking action k includes both pecuniary parts such as price of cigarette and non-pecuniary

parts such as how diﬃcult it is to take action k. For instance a teenager may face obstacles in

acquiring cigarettes or narcotic drugs that can be measured as time spent. The obstacle faced

are determined by neighborhood, school and family environment inputs. For example, increased

parental monitoring might make cigarette smoking more costly; a drug infested neighborhood might

make drug usage less diﬃcult. The perceived future costs usually depend on the discount rates and

the value of life, which may vary with current health status (healthy people are more patient in

general) and genetic predispositions. Since the data contains no information on this matter, wlog
 26
   Research has also suggested that individuals with ADHD employ nicotine to enhance cognitive
function (e.g. Coger et al. (1996), Levin et al. (1996) and Pomerleau et al. (1995)).

                                                  20
we assume a non-binding monetary budget constraint for ease of exposition. As a result adolescent

i’s choice of k is a function of the market price for k that’s available to i (pk ) and the health status

at time T0 (HiT −1 ), given i’s endowed predisposition to taking action k – that is, the set of genes

(Gk ) associated with k and the environment variables that are included in the matrix X1iT .


                                        kiT = k(X1iT , HiT −1, pk , Gk ,   k
                                                                           iT )                      (1)

        k
where   iT   captures an independent random shock. This model can be easily generalized to treat k

as a vector of behaviors that are either health enhancing (i.e. proper diet and regular exercise) or

health deteriorating (i.e. smoking and drinking).

   Stage 2, at time T1 , altruistic parents select a level of health input liT for adolescent i, given
                                                      ˜

this period and revealed health status HiT −1 , that provides the highest indirect utility for their

household ViTl :

                                                  ˜
                   ViTl ≡ ViT (X2i , ClT , HiT −1 , KiT , GH                             0
                                                           i ), for each l available to i s family   (2)


where X2i are person-specific and environmental characteristics of the child i; ClT is the cost of

health input l at time T which include the cost of insurance payment and the wage-rate forgone

when taking care of child i’s sickness etc.; and GH
                                                  i is a vector of genetic markers that provide


endowed predispositions to the current state of health status.

   For empirical identification, the set of genetic markers, home and school environments that

impact health outcomes are not identical to those that determine health behaviors. Given the

                                                          21
history of health behaviors chosen by adolescent i and the health inputs chosen by i’s parents,

health production functions translate these elements into a vector of health outputs as follows


                            HiT = g(X2iT ...X2i0 , kiT ...ki0 , liT ...li0, GH
                                                                             i , Hi0,
                                                                                         H      H
                                                                                         iT ... i0 )            (3)

                                                   H      H
where X2iT ...X2i0 , kiT ...ki0 , liT ...li0 and   iT ... i0   are the full history of individual and environmental

characteristics, health behaviors, health inputs and independent random shocks to health production

respectively. Child i’s initial health stock at the start of life is represented by Hi0 .

    We assume here a display of single-mindedness in parental preference on child health. That is,


                                      U (Hit1 , •) ≥ U(Hit2 , •)      if Hit1 > Hit2 .                          (4)


We also assume a discrete set of health input levels (i.e. health insurance packages) all well within

the budget constraint. By this, we leave out the extreme cases that parents have to choose between

putting enough food on the table and paying the kid’s medical and insurance bills. Since our data

has no health input information, this assumption places no constraints on the estimation equations.

Under these two assumptions, parents will always choose l∗ that leads to the highest possible level

of health for child i.

    Stage 3, at the end of period T , T2 , parents choose a set of education inputs (i.e. school quality,

employing tutors, etc.) based on the health status of their child. Parents select among these inputs

the optimal school j ∗ for child i which provides the highest indirect utility for their household Vij∗ ,


                       Vij ≡ Vij (X3i , Cj , Qj , AiT −1 , Ii ), for each j available to child i                (5)


                                                                22
where X3i are observable person-specific and family characteristics of the child i; Cj is the cost of

attending school j, which include the cost if living in a good school district; Qj is school-specific

characteristics; AiT −1 indexes child i’s measured achievement at the stage of decision making; and Ii

is child i’s innate abilities. The availability of schools to a child is described by the school admission

rules in the local areas where parents can commute to work daily.

      Conditional on the selection of school j in the third stage, the standard education production

model states that child i in school j at time T gains human capital as measured by a score on an

achievement test or report card. The general conceptual model depicts this level of achievement

AijT to be a function of the full history of family, community, school inputs and own innate abilities.

These variables interact with each other in a nontrivial, unknown way. This general model expresses

current achievement over time as

                                        e      e
                             AijT = f (XiT ...Xi0 , QjT ...Qjo , HiT , Ii,   iT ... i0 )                         (6)


where Xite is a vector of community variables, individual and family characteristics in year t, Qjt is

a vector of school characteristics, Ii is a vector of unobserved heterogeneity including such factors

as student innate abilities, parental tastes, determination, among others and (            iT ... i0 )   are the full

history of independent random shocks assumed to have zero mean and no serial correlation.27

      There are three popular explanations put forth in the health economics literature for the ob-

served positive relationship between health and education. The first model considers education an
 27
   This model underlies education production function studies was first discussed in Boardman
and Murnane (1979).


                                                       23
investment in the future as paying large dividends the longer one lives, thus incentivizing individuals

to stay healthy and live longer (Becker, 1993). The second model postulates that education is a

critical component in a health production function, thus, educated individuals are better equipped

to stay healthy (Grossman, 1972). The third explanation suggests that the relationship exists be-

cause both health status and education are directly related to an unobserved variable such as time

discounting (Fuchs (1982)) or one’s family background (Rosenzweig and Schultz, 1983). However,

there’s no formal economic model postulating how health enters into the education production

process as an input. As a result, we hypothesize below the possible channels under which health

status (HiT ) potentially aﬀect education.

   First, it may aﬀect the physical energy level of a child which determines the time (including

classroom attendance and after school educational activities) that can be used for learning. For

example, obesity has been found to be the largest determinant of absenteeism (Schwimmer et al.,

2003). Second, it aﬀects the child’s mental status that may have a direct impact on academic per-

formance. For example, obesity may cause low self esteem which leads to classroom disengagement

that may reduce academic performance. Other health status such as being diagnosed with ADHD

or clinical depression may directly aﬀect a child’s attention span, which adversely aﬀects her acad-

emic outcomes. Third, a child’s health status may aﬀect the way her teachers, parents and peers

treat her; this in part shapes the learning environment that she encounters. For example, obese

children are often less popular among their peers and teachers. Depressed children are associated

with personal distress, and if the state lasts a long time or occur repeatedly, they can lead to a


                                                  24
circumscribed life with fewer friends and sources of support (Klein et al., 1997). The first two

channels directly aﬀect own health input (both physical and mental) in the education process while

the latter scenario influences a child’s education outcome through other inputs such as peer quality

and teacher attention that is the result of a certain health status.

   Ideally we would like to disentangle the eﬀect of obesity on education (the structural parameter)

from that which is due to the impact of the environment resulting from being obese. If parents,

schools or peers are responding to negative health outcomes by increasing investment into other

inputs this may oﬀset the deleterious eﬀects of poor health on achievement. Conversely the response

of these individuals could move in a direction that reinforces the deleterious impact of health such

as discrimination. For example, parents may decide not to invest or invest less in a child’s education

due to observed health status of their child. Since our data lacks information on family and school

inputs as well as peers, we will obtain a combined (reduced form parameter) impact of health on

education.



4.2      The Estimating Equations

Linearizing the achievement relationship (equation 6) yields

                                                              X

                                                              t=0




                                                       25
where δ it = α5t εit for some coeﬃcient α5t . The components of equation (7) may include higher

order and interaction terms. We re-express the achievement function as

                                                                           ˜
                              AijT = β 0 + β 1 XiT + β 2 HiT + β 3 QjT +       iT                  (8)


where the vector X contains individual characteristics (gender, race, residential smoking status),28

the vector H is a vector of variables that captures current predetermined health measures.29 Sim-

ilarly we linearize and generate equations for both the health production function in equation (3)

and the decision to engage in health behavior equation (1) as follows:

                                                                           ˜H
                              HiT = γ 0 + γ 1 XiT + γ 2 kjT + γ 3 GH
                                                                   i +      iT                     (9)
                                                                         ˜S
                               kiT = δ0 + δ 1 XiT + δ 2 HiT + δ3 Gki +    iT                     (10)


      Instrumental variable methods are used to estimate the above system of equations ((8) - (10)) to

generate consistent estimates of the causal impact of health on education (β 2 ). Our identification

relies on the assumption that the vectors of genetic markers that impact health behaviors (GH
                                                                                            i )


are unrelated to unobserved components of equation (9). While there is absolutely no evidence for
 28
      Since parents may choose to make investments in their children based on their health status,
our estimates should be viewed as an upper bound of the health impact on academic performance
if the investment is positively related to good health. Conversely, if the investment is negatively
related to good health, our estimates provide a lower bound.
   29
      This model is commonly used in the economics of education literature and it implicitly assumes
that the eﬀect of all previous observed and unobserved influences are zero in the current period.
The empirical validity of this assumption has only recently been tested (Ding and Lehrer (2005),
Todd and Wolpin (2005)) who each find support for it with school but not home inputs. This model
was elected since our data lacks information on home inputs.

production process, it remains possible.

Understanding the relationship between the genetic markers in our study provides support for

our identification strategy by demonstrating that there is substantial unique variation from these

markers and their interactions. Summary information on the genetic markers in our data is provided

in Table 2. The DAT genotypes are classified with indicator variables for the number of 10-repeat

alleles (zero, one, or two). We include indicator variables for the available AA, AC and CC genotypes

of the TPH gene. Similarly, the DRD2 gene is classified as A1/A1, A1/A2 or A2/A2. Finally, we

include indicator variables for the available CC, CT and TT genotypes of the CYP gene. The

first column of Table 2 provides the raw number of individuals who possess each particular marker.

Excluding the TPH gene, the majority of individuals in our data are homozygous for A2/A2 (of

the DRD2 gene), CC (of the CYP gene) and have two ten repeat alleles of the DAT gene. For

each of these genes the heterozygous combination is the next most populated and the remaining

homozygous combinations of the CYP and DRD2 genes are rarest. For the TPH gene there is nearly

an equal number of people who possess either the heterozygous AC or homozygous CC combination.

                                                 27
      The entries in the remaining columns of Table 2 indicate the number of people in each row

that also possess one of the rare allele combinations of the other genes along with the conditional

probability of possessing this combination. Each cell in the table is populated with at least two

individuals and there does not exist any systematic relationship between the diﬀerent genetic poly-

morphisms.30 Thus, having a rare polymorphism for one gene does not make it more likely that

you would have a rare polymorphism in another gene. These results are encouraging as they do not

lend support to correlations between markers of diﬀerent genes.


5.1.2     Candidate Genes for Adolescents

To justify our four sets of genetic markers and two by their polygenic interactions to explain health

behavior and status we begin by examining whether there are diﬀerences in health measures between

individuals with diﬀerent genetic markers. Table 3 presents information on summary measures for

each genetic marker. That is, each cell contains the conditional mean, standard deviation and odds

ratio of alternative health outcomes for individuals that possess a particular marker.

      For each genetic marker, there exists a substantial diﬀerence in the occurrence rate of at least

one of the health outcomes and behaviors.31 Individuals with the AA polymorphism of the TPH
 30
     Statistically, to determine whether there were links between markers of diﬀerent genes we con-
ducted regressions and tests for homogeneity of odds ratios to see whether possessing a given marker
increased the odds of possessing a specific marker for a diﬀerent gene. We did not find any evidence
indicating a systematic relationship between markers of any two of these genes.
  31
     In addition, we conducted simple linear regressions by gene of health outcomes on discrete
indicators for possessing each allele combination. The regression results are available from the
authors by request. Several relationships are statistically significant and we denote statistically
diﬀerent odds ratios with * in the Table.

                                                   28
gene have 50% and 20% higher propensities (relative to other TPH markers) for smoking and

obesity respectively. For the CYP gene, those with the rare TT polymorphism are more than 85%

more likely to be diagnosed with inattention (AD) and hyperactivity (HD), while those with the

common CC marker are at least 50% more likely to be obese. For the DRD2 gene, individuals

with the common A2A2 allele are substantially less likely to be diagnosed as depressed or obese

relative to the other DRD2 markers. Among the DAT gene, individuals with one 10-repeat (DAT1)

independently have both higher rates of being diagnosed with ADHD and lower rates of depression.

Individuals that have no 10- repeats (DAT0) are associated with slightly higher smoking rates.

These results clearly demonstrate that the four sets of genetic markers have statistically significant

associations with our health measures.


5.1.3   Health and Education Outcomes in Adolescence

The well known positive association between good health and educational outcomes is also observed

in the data. As indicate din Appendix Table 2, individuals diagnosed with ADHD, depression and

obesity respectively have on average GPA scores that are 0.26, 0.18 and 0.43 lower than their

counterparts. These diﬀerences are statistically significant (one sided t-tests). The raw GPA gap of

individuals with ADHD or obesity relative to those not diagnosed increases between grades 10 to

12 by approximately 20%. While the gap between depressed and non-depressed children does not

vary through grades, cigarette smokers close their GPA gap with non-smokers from 0.58 in grade

10 to 0.49 in grade 11 and 0.37 in grade 12. This is somewhat misleading as numerous individuals


                                                 29
start smoking over time. These new smokers have substantially higher GPA scores than long-term

smokers. Between grade 10 and grade 12 long-term smokers consistently have GPA scores that are

approximately one half point lower relative to non-smokers.

      Not only do smokers have lower GPA scores but they also have a higher propensity of being

diagnosed with negative health status. Individuals with each health disorder are significantly more

likely to be smokers at the 1% significance level.32 The largest gaps occur for individuals diagnosed

with either inattention or ADHD whose smoking rate is over 250% higher than the remaining

population (33% of individuals with ADHD smoke versus 13% of the remaining individuals and 39%

of individuals with AD smoke versus 12% of the remaining population). The propensity to smoke is

twice as high among adolescents with hyperactivity (HD) relative to those not diagnosed with this

disorder. Lastly, adolescents diagnosed as obese or depressed are associated with approximately

50% greater smoking propensities versus the remaining sample.

      A major statistical challenge in accounting for these health outcomes is the presence of comorbid

conditions. Comorbid conditions, or comorbidities, are conditions that happen to occur at the same

time. For example, Biederman et al. (1995) report that seventy percent of adults with ADHD are

treated for depression at some point in their life. Table 4 presents some summary information on

the presence of comorbordities in our full sample.33 Column 1 of Table 4 displays the number of

individuals (and marginal distribution) in each wave who smoke or have been diagnosed with either
 32
    Results from one sided t-tests.
 33
    Appendix Table 4 presents the same analysis for each gender. Recall being diagnosed with
ADHD means that an individual has been diagnosed with either AD or HD. It also does not make
a distinction between individuals with one or both disorders.

                                                   30
AD, HD, ADHD, obesity or depression. Across each row we present the number of individuals (and

conditional frequency) who also engage in smoking or suﬀer other poor health outcomes. Not only

are adolescents who are diagnosed with ADHD more likely to smoke but they also have a higher

rate of being diagnosed as either clinically depressed or obese than their cohorts (one sided t-tests).

This result is not unique to ADHD as we find that individuals diagnosed with any of these health

disorders are significantly more likely to engage in smoking than those not diagnosed in grade 12.

      Since health disorders and risky health behaviors are more common among individuals diagnosed

with one particular disorder than among the remaining population we will investigate whether

estimates of the impacts of a disorder vary if we do not control for comorbidities. The majority

of the literature on the impacts of health generally include only single outcome measure such as

obesity, smoking or birthweight in their analysis. Estimates of the impact of health disorders may

vary if there are both strong correlations between included and omitted health outcomes and if the

omitted health outcomes have a significant impact on the dependent variable. Our instruments are

unlikely to be unique to specific disorders as they are associated with the same region of the brain.34

Thus, even with the genetic instruments excluding significant comorbid conditions may result in

estimates of the impacts of included disorder proxying for the eﬀects of the omitted outcomes.
 34
   Recall, from the scientific literature that these disorders are believed to be polygenic and that
there is no unique depression or obesity or ADHD gene. Pharmaceutical companies are now in the
process of examining the use of nicotine patches to deal with ADHD. Ritalin, which is currently
prescribed to children with ADHD was originally developed as an anti-depressant.

5.2      Estimates of the Empirical Model

Ordinary least squares estimates of equations (8) that ignore the endogeneity of health outcomes

and smoking behavior are presented in the top panel of Table 5.35 In our analysis we consider two

diﬀerent health vectors. The first health vector includes depression, obesity and ADHD. The results

are reported in columns 1 - 3. The second health vector (results reported in columns 4 -6) includes

depression and obesity but decomposes the diagnosis of ADHD into being clinically inattentive (AD)

or clinically hyperactive / impulsive (HD). Results for the full sample are presented in columns 1

and 4, for the sample of females in columns 2 and 5 and the male sample in columns 3 and 6.

      As shown in column 1 of Table 5, the impact of each health disorder in the first vector is

negatively and significantly associated with academic performance for the full sample. The negative

impact of obesity is approximately twice the magnitude of the other health outcomes. On average

obese individuals have a GPA 0.37 points lower, an eﬀect that is larger than that from any race

or family variable. Column 2 shows that female academic performance is significantly negatively

associated with obesity. Obese girls saw a point decrease in their GPA, a magnitude that is five

times as large as being depressed. In addition, ADHD does not correlate with female’s academic

outcomes. In contrast, column 3 demonstrates that the impact of health measures were all negatively

and significantly associated with GPA for boys but the coeﬃcients do not vary across the health

measures. Finally, the negative impact of the household environment variable is nearly twice as

request.



                                                32
large for boys than for girls.

      Decomposing the impact of ADHD into its components, columns 4 to 6 of Table 5 indicate that

AD was responsible for the negative coeﬃcient of ADHD in column 1. For the full sample, HD is

positively associated with academic performance. Column 6 shows a strong negative association

between AD and GPA for males that is approximately 50% larger than that found in females.

Similarly, the positive impact of HD is 50% larger for boys but is statistically insignificant for both

genders. Interestingly Asian females performed significantly higher than their Caucasian classmates

while there were no diﬀerences for Asian boys.


5.2.1     Endogenous Health Outcomes and Health Behaviors: First-stage Estimates

A challenge exists in selecting an appropriate subset of the markers in our data to serve as instru-

ments. The scientific literature provides some (arguably weak) guidance as the evidence tends to be

inconsistent across studies.36 We present and report results from instruments selected by forward

stepwise estimation for each health outcome and behavior at the 5% level. This set was selected not

only because it has good first stage properties for the full sample by design but rather because it is

more parsimonious than the other instrument sets we used to verify the robustness of our findings.37
 36
     These studies tend to use very small unrepresentative clinical samples. Since it is not possible
(and probably unethical) to engage in random mutations of an individual genetic code we argue
it is best to treat genetic predispositions as a form of neural correlates with health behaviors and
health status.
  37
     For robustness, we considered seven diﬀerent instrument sets for the equations. One set involved
the use of the complete set of the markers in our study, another set was constructed based on our
reading of the neuroscientific literature up to May 2005 and the remaining five sets were constructed
from stepwise estimation using alternative selection criteria.

                                                  33
We do not vary our instrument set across race or gender so that any observed diﬀerence in terms

of health eﬀects is not the result of the selection of diﬀerent instrument sets that are race or gender

variant.38

       For the markers to serve as instruments they must possess two statistical properties. First,

they must have a substantial correlation with the potentially endogenous health variables. Second,

they must be unrelated to unobserved determinants of the achievement equation. Table 6 presents

results from two specification tests that examine the statistical performance of the instruments for

each health equation and sample.

       In the top panel of Table 6 we present estimates of the F-statistics of the joint significance of

the instruments in the first stage regressions. For each health outcome and health behavior with

each sample, the instrument set is jointly statistically significant at a level above current cutoﬀs

for weak instruments.39 Since our estimates are over-identified, we use a J-test to formally test

the overidentifying restrictions. The associated p-values for these tests are presented in the bottom

panel of Table 6. The smallest of the five p-values is a reassuring 0.21, provides little evidence

against the overidentifying restrictions. In addition many of the p-values are large and exceed 0.5.

However, these tests are known to have poor power properties.
  38
     Our results (available upon request) were robust to the instrument set for the full sample and
sub-sample of females. The estimates do not vary substantially either qualitatively or quantitatively.
For the sub-sample of males there were some minor diﬀerences with some of the other instrument
sets.
  39
     Similarly the F statistics for the full set of instruments for the entire model is above current
cutoﬀs. We report equation by equation results in Table 6 to demonstrate that the results are not
driven by the instruments performing well in some health equations and not in others.


                                                    34
5.2.2     Endogenous Health Outcomes and Health Behaviors: Second-stage Estimates

Two stage least squares (2SLS) results for the achievement equation (8) for the two health vectors

is presented in Table 7. Column one presents results for the full sample and only depression is

significantly related to academic performance. The impact of depression is approximately four times

larger than the OLS estimate presented in Table 5. When ADHD is broken into components (AD and

HD) both obesity and HD become statistically significant as shown in column 4. Hyperactivity and

impulsiveness is positively related to academic performance. In contrast, the portion attributable

to AD is no longer statistically significant once we correct for endogeneity.

      The results for the subsample of females in columns 2 and 5 are most striking. The quantitative

impact of each health behavior is substantial. Both depression and obesity lead to decreases in

GPA. The impact of depression is nearly three times as large as that of obesity in health vector

one. With health vector two, both depression and obesity lead to a 0.8 GPA point decrease. While

the total impact of ADHD is close to zero, the separate eﬀects of AD and HD are statistically

significant. While inattention (AD) leads to lower GPA, the impact of HD is of opposite sign.

      In contrast, for the subsample of males in columns 3 and 6, health outcomes are no longer

statistically significant once we correct for their endogeneity. The separate impact of obesity, de-

pression and AD are statistically diﬀerent across the genders.40 For each sample and health vector
 40
    For health vector 1, the t statistic for diﬀerences in the coeﬃcient estimates between genders
is 0.502, 2.499 and 2.020 for ADHD depression and obesity respectively. For health vector 2, the t
statistic for diﬀerences in the coeﬃcient estimates between genders is 1.845, 0.537, 1.412, and 1.812
for AD, HD depression and obesity respectively.



                                                  35
we checked whether health status should be treated as endogenous by testing the null hypothesis

that the OLS and 2SLS estimates are equal using a Hausman-Wu test.41 We can reject the Null of

exogeneity of health outcomes for each health vector with each sample at the 5% level.42

      There are several additional diﬀerences between the estimates for males and females. Asian girls

are associated with higher GPA scores among females. Hispanic boys have significantly lower GPA

among the males. The negative impact of home smoking environment is statistically significant for

both samples. The magnitude in the 2sls estimates increases relative to OLS for the boys but di-

minishes by approximately 40% for girls. We should emphasize that our variable indicating whether

a smoker resides in the household is a proxy for family environment that we lack direct information

on. Concerns regarding whether a smoker residing in the home may represent inheritability of genes

from biological parents were examined. First, the raw association between biological parents having

been regular smokers and the presence of a smoker in the household is 35%, within the households

that smoke approximately 65% of the smokers are other family members. Second, we replicated

the analysis in Table 7 excluding this proxy for home environment, the magnitude as well as the
 41
     Note, in the event of weak instruments and / or overfitting of the achievement equation the
2SLS estimates would be biased towards the OLS estimates.
  42
     We also considered the more eﬃcient 3sls estimation of equation 8 where we accounted for the
                                          ˜
one way error component structure of iT in running GLS. The 3sls results are consistent with a
                                                     ˜
underlying model which treats the components of iT as follows: Ii can be viewed as a random eﬀect
that is i.i.d. across people and iT is an error term which is assumed i.i.d. across grades for the
same individual. There are limited eﬃciency gains and no substantial diﬀerences in the magnitude
or significance of any of our results in this section moving from 2sls to 3sls. For completeness, 3sls
results that correspond to Table 7 are presented in Appendix Table 3. The only minor change is
that in the full sample with health vector 1, depression is now significant at the 10% rather the 5%
level but the magnitude is virtually unchanged.


                                                   36
statistical significance of the health disorders were unchanged for all three samples and two health

vectors.

   As indicated in Appendix Table 3, which presents comorbidities by gender, there are substan-

tially fewer girls diagnosed with both AD and HD relative to boys. Further, there are many more

depressed females particularly in the early waves. However, unlike males, girls that suﬀer from

depression have fewer comorbid conditions.

   To demonstrate the robustness of our results, Appendix Table 5 presents results for the male

and female subsample that correspond to their preferred instruments sets using stepwise estimation

on those subsamples. While the first stage properties for these samples are improved, a eyeball

test confirms that there are no important statistical diﬀerences between these estimates and those

using the instruments set constructed for the full sample with health vector 1 in Table 7. Similarly,

combining the separate instrument sets for males and females and estimating the system of equations

for the full sample yields no observable diﬀerences. For females with health vector 2, the positive

impact of HD and negative impact of AD shrinks by approximately 25% with this instrument.

However, the impact of depression increases by 25% with this alternative instrument set. Overall,

the results continue to demonstrate that females suﬀer large decreases in their GPA when they have

been diagnosed with AD, depression or as obese; whereas no significant relationships exist for the

males.

5.2.3     Discussion

The parameter estimates we obtain are reduced form coeﬃcients. Information on parental and

teacher investment as well as peer group composition is not available to disentangle the impact

of the health condition as explained by genes from that of the response from the environment

to the health conditions as explained by genes. While this appears unsatisfying, this limitation

is also implicitly shared by other empirical strategies used to estimate the impact of health on

education which generally either treat genetics as part of a big blackbox that can be eliminated under

strong assumptions or propose the use of alternative instrumental variables such as an individual’s

phenotype.43 The availability of genes as instrumental variables for the first time makes it crystal

clear the level of diﬃculty in obtaining structural parameter estimates and the importance of detailed

accurate information on health and education inputs. Further, structural parameters of this kind

even if they could be obtained, may quickly become invalid every time a new (medical) treatment

is developed that changes the occurrence rate or severity of these disorders’ negative impacts.

      The use of exact measures of genes permits us to enter what traditionally has been a blackbox

in empirical economics. Studies that exploit variation within siblings or within twins not only

assume that the set of genetic factors do not vary between pairs but implicitly the impacts of these

factors and unobserved (to the analyst) family investments are constant between family members.

Most unsatisfying is that one can not test the validity of these two assumptions and if they are
 43
   Phenotype reflects the observable manifestation of a person’s genotype in which the variation
across individuals is due to past experiences with the environment.



                                                 38
refuted biases could increase from diﬀerencing.44 Increasing evidence that monozygotic human twins

are discordant in many physical traits and diseases is not only ascribed to environmental factors

but also epigenetic modifications.45 Epigenetics refers to DNA and chromatin modifications that

play a critical role in regulation of various genomic functions. Essentially a substantial degree of

epigenetic variation can be generated during the mitotic divisions of a cell in the absence of any

specific environmental factors. This variation which results primarily from stochastic events is either

assumed the same in the sibling and twin diﬀerencing strategies or has zero impacts on outcomes.

      Our 2sls estimates, however, are not assuming a constant eﬀect on health for individuals with

the same genetic markers. Drawing on Imbens and Angrist (1994), Angrist and Imbens (1995), and

Angrist, Imbens and Rubin (1996) when heterogeneous response to the instrument and heteroge-

neous treatment eﬀects are pervasive, the 2sls estimate can take a causal interpretation as a local

average treatment eﬀect (LATE) under two assumptions.46 This LATE parameter is simply the

average causal eﬀect on education that can be attributed to the health disorders for the subset of

the population whose health disorders are induced by the chosen set of genetic markers and their
 44
     The notion that estimates with samples of twins may increase biases is discussed in Bound and
Solon (1999) and Neumark (1999) in the context of estimating the returns to education.
  45
     For example, while 80% of the variation in schizophrenia is assumed to be heritable only half
of monozygotic twin pairs in which at least one twin has the disease, share the disorder. In total,
only 10% of diseases are assumed to be due strictly to heritable genetic factors. Gringas and Chen
(2001) discuss the mechanisms that lead monozygotic twins to be genetically diﬀerent.
  46
     Specifically the exclusion restriction of the traditional IV literature is made stronger as the
instrument is required to be entirely independent of the potential outcomes and potential treatments.
Second a specific monotonicity condition on individuals’ responses to shifts in the instrument is
made. This condition requires those induced to change their health status by the instruments have
health changes operating in only one direction.


                                                  39
interactions (or, at least, a mechanism that the genetic markers reflects).

   As noted, the use of genes as an instrument presents a challenge in regards to intergenerational

transmission. It is well known that oﬀspring of parents with psychological problems are more likely

to develop these disorders. For example, it has been estimated that 40% of children with depressed

parents experience psychiatric disorders by the age 20 (Beardslee et al., 1998). Data from the

Minnesota Twin Family Study finds a weak positive association between maternal depression and

oﬀspring depression but does not find any evidence of an association between paternal depression

with either maternal or oﬀspring depression. The mechanism by which parental disorders influence

oﬀspring psychopathology has not been established and is hypothesized among other factors a

combination of genes and environmental factors.

   Our coeﬃcient estimates may also capture a dynastic eﬀect of the impact of health disorders.

Without more detailed data on parental diagnoses as well as parental genes we can not separate

out the portion of the impact that is uniquely brought on by the child’s condition. As a result,

this eﬀect may include the impact of family environments provided by depressed parents whose

depression can be explained by exactly the same set of genes and genetic interaction terms that we

selcted to explain the child’s depression in our study. This dynastic eﬀect may be useful to estimate

since individuals are in general not randomly assigned to families. Similarly if the assortative mating

process is stable, then the dynastic eﬀect is important to recover since kids with certain disorders

will increasingly come from families that also have this disorder. It is also worth noting that there

is limited evidence that individuals seek out partners with similar genetic makeup. Animal studies


                                                  40
on mate choice have shown that both signals of genetic quality and genetic diversity play important

roles whose relative weight varies according to the respective ranges of these characteristics in the

study population.47 The pursuit of genetic diversity serves to weaken intergenerational correlations,

especially on adverse health attributes.

      To summarize, the genetic markers we employ in our study are predetermined to any interaction

that the adolescents have with the environment, even those interactions such as pre-natal care that

occur in utero and aﬀect measures such as birth weight and APGAR scores. They possess strong

correlations with certain health disorders and health outcomes. At present there is no detectable

evidence that they are correlated with genetic factors that associate with inputs to either innate

ability or the development of intelligence. We are not ruling out the possibility that the genes aﬀect

the acquisition of intelligence but rather we are assuming that these genes neither directly enter the

education production process nor are correlated with genes involved in production of these education

outcomes. The assumptions underlying these markers for identification are supported by statistical

tests. Not only can these assumptions be tested but we argue that this strategy imposes substantially

weaker assumptions on the relationship between nature, nurture and adolescent outcomes than other

empirical strategies used in the literature. Despite these advances substantially richer data would

be needed to recover the structural parameter.
 47
   Roberts and Gosling (2003) use experiments with rodents to reach this conclusion and note that
genetic diversity is desired since it increases reproductive success.

5.3      Accounting for Endogenous Cigarette Smoking Matters

5.3.1     Are Smoking Patterns Diﬀerent Between the Sexes?

Our analysis indicates that a substantial gap exists between the genders in the impacts of health

disorders on academic achievement. One potential candidate that can account for this gender

diﬀerence is smoking patterns. A strength of our data is that we have detailed information on

the smoking behavior of each individual throughout adolescence. Between the sexes simple t-tests

suggest that there are no systematic diﬀerences in tobacco consumption as measured in current

smoking and year smoked. However, boys diagnosed with either depression, ADHD, AD, or HD

smoked cigarettes with significantly more tar and nicotine content than girls diagnosed with the

same disorder.48 Males with mental disorders may use the nicotine in the cigarettes to self-medicate

against these disorders since nicotine is well known to have a positive eﬀect on attention and indirect

eﬀects on the dopaminergic system, potentially reducing symptoms of ADHD and depression.49

This is consistent with the hypothesis that for individuals with limited attention spans there is an

immediate academic benefit or compensation from cigarette smoking.50

      While it is unlikely that only males would self-medicate with tobacco, a recent survey in the
 48
     Simple linear regressions controlling for school eﬀects and demographic variables confirm this
observation.
  49
     Conners et al., (1996) present research that suggests nicotine does indeed enhance attention
function in adults with ADHD.
  50
     Smoking diﬀers from other health behaviors such as drug or alcohol use as it is not known to
impair judgment and the detrimental health impacts come much later in life relative to drug use,
thus appears to be less damaging in the present. Tobacco does not alter consciousness and many
smokers claim that by smoking cigarettes they relieve symptoms associated with a variety of health
disorders.

                                                  42
psychiatric literature (Perkins et al. 1999) concludes that gender diﬀerences in the motivation for

tobacco consumption and maintenance exist in both human and animal populations. This finding

in combination with evidence that females are less sensitive to the eﬀects of nicotine is interpreted

in the survey as supporting the hypothesis that females are less likely to self-medicate with tobacco.

If males are more able or inclined to take advantage of the immediate compensating benefits from

smoking this may explain the diﬀerence in the impacts of the health disorders.

   To investigate whether smoking patterns do indeed have diﬀerent relationships with diagnosed

health disorders between the genders we present OLS and 2SLS estimates of the impacts of smoking

on each health outcomes for each sample and health vector in Appendix Table 6. Whereas smoking

is positively associated with each health outcome when treated as exogenous (in the bottom panel),

the 2sls estimates present diﬀerent patterns. Smoking is positively related to ADHD and negatively

related to obesity once we account for endogeneity as reported in column 1. Further, boys who

smoke are significantly less likely to be diagnosed with ADHD; particularly HD. In contrast, females

who smoke are less likely to be obese or be diagnosed with depression although neither impact

is statistically significant at conventional levels. These gender diﬀerences add a further layer of

complexity and support the possibility that smoking patterns account for some of the gap in the

impacts of health disorders on education between the genders. We next examine the sensitivity of

our results of treating smoking as a state as opposed to a control variable.




                                                 43
5.3.2     Are Smoking Decisions Exogenous?

With genetic markers as instruments we can investigate the degree to which smoking is a choice

variable. Past research has suggested that smoking could proxy for an individuals’ discount rate in

the economics literature. Several studies using this strategy have implicitly assumed that smoking

does not reflect a choice.51

      Treating cigarette smoking as an exogenous input to health outcomes presents striking changes

to our results. Table 8 presents 2SLS estimates of equations (8) and (9) which assume this choice

is exogenous. Notice that the magnitude of all health outcomes in Table 8 increases markedly from

those presented in Table 7, where smoking was treated endogenous. Most surprising is that by

treating smoking as an exogenous behavior, the estimates on the impact of depression, HD and

obesity become statistically significant for males. The results suggest that being obese leads boys

to score 0.8 points higher on their GPA. For the full sample and subsample of girls, the estimated

impact of depression nearly doubles in magnitude. In addition, ADHD becomes statistically signif-

icant for the full sample. Finally, the estimates on AD and HD for girls become implausibly large

but continue to oﬀset one another. The implausible magnitude of these coeﬃcients are a result of

both limited independent variation to separately identify impacts and the use of smoking as an

invalid exclusion restriction.
 51
   This idea is due to Farrell and Fuchs (1982) and subsequent studies such as Evans and Mont-
gomery (1994) have tried to use smoking as an instrument for education in wage equations. Ham-
mermesh (2000) argues that smoking behavior is a measure of family background and is unlikely to
be a valid instrument for education.



                                                 44
   We conducted a Hausman test of each health status equation for each vector in Table 8 by

comparing it to the corresponding equation in Table 7. We can reject the Null of exogeneity for

years of cigarette smoking, suggesting that smoking is indeed a choice variable. Our investigation

into the endogeneity of smoking shows that despite the use of genes as instruments for the health

outcomes, the diﬀerent ways of accounting for the smoking decision leads to very diﬀerent results.

This could result from the fact that genes associated with smoking tendency are also associated

with health disorders as well as smoking directly impacting health disorders. By either ignoring

smoking decisions or treating smoking decisions as exogenous the exclusion restriction assumption

of the genetic instrument is violated since individuals with these disorders are more likely to smoke.



5.4    Accounting for Comorbid Health Outcomes Matters

We now consider what, if any, eﬀect it would have on our estimates if we followed the usual practice

of ignoring comorbid conditions and only including one health outcome at a time. The results from

2SLS of achievement equations that include only one health variable are presented in Table 9. Each

entry refers to the point estimate of that health behavior from a system of equation which includes

the achievement equation and that health behavior or status alone.

   Examining results from separate regressions using the full sample, we would conclude that

inattention is positively and HD negatively related to GPA, which is the opposite of the pattern

reported in Table 7. The results for the subsample of boys completely change when comorbid

conditions are omitted. Obesity, AD and HD are all positively related to academic performance


                                                 45
and the magnitude of the impact for obesity is extremely large. Similarly, for the full sample and

subsample of girls the impact of depression is approximately 40% larger as it may be capturing

a portion of the negative impact of obesity or ADHD. Taken together, the results of Table 8 and

Table 9 illustrate the need to account for a greater set of health outcomes and endogenous behaviors

in any analysis. Even with exogenous instruments such as genes to correct for the endogeneity of

health status, the omission of comorbid conditions and behaviors may present a misleading picture

of the causal relation between particular health states and academic performance among other

outcomes.52



6       Conclusions

Understanding the consequences of growing up in poor health for adolescent development is an

important research question. This question is particularly interesting to policymakers since part

of the explicit rationale for programs such as Medicaid is to improve the development of children.

However, it is challenging to address due to endogeneity that arises from omitted variables and

measurement error problems pertaining to health.

      In this paper, we use information on genetic markers to overcome these challenges and identify

the causal eﬀect of health on education via an instrumental variables strategy. The explicit use of
 52
    This may be due to the fact that the genes are associated with more than one health outcome
in a vector. But if genetic markers cannot separate one health outcome from another, it is hard to
imagine that any nurture or environmental factor could break the statistical association between
these disorders. This issue does not have a simple solution.


                                                  46
genetic markers in empirical social science research is becoming possible due to an ever increasing

understanding of how genetic inheritance relates to individual health outcomes as well as knowledge

from the human genome project. While the decoding of the human genome has been compared to

breakthroughs such as Galileo’s celestial searching or sending a man to the moon since it has the

potential to revolutionize medical treatments, we believe that it also has the ability to shed light on

open questions in the social sciences. For example, the interactions and dynamics between health

behavior and health status together with the information on genes might really be important in a

line of research that tries to assess the impact of health as a form of human capital on many outcomes

of interest to economists such as labor market activity, marriage and educational attainment.

   We find strong statistical evidence that genetic markers indeed show a great deal of promise as

a set of instrumental variables for several health outcomes and behaviors. Using these genes as a

novel source of identification we find that the impact of poor health on academic achievement is

large. Depression and inattention both lead to a 0.5 point decrease on GPA, which is roughly a one

standard deviation reduction in performance. There exists substantial heterogeneity in the impacts

of health status on academic performance as female adolescents are strongly adversely aﬀected by

negative physical and mental health conditions, whereas males are not significantly impacted. In

addition, we find that it is very important for researchers in explaining health status to account for

comorbid health disorders as well as endogenous health enhancing or health deteriorating behaviors.

Our evidence indicates that either treating these behaviors as exogenous or ignoring comorbid

conditions would lead to either diﬀerent signed estimates or substantially larger impacts of health


                                                  47
on education.

   Unfortunately, the results also lead to more questions, particularly in understanding why females

and not males are so adversely aﬀected by poor health outcomes. More research is needed to further

our understanding on this issue. For example, responses to a variety of psychological questionnaires

can be used to shed light on possible diﬀerences between females and males in their self-perception.

Future research could also incorporate additional dynamics such as how parents, teachers and peers

respond to an individual’s changing health state to explore more deeply some of the sources for this

heterogeneity. In conclusion, recent years have witnessed an explosion of findings on the causes and

correlates of health outcomes and behaviors in neurobiology, which could oﬀer a promising source

of predetermined exogenous variations to help identify the impact of health on a set of outcomes of

great interest to economists.

 Note: First stage F statistics is computed from a joint test of significance of the full set of genetic
instruments from individual first stage regressions that also include the full set of control variables
included in the second stage. In each case, the Null is rejected at the 1% level. P-values are
computed from Sargan tests of the joint null hypothesis that the excluded instruments are valid
instruments.
