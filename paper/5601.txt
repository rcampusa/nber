                                              ABSTRACT



       There have been a number of econometric studies of the effect of changes in management

and control on the productivity   and employment       of private, but not of public, enterprises.       This

paper examines    the impact of changes         in political   administration     on the productivity     and

employment    of the entire executive branch of the U.S. government using data compiled under

the Bureau of Labor Statistics’        Federal Productivity    Measurement        Program.    The estimates

indicate that the mean rate of productivity     growth in the first year of administrations      is 2.6 times

as high as the mean growth in subsequent years. Also, employment                growth is strictly increasing

with respect to the administration’s    tenure: 95% of federal employment growth during the period

1967-94 occurred in the fourth or later years of political administrations,        although administrations

were that old only 36% of the time. These findings are broadly consistent with evidence about

the private sector.   They suggest that the inauguration       of a new administration       initially purges

the executive branch, but as an administration’s         tenure increases, fat and inefficiency       tend to

accumulate.

        Previous research has indicated that changes in the

management and control of private enterprises have significant

effects on their productivity and employment.      Lichtenberg and

Siegel (1987, 1990a) found that the productivity of manufacturing

plants increased significantly (relative to average industry

productivity) afier a change in ownership or leveraged buyout.

They also found ( 1990b) that changes in ownership were

associated with substantial reductions in the employment of

(relatively highly-paid) white-collar workers in corporate

headquarters and other “auxiliary establishments” (but not in the

employment of production workers).

        The executive branch of the Federal government, which

employs almost 3 million people, undergoes regular changes in

leadership and control: there is a presidential election eve~ four

years. Although there are many important differences between the

private and public sectors, the hypothesis that control changes

have similar effects on productivity and employment in the two

sectors is a plausible one. 1 However we are not aware of any




‘ Recent research (Lichtenberg ( 1993) and Lehr and Lichtenberg ( 1996))
suggests that the introduction of information technology has similar
effects on productivity in business and government.
previous econometric research on the impact of changes in

administration   on executive branch productivity and employment.

        The lack of existing evidence about the effect of changes

in administration on government productivity is not surprising,

given the general absence of data on the output and productivity

of government enterprises.    But thanks to the Federal Productivity

Measurement Program (FPMP) conducted by the Bureau of

Labor Statistics from 1967 to 1994 (which has unfortunately now

been terminated),   annual time-series data on executive branch

productivity and employment are available, and it is possible to

investigate whether leadership changes have similar effects in the

private and public sectors.

       Under this program, Federal Government agencies

annually submit workload counts (outputs), employment and

compensation     data, along with descriptions of their workloads and

other related information to the BLS. BLS also obtains some data

from annual reports, budgets, or Congressional    hearings. In 1994

the FPMP covered over two million Federal civilian employees

working in 255 organizations within 60 Federal agencies. About

2500 different products and semices were measured by the
                                                                         4


program.2 BLS does not publish organization- or agency-level

data, but it does publish series for the “measured portion” of the

Federal government as a whole, and by “fi.mction,” for 24

government finctions,     such as audit of operations, loans and

grants, and medical services. We will examine the effect of

changes in administration    on productivity and employment on the

total measured portion of the Federal govemment.3

        Summary statistics on annual rates of productivity, output,

and employment growth for the entire measured portion of the

Federal government during the period 1967-94 are presented

below (the data were obtained from Table 1 of BLS Summary 96-

3, “Federal Government Productivity Highlights, 1967-94”):




2 See Forte (199) and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (1994, 1996) for
detailed discussions of the Federal productivity data.
3The output series compiled under the FPMP reflect ~        activities of
the organizations being measured, that is, the outputs used by groups
outside the organization. Not all outputs, however, are fial to the
Federal government in that some measured outputs (e.g., maintenance,
personnel, and supply) are used by other government organizations.
Thus, the FPMP summary statistics reflect the productivity of the
measured organizations, not the Federal government as a whole.
Measured productivity may perhaps be regarded as the sum of true
productivity and a classical (“white-noise”) measurement error. If this
error is uncorrelated with changes in administration, our estimates of the
effect of the latter will be unbiased.

The average annual rate of labor productivity growth--the

difference between the rate of output growth ( 1.4Yo) and the rate

of employment growth (O.30/0)--was 1. 10/O.There is some

evidence of slowdown in Federal productivity:      average rates of

productivity and output growth during the last seven years of the

period (1987-94) were only 0,4% and 0.6Y0, respectively.
        We are interested in examining the relationship between

government productivity and employment grotih         and the “age”

of the political administration,   At. The latter was defined to be

equal to 1 in the first year following each presidential election
(1969, 1973,.,,, 1993), to 2 in the second year, and so forth, The

years 1985-88 were treated as years 5-8 of the Reagan
                                                                            6


administration.     Time-series data for & p, and I are presented in

Table 1.

          Figure 1 is a chart of the mean annual rate of executive

branch productivity growth, by year of political administration.

(Since only the Reagan administration lasted more than four years,

obsewations      for which A exceeded four are grouped into a single

catego~     (5+ years).)   The rate of productivity growth in the first

year is much higher than it is in subsequent years, but there is

essentially no relationship between p and A for A z 2. The null

hypothesis that these five mean growth rates are identical can be

rejected at only about the 20°/0 significance level. However, as

the following regression reveals, the difference between mean

productivity growth in the first year and mean productivity growth

in years 2 through 8 is highly statistically significant (t-statistics in

parentheses):


p,= 90.7 + 1.21 FIRSTYEAR.t            -.045 t +~

   (1.76)       (2.48)                 (1.74)
                   R2 = .285

where FIRSTYEARt           = 1 if& = 1, and otherwise equals zero, and

Q is the residual. This implies that productivity growth in the first
                                                                              7


year of an administration      tends to be 1.2 percentage points higher

than it is afier the first year, Since the average rate of productivity

growth is 1.1Yo,the annual rate of productivi~         growth i)z the first

year is 2.6 times as high as it is in subsequent years; over 40% of

all government productivity growth occurs in the first year of

political administrations.

        Next we consider the relationship between total executive

branch employment growth and the “age” or year of the

administration.   Figure 2 is a chart of mean employment growth

by year of administration.      It indicates that the rate of employment

growth is strictly increasing with respect to age. During the first

year the administration      is in office, employment typically declines

by 0.6V0. In subsequent years, the rate of employment growth

increases, and reaches 0. So/Oin year 4 and 1.0°/0 in years 5-8. The

null hypothesis that these five growth rates are equal can be

rejected at the 7°/0 significance level. These figures indicate that

95% of federal employment growth during the period 1967-94

occurred in the fourth or later years of political administrations,

although administrations       were that old only 36% of the time. 4




442% of federal employment growth occurred in the fifth or later years;
administrations were that old only 14°/0of the time
                                                                       8


        Figure 2 suggests that it is reasonable to postulate that

employment growth depends on the logarithm of A, so we

estimated the following regression:


1, = -0.44 + 0.82 log(AI) + v,

     (1.46)   (3.09)

R2 = .276

(We tried including t and the log of employment in year t- 1 as

regressors, but these variables were insignificant and had almost
no effect on the estimate of the log(&) coefficient.) There is a

significant positive relationship between employment growth and

the age of the administration.

        One possible interpretation    of these results is that the

inauguration of a new administration initially purges the system--

much like new management may purge a company--and places the

government on a diet, restraining employment growth without

sacrificing much output.    (Some authors have suggested that

external shocks other than leadership changes may reduce “fat” or
“X-ineficiency”   in corporations.    Borenstein and Farrell (1 996)

hypothesize that sharp decreases in crude oil prices may have this

effect on oil companies, and Scherer (1992) and others argue that
increases in foreign competition may have this effect on

manufacturing companies,)    But as an administration’s tenure

increases, waste, inefficiency, and fat tend to accumulate in the

executive branch.
