                                                ABSTRACT

A currency union’s ability to increase international trade is one of the most debated questions in international
macroeconomics. This paper studies the dynamics of these trade effects. First, an empirical study of
the European Monetary Union finds that the extensive margin of trade (entry of new firms or goods)
responds several years ahead of overall trade volume. This implies that the intensive margin (previously
traded goods) falls in the run-up to EMU. The paper’s theoretical contribution is to study the announcement
of a future monetary union as a news shock to trade costs in the context of a dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium trade model. Early entry of new firms in anticipation is explainable as a rational forward-looking
response under certain conditions, where essential elements include sunk costs of exporting and heterogeneity
among firms of a type known before entry. The findings help identify which types of trading frictions
are reduced by a currency union. The important role of expectations also indicates that continued gains
from EMU depend upon long-term credibility of the union.

1. Introduction

        A currency union’s ability to increase international trade has been one of the most

debated questions in international macroeconomics, especially since Rose (2000) found

potentially large effects in historical monetary unions. Subsequent literature with improved

methodology and expanded data, including coverage of the European Monetary Union, has

mostly supported the statistical significance of this effect, but estimated lower magnitudes.1

Previous work has also documented that a substantial portion of the trade effect operates at the

extensive margin, that is, trade of goods not previously traded.2 A question that remains elusive

is the mechanism by which a currency union affects trade. In order to help address this question,

this paper studies the dynamics of these trade effects. It identifies new stylized facts about the

timing of effects at the various margins of trade.3 Then by constructing and simulating a

dynamic “new” trade model augmented with news shocks, the paper draws implications

regarding what types of trade cost reductions would be consistent with the observed dynamics.4

        As motivation, the paper presents a new stylized fact in trade data regarding the effects

of European Monetary Union (EMU). Based on disaggregated trade data the paper constructs

measures of the extensive margin of trade (the entry of new goods categories) and the intensive

margin (the amount of trade in previously traded goods categories). Panel regressions are used

  There is an extensive literature on this subject. For a sampling of supporting evidence see Rose and van
Wincoop (2001), Glick and Rose (2002), and Frankel and Rose (2002). For critiques hostile to this view
see Persson (2001), Nitsch (2002), and Baldwin (2006). For empirical studies of the European Monetary
Union, see Micco, Stein, and Ordonez (2003), Baldwin and di Nino (2006), Flam and Nordstrom (2006),
Berthou and Fontagne (2008), and Frankel 2010. Estimates for the effect on trade in the EMU range from
5% to 20%.

  Papers studying the effect of EMU on the extensive margin of trade, including Baldwin and di Nino
(2006), Flam and Nordstrom (2006), and Berthou and Fontagne (2008), estimate a rise in the extensive
margin in the range of 6% to 19%.
3
  While Micco, Stein and Ordonez (2003) consider the timing of overall trade effects, finding that effects
begin in 1998, they do not consider the extensive margin. While Flam and Nordstrom(2006) measure the
extensive margin for years prior to EMU, their objective is to compare the pre-EMU (1995-1998) period to
post-EMU (2002-2005), taking the earlier period as a benchmark rather than considering the possibility that
these early periods could themselves show an increase in the extensive margin.

                                                                                                         1
to identify the effect of adopting EMU on these two margins of trade, where dummies are used

to indicate effects in years both before and after actual EMU adoption. Estimates indicate that

the extensive margin began to rise already four years ahead of actual EMU adoption. While

initial increases in the extensive margin are small, they are found to be very significant

statistically, and to grow gradually over time to reach a maximum 3 years after EMU adoption.

These dynamics contrast sharply with the dynamics of overall trade, where effects become

significant much later (around one year prior to EMU adoption), with magnitudes that initially

are much smaller than the extensive margin. This implies that the intensive margin, the

difference between overall trade and the extensive margin, is negative in the run-up to EMU

adoption. This effect dies out several years after adoption, as the extensive margin effect

declines over time and the overall trade effect catches up.

        It is striking that new goods appear to enter the export market before the monetary

union actually generates an increase in trade. Some previous papers have discussed the need for

dynamics to account for gradual adjustment to new trade opportunities, such as time to build to

generate a sluggish response of new entry. But the evidence here is the opposite; rather than

being sluggish, entry instead anticipates the future trade opportunities created by EMU. It is

true that EMU did not become certain until a year before adoption, with announcement in 1998

of those countries satisfying the convergence criteria. However, when firms respond to shifts in

expectations, the future profit opportunities need not be known with certainty; a simple shift in

probabilities of uncertain events can induce changes in firm decisions. Exporting may well

involve one-time sunk costs, such as one-time investment in distribution networks abroad.

Given that paying a sunk cost presents the opportunity but not the requirement to sell abroad,

the option value of establishing a presence in foreign market could become justified based upon

rising probabilities of states of nature where exporting is profitable, even if these states are not




                                                                                                  2
realized in the end. These facts suggest a need for trade models augmented with expectations

and forward looking behavior in response to news about the future.

        The theoretical contribution of the paper is to construct a trade model to understand the

role of news shocks and shifts in expectations. We believe it is the first of the “new” dynamic

trade models with firm heterogeneity to study the role of news shocks. The model focuses on

real variables and abstracts from money and nominal exchange rates. Because the countries

joining the European Monetary Union previously belonged to a system of mutually fixed

exchange rates, EMU is not associated with a significant reduction in exchange rate volatility,

or a significant change in monetary policy rules or shocks. Instead the model studies the

adoption of a common currency as the elimination of trade costs of various types, frictions

associated with currency conversion or other reduction in the significance of national borders.

The model studies the effect of a news shock, whereby an announcement is made about a future

reduction in these trade costs. These trade frictions can take one of several forms in the model:

iceberg trade costs proportional to trade volume, fixed costs paid each period, and a one-time

sunk cost. The model differs from Ghironi and Melitz (2005) and most models in the literature

in assuming a distinct sunk cost for exporting, which is necessary for the extensive margin to

respond to a news shock.

        The first theoretical finding is that the anticipation effect of monetary unions on the

extensive margin can be explained as rational forward-looking behavior, but it requires sunk

costs and firm heterogeneity of a particular type. They key is heterogeneity in the present value

of anticipated future profits of firms. Standard models of heterogeneity in terms of firm

marginal costs realized after entry (as in the canonical model of Ghironi and Melitz, 2005) turn

out not to satisfy this condition, nor does a simple model of learning by doing. What does work

is heterogeneity in the sunk costs of entry, capturing the fact that some types of goods are

harder to introduce into new markets than others. This may reflect more extensive distribution


                                                                                                  3
networks or more demanding product standards required for some types of goods. Without this

feature, firms contemplating entry in periods prior to the monetary union adoption correctly

anticipate that entry of firms in the future period of adoption will compete away profits in

excess of the sunk cost, eliminating the incentive for early entry. However, heterogeneity in

terms of the size of the sunk costs of entry will imply that profits per firm will remain at a

higher level after the adoption, equal to the sunk cost of the marginal exporter. If firms with

high productivity or lower entry costs know this prior to making the entry decision, this implies

an expectation for future profits in excess of sunk costs, thereby justifying their early entry.

The model also studies an experiment using a second-order approximation to show that this

entry in anticipation of future monetary union is robust to moderate levels of uncertainty about

the future.

        A second theoretical finding is that the model also points to iceberg costs as the key

trade costs reduced by the monetary union adoption. A news shock reducing the sunk cost itself

leads to an exit of firms prior to adoption rather than the observed entry. Further, a news shock

reducing the fixed cost of trade fails to generate the observed rise in overall export volume

upon adoption.

        Third, the finding that the extensive margin anticipates adoption suggests that a

significant portion of the welfare gains of adopting a monetary union, which work through love

of variety in utility, rely upon expectations of a monetary union and precede its actual adoption.

This indicates that continued gains from a monetary union rely upon expectations for the

union’s continued existence in the long run; an expectation of future union dissolution would

reduce the welfare gains.

        The next section of the paper discusses the empirical methodology and new stylized

facts. Section three defines the model, and section four discusses the simulation results.




                                                                                                   4
2. Empirical Motivation

         The study uses a panel dataset which covers exports at an annual frequency from 1973

to 2004. The trade data of 1973-2000 come from the NBER-UN World Trade Data set,

developed by Rob Feenstra and Robert Lipsey, documented in Feenstra et al. (2005). The trade

data after 2000 come from the UN Comtrade Data set, developed as the same way as in

Feenstra et al. (2005). This data set computes annual bilateral trade flows at the four-digit

Standard International Trade Classification, by performing a series of adjustments on UN trade

data5.

     Following Hummels and Klenow (2005), the extensive margin is measured in a manner

consistent with consumer price theory by adapting the methodology in Feenstra (1994).

The extensive margin of exports from country j to m, denoted by EM mj , is defined as


                                              X         W
                                                         m ,i
                                              i∈I mj
                                    EM mj =                                                             (1)
                                                  X mW

where X mW,i is the export value from the world to country m of category i. I mj is the set of

observable categories in which country j has positive exports to country m, and X mW is the

aggregate value of world exports to country m. The extensive margin is a weighted count of j’s

categories relative to all categories exported to m, where the categories are weighted by their

importance in world’s exports to country m.

     The corresponding intensive margin of exports from country j to m, denoted as IM mj is

defined as

  It is noted that the data purchased from the UN for 1984-2000 only had values in excess of $100,000, for
each bilateral flow. To be consistent, the cutoff of exports in this study is set as $100,000, which implies
that goods are considered nontradable if an export value of the category is less than $100,000.


                                                                                                          5
                                             X mj
                                       IM = j
                                                                                                                          (2)
                                             X mW,i
                                            m

                                                  i∈I mj



where X mj is the total export value from country j to country m. The intensive margin is

measured as j’s export value relative to the weighted categories in which country j exports to

country m. Therefore, multiplying the intensive margin by the extensive margin can get country

j’s share of world exports to country m, EXSharemj :

                                                X mj
                             EXSharemj =             = EM mj IM mj
                                                X mW                                                                      (3)

     The categories of goods exported might differ across exporters and change over time.

With the same level of share of world exports to country m at time t, the measurement implies

that country j would have a higher extensive margin measure if it exports many different

categories of products to country m, whereas, it would have a higher intensive margin if

country j only export a few categories to country m.

     Separate panel regressions are run by regressing in turn the extensive margin, the intensive

margin, and the exporter’s total share on the currency union status as well as controls. Controls

include membership in the European Union, which entailed economic reforms that could be

expected to raise bilateral trade themselves, as well as the standard set of variables representing

country size and distance used in gravity trade models to explain bilateral trade. The

benchmark regressions take the form:

   Y jm ,t = β 0 + β 1 EMU jm ,t + β 2 EU jm ,t + β 3 EUTrend jm ,t + λX   jm , t   + γF jm ,t + φ t + κEX + ωIM + ε jm ,t (4)

The model is estimated by ordinary least squares with robust standard errors clustered in export

pair level, where j is the exporter and m is the importer. The dependent variables (Yjm,t) will be

either the logarithm of country j’s extensive margin of exports to country m, the logarithm of

country j’s intensive margin, or the logarithm of share of world exports. Regressors include


                                                                                                                            6
dummies for the currency union status, EMUjm,t. A dummy for the European Union, EU jm ,t ,

is included to control the impact of a free trade area on export. However, the European

Union may become a deeper agreement and increase the impacts over time, so

EUTrend jm,t is included to control the EU effects on export through time. The regressor

Xjm,t is a set of variables that vary over time, which includes the logarithm of real GDP per

capita of exporter j relative to real GDP per capita of all countries who export to importer m,

logarithm of exporter j’s population relative to real GDP per capita of all countries who export

to importer m, and a dummy variable indicating whether the two countries had a free trade

agreement at time t. Fjm is a set of variables that do not vary over time, such as the logarithm

of distance between country j and m, a common language dummy, a land border dummy. Also

included is a time effect, t, to control for time-specific factors such as global shocks or business

cycles.

     To avoid omitting variables that may affect bilateral trade, two vectors of dummy

variables, EX and IM, are included indicating exporter and importer fixed effects. As Anderson

and van Wincoop (2003) proposed, country effects are included as controls for multilateral

resistance. We decided to use separate country fixed effects for each country as exporter and

importer, because in contrast with the related literature on trade flows, our dependent variable

specifies the direction of trade.

     We begin by reporting result for a sample of 15 European countries, including 3 countries

which are not members of the monetary union.6 Initial results using country fixed effects are

reported in the first three columns of Table 1. Joining EMU raised overall exports by 11.9%,

which is smaller than the effects originally found by Rose but similar to those found by other

  The countries included are Austria, Belgium-Luxembourg, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom. Ten of these joined the
monetary union in 1999, and Greece joined in 2001. Denmark, Sweden, and United Kingdom did not join
the monetary union.


                                                                                                       7
researchers focusing on a European sample.7 The effect is slightly smaller in magnitude than

the effect of entry into the EU. The first column indicates that the majority of this trade effect

occurs at the extensive margin, which rises by 6.3%. In fact, while the effect at the extensive

margin is statistically significant, that at the intensive margin is not. This result emphasizes the

importance of the extensive margin for understanding the trade effects of monetary unions.

The remaining columns confirm that this result is robust to alternative sets of controls, such as

country-year fixed effects to control for time-varying multilateral resistance in the

determination of the trade pattern, and country-pair fixed effects to control for the bilateral

tendency to trade instead of the multilateral resistance.

           Table 2 reports result regarding the dynamics of these trade effects over time. The

regression equation is augmented with leads and lags of the EMU indicator variable, to capture

the effects of EMU before and after adoption.

The main finding is that the extensive margin rises well ahead of the actual adoption of the

monetary union. All three sets of estimations agree on this point, all showing a statistically

significant positive coefficient on all leads of the EMU indicator in their respective extensive

margin regressions. The magnitudes of this effect are similar to those found in table 1, tending

to be somewhat smaller in years prior to EMU, and larger in years following actual adoption of

EMU. The three sets of estimations vary among themselves regarding values of other

coefficients. Overall trade rises one year ahead of EMU adoption under country fixed effects

and country-pair fixed effects; trade rises earlier under country-pair fixed effects. The intensive

margin is either insignificantly different from zero or negative in the run-up to EMU depending

on the estimation, but tends to become significantly positive several years following

implementation.

        In order to get more precise estimates, we follow Frankel (2010) in expanding the data

set to all available countries. The full country sample covers 148 countries after combining all

the data sets8, so we include all of these in the gravity regression above. We augment the

regression equation with an additional indicator variable to control for currency unions other

than EMU. Consequently, the EMU indicator variables remain specific to the monetary union

in Europe, and the coefficients on these indicators can continue to be interpreted as the effect

EMU.

        Results are reported in Table 3. The additional data produce highly significant

parameter estimates both for estimations using country fixed effects and country-year fixed

effects, and there is a close correspondence in results between these two cases. We will focus

on results for the latter estimation, as this controls for time-varying multilateral resistance,

which past literature has emphasized as a potential source of bias. In contrast, estimates from

using country pair fixed effects lack statistical significance. Country-pair fixed effects could be

useful if trade resistance is bilateral rather than multilateral in nature. However, it eliminates

cross-sectional variation in the panel and leaves only time-series variation. Given that the vast

majority of the new countries added to this larger sample have not entered or left a currency

union during this sample period, these additional countries yield no information in the estimate.

See Bergin and Lin (2009) for a discussion of this point.

        Figure 1 plots the regression coefficients arising from the time-varying fixed effects

estimation. Estimates agree with the main conclusion of Table 2, showing a significant rise in

the extensive margin in anticipation of EMU adoption, but estimates here offer greater

precision and details about the dynamics. The extensive margin effect can now be seen to rise

smoothly and gradually over time. Estimates are small and insignificantly different from zero

for initial years, but the effect becomes significant starting four years prior to EMU adoption.

This contrasts with the overall effect on trade, which does not become significant until much

later, one or two years before EMU adoption depending on the criterion for significance. The

magnitude of the extensive margin effect in these periods is also much larger than that on

overall trade. This implies that the effect on the intensive margin of trade, the difference

between overall and extensive margin, is actually negative. We can confirm that the difference

between the two is statically significant, as Column 8 of Table 3 reports coefficients in the

intensive margin regression, and shows that EMU dummies are significantly negative for all

periods preceding EMU adoption.

        The figure also shows that the dynamics change after EMU adoption. The extensive

margin effect reaches its maximum about 3 years after adoption, and then falls in remaining

years. At this point the overall trade effect nearly catches up with the extensive margin. Overall

trade and the extensive margin rise 44% and 55% respectively. This is larger than the estimates

from the European country sample in Table 2, though still much smaller than estimates of

currency union effects from the work of Rose. These larger values do correspond with those

found in Frankel (2010), which argued that an expanded data set, in terms of time an countries,

is helpful in detecting EMU effects. The narrowing of the difference between extensive margin

and overall trade after EMU adoption is confirmed by the fact that the intensive margin

coefficients are no longer significantly negative.

        It is striking that new goods appear to entry the export market before the monetary

union actually generates an increase in trade. Why would firms enter a market when a constant

level of trade must be divided among more firms, presumably leading to a fall in profits? Given

the part of firms, in response to news about future policy changes and rise in opportunities for

trade. Such anticipation effects cannot be explained in the context of a standard static trade

model, where trade and entry occur simultaneously. Some previous papers have discussed the

need for dynamics to account for gradual adjustment to new trade opportunities, such as time to

build to generate a sluggish response of new entry. But the evidence here is the opposite; rather

than being sluggish, entry instead anticipates the future trade opportunities. These facts suggest

the need for trade models augmented with expectations and forward looking behavior in

response to news about the future.9



3. Benchmark Theoretical Model

         Consider a model of two symmetric countries, home and foreign, which trade with each

other. Engaging in trade involves paying several types of trade costs: iceberg costs, fixed costs

each period, and a one-time sunk cost. The model differs from Ghironi and Melitz (2005) and

most models in the literature in assuming a distinct sunk cost for exporting.10 The ability to

generate an anticipation effect in the extensive margin in response to a news shock depends

upon a sunk cost associated with exports.

         Although the model is motivated by study of a monetary union, the model focuses on

real variables and abstracts from money and nominal exchange rates. Because the countries

joining the European Monetary Union previously belonged to a system of mutually fixed

exchange rates, EMU is not associated with a reduction in exchange rate volatility, or any

significant change in monetary policy rules or shocks. Instead the model studies the adoption of


9
  The dynamic models of Ghironi and Melitz (2005) includes forward looking behavior, but it does not
study anticipated future changes in trade liberalization, so like standard trade models, it does not study the
possibility of trade response in the absence of a current rise in trade volume.
10
   Ruhl (2008) and Arkolakis (2009) allow for a distinct sunk entry cost for exporting.

other reduction in the significance of national borders.



3.1 Goods market structure

      Overall demand (D) in the home country is an aggregate of n H varieties of home goods

and n F varieties of goods exported from the foreign country. The aggregator is CES, with a

potentially distinct elasticity between home and foreign goods aggregates ( φ ), and among

varieties from a given country ( μ ).

3.2 Home household problem

        The representative home household derives utility from consumption (C) and disutility

from labor (L). Households derive income by selling their labor (L) at the nominal wage rate

(W), receiving real profits from home firms ( Π ).There is no international asset trade, so trade

is balanced between the two countries.

        Household optimization for the home country may be written:

3.3 Home firm problem

        There are two types of home firms, those selling in the domestic market and those that

engage in export. The markets are monopolistically competitive, with free entry subject to a

                                                *
one-time sunk cost, KHt for domestic firms and KHt for exporters. This setup cost may be

viewed as a type of investment analogous to that in physical capital in other DSGE models.

Home exports to the foreign market are subject to a fixed export cost each period FHt* t, in units

of labor, as well as a proportional iceberg trade cost, τ Ht
                                                          *
                                                             . It is assumed that fraction δ of firms

must exogenously exit the market each period. Production for all firms is linear in labor:

                                                yt ( i ) = ALt ( i ) .                          (16)

where A represents technology common to all production firms in the country.

        To determine prices and entry in the home market, the home firm maximizes current

home market profits plus discounted future home market profits, π H ,t ( i ) + vH ,t , where:

new firms (20-21, 26-27), market clearing for goods and labor markets (28, 29), definition of

    The macro parameters are taken at standard real business cycle values: ρ = 1 (log utility),

ψ =1 (unitary labor supply elasticity), μ =6 (implying a price markup of 20%), and β =0.96 to

represent an annual frequency. The elasticity of substation between home and foreign goods is

calibrated at φ =3, the median estimate from Broda and Weinstein (2006). The calibration of

δ =0.10 follows Ghironi and Melitz (2005) to match data on the annual job destruction rate of




                                                                                               17
10%. Home bias in preferences is set at θ =0.66 so that the trade share in GDP is 70%, which is

representative for EU counties (European Commission, 2006).

    Trade costs are calibrated based on outside studies. The steady state iceberg cost τ H is set
                                                                                                  *

with the fixed costs set at FH =0.07 so that 21 % of total home firms export (as in Ghironi

and Melitz, 2005). For the purpose of impulse responses, we begin by assuming that trade cost

shocks are permanent: ρτ = ρτ = 1 .

4. Simulation Results

4.1. Benchmark model

        Figure 2 reports impulse responses in log deviations from steady state. The shock is a

drop in iceberg trade costs announced in period 1 that will occur in period 8, which we will

refer to as period T. The timing represents the signing of the Maastricht treaty in 1992,

formalizing plans to begin a common currency seven years later in 1999. The size of the shock

is calibrated so that exports rise by the 12% magnitude observed in the empirical section, which

requires a drop in iceberg trade costs from 0.20 to 0.165. The key result is that the figure

indicates no effect on overall trade or the number of exporting firms in anticipation of the

monetary union; both rise first in period T where trade costs actually fall.

        This may seem surprising, since one might think that firms would be willing to pay the

one-time sunk cost of entry as soon as they begin to expect a rise in profits in future periods.

But intuition comes from examining the entry condition combining (23) and (26)

The general principle is that under free entry, an expectation of future trade cost reduction does

not predict a rise in discounted future profits per firm, but instead a rise in the future number of

firms. Begin by considering firm decisions in period t=T-1 for entry in period t+1=T: firms will

progressively enter this period until discounted profits per firm are driven down to the point that

they just barely cover the sunk cost of entry with no extra profits left over. Because the sunk

entry cost in T-1 is the same as in all previous periods, entry guarantees that the value of

discounted profits per firm must also be the same as in previous periods. Now consider the firm

decision one period earlier, in period t=T-2 for entry in T-1. Firms anticipate the equilibrium in

the next period, and realize there will be no extra profits per firm, so there is no additional benefit

to entry. Conversely, extra entry in period T-1 would lower single-period profits in that period

because monetary union has not begun and sales have not yet risen. New entry in period T-1

would imply a fall in profits per firm in that initial period, so entry in T-1 implies a stream of

profits that will not cover the sunk cost of entry. The fact that firms correctly anticipate future

entry that eats up extra future profits that might have compensated for lower profits in the initial

periods before monetary union removes the incentive to enter in any earlier period.

        Figure 2 coincides with this description. While single-period export firm profits do rise

prior to period T, equation (34) makes clear that profits must be discounted by the marginal

utility of consumption. The figure shows that consumption rises along with single-period

profits to maintain a nearly constant level of discounted profit stream and firm value. Firm

value rises only in period T by a small amount, along with the small rise in home wage which

raises the effective entry cost when converted from labor units.



4.2. Productivity heterogeneity

        One might think that firm heterogeneity could alter this result. If some firms are more

productive than others, these firms will have profits even after less productive firms enter in


                                                                                                19
later periods, which would justify immediate entry of the most productive firms. We follow the

convention for modeling firm heterogeneity under a sunk cost as discussed in Ghironi and

Melitz (2005), hereafter GM. Firms pay the sunk cost of entry before knowing their

productivity draw, so that the sunk cost decision depends upon expectations of productivity,

that is, firm averages.11 Our model differs from GM in that we wish to specify a sunk cost

associated with the exporting decision not just firm entry into the domestic market. As in the

benchmark model above, this is facilitated by assuming that exportable and domestically

consumed goods are produced by distinct sectors populated by two distinct sets of firms, so that

firm creation in the export sector is synonymous with entry into the export market.

            For firms in the export sector, a firm-specific productivity term z augments production:

yt ( i ) = At z ( i ) Lt ( i ) . Following GM, firm productivity is assumed to follow a Pareto

distribution with shape parameter k and lower bound zmin : G ( z ) = 1 − ( zmin z ) . Productivity

   An alternative would be to allow firms to pay the sunk cost after knowing their productivity draw as in
Ruhl (2008). This would greatly amplify the complexity of model solution, as one would need to track the
productivity levels of all firms at all periods, rather than taking aggregate variables as functions of average
productivity as in Ghironi and Melitz (2005). We consider the possibility of heterogeneity known at the
time of entry later in the paper, where heterogeneity takes a form that does not pose this problem for model
solution.

        Calibrations follow GM, setting zmin to 1 and choosing k so that the standard deviation

of firm size, which equals 1 ( k − μ + 1) , is 1.67 to match evidence on the firm size distribution.

        Figure 3 reports the impulse response to the pre-announced reduction in iceberg trade

cost considered above. As in the previous model without firm heterogeneity, the figure shows

there is no rise in the number of exporting firms in periods prior to the trade cost reduction. The

intuition is that firms do not know before paying the sunk cost whether they will have high or

low productivity, so heterogeneity has no impact on the sunk cost decision above. Firms

considering the possibility of early entry expect to have the same productivity as later entrants,

so they expect that their future profits will be the same as that for later entrants. As in the

previous experiment, firms expect future entry will bid down profits to the point of just

covering sunk costs of those future entrants. So early entry in periods of lower or negative

initial profits cannot be justified by an expectation of higher than average future profits for

those early entrants.



4.3 Main Result: Sunk cost heterogeneity

        Another form that heterogeneity could take would be in sunk trade costs. Following

Ruhl (2008), suppose a distribution of sunk costs G ( KHt ) = ( KHt* KH* max ) , where KH* max is an
                                                       *                                 χ




upper bound on the sunk cost, and χ characterizes heterogeneity. Denoting the full set of

potential exporters as nH* max and the set of entrants at the end of a period as nxH* = nH* + neH* ,

we write nxH* = G ( KHt
                     *
                        ) nH* max , which implies the sunk cost of the marginal entrant rises with
the fraction of potential firms engaged in the market:



                                                                                                  21

                                                                     H max
                                                                           χ

This requires that the entry condition be written in terms of the marginal firm, i = nxH* ,t +1 :

                                                                                      χ

                                                                            *          

                                                                            nH max  Wt .
                                  v*
                                    H ,t   ( nx ) =
                                                  *
                                                  H ,t +1
                                                                            At            Pt
                                                                                                                    (37)


Note this entry condition is different from Ghironi and Melitz (2005) in that it applies to the

marginal firm, evaluated after the value of the heterogeneous sunk cost is known, rather than

being evaluated for average firm value, based on expected values of the heterogeneous term. It

also is simpler than the specification of Ruhl (2008), in that there is no heterogeneity in firm

marginal costs or profits, which would require a different and much more complex solution

method to track the evolution of heterogeneity. The main point is that firms can be ranked at

any given point in time in terms of their willingness to enter the export market, and it is the

sunk cost of the marginal firm that determines the equilibrium level of profit per firm in each

period. So while the profit per firm after entry in period T will just cover the sunk cost of the

marginal new entrant, it will more than cover the lower sunk cost of the other entrants that

period, with extra profit left over. Since firms are forward looking, these firms will correctly

anticipate these excess profits, and see a motivation for entry in earlier periods. Future entrants

will not eat up all extra profits, because these later firms must deal with higher sunk costs.

        Aggregating over heterogeneous sunk costs, the resource constraint becomes:

The parameter χ is calibrated at 0.190, the values implied by the calibration in Ruhl (2008) for

the common value of productivity among our firms (A=1).13 The maximum sunk cost in the

distribution, KH* max , is taken to be twice the value of the sunk cost assumed in earlier

simulations, and the maximum number of exporters, nH* max , is assumed to be twice the steady

state number of exporters in earlier simulations.

        Impulse responses reported in Figure 4 indicate significant entry investment

immediately in the period where the shock is announced, leading to a larger number of firms

starting in the second period. Profits fall in the initial period, as new entrants divide up the

given export sales among more competitors. But entry occurs nonetheless, because the fall in

current profits is compensated by higher future profits for these firms with low sunk costs. As

the date of the shock approaches, yet further firms enter, as there are a smaller number of

periods of lower profits before the higher single-period profits begin in period T, making the

present value of entry positive for a wider subset of the distribution of firms. Note also that the

response in overall exports differs from that of the number of firms, in that it does not rise

significantly prior to the actual shock. This coincides nicely with the empirical evidence

reported earlier that the extensive margin responded to EMU several years ahead of overall

exports. The reason is that while the extensive margin is driven mainly by sunk costs and

forward looking behavior, the demand for imports is driven primarily by the relative price and

hence by iceberg trade costs in that period.

        This experiment demonstrates that expectations about a future monetary union generate

a rise in the number of varieties available for consumption. Equation (7) shows that the utility


13
  Ruhl (2008) introduces sunk cost heterogeneity in order to explain the entry of small exporters, which
requires a correlation of sunk cost heterogeneity with productivity heterogeneity. The purpose here is
different, and introducing of Ruhl’s productivity heterogeneity would not be solvable using our current
methods. We borrow the specification and calibration of sunk cost heterogeneity from Ruhl for
convenience. The result is robust to alternative calibrations of the parameters.


                                                                                                           23
of consuming imports rises as a fixed expenditure on imports is spread over more varieties, due

the love of variety, γ . Given that the standard Dixit-Stiglitz preferences imply a love of

variety γ = μ ( μ − 1) , under our calibration utility from consumption rises by an extra 20% for

each percentage rise in varieties. Given that these welfare gains begin well before the monetary

union is formed due to firm entry in anticipation, one might likewise wonder what would be the

implications if firms begin to expect a future dissolution of a monetary union? Given that the

model is solved in a linearized form, the impulse responses for such an experiment would be

the exact inverse of those in figure 4. Firms would begin to exit as soon as expectations are

formed for a future dissolution and the exit would build over time, leading to an immediate loss

in welfare from consumption.

        Achieving entry in anticipation of EMU is by no means dependent upon a high degree

of curvature in the distribution of firms, as summarized by χ . An alternative calibration for

χ would be to match the steady state share of firms exporting, at 21%. The preceding

calibration implies a value of low sunk cost in steady state and hence a large number of

exporting firms. A value of χ =0.6 restores the steady state sunk cost and share of exporting

firms to the values assumed in previous experiments. Fig. 5a shows that the entry in

anticipation of EMU is somewhat smaller in the earliest periods, but grows large several

periods prior to EMU implementation.

         Figure 5b demonstrates that for a lower deprecation rate ( δ = 0.01 ), initial firm entry

in anticipation of the shock equals about two thirds of the full entry when the shock is later

realized. Firms are more willing to enter if they are more likely to still be around to reap the

benefits of the extra profits in the future.

        The result is also sensitive to the intertemporal elasticity of households, 1 ρ , because

                                                                                            ρ
this determines the stochastic discount factor used to discount future profits, ( Ct + s Ct ) . Recall


                                                                                                  24
from discussion of Figure 1 that the ability of future profits to encourage entry is dampened by

the rise in consumption and the discounting of these future profits. A lower value of ρ lowers

the degree of discounting implied by rising consumption. Figure 5c shows the case where ρ =

0.3, so that the rise in future profits has greater power to encourage new entry. Recall that the

entry decision for entry in period T is unique, in that new entrants benefit from the increased

sales induced by the shock but do not pay sunk cost at the higher wage rate induced by the

shock, so there is the possibility of some degree of overshooting in the amount of entry in the

initial period of the shock above the long-run level. This overshooting was precluded in Figure

2 by the fact that future rises in consumption led to greater discounting of future profits. But the

figure shows that this overshooting occurs once the discounting is dampened. This offers one

potential explanation to the empirical finding that the extensive margin has its maximum effect

right around the time of EMU implementation, and the extensive margin retreats somewhat

thereafter.

        Finally, the model is used to evaluate the effects of cuts in alternative costs. Figure 6a

reports the result of a news shock cutting the sunk cost of exporting firms by 5% in period 8,

announced in period 1. The model simulated includes sunk cost heterogeneity as described

above (with χ calibrated at 0.6), with KH* ,t from equation (36) now interpreted as the mean of

an AR(1) process for sunk costs with log normal shocks. Fig. 6a shows that entry actually falls

in the periods after the announcement, as firms wait for the lower sunk costs before entering.

This fall in entry is at odds with the empirical evidence, and suggests that EMU does not raise

trade primarily by lowering sunk costs.

        Figure 6b studies the effect of a shock lowering by 5% the fixed cost of trade FH* ,t in

period 8, announced in period 1. This shock does predict a rise in entry prior to the shock. But

it fails to predict the sizeable rise in exports; exports rise only a third as much has the rises in


                                                                                                  25
entry, as the extra trade arises solely from love for variety. Further, trade rises in periods prior

to the trade cost cut, as it is driven by the love of variety and hence moves in sync with the

extensive margin. These failures indicate that EMU likely does not work primarily through

lower fixed costs of trade.



4.4 Learning by doing

         Consider finally the possibility of learning by doing, whereby firms become more

efficient at producing if they engaged in production and export previously. Such learning by

doing has been used in the macroeconomic literature for other purposes such as generating

endogenous persistence.14 In the present context, one might expect that if exporting firms

become more efficient from experience, this might induce firms to enter prior to EMU

implementation, so that they are prepared to take greater advantage of these trade opportunities

when they arise later.

         Learning by doing will be modeled here in terms of the fixed cost of production, F.15

Firms that were previously producing and active in the export market have acquired experience

that lowers their fixed cost in future periods. For simplicity we assume there is a one-time

permanent reduction in fixed costs of a given export firm by fraction ζ starting in the firm’s

second period of production.

         This implies modifying firm value as follows for home exporters:

  See for example Lahiri and Johri (2008).

  Learning by doing is typically introduced by specifying marginal costs of production as a negative
function of past output levels. This version is not possible in the context of a sunk cost of entry, as it would
lead to a proliferation of state variables. We would have to keep track of each generation of new entrants
over all past periods, and how long they have been present in the market, in order to specify their marginal
costs. This would produce a complex cross-sectional distribution of marginal costs that would be difficult
to aggregate over.

Likewise for foreign exporters. The labor market clearing condition needs to be augmented to

account for the extra fixed costs, which use labor:

        Figure 7 reports impulse responses for the usual cut in iceberg trade costs used in

earlier simulations. Again results show there is no entry prior to the period of implementation.

It is true that learning by doing makes firms more willing to enter during initial periods of low

profits in periods before EMU implementation. But this incentive also applies to firms that

enter later in the period of implementation. Because they too are willing to enter with a lower

level of initial period profits, there is greater entry in the period of implementation, which

brings down the equilibrium level of profit per firm in that period. Firms contemplating entry in

earlier periods anticipate this additional future entry and the resulting lower future profits. This

offsets the incentive for early entry, resulting in no extra entry in early periods.



4.5. Uncertainty about future monetary union

        Although the Maastricht Treaty already in 1992 set a date for monetary union, the final

list of countries participating did not become final until announced in 1998. Our results suggest

that there was entry of new exporting firms based upon an uncertain prospect for a future

monetary union. The stochastic model above can analyze entry under uncertainty about trade



                                                                                                                                              27
costs if we alter the experiment studied above in two respects. First, the model must be solved

to a second order approximation rather than a linear approximation, as linearization implies

certainty equivalence. Second, rather than modeling the announcement of the future monetary

union as a shock to trade costs, model it as a shift in the mean of the stochastic distribution of

trade costs. In particular,

                             Ht   − logτ Ht

                                            )
                                            = ε *t

                 ( logτ      Ft             )
                                  − logτ Ft = ε *t

                 (ε   *
                       t   , ε *t )  N ( 0,σ I ) .

                                     and τ Ft , take the value 0.2 for the first seven periods and

then drop to 0.165 in all future periods, and this shift is fully anticipated by all agents. Shocks

are independently normally distributed with zero mean and benchmark standard deviation of σ .

Although the mean of the distribution shifts in a way fully anticipated by agents, there is still

uncertainty about the realized value of trade costs in a given period, as shocks make trade costs

fluctuate around the mean. The trajectory of all endogenous variables are solved for a sequence

of 50 draws for the shocks, and the mean over simulations is reported. We simulate the version

of the model with heterogeneity in sunk as reported in Fig. 4 previously.

        For a calibration of σ =0, where there is no uncertainty in the model, the mean

trajectories of variables are identical to those in Fig. 4, as should be expected. The maximum

rise in overall trade (in period 8) is 8.7% and the rise in the number of firms is 2.1%. As the

calibration of σ is increased, the degree of uncertainty about future trade cost levels

progressively rises. Given random fluctuations in trade costs in periods after as well as before

the date set for EMU adoption, it is possible that the realization of trade costs may not be

smaller in a post EMU period than a period before EMU. For example, for the calibration of

σ =0.010 the probability that trade cost in the period after EMU implementation will be


                                                                                                28
lower than the period of the announcement is 64%.16 In other words there is a 36% chance

that trade costs will not fall in the period of EMU implementation. The second order

solution of the model indicates that this uncertainty dampens somewhat the maximum impact

of the EMU announcement, but the effect is very modest. Under σ =0.010 the impact on the

number of exporting firms remains at 98% of its impact under no uncertainty, and the trade

volume rise is unaffected.

              As σ is progressively raised the probability of a trade cost fall after EMU

progressively falls. For very large σ the model approaches its limit of a 50/50 chance of trade

costs falling, which approximates an expectation that EMU will not take place or not be

effective. Fig. 8 plots what fraction of the impact under certainty survives for various levels of

uncertainty. Trade volumes appear to be unaffected by the uncertainty. The extensive margin is

affected noticeably only for very high degrees of uncertainty, as the probability of lower trade

costs reaches close to the limit of 50%, with very minimal impacts otherwise.

              One reason that uncertainty may have small effects could be the model calibration of a

lower value of ρ , the coefficient of relative risk aversion, at unity. We can consider a larger

degree of risk aversion at ρ =3, which is at the upper range of risk aversion typically

considered in the DSGE models. The results for this calibration of the model are also reported

in Fig. 8. Trade volume is little affected by uncertainty. The extensive margin now is affected

for somewhat lower degrees of uncertainty, with the impact reduced to 96% of its maximum

for a probability (of trade cost reduction) of 64%, and the impact is reduced to 84% for a

probability of 57% . Again the impact is reduced near zero as the probability approaches its

limit of 50%. It is remarkable that even at this hightened sensitivity to risk, the results support

the conclusion that firms will respond strongly to the possibility of trade cost reduction, even if

there is a good deal of uncertainty about whether that future trade cost reduction will actually

take place.



5. Conclusion

        A currency union’s ability to increase international trade is one of the most debated

questions in international macroeconomics. This paper employs a DSGE model to study the

dynamics of these trade effects. First, original empirical work with data from the European

Monetary Union finds that the extensive margin of trade (entry of new goods) responds ahead

of the intensive margin (increased trade of existing goods). The number of products being

traded begins to rise several years prior to the currency union adoption, peaking near the time

of adoption and attenuating somewhat thereafter. A DSGE model indicates that this dynamic

response in firm entry is explainable as a rational forward-looking response to a news shock

about a future monetary union which is expected to lower iceberg (ie. proportional) trade costs,

and where entry in the foreign market involves a one-time sunk cost that is heterogeneous

across goods. The model indicates that alternative explanations for a currency union trade

effect, that it lowers the sunk cost or a fixed but repeated cost of trade, are inconsistent with the

dynamics of the extensive margin evidence. This finding helps identify which types of trading

frictions are reduced by adopting a currency union, and it indicates that a significant fraction of

the welfare gains from a monetary union are dependent upon the expectation by traders that a

monetary union will continue to exist in the future.

Note: The figure plots the rise in trade volume and extensive margin in period 8 as fractions
of the values achieved by each under no the case of no uncertainty. The bottom axis
indicates the probability that the draw of stochastic iceberg trade costs in a period after the
fall in distribution mean will be lower than before the fall in distribution mean
