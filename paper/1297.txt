                        The Demand for Labor in the Long Run


                                     ABSTRACT


      The theory of the demand for labor is presented alonQ with a catalog and

critique of methods that are used to estimate the parameters that describe

empirical labor—demand and substitution possibilities. A critical survey is

presented of studies of own—price demand elasticities for labor as a whole and

for workers categorized by demographic group, of substitution parameters among

workers of different types, and of workers for capital. The main findings

are: 1) The long—run constant—output demand elasticity for labor that is

treated as homogeneous is between .15 and .5; 2) Own—price demand elasticities

are higher for workers that have less general human capital embodied and them;

3)   Skilled   labor and physical capital are p—complements; and 4 More

tentatively, youths and wornenare q—substitutes in production. The

implications and importance for policy of these and other results are

discussed. Suggestions for improving the literature and narrowing the range

of knowledge of the underlying parameters, especially by concentrating more on

disaggregated and even microeconornic data, are presented.

I. Introduction

        The demand for labor in the long run   should   be important to labor

economists for a variety of reasons. So long as the supply of labor to an

occupation, industry or area is not perfectly elastic in the long run, the

nature of demand for labor in that subsector interacts with the shape of the

supply function to determine the level of wages. As in the market for a

commodity, so too in the market for labor the demand is an integral

determinant of the price of what is exchanged.

         In many cases economIsts are Interested In the demand for labor for Its

own   sake   rather than for its effects on wage determination. In some

Instances, e.g., In unionized employment or where the supply of labor to a

subsector is perfectly elastic, the wage can be viewed as unaffected by labor

demand. In such cases knowledge of wage elasticities of labor demand allow

one to infer the effects of exogenous changes in wage rates on the amount of

labor employers seek to use. The impact of changes in the price of one type

of labor on its employment and on the employment of other types of labor

(cross—price effects) can be discovered using estimates of labor—demand

relations alone. Alternatively, one can in many instances assume that the

employment of workers of a particular type is fixed (and determined solely by

the completely inelastic supply of such workers to the market). In those

cases the demand for their labor determines the wage rate they are paid.

Knowledge of the shape of the labor—demand function enables one to infer how

exogenous changes in supply (due perhaps to changes in the demographic mix of

the labor force or to shifts in suppliers' preferences for entering different

occupations) affect the wage rate of workers in the group whose supply has

shifted and in other groups too (cross—quantity effects).

       Economists interested in policy questions should be concerned with

issues of labor demand. The effects of any policy that changes factor prices

faced by employers will depend on the structure of labor demand. Thus to

predict the impact of wage subsidies, payroll tax changes, investment tax

credits, etc., one must have satisfactory estimates of underlying

parameters. Similarly, the impact on wages of policies such as skills

training or population control that change the demographic or human—capital

mix of the labor force can be assessed only if one knows the underlying

trtietur of substitution relations among rouos of workers.

       Bearing in mind throughout that the purpose of studying the demand for

labor is to understand how exogenous changes will affect the employment and/or

wage rates of a group or groups of workers, we begin this essay by examining

the theory of labor demand. The theoretical discussion is divided into two

parts: Demand for labor in the two—factor case, and demand in the multi—

factor case. In each part we first derive the results generally, then proceed

to specific functional forms. In Sections IV and V we point out the issues

involved in estimating labor—demand relations for one type of homogenous

labor, and then summarize the state of knowledge in this area. Sections VI

and VII perform the same tasks for the demand for labor of several types.

       The focus throughout is on the relations between exogenous wage changes

and the determination of employment, and between exogenous changes in

inelastically supplied labor and the structure of relative wages. We ignore

the possibility that firms may not maximize profits or minimize costs, and

assume throughout that employers are perfect competitors in both product and

labor markets. While this latter assumption may be incorrect, the analysis

applies mutatis mutandis to employers who have some product—market power.

Most important, we focus only on the long—run, or static theory of labor
                                      3

demand, and thus only on the long—run effects of exogenous changes in wage

rates or labor supply. The dynamics of labor demand, particularly the role of

adjustment costs and the distinction between the amount of labor used and its

intensity of use (employment versus hours per period), are Ignored (and left

to Nickell's essay in this volume). Most lags in the adjustment of labor

demand to its long—run equilibrium do not appear to be very long (Hamerinesh,

1980); the slow adjustment of relative wages to exogenous shocks appears due

mostly to lags in suppliers' decisions about training and mobility. That

beIng the case, the theory of labor demand in the long run, and the estImates

of parameters describing that demand, are useful in answering questions of

interest to policy—makers and others who are interested In the near—term

effects of various changes In the labor market.

El. Two Factors——The Theory

       While the theoretical results on labor demand can be generalized to N

factor inputs, many useful insights Into the theory can be gained by examining

the demand for homogeneous labor when there is only one cooperating factor,

usually assumed to be capital services. Since much of the terminology of

labor demand applies in the two—factor case, concentrating on it also has some

pedagogical advantages. Also, many of the specific forms for the production

and cost functions from which labor—demand functions are derived were

initially developed for the two—factor case and make a good deal more economic

sense applied to only two factors than generalized to several. The

presentation here and in Section III goes through some derivations, but our

aim is to provide a theoretical outline to link to empirical work. More

complexity can be found in Varian (1978); still more is available In the

essays in Fuss—McFadden (1978).
                                             4

        Assume that production exhibits constant returns to scale, as described

by F, such that:

(1)       Y =   F(L,K),    FD > 0, Fji < 0, F > 0
where Y is output, and K and L are homogenous capital and labor inputs

respectively. A firm that maximizes profits subject to a limit on costs will

set the marginal value product of each factor equal to its price:

(2a)      FL — Xw=0;

(2b)      FK — Xr=O,

where w and r are the exogenous prices of labor and capital services

respectively, X is a Lagrangean multiplier showing the extra profit generated

by relaxing the cost constraint, and we assume the price of output is unity.

The firm will also operate under the cost constraint:

(2c)      C°—wL—rKO
The ratio of (2a) to (2b) is the familiar statement that the marginal rate of

technical substitution equals the factor—price ratio for a profit—maximizing

firm.

        Allen (1938, p.341) defines the elasticity of substitution between the

services of capital and labor as the effect of a change in relative factor

prices on relative inputs of the two factors, holding output constant.

(Alternatively, it is the effect of a change in the marginal rate of technical

substitution on the ratio of factor inputs, defined as an elasticity.) In

this two—factor linear homogeneous case it is (see Allen (1938) pp. 342—343):

                                     K
                               din
(3)       a —    din K/L —                 — FLFK
                din(w/r)     din   (FL/FK)   YFLK
                                         5

          The own—wage elasticity of labor demand at a constant output and

constant r is [Allen (1938) PP. 372—373]:

(4a)          1LK = [1—s]ci > 0

where s = wL/Y, the share of labor in total revenue. Intuitively, the

constant—output elasticity of labor demand is smaller for a given technology (ci)

       when labor's share is greater because there is relatively less capital

toward which to substitute when the wage rises. The cross—elasticity of

demand (for capital services) is:

(4b)          1LK = [1—s}c > 0

[What is the intuition on the inclusion of 1 — s in (4b)?].

          Both (4a) and (4b) reflect only substitution along an isoquant. When

the wage rateincreases, the cost of producing a given output rises; and the

price of the product will rise, reducing the quantity of output sold. The

scale effect depends on the (absolute value) of the elasticity of product

demand, , and on the share of labor in total costs (which determines the
percentage increase in price). Thus to (4a) and (4b) the scale effects must

be added, so that:

(4a')         LL = — [1—sJi    —     s
        and

(4b')             = [l—sJ   [ci—i]

The results here and in (4a) and (4b) are the most important in the theory of

labor demand. They will be proved below using the cost—function approach.

          Both (4a) and (4a') are useful, depending on the assumptions one wishes

to make about the problem under study. Certainly in an individual firm or

particular industry, which can expand or contract as the wage it must pay

changes, scale effects on employment demand are relevant. For an entire

economy, in which output may be assumed constant at full employment, (4a) and
                                          6

(4b) are     the correct measures of the long—run effect of changes in the wage

rate on factor demand.

         All of these measures assume that both factors are supplied elastically

to the firm. If they are not, the increase in employment implicit in (4a')

when the wage decreases cannot be complete: The labor that is demanded may

not be available; and the additional capital services whose presence raises

the marginal product of labor (FLK > 0) also may not be. In such cases the

demand elasticities are reduced (see Hicks (1964, Appendix)). Though such

cases may be important, we ignore them in this essay (though we do deal with

the polar case in which the wage depends upon the level of exogenous

employment).

         An alternative approach makes   use   of cost minimization subject to an

output constraint. Total cost is the sum of products of the profit—maximizing

input demands and the factor prices. It can be written as:

(5)          C =   C(wr,Y), C > 0, Cj > 0, i,j = w,r,
since the profit—maximizing input demands were themselves functions of input

prices, the level of output, and technology. By Shephard's lemma (see Varian

(1978, p. 32)) the firm's demand for labor and capital at a fixed output Y can

be recovered from the cost function (5) as:

             L* =
(6a)                C
       and

(6b)         K*Cr
Intuitively, the cost—minimizing firm uses inputs in a ratio equal to their

marginal effects on costs. The forms (6) are particularly useful for

estimation purposes, as they specify the inputs directly as functions of the

factor prices and output.
                                        7

         Using equations (6) and the result that C(w,r,Y) =   YC(w,r,l)   if Y is

linear homogeneous, the elasticity of substitution can be derived (see Sato—

Koizumi, 1973) as:


                  ccyr
(7)
                  yr

Note that the elasticity of substitution derived from a cost function looks

strikingly similar to that derived from a production function. Obviously they

are equal, suggesting that the form one chooses to measure i should be

dictated by convenience.

         The factor—demand elasticities can be computed as:

(8a)        1LL = —[1—mjci

      and

(8b)        1LK = [1—m]i,

where m is the share of labor in total costs. Since by assumption factors are

paid their marginal products, and the production and cost functions are linear

homogeneous, m=s, and (8a) and (8b) are equivalent to (4a) and (4b).

         We are now in a position to prove (4a') easily following Dixit (1976,

p. 79). If we continue to assume constant returns to scale, we can reasonably

treat the firm as an industry and write industry factor demand as:

(6a')       L = YC

      and

(6b')       K =   YC.
Under competition firms equate price, p, to marginal and average cost:

                  p = C.
                                                    8

Noting that if markets clear, so that output equals industry demand D(p), we

obtain:

            ôLIôw      YC + D'(p) C2
                                   w
                         ww
          Because C is linear homogeneous, C                 =               Substituting   for CWW'
                                                                 w Cwr
                                                                         .
                                                        ww
then from (7) for Cwr and then for C and Cr from (6a') and (6b'):

           ÔL/ôw =              2J +      D'(p)L2
                       Y        wC
To put this into the form of an elasticity, multiply both sides by pw/pL, and

remember that p = C:

by the definition of factor shares under linear homogeneity.
          The production or cost functions can also be used to define some

concepts that are extremely useful when examining markets in which real factor

prices are flexible and endogenous, but factor supplies are fixed (and,

because of the flexibility of input prices, are fully employed). The converse

of asking, as we have, what happens to the single firm's choice of inputs in

response to an exogenous shift in a factor price is to ask what happens to

factor prices in response to an exogenous change in factor supply. Define the

elasticity of coniplementarity as the percentage responsiveness of relative

factor prices to a one—percent change in factor inputs:
                   ô.tn w/r
(9)        C InK/L
This is just the inverse of the definition of .

Thus:

                          CC
                           wr      YFLK
(10)
              =•=CCwr             FFLK
In the two—factor case in which the production technology is linear

homogeneous, one can find the elasticities of substitution and of

complementarity equally simply from production and cost functions; and, having

found one of them, the other is immediately available.

          Given constant marginal costs, the elasticities of factor price (of the



                             i
wage rate and the price of capital services) are defined as:

(11\
'''                  = — ri—mi
                         L
              ''ww
        and

(lib)         rw =       [1—m]c

Equation (ha) states that the percentage decrease in the wage rate necessary

to accommodate an increase in labor supply with no change in the marginal cost

of the product is smaller when the share of labor in total costs is larger

(because labor's contribution to costs —— a decrease —— must be fully offset

by a rise in capital's contribution in order to meet the condition that

marginal cost be held constant).

          Consider now some examples of specific production and cost functions.

A. Cobb—Douglas technology

          The production function is:

(12)          Y =

where a is a parameter; marginal products are:
              oY         Y
(13a) stat,
       and
              oY =       Y
(13b)              [1—a]

Since the ratio of (13a) to (13b) is      if the firm is maximizing profits,

taking logarithms and differentiating with respect to £n       yields cy = 1
                                           10


Equations (4a) and (4b) Imply:

                        LL = — [1—a]
                             =   1 -   a
        Minimizing total costs subject to (12), one can derive (Varian (1978,

p. 15)) the demand functions for L and K, and thus the cost function. The

latter reduces to:
                                 a
(14)      C(w,r,Y) =     Zwarl       y

where Z Is a constant. Using Shephard's lemma, one can again derive:

(15)-     LIK=---
              i—a
                  —.     w
Taking logs, the calculation that c =      1    follows immediately. It is also clear

from (15) that c = 1.

B. Constant elasticity of substitution technology

        The linear homogeneous production function is:

                                       1

(16)      Y = [aLa + (1—a)Kj

where a and p are parameters. Marginal products are.!-":



          oY =       Y1.-p
(17a)
and
          oY =        Y1—p
(17b)            (1—cz)()
Setting the ratio of (17a) to (17b) equal to the factor—price ratio, taking

logarithms, differentiating with respect to In          ,   and making   ) 0 , yields:
                 L
          —ô In K =
(18)
           o
                             = l/[l—pJ
                 r


The CES is sufficiently general that any value of p < 1 is admissable, and the

relationship (18) can be used to estimate ci.
                                               11


        mong special cases are:        1) The Cobb—Douglas function (p =        0,   as

should be clear from (18)); 2) The linear function (p =             1),   in which L and K

are perfect substitutes. (Go back to (3), and note that if p = 1, so that (16)

is linear and FLK =    0,   a =   .)      3) The Leontief function (p = — w), in
which output is the minimum function Y =            mm   {L, K} , and the inputs are not

substitutable at all.-! The constant—output factor—demand elasticities in

each case follow immediately from the definitions and the recognition

that   a is labor's share of revenue if the factors are paid their marginal
products.
        The CES cost function can be derived (Ferguson (1969, p. 167)) as:

                                               1
                    a 1—a         a 1—a 1-c
            C=Y[aw +[1—a] r                ]


where, as before, a = l/[l—p]     ) 0 •        The demand for labor is:



(19)
            L.aawaY
Taking the ratio of (19) to the demand for K, the elasticity of substitution

can again be shown to be a.

         In both of these examples it is very straightforward to derive c first,

then derive a as its inverse. It is worth noting for later examples and for

the multifactor case that c is more easily derived from equations (17) and the

factor—price ratio (since w/r, the outcome, appears alone), than from (19) and

the demand for capital. a is more readily derived from the cost function,

since the ratio L/K appears alone. Obviously in the two—factor case the

simple relation (10) allows one to obtain c or a from the other; but the ease

of obtaining c or a initially differs depending on which function one starts

with,   a   difference that is magnified in the multifactor case.
                                                   12

        Two other specific functional forms, the generalized Leontief form of

Diewert (1971) and the translog form (Christensen et al (1973)), are second—

order approximations to arbitrary cost or production functions. Each has the

advantage over the CES function in the two—factor case that ci (or c) is not

restricted to be constant, but instead depends on the values of the factor

inputs or prices. In each case we examine here only the cost function.

C. Generalized Leontief

                  Y{a11w
where the ai are parameters. Applying Shephard's lemma to (20) for each

input, and taking the ratios:


                             w —1/2
         L        a11 + a12 C—)
(21)
                               wl/2
                  a22 + a12 (j)

As is easily seen from (21), in general                 (—    ôin   (K)/&Qn (a)) depends on all

three parameters and the ratio            .       Under restrictive assumptions (20)

reduces to some of the examples we have already discussed. If a12 =                     0,   it

becomes a Leontief function (since the ratio L/K is fixed). If a11 = a22, it

becomes a Cobb—Douglas type function.

D. Translog

(22)    in C =      in Y   + a0 + a1 in w + .5b1[ w}2 + b2 in w in r + .5b3[in r]2

                                              +              in r
                                                  [1—a1]
where the a1 and bi are parameters. Applying Shephard's lemma to each input,

and taking the ratios:
         Lr a
            1              +binw+b
                            1     2
                                    mr
"  '

         K
              —
                  w [1—a1] + b2 in w + b3 in r

Again   depends on all parameters and both factor prices. Under specific

circumstances (bi = 0 for all 1), the cost function reduces to a Cobb—Douglas

technology.
                                        13

       Both the generalized Leontief and translog functions may be useful for

empirical work (see below), even when written out as in (20) and (22). Each

has the virtue of allowing flexibility and containing some simpler forms as

special cases. That suggests that they should supplant the Cobb—Douglas and

CES functions even for empirical work involving just two inputs.

       Throughout this Section we have assumed the production and cost

functions are linear homogeneous. This also implies they are homothetic:

Factor demand is such that the ratio of factor inputs is independent of scale

at each factor—price ratio. This assumption may not always make sense. For

example, large firms may be better able to function with a more capital—

Intensive process at given w and r than are small firms.

       In the general case nonhoinotheticity means that the production function

cannot be written as:

         Y =   G(F[L,K]),
where G is monotonic and F Is linear homogeneous. Alternatively, the cost

function cannot be expressed as (Varlan (1978, p. 49)): C(w,r,Y) =

C1(Y) C2(w,r) ; i.e., output is not separable from factor prices. Some
special cases are useful for estimation; and a nonhomothetic CES—type function

(Sato (1977)) and translog form (Berndt—Khaled (1979)) have been used.

III. Several Factors — The Theory

       Mathematically the theory of demand for several factors of production

Is just a generalization of the theory of demand for two factors presented in

the last section. Empirically, though, the generalization requires the

researcher to examine a related aspect of factor demand that is not present

when the set of inputs is classified into only two distinct aggregates. The

issue is illustrated when one considers a three—factor world, for example,

three types of labor, L1, L2 and L3 .    One could assume that production is
                                                 14

characterized by:

(24)     Y = F(G(L1, L2), L3)

where F and G are two—factor production functions of the kind we discussed

above. The difficulty with (24) is that the aggregation of L1 and L2 by the

function G is a completely arbitrary description of technology. Far better to

devise some method that allows this particular aggregation to be a subcase

whose validity can be tested. This problem, one of separability of some

factors from other(s), provides the major reason why labor economists must be

interested in multi—factor labor demand. As an example, it means that one

should not, as has been done by, for example, Dougherty (1972), combine pairs

of labor subaggregates by hierarchies of two—factor CES functions.

Intuitively this is because changes in the amount of one type of labor in a

particular subaggregate could affect the ease of substitution between two

groups of labor that are arbitrarily included In another subaggregate. If so,

one will draw incorrect inferences about the ease of substitution between the

latter two factors (and about the cross—price demand elasticities).

       Consider a firm (industry, labor market, economy) using N factors of

production, X1,   ...,   XN.     Let the production function be:

         Y =                           > 0, f1 < 0
(25)           f(X1,   ...,    XN),
Then the associated cost function, based on the demands for X1, ..., XN, is:

(26)     C =                                > 0,
               g(w1,   ..., WN, Y),

where the wj are the input prices. As in the two—factor case:

(27)     f1 — Xw = 0      ,             I   =   1,    ..., N;
                                                       15

       and, using the cost function:

(28)        Xg1=O,                                i=1, ...,N,
where X and i.t are Lagrangian multipliers.

          The technological parameters can be defined using either the

equilibrium conditions based on the production function ((25) and (27)) or

those based on the cost function ((26) and (28)). Allen (1938) used f to

define the partial elasticity of substitution, the percentage effect of a

change in wj/w on                     holding output and other input prices constant, as:


                                 1;


(29)             =
                     xixj
where:

                         0 f
                             I
                                 .    . . .     . fn
            F=           •
                                       f
                                           ii




the bordered Hessian determinant of the equilibrium conditions (25) and (27),

and F1 is the cofactor of fj in F.

          The definition in (29) is quite messy. An alternative definition based

on the cost function is:


                     C
(30)        .=
            ij g1g
(Note the similarity to the definition of a in (7) in the two—factor case.

Note also that the definition in (30) requires knowledge only of a few

derivatives of (26), unlike that of (29), which requires a compete description

of the production function.)
                                                16

          If one differentiates the system (25) and (27) totally, the

comparative—static equations are:



                   rdvx
                     dX1    =

where the last equality results from the assumptions that factors are paid

their marginal products and f is linear homogeneous.3" The                factor demand

elasticities, can, of course, be calculated more readily using the definition

of        based on (26).

case that at least one           > 0,           But (and what makes the multifactor

case interesting) some of the r1. may be negative for j*i.

          The partial elasticity of complementarity between two factors is

defined using the production function as:



(34)       c. = ____
                                                 17


(Here the definition is just a generalization of (10).) The cj show the

percentage effect on w1/w of a change in the input ratio X1/Xj, holding

marginal cost and other input quantities constant.

       The cii can also be defined from the cost function (from the system of

equations (26) and (28)) in a way exactly analogous to the definition

       from the production function:


                             C.
(35)             =
           c1

where JGj is the determinant of the bordered Hessian matrix that results from

totally differentiating (26) and (28), and Cj is the cofactor of g1 in that

matrix (see Sato—Koizumi (1973, P. 48)). Note that unlike the two—factor

factors. It is quite possible, though, that there are factors for which

     < 0 for some j # I, i.e., for which an exogenous increase In the quantity

of input j reduces the price of input i at a constant marginal cost.

        The partial elasticities of demand and of factor prices can be used to

classify pairs of factor inputs. Using the                     inputs i and j are said to be

q—complements J.f      c .   = s.c..   > 0- ci—substitutes if c. . < 0.
                                                                      13
                                                                                   (Note that it
                        iJ      3 13
is possible for all input pairs (i,j) to be q—complements.) Using the

inputs i and j are said to be p—complements if i.. =                  s.c..   < 0, p—substitutes

if         > 0.    (Note that it is possible for all input pairs (i,j) to be p—
     1ij
substitutes.) If there are only two inputs, they must be q—complements and p—

subs titutes .

           The use of these definitions should be clear, but some examples may

demonstrate it better. If skilled and unskilled labor are p—substitutes, one

may infer that a rise in the price of skilled labor, perhaps resulting from an

increase in the ceiling on payroll taxes, will increase the mix of unskilled

workers in production. These two factors may also be q—complements.                      If so,

an increase in the number of skilled workers (perhaps resulting from increased

awareness of the nonpecuniary benefits of acquiring a college education) will

raise the wage of unskilled workers by Increasing their relative scarcity.

           The concepts developed in this section can be illustrated by a number

of the specific functional forms that have been used in the literature to

estimate production/cost relations describing several inputs.

A. Multifactor Cobb—Douglas and CES functions
                                                                     19

           These are just logical extensions of the two—factor cases. The N—

factor Cobb—Douglas cost function can be written:

(39)         C =         ri wi',              ai = 1
                          i
Each             =   1        (just apply (30) to (39)), making this function quite

uninteresting in applications where one wishes to discover the extent of p—

substitutability or examine how substitution between X and X is affected by

the amount of Xk used. That                                 =   1   can be readily derived from a

generalization of the argument in (13)—(15).

           The N—factor CES production function is:


                                      1

             Y = [E                                    =1
(40)                              p]P     ,

As with the N—factor Cobb—Douglas function, the technological parameters are

not interesting:

       =   1—p    for all
 c1
The degree of substitution within each pair of factors is restricted to be

Identical.

           A slightly more interesting case is that of the two—level CES function

where the                and u are parameters to be estimated. Equation (41) is the same

as (40), except that groups of factors aggregated by CES subfunctions are

themselves aggregated by a CES function with parameter u •                                         For factors

within the same subaggregate:

 cl.=i—pk, k=1,...,M.
For factors in different subgroups, c.. = 1 —                                   u.    While (41) is less
                                                           20

restrictive than (40), it still imposes the assumption that the ease of

substitution is the same between all pairs of factors not in the same

subgroup; and it also imposes separability——substitution within a subgroup is

unaffected by the amount of inputs from other subgroups.

B. Generalized Leontief

         The cost function, an expanded version of (20), is:

(42)       C = Y EE a. .w5w5, a.. =                   a..
                     lJi 3     13                      3].
The technological parameters can be estimated from:

(43)       X =
            A.
                   a + > a [w./w]5, i =
                       j.j.          .IJ    J
                                                                1,   ...,   N.

The partial elasticities of substitution are:



     —
 (5..—
                  ij

         2[X.X.

and


         a. -X.
 (5.. = 2ii 1
  ii      X.s.
           11

To derive the                 from this functional form, one need only know those
                         ij
parameters that involve factors i and j.5 A production function analogous to

(42) can be used to derive the c1 easily (and the a.1. with great effort!).

C. Translog

         In general the translog cost function is:

           in C = mY + a + Ea.lnw. + .5 E E b. •lnwlnw
                                                                13.13

with
(45)        E ai = 1; b . = b..                 ; E b. .   =0    for all j.
            1                   iJ         31     1
                                                   . 1]


The first and third equalities in (45) result from the assumption that C is
                                                         21

linear homogeneous in the w1 (proportionate increases in the w1 raise costs

proportionately). By Shephard's lemma:

           The reason for writing (46) as it is rather than as a set of factor—

demand functions is that, while the latter are nonlinear In the parameters,

(46) is linear:

(47)              =

The partial elasticities of substitution are:

       =

 a11 = [b11 ÷ s1—s}/s1

           The    a1 can also be calculated from a translog production
specification, but to do so requires using (29), and thus the determinant of

what could be a large matrix. The production form is useful, though, to

derive partial elasticities of complementarity.

           These functional forms and the associated production functions are all

summarized in Table 1 for the multifactor case. (Though the Cobb—Douglas and

CES should not be used when there are more than two factors, I present them

here to allow their use in the two—factor case.) The relative merits of and

problems with the alternative cost and production tableaux are discussed in

the next sections.

IV.   Homogeneous Labor——Estimation and Empirical Issues

      In this section we deal with the problems involved in estimating the

demand for homogeneous labor. We examine how one estimates the demand

parameters under the assumption that all units of labor are identical. The

parameters of interest, the labor—demand elasticity and the cross—price and

substitution elasticities, have been produced both in the two— and the

rnultifactor cases. We discuss both issues of how the estimating equations are

to be specified, and how they are to be estimated and the results

interpreted.


      A. Specification


      The first approach to estimation rel ies on the production or cost

function 'directly." In the case of the Cobb—Douglas function this method

produces the distribution parameters. (If, for example, data on factor prices

are unavailable, these parameter estimates are necessary to compute the

factor—demand elasticities. if data on shares can be computed, there is no

reason to estimate such a function.) Estimating a CES function directly is,

as inspection of (16) shows, not easy, so the direct approach does not apply

here. The general ized Leontief and translog approximations can be estimated

directly (either in their cost or production function forms). Though little

work has rel ied upon this approach, it is quite feasible in the two—factor

case. In the multifactor case the problem of multicoll inearity (N+1 terms

involving each factor of production are included in the translog

approximation, N in the generalized Leontief approximation) becomes severe

(but see Hansen     al (1975)). With more than one other factor included,

direct estimation should not be done unless one arbitrarily imposes a

mul tifactor Cobb—Douglas technology.
                                       23


     The second approach uses labor—demand conditions, either from the

marginal productivity condition (2a) or the Shephard condition (6a). In the

simplest case, a CES function, this means estimating an equation like:


(48) ln L =        +   Yln   WL + a11n Y,
              a0


where the a. are parameters, with a11 if the production function is

characterized by constant returns to scale.6 (Indeed, estimating (48) without

constraining a1 to equal one is the standard way of testing for constant


returns to scale while estimating the labor—demand equation.) In the

generalized Leontief and translog cases the amount of labor demanded is a

noni inear function of the factor prices, which makes these approaches

inconvenit.
     In the multifactor case the labor—demand approach involves the estimation

of an equation like:


(49) in L = Eb.ln w. 4 a In Y, Eb. = 0,
                        1                   I




where one can test for constant returns to scale (a11). Clearly, (49) should

be viewed as part of a complete system of factor—demand equations; if data on

all factor quantities are available, a complete system should be estimated.

If not, though, (49) will provide all the necessary estimates, for:


   £ln L/ln w. =       (s./s   ]ln X./51n w
                                                L


The multifactor labor—demand approach provides a useful way of testing whether

the condition that the demand for labor be homogeneous of degree zero in

factor prices holds, and whether it is homogeneous of degree one in output. A

similar approach can be used to examine a wage equation specified as a linear

function of the logarithms of all factor quantities.
                                   24


     Yet a third approach may be cafled the relative factor demand method. In

the two—factor CES case this just invoives estimation of <18), with in L/}< as

a dependent variable, from which the demand elasticities can be calculated,

Some research has used this method, but none has used <21) or <23) directly.

     The relative factor—demand method should not be used in the rnultifactor

case, for it involves the estimation of all pairs of equations like (18), in

the CES case, or like (21) and (23:1 in the more general cases. UJhile there is

nothing inherently wrong with this approach, it prevents the imposition of the

restrictions that factor demand be homogeneous of degree zero in all factor

prices. Since that restriction is a postulate of the theory, the

specification that prevents the researcher from imposing or at least testing

it does not seem desirable.

     The fourth approach is to estimate the demand for labor as a part of a

system of equations based upon one of the approximations, like the general ized

Leontief or translog forms, that we discussed in Section III. Even in the

two—factor case a single equation like (47) for iL could be used, with the

only parameters to be estimated being the constant term and the slope on

ln{WL/Wj) (since the homogeneity restrictions make an equation for the other

factor redundant and the coefficients on ln WL and in w. equal and of opposite

sign). In the case of several factors homogeneous labor becomes one of the

factors in a system of N—i equations. These are the share equations for the

translog approximation, or equations (43) for the generalized Leontief

approximation.

     Throughout the discussion in this section we have dealt only with methods

of estimating the constant—output labor—demand elasticity. As we indicated in

Section II, in the short run, or for individual firms, sectors or industries,

a change in the price of labor will induce a change in output (especially if a
                                  25


small industry is the unit of observation). The effect of the output change

can be measured indirectly or directly. The indirect approach simply takes

some extraneous estimate of the demand elasticity •for the product of the

industry, and uses (4a') to derive a labor--demand elasticity that includes the

scale effect. A direct approach would estimate equations 1 ike (48) or (49)

but with output (Y) deleted.


                B. Measurement and Interpretation Issues


    There are many data considerations in estimating elasticities involving

labor demand; we concentrate here only on problems concerning the measurement

of L and w . The simpler issue is the choice of a measure of the quantity L

In the literature the alternatives have mostly been total employment and total

hours. Clearly, if workers are homogeneous, working the same hours per time

period, the choice is irrelevant. If they are heterogeneous along the single

dimension of hours worked per time period, using number of workers to

represent the quantity of labor will lead to biases if hours per worker are

correlated with factor prices or output. In studies using cross—section data,

in which there may be substantial heterogeneity among plants, firms or

industries in hours per worker, this consideration suggests that total hours

be used instead of employment. In time—series data (on which most of the

estimates of demand elasticities for homogeneous labor are based:) the choice

is probably not important, since there is relatively little variation in hours

per worker over time. However, if one is also interested in the dynamics o-f

labor demand, the choice is crucial, for there are significant differences in

the rates at which employment and hours adjust to exogenous shocks (see

Nickell in this volume).

     The choice of a measure of the price of labor is more difficult. Most of

the published data from developed countries are on average hourly earnings or
                                     26


average wage rates. A few countries publish data on compensation (employers'

payments for fringes and wages per hour on the payroll). While most of the

studies of the demand for homogeneous labor use one of the first two measures,

none of these three is satisfactory. There are two problems: 1) Variations in

the measured price of labor may be the spurious result of shifts in the

distribution of employment or hours among subaggregates with different labor

costs, or of changes in the amount of hours worked at premium pay; and 2) Data

on the cost of adding one worker (or one hour of labor services> to the

payroll for one hour of actual work are not available.'

     The first problem can be solved in studies of labor demand in the United

States using the adjusted earnings series covering most of the postwar period

for the private nonfarm economy. The second problem is soluble (except for

labor costs resulting from inputs into training) for studies of the United

States labor market beginning in 1977 by the Employment Cost Index that the

Bureau of Labor Statistics has produced. Clearly, future work using aggregate

data should rely upon that index. That the distinction is important is shown

in Harnerrnesh (1983), in which a measure of labor cost per hour worked is

developed and shown to lead to substantially higher own—price demand

elasticities than do average hourly earnings or average compensation

measures.

     The second measurement issue is what variables if any should be treated

as exogenous. Ideally the production or cost function, or labor—demand

equation, will be embedded in an identified model including a labor supply

relation. In such a case methods for estimating a system of equations are

appropriate, and the problem is obviated: Both the price and quantity of labor

may be treated as endogenous. If a complete system cannot be specified, one

may have sufficient variables that are not in the equation based on the cost

or production function and that can be used to produce an instrument for the
                                  27


endogenous right—hand side variable. However, given the difficulty of

specifying a labor supply relation in the aggregate data on which most studies

of   labor demand are based, it seems unlikely that a good set of variables can
be found.

      The choice usually boils down to whether price or quantity can be viewed

as exogenous in the problem under study. In studies based an small

units——plants, firms, or perhaps even geographical areas——one might well argue

that supply curves to those units are nearly horizontal in the long run. If

so, the wage rate may be treated as exogenous; and estimates of cost

functions, labor—demand equations, or share equations based on factor prices

are appropriate <for they include the wage instead of the quantity of labor as

an independent variable). In studies using aggregate data this assumption has

not been considered valid since Maithusian notions of labor supply were

abandoned. If, as many observors believe, the supply of labor to the economy

is quite inelastic even in the long run, demand parameters are best estimated

using specifications that treat the quantity of labor as exogenous; production

functions and variants of second—order approximations that include factor

quantities as regressors should be used.

       Since in reality it is unlikely that the supply of labor to the units

being studied is completely elastic or inelastic, any choice other than

estimating production parameters within a complete system including supply is

unsatisfactory. However, since supply relations have not been estimated

satisfactorily except in certain sets of cross—section and panel data, one is

left to make the appropriate choice based on one's beliefs about the likely

elasticity of supply to the units, the availability and quality of data, and

whether factor—demand elasticities or elasticities of factor prices are of

i r t e rest.

V. Homogeneous Labor-—Results and Problems


               A. Results with Output Constant and Wages Exogenous


     Remembering that the chief parameter of interest in analyzing the demand

for homogeneous labor is the constant—output own—price elasticity of demand,

let us consider a number of studies that have produced estimates of this


parameter.7     I have divided the studies into two main types depending on the

specification of the equations estimated: Labor—demand studies and production

or cost—function studies. All of the latter use either a CES production

function or a translog cost function. In the translog cost functions labor is

specified as one of several factors of production (with energy, the focus of

interest in these studies, included as one of the other factors).

     In Table 2 I list the classification of the available studies of the

constant—output long—run demand elasticity for labor. The estimates are of

the absolute value of the own—price elasticity of demand for homogeneous

labor. (The studies listed in Part l.A are based on relationships like (48:);

since the values of      are unavailable for the particular samples, I present

the estimates of                    The estimates in the studies based on a


marginal productivity condition imply a measure of the responsiveness of

demand that is quite consistent with constant—output demand elasticities

holding other factor prices constant of between .2 and .4 (assuming the share

of labor is 2/3, and noticing that the range of most of the estimates is .67 —

1.09).   Only Black—Kelejian 1970: and Drazen .e...t .aJ. (1984) aron those studies

using this approach produce estimates that imply a constant—output demand

elasticity holding other factor prices constant that is well below this

range. The latter may be an outl ier because of the difficulties with the wage

data for some of the countries; why the estimates in the former are so low is

unclear.

      Studies included under LB. in the table in most cases specify the price

of   capital services in a labor—demand equation that can be viewed as part of a

complete system of demand equations. The estimates have the virtue that the

own—price demand elasticity is simply the coefficient of in WL in the equation

containing in L as the dependent variable. The estimates are substantially

lower than those produced in studies in l.A. that include only the wage rate.

However, when one remembers that the estimates in l.A. are of the elasticity

of substitution, the two sets of estimates are in the same fairly narrow

range. Only the estimates based on interrelated factor demand (Part l.C. in

the table) are below the range implied by the estimates in l.A. and l.B.

Clark—Freeman (1980) have shown that measures of the price of capital services

are much more variable than measures of wages or earnings (presumably

reflecting at least in part errors of measurement). Studies of interrelated

factor demand, by estimating labor and capital demand simultaneously,

inherently base the estimated labor—demand elasticities in part on the

responsiveness of the demand for capital to what is likely to be a poorly

measured price of capital. This view suggests the studies in Part l.C. o-f the

table probably shed little light on the demand parameters of interest.

      Among the cost arid production function studies listed under Part II of

Table 2 there is a remarkable degree of similarity in the implied

constant—output labor—demand elasticity. Given the diversity of

specifications, sample periods and units that are studied, the extent of

agreement is astounding. These studies produce estimates that are roughly in

agreement with those listed under LA. and lI.B. Again, whether one takes

information on other factor prices into account or not seems to make little

difference for the estimates of the labor demand elasticity. All that is
                                30



required is that one interpret one's results carefully, relating the parameter

estimates back to the elasticity one is trying to estimate.

     Obviously there is no one correct estimate of the constant—output

elasticity of demand for homogeneous labor in the aggregate. The true value

of the parameter will change over time as the underlying technology changes,

and will differ among economies due to differences in technologies. However,

a reading of the estimates in Table 2 suggests that, in developed economies in

the late twentieth century, the aggregate long—run constant—output

labor—demand elasticity lies roughly in the range .15 — .50   .   While this range

is fairly wide, it does at least put some limits on the claims one might make

for the ability of, for example, wage subsidies to change the relative labor

intensity of production at a fixed rate of output. These limits suggest that

the huge empirical literature summarized here should narrow the debate over

what the likely effects would be of any change imposed on the economy that

affects the demand for labor.

     An examination of these empirical studies and a consideration of the

problems of specification indicates that the labor—demand elasticity can be

obtained from a marginal—productivity condition, from a system of

factor—demand equations, from a labor—demand equation that includes other

factor prices, or from a system of equations that produces estimates of the

partial elasticities of. substitution among several factors of production.

Often data on other factor prices will not be so readily available as the wage

rate. The lack of differences we have noted between studies that include

other factor prices and those that do not suggest the effort devoted to

obtaining series on those other prices will not result in major changes in the

estimates of the labor—demand elasticity.


                  B. Varying Output or Endogenous Wages
                               31


    While our major interest is in the constant—output labor—demand

elasticity, it is may be worth asking a short—run question: What is the

elasticity when output can vary, that is, what is a reasonable value for   l'   in


(4a')? The responses to changes in wage rates under these assumptions are

obviously of special interest to those concerned with short—run macroeconomic

problems. One recent study, Symons—Layard (1983), examined demand functions

for six large OECD economies in which only factor prices, not output, were

included as independent variables. The estimates range from .4 to 2.6, with

four of the six being greater than one. These relatively large estimates

suggest, as one should expect from comparing (4a) and (4a'), that there is

more scope for an imposed rise in real wages to reduce employment when one

assumes output can vary.

     The discussion thus far has dealt with the demand for homogeneous labor

in the aggregate. Nearly all the studies summarized treat factor prices,

including the wage rate, as exogenous. Yet, as we noted in Section IV, this

assumption is strictly correct only if the elasticity of labor supply is

infinite, which hardly seems correct in those studies based upon data from

entire economies. <it is unlikely that the private nonfarm sector can elicit

more labor from households without any increase in the market price of time.)

The remarkable similarity of the results discussed in this Section may merely

arise from the authors' use of methods that are similar, but essentially

incorrect, and that fail to provide a proper test of the theory of labor

demand. Studies based on units of observation to which the supply of labor

can be claimed to be truly exogenous thus provide a clearer test of the

predictions of the theory of labor demand.

     Estimates of labor—demand elasticities for small industries, for workers

within a narrowly—defined occupation, for workers within small geographical

areas, or even within individual establishments, are less likely to be fraught
                                32


with problems of simultaneous—equations bias than are the macro time—series

that underlie the studies summarized in Table 2. Unfortunately, relatively

little attention has been paid to this problem; but those studies that have

treated less aggregated data describing the demand homogeneous labor are

summarized in Table 3. The estimates of the constant—output labor—demand

elasticities are quite similar to those summarized in Table 2. This suggests

that the estimated elasticities that seem to confirm the central prediction of

the theory of labor demand are not entirely an artifact produced by using

aggregate data.

     One might claim that even these units of observation are not the

establishments or firms upon which the theory is based. it is true that, in

contrast to the myriad studies of labor supply behavior based observations on

households, there is a shocking absence of research on the empirical

rnicroeconomics of labor demand. Thus the most appropriate tests of the

predictions of the theory have yet to be made. For those skeptical even of

the results in Table 3 that are based on data describing occupations or

industries, an additional confirmation of the theory is provided by analyses

of the effects of the minimum wage. An overwhelming body of evidence <see the

summary in Brown .t al 1582:) indicates that imposed, and thus exogenous,

changes in minimum wages induce reductions in the employment of workers in

those groups whose market wages are near the minimum.




VI. Heterogeneous Labor——Estimation and Empirical Issues


     Most of the methods for specifying and estimating models involving

several types of labor carry over from the discussion of homogeneous labor in

the previous section. Yet because one is generally interested in many more

parameters than in the case of homogeneous labor, there are several

considerations that do not arise in that case.


                                   A. Specification


     If one assumes that there are only two types of labor, and that they are

separable from   nonlabor inputs, the discussion in the previous section applies
and the ways of estimating substitutability between the two factors should be

apparent. (But see below for some problems that arise in this case.) In most

instances, though, the problem at hand involves estimating the degree of

substitutability among several types of labor (and among them and other

factors). In     that   case, as the discussion in Section III should make clear,

the restrictive Cobb—Douglas and CES forms will not be appropriate to answer

the questions under study except under highly unl ikely circumstances.

     Two alternatives are possible, with the choice depending on the

availability of data: 1) A complete system of factor—demand equations,

essentially a series o4 N equations with the L. ,     i=1...N,   as dependent

variables, and the same set of independent variables as in (49); and 2) A

system of equations based on one of the flexible approximations to a

production or cost function, e.g., the generalized Leontief or translog forms,

such as are shown in Table 1. (Whether one specifies these systems with factor

prices or quantities as independent variables is another issue, which we

discus; below.) Each of these approaches requires data on all factor prices

and quantities. Each of the approaches using the flexible forms allows the

ready inference of the partial elasticities of substitution (or of

complementarity) as well as the factor—demand (factor—price) elasticities.

     As in the case of homogeneous labor, one would ideally specify factor

demands simultaneously with factor supplies and be able to estimate a model

that obviates the need to consider whether factor prices or quantities are to
                                    34



be considered exogenous. However, if it is difficult to specify such a model

involving homogeneous labor, it seems impossible to do so for a model that

includes several types of workers. Accordingly, one must be able to argue

that suppi ies of each type of labor are either completely inelastic or


completely elastic in response to exogenous changes in demand. 8

     No satisfactory choice appears to have been made in the studies that have

estimated substitution among several types of labor. For example, consider a

study that seeks to examine the extent of substitutability among adult women,

adult men, youths and capital.   It seems reasonable to treat the quantity of

adult men in the work force as exogenous, and increasingly also for adult

women, but that assumption hardly makes sense for youths whose labor supply

appears to be quite elastic. (The supply elasticity of capital is also a

problem.) That being the case, the absence of an appropriate set of variables

from which to form instruments for the wage or labor quantities used means one

must accept some misspecificat ion whether one chooses to treat wages or

quantities as exogenous.

     As another example, one might argue that the supplies of blue— and

white—collar labor to the economy are highly elastic in the long run; but it

is uni ikely, given the heterogeneity among workers' abil ities, that these

supplies are completely elastic. Even if one believes they are, the long run

over which they are infinitely elastic is probably longer than the quarter or

year that forms the basic unit of observation a-f time—series studies that

focus on this disaggregation of the work force. That being the case, there is

no clear—cut choice dictated by theory alone about whether wages or quantities

should be treated as exogenous in this example either.

    The problem is not solved by estimating the cost or production parameters

using aggregated cross—section data. For example, the persistence a-f regional
                                    35


wage differentials unexplained by apparent differences in amenities suggests

that one cannot claim that labor of all types is suppl ied perfectly

elastically to geographical areas. Thus using data on metropolitan areas or

other geographical subunits does not guarantee that factor prices can be

considered exogenous. The same problem arises when data on industries are

used: Insofar as industries use industry—specific skills, the supply of labor

to the industry could well be upward—sloping in the long run. The only

satisfactory solution, one that has not been tried in practice, is to use data

on firms or establishments as the units of observation.

     In practice the best guide to the choice between treating wages or

quantities as exogenous is the link between this choice and the researcher's

own priors on the supply elasticities of the factors whose demand is being

examined (and thus how the misspecification that is induced can be

minimized). In the example involving adult females, adult males and youths

the overwhelming shares of output are accounted for by the first two groups,

whose supply of effort is relatively inelastic. That being so, treating

factor quantities as exogenous is probably the better choice. This also means

that one should focus the analysis on the elasticities of comnplementarity and

of factor prices, which are estimated more readily using production rather

than cost functions (see Section III).


                  B. Measurement and Interpretation Issues


     Whether labor subaggregates are separable from capital, or whether some

groups within the labor force are separable in production from others, is of

central importance in empirical work estimating substitution among

heterogeneous workers. Consider first the issue of separabil ity of labor

subaggregates from capital. In many cases the available data provide no way

of obtaining a measure of the price or quantity of capital services. Even if
                                      36


such data are available, they may be measured with much greater error than the

data on wage rates or employment in each labor subgroup. If the errors of

measurpr'rJ are small, one might well argue the Cambridge position that the

notion of trying to aggregate the capital stock in an economy, or even in a

labor market, is senseless. That being the case, one must be sure that labor

is separable from capital when one estimates substitution relations among

labor subgroups in the absence of a measure of capital price or quantity.

Otherwise, the estimates of labor—labor substitution will be biase:

       A similar problem arises when one concentrates on substitution among

several subgroups in the labor force and assumes that they are separable from

the rest of labor. (For example, Welch—Cunningham (1978) examine substitution

among three groups of young workers disaggregated by age under the assumption

that the 0        of each for adult workers are identical.) The estimates of the
             IJ


       <or c ) between the pairs of labor subgroups being studied will

generally be biased. The separability of the labor subgroups from capital

should always be tested rather than imposed if the data permit.

       Even if the labor subaggregates are separable from capital (or, if they

are not separable, the biases induced by assuming separability are small), a

problem of interpretation arises. Assume, for example, that the true

production function is:


             Y
                  F(K,6EL1, L2]),


where the function 6 aggregates the two types of labor. Estimates based on:


(50)               L
                       G(L1,L2),


implicitly measure substitution along an isoquant that holds L ,   but   not

necessarily Y constant. Thus the factor—demand elasticities computed from

discussion of this). They are                          ias±icLtie.s; constant—output   labor

demand elasticities will differ from these, for any rise in the price of, say,

L1 ,   will        induce a reduction in L (because the price of aggregate labor has

fallen). If, for example, the L—constant demand elasticity for L1 is

the constant—output demand elasticity will be:

The true (constant—output) demand elasticity is more negative <greater in

absolute value) than the gross elasticity, '*ii; and the true cross—price

demand elasticities are more negative than those based on estimates of

substitution using <so: as the underlying production relation.

       Assuming the labor subgroups can be treated as separable from capital,

there is nothing wrong with the estimates of factor—demand (or factor—price

elasticities in the dual case). However, they are not the usual elasticities,

and should be adjusted accordingly. Otherwise, one will underestimate

own—price demand elasticities, and infer that the types of labor are greater

p—substitutes than in fact they are.

       Another consideration is the choice of a disaggregation of the work

force. Much of the early empirical work (through the middle 1970s) focussed

on the distinction between production and nonproduction workers. This was

dictated partly by the ready availability of time—series data on this

disaggregation, partly by the belief that this distinction represented a
                                  38


comparison of skilled and unskilled workers. Recent work by labor economists

has recognized that differences in skill (embodied human capital) between

production and nonproduction workers are not very great. lso, most of the

pol icy issues on which studies of labor demand can have a bearing involve

labor subgroups disaggregated according to other criteria. Thus most of the

recent work has disaggregated the work force by aQe, by race or ethnicity, by

sex, or by these criteria in various combinations.

     Given one's interest in substitution among particular groups of labor

necessitates the aggregation of workers who differ along other dimensions that

are of less interest to the researcher. Care should be exercised, though,

that the aggregations decided upon make sense, in that substitution toward

other groups is the same for all workers within a subaggregate.9 In practice

this means that, wherever possible given the limitations of the data being

used, one should test for the consistency of aggregating workers into larger

groups. For example, if one is concerned about substitution among males,

females and capita, one should if possible test whether the substitution

between young men and females (or capital) is the same as that far older men.

     The problem of deciding which disaggregation to use and the larger

difficulty of deciding what we mean by a 11skill" have led to efforts to

circumvent the decision by defining a set of characteristics of the workers.

In this view (see Ujelch (1949) and Rosen (1983)) each worker embodies a set of
                                                                              10
characteristics (by analogy to Lancastrian models of the demand for goods).

This approach has the appeal of avoiding the aggregation of what may be very

dissimilar workers into a particular group; instead, it ulets the data tells'

what the appropriate skill categories are, in a manner similar to factor

analysis. One of its difficulties is that it has not as yet been developed

enough that the powerful restrictions of production theory can be imposed on
                                   39


estimates using this approach. Also, for many issues that attract pub] ic

interest the arbitrary disaggregations of workers by age, race, sex, etc. are

of substantial importance.




VII. Heterogeneous Labor——Results and Problems


     A summary of the parameters of interest in the studies that have examined

                                                                      11
heterogeneous labor disaggregated by occupation is shown in Table 4. Perhaps

the most consistent finding is that nonproduction workers (presumably skilled

labor) are less easily substitutable for physical capital than are production

workers (unskilled labor). Indeed, a number of the studies find that

nonproduction workers and physical capital are p—complements. This supports

Rosen's (1968) and Griliches' (1969) initial results on the c.apJ.ial—.skiII

cIiaii hi±b.s..Ls. This finding has major impi icat ions f or the

employment effects of such policies as accelerated depreciation. investment

tax credits and other attempts to stimulate investment in physical capital,

suggesting that they will increase the demand for skilled relative to

unskilled labor.

     Although not uniformly observed in all the studies tabulated, in most the

demand elasticity for nOnpraduction workers is lower than that for production

workers. This difference reflects what seems to be a consistent result among

studies examining all the disaggregations of the labor force: The own—price

demand elasticity is lower, the greater is the amount of human capital

embodied in the average worker in the particular class of labor. Thus skill

p.ar. s. ties employers to workers by making labor demand less sensitive to

exogenous changes in wage rates.

     One would like to draw some inferences about the ease of substitution of
                                                                          TABLE 4

white— for blue—collar labor, and about the absolute size of the demand

elasticities for each. Unfortunately, there appears to be very little

agreement among the studies on these issues. Examining the table more

closely, though, one notices that the estimated demand and substitution

elasticities are generally higher in those studies that base them on estimates

of production functions. Since inferring these parameters from production

functions requires inversion of an entire matrix of parameter estimates (see

equation (29)), they will be affected by errors in any of the parameters

estimated. While there is no reason to expect biases, the accumulation of

errors is also to be avoided. For that reason the cost—function estimates are

likely to be more reliable. The estimates shown in Parts l.A and II .A are

better ones to use to draw inferences about the extent of substitution among

these three factors. Using them, the demand elasticities for the broad

categories, white— and blue—collar labor, seem to be roughly the same

magnitude as the estimates of the demand elasticity for homogeneous labor that

we discussed in Section V.

     Only a few studies have disaggregated the labor force by educational

attainment. Among them Grant (1979) finds that the own—price demand

elasticity decl ines the more education is embodied in the group of workers.

(This is consistent with the results on the relation of the elasticity to the

skill level that we noted above.) Grant and others, including Welch (1970)

and Johnson (1970), find that college and high—school graduates are

p—substitutes. (These latter two studies, which estimate pairwise CES

relations, are less reliable because they did not allow the level of other

factor inputs to affect the measured extent of substitution within a pair of

inputs. Essentially they estimate relative factor demand for many pairs of

factors.) All the studies estimate the extent of substitution, and the

own—price demand elasticities, to be roughly on the order of those found
                                             41


between white— and blue—collar workers in Table 4.

        The disaggregations of labor used in the studies discussed above are

clear—cut. In the more recent research a large variety of disaggregat ions,

mostly involving age and/or race and/or sex, have been used. This diversity

makes it rather difficult to draw many •firm conclusions from the findings

because of the relative lack of replication. In Table 5 1 list the results of

these studies, separating them by whether they estimate substitution

elasticities or elasticities of complementarity. Among the former several

elasticities (and, though they are not shown in the table, the substitution

elasticities) are much larger when produced using methods that treat factor

quantities as exogenous. This result parallels what we observed in Table 4;

even though quantities may be exogenous, deriving any substitution elasticity

from estimates based on this assumption requires estimates of all the

production parameters. That requirement may induce large errors when one or

more of the parameters is estimated imprecisely.

        The estimates of the factor—demand elasticities vary greatly among the

studies. (Indeed, in Merrilees (1982) some are positive, for reasons that are

not clear; but their sign casts doubt on all of Merrilees' results.) However,

the demand elasticity for adult men is generally lower than that for other

groups of workers. This result is another reflection of the apparently

general inverse relationship between a group's average skill level and the

elasticity of demand for its labor. The final general izat ion from the studies

listed in Part I of Table 5 is that in most of the disaggregations each factor

is a p—substitute for the others.

        As we noted in Section VI, the elasticity of supply should guide the

choice about whether to treat wages or quantities as exogenous. In the case

of disaggregating by age and sex, treating quantities as exogenous and

deriving elasticities of cornplernentarity and factor price is the better choice

(in the absence of a well—specified model of the supply of each type of labor)

if data on large geographical units are used. (Clearly, if data on a small

industry or even individual establishments are used, wages should be treated

as exogenous. One's bel ief in the validity of the theory of labor demand

should be strengthened by the results of those three studies——Rosen (1968),

OConnell (1972) and King (1980)——that use these small units and find the

expected negative own—price elasticities for workers in narrowly—defined

occupations.) The studies presented in Part 11 of Table 5 treat quantities as

exogenous and estimate these elasticities for a variety of disaggregations of

the labor force. As such they give a better indication of the substitution

possibilities within the labor farce disaggregated by age, race and sex than

do those listed in   Part   I.


     In all the studies the elasticities of factor prices are fairly low.

(Given the small share of output accounted for by most of the inputs, the

elasticities impi ied by Borjas' studies and by Berger (1983) are also quite

low.) They suggest that the labor market can accommodate an exogenous change

in relative labor supply without much change in relative wages2No

general izations about the relative magnitudes of the elasticities are possible

from the studies currently available.

     One intriguing result occurs in all four studies (BorJas (1983a),

Grant—Hamermesh (1981), Berger (1983) and Freeman (1979)) that examine the

issue. Adult women are q—substitutes for young workers. Borjas (1983a) also

disaggregates the black male work force by age and finds that most a-f   the

q—substitutabil ity is between women and young black men. This finding

suggests that the remarkably rapid growth in the relative size of the female

labor force that has occurred in many industrialized countries, including the
                                  43


United States, Canada and Sweden, in the past twenty years has contributed to

a decline in the equilibrium relative wage iate for young workers. To the

extent that relative wages cannot adjust because of real wage floors, and thus

permanent unemployment, the assumptions needed to produce estimates of

q—substitutability are incorrect. However, so long as adjustment ..en±uaI1

occurs, these cc. :section estimates can be used to infer that the growth of
the female labor force has also contributed to the high rate of youth

unemployment in these countries during this time.

    Among the studies discussed in this Section oniy a few have tested for

the separability of labor from capital (and thus shed light on whether

estimates of the (gross) elasticities of demand or of factor prices obtained

when capital is excluded are biased). Berndt—Christensen (1974a) and

Denny—Fuss (1977) examine this issue using the production—worker,

nonproduction—worker disaggregatian; and Grant—Hamermesh (1981) disaggregate

the labor force by age, race and sex. All three studies conclude that the

separability of labor from capital is not supported by the data, The findings

suggest that the inclusion of the quantity or price of capital services is

necessary to derive unbiased estimates of production and cost parameters even

between subgroups in the labor force. The extent of the biases induced by

assuming separability has not been examined, though Borjas (1983a) indicates

that the a.. involving labor—force subgroups change little when capital is

excluded from a generalized Leontie-f system.13

     There has also been very little effort made to examine whether the

particular disaggregations used are correct in assuming that workers included

within a subgroup are equally substitutable for workers in other subgroups.

This absence is due partly to the difficulties of obtaining data on large

numbers of narrowly—defined groups of workers. However, the evidence (see
                                   44



Grant-Harnermesh (1981)) suggesting that it is incorrect to aggregate subgroups

of workers into still larger subgroups should induce greater care in future

research in this area.


VIII. Conclusions


     Research into the demand for labor over the past 50 years has focussed on

depicting demand in a decreasingly restrictive way as the outcome of

employers' attempts at cost minimization or profit maximization. The outcome

of this trend to date is a means of characterizing demand for N factors of

production in a way that allows for complete flexibility in the degree of

substitution within any pair of factors; for that flexibil ity to depend on the

firm's output level; and for flexibility in the specification of returns to

scale in production. Not only is the theory completely general: We have today

the means to describe production relations empirically in a completely general

manner.

     Perhaps the main advantage of this increased general ity is that it allows

us to test whether some of the simpler specifications of labor demand describe

the data well. Thus the many studies analyzed in Section V suggest that the

Cobb—Douglas function is not a very severe departure from real ity in

describing production relations between homogeneous labor and physical

capital. So too, returns to scale in production functions involving

homogeneous labor do not seem to differ too greatly from one.

     The major advance of the last 15 years has been the ability to estimate

substitution within several pairs of inputs. While such estimation is reall>

in its childhood (partly because of the wide range of interesting choices

about how to disaggregate the labor force), some results are already fairly

sol Id. 1) Skill (human capital) and physical capital are p—complements in

production; at a fixed output employers will expand their use of skilled labor
                                     45



when the price of capital services deci ines. 2) The demand for skill is also

less elastic than the demand for raw labor; thus we find that the demand for

more educated or more highly trained workers is less elastic than that -for

other   workers. 3) No matter what the disaggregation, labor is not separable

in production from physical capital. This finding impi ies that estimates of

substitution among groups within the labor force should be based on models

that include either the price or quantity of capital services. 4 Finally,

though it is less solid a result than the other three, there is an

accumulation of evidence that adult women are q—substitutes for young

workers.

        The theory and estimation techniques we have outlined provide many ways

to estimate the degree of factor substitution and the responsiveness of factor

demand <prices) to changes in factor prices <quantities). Though the

appropriate specification depends upon one's beliefs about the behavior of the

agents in the particular labor market, several guidelines for the analysis

arise from this discussion. Where at all possible, the specification should

allow the researcher sufficient flexibil it>' to test whether simpler

specifications are applicable. Where the data are available, physical capital

should be included as a factor of production in the analysis along with the

various types of labor.

        Despite the substantial advances that have been made in analyzing the

demand for labor, a remarkable amount is still unknown. We still understand

very little about the absolute magnitudes of elasticities of demand, or

elasticities of factor prices, for various labor—force groups. So too, the

ease of substitution among groups is only now beginning to be analyzed.

        More important than these lacunae in our understanding of labor demand,

though, are problems induced by the failure to account for the interaction of

substitution parameters with parameters describing the supply of labor—force
                                46


groups. Those relatively few studies that have estimated demand relations

using highly disaggregated data corroborated the basic predictions of the

theory of labor demand. However, there has been far too little work that has

accounted for the possibil it>' of simultaneity between wages and quantities of

labor. Since we have seen how important the specification of labor supply is

to deriving estimates of production parameters, the joint estimation of

substitution parameters and labor supply should be an area that will lead to

substantial advances in understanding the demand for labor. Alternatively,

more research is needed that estimates demand relations using data on

individual firms or establishments as units of observation.

  1The little trick to derive (17a) and (17b) is to remember that, after having
  done the grubby arithmetic, the numerator is just Y raised to the power i—p.

  2The arithmetic that demonstrates this is in Varian [1978, p. 18].

  3One might wonder how, if 1L =               in the two—factor case,

  LL = 5LLL in the multi—factor case when we assume N =
                                                        2. Remembering that

  SLLL + SK =   O 11LL =     SK     Since    =   —     and KL is just

  alternative notation for    ,    the two representations are identical.
     good mnemonic for these distinctions is that the q and p refer to the
  exogenous quantities and prices whose variation is assumed to produce changes
  In endogenous input prices and quantities respectively.

   5To derive a.., perform the required differentiation and remember that
  g1=X.

  6One should note that the slope parameter on in WL in (48) is not the usual
constant—output labor—demand elasticity, and that the latter needs to be
calculated from the estimate using (4a). it is also worth noting that (48) is
a trans-formation of the equation used by rrow LI al (1962) to estimate the
elasticity of substitution in the CES function they had proposed: Under
constant returns to scale (48) can be written as;

                 In '(IL
                           aOwL,
the -form originally used to estimate .
   7The issues from 1975—1982 of a large number of Journals
were searched. For years before 1975 the references are taken
from Harnermesh (1976). While we make no claim that our survey
is exhaustive, it should give a fair representation of work on
this subject.

   8Remernber that this is an
economic issue, not a problem of inferring the partial
elasticities of substitution or complementarity. in the translog
case, for exarnple,those can always be inferred, either easily or
by inverting a matrix involving all the coefficients estimated.

   9lndeed, one should be able
to demonstrate that workers can be aggregated
linearly, not merely that those within a subgroup are separable
from those in other subgroups.
 10
    Stapleton and Young '1983) have attempted to apply
this view to the United States for 1967—1977. The results
support many of the findings summarized in the next section,
though they are not uniformly consistent with the theory of
product ion.

  1tThe issues from 1979—1982 of a large number of
journals were searched. For years before 1979 the references are
taken from Harnerrnesh—Grant (1979).

  12This finding implies nothing about how uicidx
an economy can adjust
to such a change. Even though the required change in relative
wages may be slight, adjustment costs may be sufficiently large
to lead to long periods of disequil ibriurn in the markets for some
o-f the groups of labor.
 13
    By tself, though, this shows very 1 ttle,
since small changes in the estimated parameters in a
translog or general ized Leontief system often lead to large
changes in the estimates of the underlying production or cost
parameters, as the discussion in Section III indicates.
