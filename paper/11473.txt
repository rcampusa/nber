This paper analyzes the long-run determinants of inflation differentials in a monetary union. First,
we aim at establishing some stylized facts relating the regional dispersion in headline inflation rates
in the euro area as well as in the main components of the consumer price index. We find that a
relatively large proportion of it occurs in the Service category of the EU’s harmonized consumer
price index (HICP). We then lay out a model of a monetary union with fully flexible prices, the
long-run properties of which are analyzed. Our model departs in several respect from the Balassa-
Samuelson hypotheses. Our results are in contrast with the result that movements in the real
exchange rate are mainly driven by regionally asymmetric productivity shocks in the traded sectors.
Our results point instead to relative variations in productivity in the non-traded sector as the primary
cause of price and inflation differentials, with shocks to productivity in the traded sector being
largely absorbed by movements in the terms of trade in the regional economies. These shocks are
also found to largely drive the variability of real wages at the country level.

1       Introduction
The experience of a major transformation in the exchange rate regime associated with the launch
of the euro has spurred much research aiming at understanding the scope for, magnitude and
persistence of inflation diﬀerentials across the regions of a monetary union as well as their potential
relevance for monetary policy making. The initial years of EMU coincided with a change in trend
in the observed degree of dispersion in inflation rates across euro area countries. In the run-up
to monetary union, inflation rates across member countries had largely converged. In the year
2000 the degree of dispersion across countries picked up somewhat and since then a non-negligible
degree of dispersion across national inflation rates in euro area has been at times observed.
    Early contributions in the literature1 aimed at accounting for the persistence of inflation
diﬀerentials within a monetary union such as the euro area in terms of the relevance in this
respect of the Balassa-Samuelson eﬀect.2 Such an explanation based Balassa-Samuelson eﬀect
seemed appealing, at least prima facie, taking into account in particular that national inflation
rates were highest in the fastest-growing economies such as Ireland, Greece and Spain. However,
the focus on a single explanatory factor was gradually superseded by broader explanations3 in
which the observed inflation diﬀerentials were accounted for by more complex interactions among
various factors such as the presence of heterogeneity in regional market structures (e.g. the degree
of market competition), the consequences of common and idiosyncratic regional shocks of both a
supply and demand nature and the role of fluctuations in the regions’ terms of trade to transmit
and absorb the eﬀects of shocks to fundamentals.
    This paper aims at analyzing the determinants of inflation diﬀerentials in a monetary union
both from an empirical and a theoretical dimension.
    First, in order to motivate the theoretical investigation, we first present evidence on the
statistical features of observed dispersion in headline inflation rates as well as in changes in the
components of the consumer price index,4 based on the experience of most of the European Union
countries conforming the euro area. Our descriptive exercise shows that there is still a sizeable
dispersion of HICP inflation rates across euro area countries. In a sectorial decomposition of this
dispersion, we find that most of it originates in the Service category of the HICP (although in some
historical periods also the Energy category has significantly contributed to overall dispersion).
This suggests that the main source of dispersion in countries’ headline inflation rates is in those
components of the HICP where non-traded goods are more intensely represented. We then
use a dynamic factor model to analyze the sources of dispersion in countries inflation rates,
decomposing the aggregate and sectorial measures of dispersion in, on the one hand, a common
component - driven by common factors - and, on the other hand, an idiosyncratic component.

     All data relating consumer prices, both relating headline inflation in the euro area, countries’ consumer prices
and subcomponents of the consumer price indes at the euro area and country levels, will refer to Eurostat’s
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (henceforth HICP).



                                                         2
We find that the heterogeneous responses, across countries, to a change in the estimated common
factor can account for a sizeable fraction of the dispersion in national inflation rates. This is
particularly the case for the Non-Energy Industrial goods categories, even if the cross-country
dispersion of the inflation rates of items in this category is relatively quite low. Moreover, this
also applies particularly to the Services component of the HICP, which, importantly, is instead
characterized by a relatively high level of dispersion. These results overall underline the large
relative contribution that the observed persistence in regional inflation diﬀerentials in the Services
component of the HICP make to overall persistence in observed headline inflation diﬀerentials
across regions.
    Second, we build a stylized model of a monetary union comprised of two regions, with a view
to gauging the relative contributions in explaining the qualitatively features of the data of, on the
one hand, innovations in the shocks and, on the other hand, structural diﬀerences in the regional
economies. In each of the two regions of the model monetary union, two productive sectors are
assumed, a traded and a non-traded goods sector. Each region is specialized in the production
of a distinct, non-overlapping bundle of traded goods. The law of one price holds for each of
the traded goods produced. Thus, consumer price and inflation diﬀerentials arise in the model
as a consequence of movements in the relative prices of non-traded goods. This is the standard
channel emphasized also by the trade literature on the Balassa-Samuelson eﬀect.
    Some distinct aspects of this model relative to the literature are described in the following.
    One important feature is that capital is not mobile and that labour mobility within sectors
of the same country can be imperfect for the introduction of imperfect substitutability between
diﬀerent varieties of sector-specific labour. This device generates wage diﬀerentials across sectors,
which is a desirable feature from an empirical perspective (e.g. Ortega, 2003) and introduces an
amplifying eﬀect on the relative price movements in response to sectorial shocks.5
    For the assumption of country specialization in the production of traded goods, terms of
trade movement are critical for the transmission mechanism of shocks. As has been recently
pointed out in the literature (Benigno and Thoenissen, 2003), a positive productivity gain in
the tradable good sector has two counteracting eﬀects on the overall price level, with upward
pressure on the relative price of non-tradables oﬀset by a worsening of the terms of trade. Which
eﬀect dominates depends on the relative values of the elasticities of substitution in consumption
preferences between home and foreign tradables and the degree of labour mobility.
    Interestingly, we show that the Balassa-Samuelson result —that movements in the real ex-
change rate are significantly aﬀected by asymmetric shocks in the traded productivity— is mod-
ified and for realistic parametrizations of the model of limited empirical relevance. Our results
point instead to relative variations in productivity in the non-traded sector as the primary cause
of price and inflation diﬀerentials, with shocks to productivity in the traded sector being largely
absorbed by movements in the terms of trade in the regional economies. These shocks are also
found to drive the variability of wages at the cross-country level.
  5
      Inter-regional mobility is not allowed in the model, even over the lung run.



                                                          3
    New insights on the explanation of real exchange rate movements emerge in our framework.
Namely, a balanced (i.e. that aﬀects both sectors) productivity shocks in one country may have
a role in explaining real exchange rate movements or, in a monetary union, inflation diﬀerentials.
In particular, we find that, for plausible parameter values, a balanced increase in productivity
in one country has a negative and sizeable impact on the consumer price of the country relative
to the rest of the area. Moreover, our framework permits that demand shocks play a role in
generating long-term price or inflation diﬀerentials across countries.
    The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the descriptive statistics on euro-
area inflation diﬀerentials and proposes a dynamic factor model decomposition of it. Section
3 presents the structure of the model. Section 4 characterizes the equilibrium and transition
dynamics upon shocks in the model, under fully flexible prices. It also shows the long-run impact
of permanent increases in the structural shocks. Section 5 presents the variance decomposition
of key endogenous variables in the model as a function of the variance of the structural shocks.
Section 6 closes the paper.



2    Euro area inflation diﬀerentials
This section addresses three empirical questions concerning the euro area economy. How sizable
are the inflation diﬀerentials in the euro area in comparison to other currency areas? Are the
inflation diﬀerentials in the euro area a sectorial phenomena, i.e. tradable versus non-tradable?
Are the inflation diﬀerentials in the euro area the result of diﬀerentiated responses to common
area-wide factors, or are they due to idiosyncratic (sector/country specific) factors?
    A number of papers have recently provided empirical analysis of inflation diﬀerentials in the
euro area. Alberola (2000) is one of the first analysis of post-EMU data specifically focusing
on cross-country inflation diﬀerentials. Recently a more extensive review of empirical evidence
and literature has been conducted by the ECB, (ECB, 2003). The latter work surveys a variety
of measures of price and cost developments at the national level in EU-12 during the 1999-2002
period and explores diﬀerent possible macroeconomic determinants. Here we maintain a narrower
focus on which are the stylized statistical facts that are more relevant for our analysis. For this,
we provide descriptive statistics as well as perform econometric analysis based on dynamic factor
models.
    The data used are based on the harmonized index of consumption prices (HICP). These data
are harmonized indices of consumer prices for a basket of all goods and services consumed by a
country, expenditure-weighted. We analyze seasonally adjusted data for the area as a whole and
for ten individual countries (all euro countries except for Greece and Luxemburg), for the period
from January 1990 to February 2004. Excluding Greece and Luxembourg reflects the fact that
HICP data series for these countries are shorter than for the other countries in the sample. Both
for the euro area and the individual countries HICP we considered the overall HICP inflation
index as well as the five main subcomponents in the HICP, namely Services, Industrial Good

excluding Energy, Energy, Processed Food and Unprocessed Food.6
   To set notation, π ij,t is the year on year growth rate of price in subindex j of country i and the
aggregate euro area counterpart is π euro                 i
                                        j,t . While π t denotes the overall inflation rate in country i
and π euro
      t    is the overall euro area inflation rate. The inflation diﬀerential between country i and
the euro area is denoted as:
                                           δ i,t = (π it − π euro
                                                             t    );

while the dispersion of inflation is measured by the root mean squared around the euro area
average, as :
                                          Ã P10         !1/2
                                                    2
                                              i=1 δ i,t
                                     ∆t =                    .
                                               10
The inflation diﬀerential between subindex j in country i and the euro area one is denoted as:

                                           δ j,i,t = (π ij,t − π euro
                                                                 j,t );


while the dispersion of inflation in the sub-component j is measured as:
                                                  Ã P10              !1/2
                                                             2
                                                       i=1 δ j,i,t
                                         ∆j,t =                             .
                                                         10

The overall dispersion ∆t is not the weighted average of the sectorial dispersion given the nonlin-
earity of the transformation. We decompose the overall dispersion into the relative contribution
of the diﬀerent subcomponents. To this end, first, we assume that the sectorial country weights
inside the HICP, wj,i,t , are equal across countries, i.e. wj,i,t = wj,t ∀i, then we define the contri-
bution of sector j to the overall inflation dispersion as:

                                                 w × ∆j,t
                                                P j          .
                                                 j wj × ∆j,t

The cross-country dispersion in inflation has been declining during the 90s across euro area as
documented in Figures 1. Dispersion was above 4% in the early 90s while it reached its minimum
at 0.26% at the end of 1997. After this point, the previous trend was inverted, starting to edge
up again to around 1% between 1998 and 2002. In early 2004 it stood at around 0.64%.7
    Compared with the degree of dispersion observed within some individual euro area countries,
inflation dispersion within the euro area remains relatively high. In particular, the recent degree
of dispersion within the euro area is around twice the comparable measures computed across the
German Länder, the Spanish Comunidades Autónomas and the Italian cities. On the contrary,
   6
     The weights of the five subindexes in the euro area HICP index in 2004 are 0.41, 0.31, 0.08, 0.12 and 0.08,
respectively.
   7
     This finding is slightly diﬀerent from the one reported in ECB (2003), due to the fact that we considered
the dispersion of the 10 indicated countries vis-à-vis the euro area while ECB (2003) considered also Greece and
Luxemburg.


                                                        5
the recent euro area inflation dispersion is quite comparable to the one measured among the 14
US metropolitan areas. The inflation divergence among US cities stayed remarkably constant at
around 1 percent for many years. However the analogy is probably misleading, given that US
cities are much smaller than EU nations, and their price indices tend to be more volatile.
    Despite the possible similarities in the level of inflation dispersion between US and euro area,
the high persistence of inflation diﬀerential is a characterizing feature of the euro area economy,
as noted by Cecchetti, Mark and Sonora (2000). Indeed, in our data set the measured persistence
of the inflation diﬀerential, δ j,i,t , is very close to the one of a unit root process on average across
countries and sectors.8
    The importance of sectorial pattern in explaining the overall dispersion is addressed in Figures
2-3. Figure 2 shows the dispersion of the year-on-year inflation rates in the euro area countries in
the Services, Industrial Good Excluding Energy and Energy sectors together with the dispersion
of the overall index. While Figure 3 presents the contribution of the sectors to the overall inflation
dispersion.
    Several conclusions can be drawn. First, all the components of inflation contributed to the
very low dispersion observed in 1997-1998. Second, the increase on dispersion between 2000 and
2002 can mainly attributed to the dispersion in Services and Energy sectors. Third, Figures 2
shows that the dispersion in the Service sector has been almost always higher than the overall
dispersion and its contribution has been increasing over time as indicated in Figure 3, also in line
with the increase of the weight of this subcomponent inside the HICP index. Fourth, diﬀerently to
the Services, the Industrial Good excluding energy index presents a low degree of dispersion and
its overall importance is decreasing. Finally, diﬀerently from the common wisdom, the dynamic
of the Energy subindex is a major source of overall dispersion. This is due both to the large
volatility of this subindex but also to considerable heterogeneity in the countries’ response to
shocks.
    Interpreting those results some cautionary remarks should be made. The HIPC is an index of
final consumer prices for a basket of all goods and services consumed; so Industrial Good excluding
energy price includes also the prices of (tradable) imported goods and a share of final sale services,
such as the prices of any non-tradable marketing and other final consumption services; the services
component included in the final Industrial good price might induce to overestimate the dispersion
of this sector. On the contrary, this is not the case in the Services sector, where the value added
deflator of Services almost entirely accounts for the final price of Services, as indicated by the
input-output evidence produced by Sondergaard (2003) for some euro countries.
    Finally, we address the last of the three questions stated at the outset - namely, whether the
observed dispersion in inflation across euro area countries is due to diﬀerent reaction to area-wide
factors or the result of country/sectorial developments. To tackle this question we follow a similar
approach to the one employed by Forni and Reichlin (2001) to decompose euro countries GDP
growth into a European, a national, and a residual component. We estimate an approximate
  8
    If we measure the persistence of the diﬀerential process by the largest autoregressive roots of a fitted ARMA
model, it turns out that the largest autoregressive root is 0.981 on average across sectors and countries.


                                                       6
dynamic factor model9 on the inflation diﬀerential which allows us to decompose the diﬀerential
in each countries and sectors as:

                              δ j,i,t = cj,i + Φj,i (L) × ut + ξ j,i,t = χj,i,t + ξ j,i,t                       (1)

where the first term of the right hand side is the average dispersion over the sample (ideally
nil), the second term captures the eﬀect of common area wide shocks, ut , which is allowed to
propagate across countries and sectors with a diﬀerentiate dynamic, and the last term captures
an idiosyncratic dynamic, mainly associated to country or sectorial specific developments. We
grouped the first and second term into χj,i,t .
     The approximate dynamic factor models exploits the cross-section dimension of a large panel
of time series to identify and estimates the part of the time series driven by few common shocks,
χj,i,t . To this end, in order to have proper estimates of the euro area common components in (1),
we augmented the sixty time series on diﬀerential, δ j,i,t , with 193 monthly macro-economic time
series related to the ten euro area countries considered.10 The estimation has been performed on
the sample period 1993.01-2003.06. In line with the finding of similar exercises, the results points
to the presence of strong commonalities among the 253 variables and the estimated common
factors account on average of around 50% of the variance of the 253 variables.11
     Having an estimate of the two components in (1), we can first ask how much of the historical
dynamic of diﬀerentials is accounted by the identified area wide factors. The table below reports
the average across countries of the share of variance of the diﬀerentials, δ j,i,t , accounted by
common shocks, both for the overall index and for the individual subindexes.

               Overall     Services     Industrial      Energy      Proc. Food        Unproc. Food
                0.66         0.58          0.67          0.52          0.65               0.42

It turns out that the Energy and the Services sector are the ones with the large idiosyncratic
components, while the Industrial Good excluding Energy and the Processed Food sectors are the
most common ones.
    The importance of the common factors is also clear from Figure 4-7, where we show how the
dispersion in inflation can be decomposed into the part attributed to the common factor, χj,i,t ,
and a remaining one, associated to the idiosyncratic part. Figure 4 presents the cross-country
dispersion of the overall HICP and its decomposition. The common part is clearly responsible for
the large part of the observed dispersion. The idiosyncratic part has a nil contribution to overall
dispersion from 1994 to 2000, but it contributes positively to dispersion from 2000 onward. The

     The data considered are, inter alia, main and sectoral industrial production indexes, consumer and producer
surveys, producer prices index, financial quantities, interest rates, trade statistics. The data has been seasonally
adjusted and transformed to be stationary.
  11
     The estimation procedure is based on the principal component decomposition of the variance-covariance matrix
of the data. The estimation indicates the presence of five static factors in the models.

Service sector presents a behavior similar to the overall index with large part of its dispersion
explained by country-specific reaction to common shocks. The increase in dispersion since 2000
is mainly associated to the common factor; even if idiosyncratic elements contributed positively
both during 2000 and 2002. In the Industrial sector the commonality is even more striking,
however it should be noted that the dispersion in this sector is relative low. By contrast, in the
case of Energy prices most of the dispersion is due to presence of idiosyncratic factors, see Figure
7.
    To conclude, the inflation diﬀerentials in the euro area are relevant and persistent. Our proxy
of the non-tradable sector, namely the Services sector seems to make a particularly strong contri-
bution to dispersion; this related to both the eﬀects of common as well as the idiosyncratic factors
behind the Services component. By contrast, the dispersion in our proxy of the price index of
tradable goods - namely industrial goods excluding energy - is relatively limited. Finally, a tenta-
tive overall conclusion from our attempt to understand the source of inflation diﬀerentials would
indicate that they are largely associated to diﬀerent responses of the ten euro area economies to
common, area-wide shocks.
    In the next section, we build a model in which the dispersion of prices at the consumer level
arises because of dispersion of prices in the non-traded sector and we analyze which shocks are
most responsible for generating such a dispersion. We focus on the long-run properties of the
model with no aim then at addressing the issue of persistence.12


3         The Model
Observed dispersion in the consumer price level across regions or countries in a monetary union
may be decomposed in its shorter-term and longer-term components, with the latter capturing
the persistency in price level and inflation diﬀerentials. The focus of our paper is on this second
component relating to long-lasting price level and inflation diﬀerentials across countries. For this,
we lay out a tractable model of a monetary union, aimed at analyzing the relative contributions
of various structural shocks to explaining the long-run component of the dispersion in prices at
the consumer level across countries.
    The model monetary union is comprised of two countries of equal population size. Consump-
tion preferences depend on non-traded and traded goods. Each country is specialized in the
production of a distinct and non-overlapping bundle of tradable goods. Financial markets are
complete within and across countries. Labor is immobile across countries but imperfectly mobile
within the sectors of a country. Prices are flexible in all sectors of the economy. The law of one
price holds in the traded sector and PPP holds at the level of traded goods. The model permits
to study deviations from PPP at the consumer level which arise as a consequence of movements
in the relative prices of non-traded goods.
    Our model is closely related to recent open-economy models, like Obstfeld and Rogoﬀ (2000)
    12
         This is the focus of a related work, Altissimo et al. (2004).

who introduces non-traded goods in stochastic models with sticky prices. Benigno and Thoenissen
(2003) use a similar model to study the real exchange rate behavior of UK with respect to the
Euro area with the purpose of analyzing whether supply shocks can account for the real exchange
rate appreciation in the late nineties.
    In reference to the recent literature on monetary unions our model is closely related to Duarte
and Wolman (2002, 2003). Their analysis is richer in two respects: first, they allow also for the
presence of producers’ price discrimination when selling same traded good in diﬀerent countries;
second, they endow fiscal policy rules with a non-trivial role in the reduction or amplification of
inflation diﬀerentials. This results from their assumption that lump-sum taxes are not available
to governments. In particular, Duarte and Wolman (2002) find that their model can deliver more
inflation dispersion following productivity shocks than what is observed in the data, while they
find that government spending shocks give rise to a negligible degree of dispersion. By contrast
to this analysis, our approach is limited to the case in which only lump-sum taxes are available.
    Andrés et al. (2003) analyzes a model in which only traded goods exist and in which price
discrimination across countries - made possible by diﬀerences in the degree of market competition
across the countries - is allowed for. They show that their model can account for sizeable inflation
diﬀerentials and that the driving force of the price dispersion in the traded sector originates more
from the mechanism of price discrimination rather than on price rigidity. Angeloni and Ehrmann
(2004) present a more stylized 12-country model of the euro area and in particular they focus on
the importance of assuming a role for inflation lags in the aggregate supply equation. They find
that this additional source of inflation persistence is important in driving up inflation dispersion
in the currency area. There are other papers that have analyzed monetary models of currency
areas, as Benigno (2004), Beetsma and Jensen (2004) and Lombardo (2004). However these
models do not allow for price dispersion at the consumer level and mainly focus on the role of
the terms of trade in stabilizing asymmetric shocks, when prices are sticky.

3.1   Households
We consider a model of a currency area composed by two countries, Home (H) and Foreign (F ).
Each country is populated by a measure one of households. A generic household j belonging to
either country H or F maximizes the following utility function:
                                            ∞
                                            X          £                  ¤
                               Utj   ≡ Et         β s−t U(Csj ) − V (Ljs ) ,
                                            s=t

where Et denotes the expectation conditional on the information set at date t and β is the
intertemporal discount factor, with 0 < β < 1. Households derive utility from consumption and
disutility from supplying hours of work.
    There are two classes of goods in both economies: traded and non-traded goods. Each country
produces a measure one of goods, a fraction γ (γ ∗ in region F )− with 0 < γ, γ ∗ < 1 - is composed
by traded goods. The remaining fractions are non-traded goods. The consumption index Ctj in

region H is defined as a Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator of indexes of traded, CTj , and non-traded goods,
  j
CN  , as it follows
                                 h 1       ϕ−1                      i ϕ−1
                                                                       ϕ
                                                         1
                                                             j ϕ−1
                          C j ≡ ω ϕ (CTj ) ϕ + (1 − ω) ϕ (CN   ) ϕ        ,

where ϕ is the elasticity of substitution between the bundles CT and CN with ϕ > 0 while ω
denotes the share of traded goods in the general consumption basket, with 0 < ω < 1. (This share
may be diﬀerent for households in region F and it will be denoted by ω∗ .) The traded goods are
non-homogenous and diﬀerentiated in consumption preferences. They are also produced with
diﬀerent technologies. In particular the index CTj is defined as a Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator of the
                                              j
bundles of home-produced traded goods, CH       , and foreign-produced traded goods, CFj , in the
following way
                                 h 1                              i θ

                                                                               j
where θ, with θ > 0, is the elasticity of substitution between the bundles CH     and CFj and n,
with 0 < n < 1, denotes the share of home-produced traded goods in the overall index of traded
goods. In the foreign economy n∗ , with 0 < n∗ < 1, denotes the share of foreign-produced traded
                                                                         j

by the continuum of diﬀerentiated traded goods produced respectively in region H and F and

of non-traded goods.
    Given the above consumption indices, we can derive the appropriate price indices. With
respect to the general consumption index, we obtain the consumption-based price index P

    Households get disutility from supplying labor to all the firms operating in their country of
residence. In particular the function V (.) is increasing and convex in an index of labor Lj . Each
firm uses a specific labor factor and each household can supply all the varieties of labor used
in the country to produce the continuum of traded and non-traded goods. In particular each
household supplies a measure one of labor varieties, of which a fraction γ will be employed in the
traded sector (γ ∗ is the respective fraction in the foreign economy) and the remaining respective
fractions in the non-traded sector. In particular we assume that Lj is a Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator
of labor indices LT and LN in the traded and non-traded sectors, respectively, as it follows

where υ > 0 is the elasticity of substitution between varieties of labor within a sector. In contrast
with standard models of traded and non-traded production, we are not necessarily assuming
that labor is perfectly substitutable and mobile across sectors and instead we allow for wage
diﬀerentiation across varieties of labor. The case of perfect substitutability, and perfect labor
mobility, is nested under the assumption that both φ, υ → ∞. In general, given wages wT (i)
and wN (i) specific to the generic variety i in the respective traded and non-traded sector, we can

Given the relative wages and the choice of Lj , we can then characterize the household’s labor

for each variety of labor supplied to a generic firm in a traded and non-traded sector, respectively.
    Each household faces the following flow budget constraint

                                            Btj ≤ Ajt + Wt Ljt + Πjt − Pt Ctj + Ttj                                                      (2)

where Ajt represents the beginning-of-period wealth that includes the bonds carried from the
previous period. Btj is the end-of period portfolio that includes a wide selection of instruments
that pay in each contingency that occurs. In particular they pay At in the particular contingency
at date t. As of time t − 1, At is a random variable whose realization depends on the state of
nature at time t.
   Here it is assumed that there are complete financial market which implies that there exists
a unique discount factor Qt,t+1 with the property that the price in period t of a portfolio with
random value At+1 is
                                      Bt = Et [Qt,t+1 At+1 ],

where Et denotes the expectation conditional on the state of nature at date t. In particular we
define the short-term interest rate in the following way, as the price of the portfolio that delivers



                                                                         12
one unit of currency in each contingency that occur one-period ahead, i.e.

                                              1
                                                   = Et [Qt,t+1 ].

    In (2), Πt are aggregate profits of all the firms within a country. Profits are risk shared across
households. Ttj are transfers from the government to household j. The economy is a cashless-
limiting monetary economy as discussed in Woodford (2003). The flow budget constraint of the
consumer can be written as

                           Et [Qt,t+1 Ajt+1 ] ≤ Ajt + Wt Ljt + Πjt − Pt Ctj + Ttj

and the consumer’s problem is further subject to the following borrowing limit condition in each
contingency and date that the consumer faces.
                                    ∞
                                    X
                       Ajt+1 ≥ −           Et+1 Qt+1,s {Ws Ljs + Πjs + Tsj } > −∞.
                                   s=t+1

The borrowing limit condition together with the flow budget constraint imply the standard in-
tertemporal budget constraint
                     ∞
                     X                            ∞

                           Et Qt,s Ps Csj ≤ Ajt +   Et Qt,s Ws Ljs + Πjs + Tsj .                  (5)

Given the above decisions on how to allocate consumption and labor across all the varieties, the
household j chooses the optimal path of the consumption index Ct and labor index Lt at all
times and contingencies to maximize its utility under the intertemporal budget constraint. In
particular the set of optimality conditions can be described by the set of Euler conditions

                                           Uc (Ctj )         β     Pt
                                             j
                                                       =                                          (6)
                                        Uc (Ct+1 )         Qt,t+1 Pt+1

for each state of nature at time t + 1 looking ahead from time t. By choosing appropriately
the distribution of initial state-contingent wealth, complete markets assure that consumption is
perfectly equalized within households belonging to a country. Moreover, across countries, the
ratio of marginal utilities of consumption is proportional to the ratio of consumer prices:

                                               Uc (Ct )    Pt
                                                         =ς ∗                                     (7)
                                               Uc (Ct∗ )   Pt

for a positive factor of proportionality ς > 0 which again depends on the initial wealth distribu-
tion. As shown by Backus and Smith (1993), under the assumption of complete financial markets,
consumer-price diﬀerentials directly translate into consumption diﬀerentials, so that a country


                                                       13
which experiences an increase in its consumer price level relative to another country should
experience a fall in its own consumption relative to the other country. This complete-market
assumption is a convenient simplification but it comes at a cost of neglecting wealth distribution
as an important channel through which price and inflation diﬀerentials can propagate into the
economy and be amplified.
    Real wages, computed using the general price and wage indices, are equated to the marginal
rate of substitution between the labor index L and the consumption index C as

                                                        Wt   Vl (Lt )
                                                           =          .                                                           (8)
                                                        Pt   Uc (Ct )

Finally the last optimality condition is the exhaustion of the intertemporal budget constraint,
i.e. (5) holds with equality at all times.

3.2    Firms
Regarding the supply side of the economy, we indeed assume that there is a continuum of firms,
of measure one, which is producing the continuum of goods. In particular a fraction γ (γ ∗ in the
foreign economy) is producing traded goods, while the remaining fractions are producing non-
traded goods. Taking as representative the home economy, a generic firm producing in the traded
sector is using the following technology y T (h) = AT f (l(h)), where AT is a country- and sector-
specific technological shock and f (.) is a standard concave production function in the specific
variety of labor used in the production of good h.13 In the non-traded sector the technology is
given by y N (h) = AN f (l(h)) for a generic firm h in the non-traded sector. Firms in both sectors
are monopolist and set their prices considering the overall demand of their goods. In the traded
sector, we assume that there is no price discrimination and that all the consumers of the area
face the same price for the same variety of goods. In particular in the traded sector a generic
firm h faces the following demand
                       µ          ¶−σ µ        ¶−θ µ        ¶−ϕ                 µ          ¶−σ µ         ¶−θ µ         ¶−ϕ

      y T (h) =                                                   C+                                                         C∗

In the non-traded sector, a generic firm faces the following demand
                                        µ        ¶−σ "µ     ¶−ϕ       #

                                1−γ         PN           P

where in particular G is an exogenous country-specific government-purchase shock that aﬀects
only the demand of non-traded goods. Period profits for a generic firm h in the traded sector are
  13
     When f (.) has decreasing return to scale with respect to labor, we are implicitly assuming that there is a fixed
factor of production, capital, which is not mobile across sectors.

where τ T,t is a sectorial country-specific time-varying proportional tax on sales in the traded
sector, pt (h) denotes the price of the firm h chosen at date t and ytT (h) is the total demand of
firm h at time t. As standard in models with monopolistic competition, profit maximization leads
to the condition that prices are set as mark-up over nominal marginal costs

                                           pt (h) = µT,t M CtT (h),

All firms within a sector set the same price. It follows that the supply schedule in the traded
sector of the domestic economy implies that

3.3   Fiscal and Monetary Policies
Each country has its own fiscal authority while there is a single monetary policymaker for the
whole area. In each region, the government raises revenues from the distortionary sale taxes to
finance the expenditure for domestic non-traded goods. Moreover, lump-sum taxes are available
to balance the budget in each period. It follows that
                         Z   1                               Z       1                      Z   1

There can be several possible ways through which diﬀerences in consumer prices can arise among
countries. One obvious reason has to do with the diﬀerent composition of the consumption
indices, due to diﬀerences in tastes. This can happen either because there can be home bias in
the consumption of traded good, so that n∗ 6= 1 − n or because the share of traded goods in the
overall consumption basket can vary across countries, ω 6= ω ∗ . Heterogeneity in consumption
preferences can be a source of consumer-price diﬀerentials even if the prices of all the goods,

                                                                     16
traded and non-traded, are equalized across countries. Conversely, even if tastes are similar,
price diﬀerentials at the single good level can produce diﬀerential at the consumer-price level.
The above decomposition shows that this can happen either because of deviations from the law of
one price for traded goods or because relative price of non-traded goods can vary across countries.
    The issue of explaining consumer price diﬀerential in a currency area is closely related to
a long-lasting puzzle in the international finance literature: the PPP puzzle and the related
literature on real exchange rate behavior.14 Using the above decomposition, Engel (1999) has
studied the US real exchange rate relative to several countries and shown that its variability can be
accounted mostly by the variability of the deviations from the law of one price for traded goods
relative to the variability of the relative price of non-traded goods. With multiple currencies,
firms might set their prices sticky in the currency of the buyer, hence protecting consumers from
fluctuations of the exchange rate. In this way deviations from the law of one price for traded
goods reflect mostly fluctuations of the nominal exchange rate. This interpretation is naturally
absent in a currency area, since there is no reason to protect prices from fluctuations of the
nominal exchange rate.15
    However, a unique currency does not exclude the possibility for firms to price discriminate
across diﬀerent markets (countries) due to diﬀerent degrees of competition in the markets or
structural characteristics.
    Moreover, even if firms do not price discriminate and markets are characterized by similar
structures and degrees of competition, there can be price deviations for traded goods that enter
the consumption basket, stemming from the fact that traded goods usually carry some non-traded
components (e.g. distribution costs) before reaching the consumer markets.16 Sondergaard (2003)
using input-output tables for France, Italy and Spain has shown that the traded sector relies more
than others on intermediate inputs produced by other sectors in the economy; in particular total
inputs from other sectors account for 60 percent of gross output in the traded sector. Movements
in the prices of non-traded goods that enter in the production or transportation of traded goods
can be an important source of price dispersion for traded goods at the consumer level. Our
evidence shows that inflation dispersion in the traded sector is much lower than in the non-
traded sector, which suggests that in any case diﬀerences in the relative price of non-traded
goods can be much more important in explaining the consumer price diﬀerential.
    In this work, we choose not to model any price diﬀerential in the traded sector to get more
  14
      See Rogoﬀ (1996).
  15
      A puzzling finding of Engel (1999) is that the importance of the relative price of traded goods in explaining
the variability of the real exchange rate is robust across the fixed exchange rate period of Bretton Woods and the
following floating exchange rate period. This decomposition holds in general also for developing economies, as in
the case of Mexico studied by Engel (2001). However in this case Mendoza (2000) has shown that during periods
of fixed-exchange rate regime movements in the relative price of non-traded goods are dominant in explaining real
exchange rate volatility. In relation to the debate on whether deviations from the law of one price for tradeable
goods originate from local currency pricing, works by Obstfeld and Rogoﬀ (2000) and Campa and Goldberg (2002)
have emphasized that the pass-through of the exchange rate at the border level can be high.
   16
      The importance of distribution sectors in explaining diﬀerential at the consumer-price leve has been emphasized
by Burstein et al. (2003) and Corsetti and Dedola (2004).

insight on what we believe can be a stronger channel.17 We assume that there is no price
discrimination and that PH = PH      ∗ and P = P ∗ at all times. We also assume perfect symmetry
                                              F     F
across countries and sectors and set ω = ω∗ = γ = γ ∗ and n = n∗ = 1/2. It further follows that
PT = PT∗ . In the appendix, we solve the model by taking a log-linear approximation to the relevant
structural equilibrium conditions around a deterministic steady state in which the shocks to mark-
ups, productivity and government expenditures, i.e. µT,t , µ∗T,t , µN,t , µ∗N,t , AT,t , A∗T,t , AN,t , A∗N,t ,
Gt , G∗t , are such that µ̄T = µ̄∗T = µ̄N = µ̄∗N = µ̄ and ĀT = Ā∗T = ĀN = Ā∗N = Ā, Ḡ = Ḡ∗ = 0. In
a log-linear approximation around this steady state the consumer-price diﬀerential is proportional
to the non-traded goods price diﬀerential (all in logs)

                              ln Pt − ln Pt∗ = (1 − γ)(T̂N,t − T̂N,t )
                                                                       ∗
                                               = (1 − γ)(ln PN,t − ln PN,t ),

where hat variables represent log-deviations of the respective variable from the steady state.
    The most popular and often advocated reason for why there can be long-lasting departures
from PPP originating from non-traded goods prices is due to Balassa (1964) and Samuelson
(1964). According to this view, countries that experience higher productivity growth in the
traded sector will also show higher consumer prices. The reason is that productivity growth in
the traded sector translates into an increase in the overall wage in the economy, since prices
of traded goods are tied internationally and there is perfect labor mobility. In the non-traded
sector, firm will increase their prices since costs have increased and there are no benefits from
productivity gains.
    There are several assumptions needed to get this result, as discussed in Froot and Rogoﬀ
(1995): mobility of labor and capital across sectors and mobility of capital internationally, con-
stant returns to scale in the mobile factors and exogenous world real interest rate. Indeed, we
cannot expect our model to display the Balassa-Samuelson features since capital is constant in
each sector and labor is not perfectly mobile. Moreover, as shown in recent works by Benigno
and Thoenissen (2003), Cova (2003), Duarte and Wolman (2003), Fitzgerald (2002), MacDonald
and Ricci (2002), the assumption of homogenous traded-good market is critical for the Balassa-
Samuelson result to hold. In our model, each country is specialized in the production of a bundle
of traded goods. When the traded sector of a country is subject to a productivity shock, prices of
home-produced traded goods can fall with respect to foreign-produced traded goods and terms
of trade worsen. In this case movements in terms of trade can absorb the productivity shock and
reduce the pressure on wages and then on non-traded goods prices.
    Another feature of the Balassa-Samuelson framework is that the consumer-price diﬀerential
depends only on the supply-side structure of the model. Instead in our framework, as in Rogoﬀ
(1992), a model no capital mobility and low labor mobility can also capture additional sources of
  17
    Andres et al. (2003) acknowledge the importance of the relative price of non-traded goods but they focus on
diﬀerentials that arise from price discrimination in the traded-good sector.

price diﬀerentials driven by demand shocks.18 This is also the case in a more modern exposition
of the Balassa-Samuelson model as in Canzoneri et al. (2001). We add also sectorial mark-up
shocks to study whether changes in taxation and competition can account for consumer-price
diﬀerences.
    To get further insight into the model, we assume that the production functions are linear in
the only factor of production, labor. In the appendix, we show that under this assumption the
log of the terms of trade and the log diﬀerence of non-traded goods prices are determined by the
following two equations

The above equation shows the determination of non-traded goods price diﬀerential as a function
of the shocks of the economy. When the intratemporal elasticity of substitution, θ, is close to one
then an increase in the productivity of the home traded sector does not increase in a significant
way the non-traded good price and thus the consumer price in the home economy. Contrary to
the Balassa-Samuelson result, a balanced productivity shock in all the sectors within a country
  18
     De Gregorio et al. (1994) find evidence that demand shocks can be important in explaining deviations from
PPP. As well, Froot and Rogoﬀ (1991) find that government spending can be an important explanatory variable
for real exchange rate movements of several European countries in the EMS.


                                                     19
creates a major reduction in the domestic consumer price. A relative increase in government
spending in the domestic economy increases price diﬀerentials across countries. The reason is
that government spending falls on non-traded goods and induces an increase in their prices.
Mark-up shocks in the non-traded sector increase price diﬀerential; the opposite happens if they
originate in the traded sector. A balanced mark-up shock in the domestic economy increases
the price diﬀerential. In the limiting case in which domestic and foreign traded goods become
perfectly substitutable (as in the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis), i.e. θ goes to infinity, then the
above solution collapses to

                                              ∗
                                    ln PN,t /PN,t = ÂR       R       R       R

which captures now the Balassa-Samuelson result augmented with mark-up shocks. Note that in
this limiting case, demand shocks and balanced shocks do not matter.19 Our results on the role of
the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign traded goods in driving the Balassa-
Samuelson eﬀect are consistent with the numerical findings of Duarte and Wolman (2003).
    Another illustrative case is when ϕ = θ = ρ = 1. Under this assumption we obtain

                  ∗             (φη + 1) γ                  (1 + φη)(φ(1 − γ) − 1) − (φ − 1) R

Now, the Balassa-Samuelson eﬀect is completely muted and, most important, values of φ below
one can change the sign of some of the responses as well as the magnitude.
    We now go back to our more general model and calibrate it in order study which of the shocks
in the model can be more relevant to explain price diﬀerential.

    As discussed in Froot and Rogoﬀ (1995), balanced productivity shocks can matter when labor intensity diﬀers
across sectors.

Table 1 presents the calibration of the parameters. The coeﬃcient of risk aversion in consumer
preferences is set to 2 as in Stockman and Tesar (1995) to get an intertemporal elasticity of
substitution equal to 0.5. From Stockman and Tesar (1995), we borrow also the elasticity between
traded and non-traded goods, ϕ = 0.44, and the share of traded goods in the consumption basket,
γ = 0.5. The intratemporal elasticity of substitution between home and foreign traded goods
is set such that θ = 1.5 as in Backus et al. (1995). Consistent with several microeconomic
studies, the Frisch elasticity of labor supply, 1/η, is set to 4 and the labor share is set such that
λ = 0.75. The discount factor β is assumed to be 0.99 and the elasticity of substitution for goods
within a sector, σ, is set to 7.88 to imply a 15% mark-up as in Rotemberg and Woodford (1997).
Furthermore, we assumed that in steady state the government expenditure is 20% of total output.
We are not calibrating the parameter φ which measures the degree of labor mobility across sectors.
Instead, we discuss three possible cases, φ = ∞, which captures the perfect labor mobility case,
an intermediate case of φ = 4.5 and a case with low elasticity, φ = 0.5.
    With flexible prices, the real variables of the model inherit the stochastic properties of the
shocks. There is no intrinsic persistence in the model. Then, Table 2 captures short- and
long-run components of consumer price diﬀerentials. In particular we show the response of the
consumer inflation diﬀerential and the terms of trade to a 1% increase of the shocks that are in
the model. We also describe the response of terms of trade to capture the dimension through
which movements in terms of trade absorb the usual Balassa-Samuelson eﬀect. Focusing on the
perfect labor mobility case, we see that a 1% increase in the traded-sector productivity in the
home country does increase the price diﬀerential only of 2 basis point, consistent with the results
of Duarte and Wolman (2003). The terms of trade worsen to absorb most of the shock. Instead
an increase in productivity in the non-traded sector and a balanced increase in productivity in
the domestic economy lower the domestic consumer price with respect to the foreign. In the
same way, terms-of-trade movements absorb mark-up shocks in the traded-sector with negligible
spillover on consumer prices, while mark-up shocks in the non-traded sector produce increases in
prices. Government-purchase shocks that aﬀect demand of non-traded goods increase the non-
tradeable goods price and thus the overall consumer price level. With intermediate values of the
labor-mobility parameter, the picture does no change much. On the opposite, when φ goes below
the unitary value, most of the responses are amplified and some change sign. Most important,

the impact of government-spending shocks is of larger magnitude.

5    Variance decomposition of the inflation diﬀerential
The previous section has analyzed the extent to which various structural shocks may generate
inflation diﬀerentials, which are found to be sizeable in the case of some of the shocks for a
plausible parametrization of the model. We now turn to evaluating the proportion to which
each of the shock contributes to the overall variability of the inflation diﬀerential implied by our
model. In order to perform the variance decomposition exercise, we need to specify and calibrate
the stochastic properties of all the shocks considered in the model. While a fully fledged exercise
would require the estimation of all the model parameters, here we resort to a simpler analytical
approach, assuming that the shocks to productivity, the mark-up and government expenditure
mimic the respective ones estimated by Smets and Wouters (2003), once aggregated across sectors
and countries.
    Starting from the productivity shock, we assume that each one of the four productivity shocks,
{AT,t ,AN,t , A∗T,t , A∗N,t }, follows independent AR(1) process with lag coeﬃcient of 0.823 and
standard error of the innovation of 0.012; this ensures that the aggregate productivity, resulting
from the weighted average of the countries/sectoral ones, exactly matches the process estimated
by Smets and Wouters (2003).
    The shocks to government expenditure in each country are assumed to follow the same inde-
pendent and very persistent AR(1) process with coeﬃcient on the lag term of 0.949 and standard
deviation of the innovation of 0.0046.
    Finally, for the mark-up shocks, we impose that they are common between tradable and non-
tradable sectors in each economy and we also assume the same process for both economies but
uncorrelated across economies. Furthermore, we impose that mark-ups are white noise processes
with a standard deviation of 0.0066, in order to match the overall variability of the price and
wage mark-up shocks of Smets and Wouters (2003).
    While the present calibration is admittedly ad hoc, it nonetheless provides some hints on the

                                                   22
way in which diﬀerent shocks contribute to the dynamic decomposition of the variance. Table
3 present the unconditional variance for several variables of the model. In particular the first
column considers the CPI inflation diﬀerential. We also present the fraction of the total variance
to which each shock contributes for each of the respective variables.

Focusing on the CPI inflation diﬀerential we note that the long-run variance is equal to 0.0020
which implies a standard deviation of 0.44% at quarterly frequency which roughly corresponds to
a standard deviation of 0.90% yearly.20 From Table 3, productivity shocks that aﬀect the traded
sector in general do not contribute much to the variability of the inflation diﬀerential, since they
are absorbed by movements in the terms of trade — indeed productivity shocks in the traded sector
are responsible for most of the volatility in the terms of trade. Most important, productivity
shocks in the traded sector explain the bulk of the variability of the output diﬀerential across
countries.
    By contrast, inflation diﬀerentials are mainly driven by productivity shocks aﬀecting the
non-tradable sector, and to a lower extent by mark-ups shocks. Productivity shocks in the
non-tradable sector are also the main factor behind the variability of real wages. Interestingly,
government-purchase shock do not contribute significantly to the variability of the variables
displayed in the table. For government-purchase shocks, the results are in line with Duarte and
Wolman (2003).
    While it is not easy to draw a clear link between the results of the factor analysis in Section 2
and the variance decomposition exercise, a plausible interpretation of this evidence is to associate
those underling statistical factors, identified in Section 2 for the euro area, with countries and/or
sectorial productivity dynamics. However a clear investigation of those links is beyond the scope
  20
     To convert on a yearly base, we multiplied the quarterly variance by a factor of four. This clearly understates
the yearly variance because it amounts at assuming that the quarterly changes are independent over time.

6        Conclusions
This paper provides both an empirical and a theoretical analysis of the factors accounting for
persistent inflation diﬀerentials in a monetary union comprised of heterogenous regions. Our
results indicate that asymmetric productivity shocks in the non-traded sector account for a sig-
nificant fraction of the variability in the relative CPI across the two countries. Moreover, we
find that symmetric sectorial productivity shocks in one country may generate sizeable inflation
diﬀerentials. This stands in contrast to the conventional explanation of movements in the real
exchange rate, which had pointed to movements in relative productivity in the traded sector.
    This concluding Section discusses some possible avenues for future work. The model could
be extended to include a third country so as to account for the component of inflation diﬀer-
entials that arise as a consequence of the interaction between common external shocks and the
heterogeneity among euro area members in terms of their trade linkages with non-EMU partner
countries. Honohan and Lane (2003, 2004) have emphasized the relevance of this source of infla-
tion diﬀerentials in the euro area, showing that movements in national trade-weighted multilateral
exchange rates are significantly correlated with national inflation rates. Even if our model relates
to a currency area with no external trade, the previous channel of inflation diﬀerentials stemming
from common external shocks could be proxied in our framework by balanced productivity shocks
which interact with heterogeneous country structures.
    More importantly, introducing country and sector specific degrees of nominal rigidity in price
setting would permit to analyze the interaction of structural shocks, asymmetric degrees of nom-
inal rigidities and monetary policy in shaping inflation diﬀerentials. It would also permit to
assess how optimal monetary policy is aﬀected by the presence of asymmetric degrees of nominal
rigidity in sectors and countries of a monetary union. We analyze these issues in Altissimo et al.
(2004).




    21
   Such investigation is currently hampered, notably, by the limited time span of euro area data, which makes
diﬃcult to address for the moment empirical issues on long-run determinants of inflation diﬀerentials.
