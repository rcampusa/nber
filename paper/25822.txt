Do Income Contingent Student Loan Programs Distort Earnings? Evidence from the UK

                                        ABSTRACT

Government backed income contingent student loans are an increasingly being used to fund
higher education. An income contingent repayment plan acts as an incremental marginal tax on
labor earnings, which could cause individuals to distort their work effort. This paper uses an
administrative dataset from the UK that links student loan borrowers between 1998 and 2008, to
their official tax records between 2001/02 and 2013/14. Using a combination of techniques,
including bunching and difference-in-difference methodology, our findings strongly reject
the hypothesis that the UK’s income-contingent repayment plan distorts labor supply.

           The rising cost of higher education is a topic of enormous controversy in the U.S., and

increasingly in other nations as well. In the U.S., the average cost of a four year private college

degree has risen from 15,160 in 1987 to $35,740 today.2 In other countries, in contrast, higher

education is largely free historically, but in a number of countries the costs of higher education

are rising as well.3

           A primary source of financing these higher education expenses is government

subsidized student loans. In the U.S., qualifying undergraduate students can borrow up to

$31,000 ($23,000 in subsidized loans) per degree program. Thirteen million students use

roughly $120 billion per year in student aid.4

           The problem with this solution is that students often appear unable to make their loan

payments upon graduation. For college graduates in 2007-2008 who had not pursued further

education, 24% were delinquent on at least one payment, 5% had defaulted on their debts, and

22% had debt repayments which amounted to more than 12% of their income, a level

considered by experts to be burdensome.5 The total burden of student debt in the U.S. is over

$1.4 trillion.6 This has led to a notable public debate about the college “affordability crisis” in

the U.S., with proposed solutions ranging from limiting the set of institutions at which students

can obtain loans to making universities debt free for all students.7

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/13/business/education-department-for-profit-colleges.html. At the same
           But another option is to emphasize a solution that is already in place: more use of

income contingent loans. Currently, undergraduate students can borrow up to around $60,000

($140,000 for graduate students) in federal student loans and by default enter a “mortgage

style” repayment system, which means repayments are set at a fixed level each year, with the

level chosen so that the debt is cleared in 10 years. However, since 2009, borrowers have been

able to apply to switch to Income Based Repayment (IBR), which have a maximum contribution

of 15% of discretionary income and 25 year repayment period, after which any outstanding

debt is written off.8 In 2016, 28% of borrowers were enrolled in income driven loan repayment

programs, holding 48% of all student loan debt.9

           An income-contingent loan approach to financing college education poses the standard

tradeoff of any means-tested transfer: insurance against poor labor market outcomes versus

disincentives to earn. An income-contingent repayment plan acts as an incremental marginal

tax on labor earnings, which could cause individuals to distort their work effort. This could be

particularly true for workers in the lower-middle class, who already face fairly high tax rates

from the phaseout of other government entitlement programs. Whether income-contingent

loan programs have such a distortionary effect on labor supply therefore becomes a critical

question for evaluating the advisability of this financing approach.

       Assessing the impact of income-contingent loans on labor supply decisions is difficult in

the U.S. Income-contingent loans are an option, and the choice of that option is likely

correlated with earnings prospects and labor supply decisions.

       So to study the effect of contingent loan programs on labor supply we turn to England.

College in England was historically very low cost, but this has increased significantly with time,

with fees rising from around £1,000 per year to around £3,000 per year in 2006, to £9,000 in

2012; as well, there have been sizeable increases in the cost of living, particularly for those

coming from poorer household or attending university in London. The government has issued

student loans to help with college costs for many years. Since 1998, the share of eligible

individuals choosing to borrow has remained relatively stable at around 85%. Private loans

during this period were not at all common due to the income contingent nature of the loans

and the low interest rate offered – until 2012, interest was equal to the minimum of the Retail

Price Index and the Bank Rate + 1%.

       Most importantly, repayment of income-contingent loans is only made once earnings

has crossed a certain threshold. This implies a large marginal tax rate at that threshold that can

be studied using standard bunching techniques (Saez, 2010). Moreover, this earnings threshold

changed repeatedly during our sample, allowing us to rule out other reasons for possible

bunching at the threshold. And the change in threshold allows us to also consider an

alternative differences-in-differences empirical strategy that compares earnings changes in

income ranges that see differential changes in income and substitution effects as the tax

threshold changes. This allows us to confirm our findings using multiple approaches.
       We do so using a dataset that links Student Loan Company (SLC) records to Her

Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) data. This consists of people who lived in England

when they applied for university and borrowed from the SLC to attend university in the UK. We

have a 10% sample of everyone who borrowed from the SLC between 1998 and 2008, and all of

their tax records between 2001/02 and 2013/14. We also have access to a residual dataset that

consists of all of the tax records that do not match to the SLC data and consists mostly of

people who didn’t go to university, or those who did go but did not borrow, which allows us to

form a control group for our analysis.

       Our findings are clear: there is no meaningful impact on earnings from the income-

contingent repayment rules. Across a variety of thresholds, we see little consistent evidence of

bunching. And we do not find any consistent change in earnings in income ranges that are

impacted through the change in the taxable threshold. This result is robust across types of

individuals and types of income, both payroll-based and self-reported. Our findings suggest

that there is little labor supply distortion to using this mechanism to finance college education.

       Our paper proceeds as follows. Part I discusses the issues around income contingent

loans as a college financing tool. Part II reviews the system of college financing in the U.K. Part

III discusses our data and Part IV our empirical strategy. Part V presents results, and Part VI

concludes.



                  Part I: Income-Contingent Loans as a College Financing Tool

       A large literature in economics documents the high rate of return to college attendance,

as reviewed by Hout (2012) and Oreopoulos and Petronijevic (2013). At the same time, this is
only an average estimate, and this human capital investment has uncertain returns. Risk averse

consumers facing such an enormous investment with uncertainty will value insurance against

those uncertain returns. For this reason, income contingent financing has long been

recommended as an approach, dating at least from Friedman and Kuznets (1945); see Shireman

(2017) for an overview of the history of thought in this area.

        But as with any insurance scheme, the benefits of reduced uncertainty must be weighed

against potential moral hazard costs. In this case, the moral hazard is reduced income

generation in response to the higher implicit taxes put in place by an income-contingent

system.

        These considerations may be paramount in countries such as the U.S. or the U.K. which

rely heavily on income-contingent transfers for the lower part of the income distribution.

Programs such as the Earned Income Tax Credit in the U.S. or the Working Tax Credit in the U.K.

have proven to be effective tools to redistribute income while promoting entry into the labor

force. At the same time, marginal tax rates in the phase out range of these programs can be

large. This is further augmented by other income-based transfers such as housing, health

insurance, and food assistance.10

        The available evidence on income responses to marginal tax rates under existing

redistribution programs does not suggest that such distortions are in fact sizeable.11 The

relevance of this literature in this context is not clear, however. The populations eligible for




10
   For an example of the analysis of these types of high marginal rates, see Mulligan (2015).
11
   See for example limited evidence on the distortionary role of marginal tax rates under the EITC in Eissa and
Liebman (1996) or more recent work on the limited impact of high marginal rates on full time work under the ACA
in Moriya, Selden, and Simon (2016).
these welfare programs are largely not college attendees. And many of the implicit taxes under

these programs are difficult to compute and do not tie to an easily identifiable level of income.

        Perhaps more relevant is the literature on income responses to tax thresholds. The

majority of which has focused on those with high incomes. Gruber and Saez (2002) estimate an

elasticity of taxable income (ETI) of 0.57 for high income individuals (those with incomes above

$100,000 in the 1980s) in the US. Brewer, Saez, and Shephard (2010) exploit a large cut in the

top rate of tax in the UK from 83% to 40% to estimate an ETI of 0.46 for those in the top 1% of

the income distribution.12

        Relatively few papers look at the responsiveness further down the income distribution.

Gruber and Saez (2002) argue that the effects are much smaller for those with incomes below

$100,000 in the US, while Adam et al. (2017) in the UK and Saez (2010) in the US find that

employees – who make up the vast majority of their sample – do not bunch at kinks in the tax

schedule further down the income distribution.

        Chetty (2012) highlights the differences between macro and micro elasticities of labor

supply and argues that this could largely be driven by optimizing frictions. Gruber and Saez

(2002) find that taxpayers who itemize (and who are likely to have the lowest frictions) are

particularly responsive to taxation, Kleven and Waseem (2013) find that the frictions are large

in Pakistan, while Adam et al. (2017) estimate that they could be worth as much as 9% of

income based on evidence from the UK. They also show that the most responsive to taxes are

company owner-managers and the self-employed. We are able to estimate responses of those



12
  These estimates seem high compared to the much of the more recent literature. Saez, Slemrod, and Giertz
(2012) suggest that the midpoint of the range of best available estimates is around 0.25. Piketty, Saez, and
Stantcheva (2014) also estimates of a very similar magnitude to this.
who itemize (that is, those who file Self-Assessment tax forms) separately from those who do

not, and we find no evidence of effects for either group.

        Once again, the applicability of this tax literature to modeling the effect of income-

contingent loan payoffs isn’t clear. That literature has not focused explicitly on the recent

college graduates the relevant income range for considering labor supply response to

repayment thresholds. College graduates who are undergoing frequent job transitions may be

more able to adjust their incomes. And these repayment thresholds may be even more salient

than are kinks in the income tax schedule.

        The literature that explicitly looks at the labor supply responses to student loans is

extremely limited. 13 The exception is Chapman and Leigh (2009), who investigate bunching at

the student loan thresholds in Australia in the early 2000s. At this time, Australian students

who borrowed from the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) had to make

repayments of 4% of their taxable income once they earned above the threshold of around AUS

$24,000. Crucially, this is a (vary large) kink in schedule which meant those earning exactly the

threshold would have disposable income around AUS $760 lower than someone earning AUS $1

less. They argue that there is evidence of bunching at the threshold, suggesting graduates are

indeed able to adjust their incomes in response to thresholds. However, they also argue that

while the effect is statistically significant, it is economically small – they suggest only around

0.3% of all those with HECS debt bunch, and they predict that the degree to which they reduce




13
  Also relevant is the literature investigating the impact of student loans on career choices. Rothstein and Rouse
show that people shift into higher paid occupations, while Sieg and Wang (2018) show that student loans affect
marriage and career choices of lawyers. The literature on the impact of income contingent loans is still in its
infancy, however.
their income is likely to be small. Our paper importantly extends on this work in several ways.

First, we use a much large sample (a 10% cut of administrative data) that gives us many more

individuals near to the threshold; Chapman and Leigh (2009) have only around 600 people

earning within AUS $1000 of the threshold in total, while we have several thousand individuals

within that range of the threshold in each year, enabling us to look separately at multiple

thresholds over multiple years. Second, they use a simple probit model to investigate the

degree of excess mass caused by the notch in the schedule, but they do not calculate

elasticities. And third, they are not able to consider how earnings growth in the early part of

graduates’ careers is affected by the thresholds, which we are able to do by exploiting the

changes in the threshold and through the panel element of our dataset.



                              Part II: College Financing in the U.K.

       The higher education system in the United Kingdom is complicated and has been subject

to much reform over the past 20 years. The U.K. is divided into four devolved nations - England,

Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - and higher education policy is the responsibility of these

devolved governments. This means that policy varies considerably. The focus of this paper is on

England, which is the country for which we have obtained Student Loan Company (SLC) records

of borrowers.

       English students can choose between around 150 universities and several other “further

education institutions” anywhere in the UK for which they are eligible for student loans. The

vast majority of these institutions remain as public institutions; although more recently the

number of private institutions has grown, this recent growth is not relevant to this paper as it
occurred after the population of students that we study had attended university. Traditionally,

the public institutions charged very low tuition: until 1998, there were no fees at all; between

1998 and 2005 fees were around £1,000; between 2006 and 2011 they were around £3,000;

then in 2012 they increased to £9,000. Details are provided in Table 1.

Notes: Cash terms figures. The maintenance loan amounts show the maximum maintenance loan for somebody living away
from home, outside of London. London rates are higher, while living at home rates are lower (generally, those from richer
households can borrow less). The repayment threshold is for the tax year, which runs from April 6-April 5. Maintenance and
tuition fee loans are for September 1 – August 31. The repayment threshold apply to people in repayment, meaning they must
have left university. Thus, people starting university in 2003/04 and doing a 3 year course would enter repayment in 2006/07,
meaning they would face the £15,000 repayment threshold. The repayment rate is 9% of earnings above the threshold
throughout. Source: Student Loan Company Statistical Release Series “Student support for higher education in England”.

         The government has offered student loans to help with living expenses during study

since the early 1980s. It set up the “Student Loan Company” in 1990 to administer the loans,

and in 1998 it made all newly issued loans “income contingent” which meant that individuals

only had to repay them if they earned above a certain threshold (prior to this, loans were

“mortgage-style” meaning repayments were dependent on amount borrowed rather than
current income). These living cost loans (referred to as “maintenance” loans) were around

£4,000 in 2002/03, increasing roughly in line with inflation. In 2006, for the first time the

government issued additional tuition fee loans, which almost doubled the amount people were

able to borrow.14

         The income contingent loan that was first introduced for 1998 university entrants meant

that individuals had to repay 9% of all income they earn above a threshold set by the

government. This was initially set at £10,000, before being increased to £15,000 in 2005, and

then roughly indexed to inflation after 2012. The marginal tax rate at the point just below this

repayment threshold was 33% between 2001/02 and 2008/09 and 31% between 2009/10 and

2013/14, the last year we observe the income data. This consisted 11% in National Insurance

Contributions (NICs), with the remainder made up in income tax. This meant that student loans

contributions increased the marginal tax rate from 33% to 42% up until 2008/09 and from 31%

to 40% after 2008/09. The student loan thresholds were chosen to be above the range where

they would interact with the phase out of other social support programs.

         There have also been changes to the details of the loan package such as the repayment

period and interest rate. Loans for our earlier cohorts (1998-2005) were written off at age 65,

while for our later cohorts (2006-2008) they were written off 25 years after graduation.

Meanwhile, the interest rate on student debt was index linked to be equal to the minimum of

RPI and the Bank of England base rate plus 1%, meaning it was much higher before the major

recession in 2008. There have been further subsequent changes to the repayment period



14
  Before 2006, the government did not offer explicit tuition fee loans, which meant students had to fund their
own tuition privately, or alternatively use their maintenance loans on their tuition costs. The tuition fees during
the 1998-2005 period were means-tested which meant that poorer students were exempt from paying any fees.
(increased to 30 years) and the interest rate (increased to RPI plus 3% while studying and RPI

plus 0-3% depending on income after graduation), but these occurred for cohorts starting

university from 2012, who we do not observe in our sample.

           Despite the changes to the loans over the past 20 years, the share of individuals

choosing to borrow from the SLC has remained remarkably stable at around 85% (Britton,

Shephard and Vignoles, 2018). Amongst non-borrowers, most have their university education

funded by their parents, and while private borrowing for student finance in the UK is very

rare.15

           Student loan repayments are automatically deducted by the tax authority, HMRC, from

individual’s reported income. Amongst our sample of borrowers who are in contact with HMRC,

around 90% have their income reported to HMRC through Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax forms,

which are automatically submitted by their employers. The other 10% file Self-Assessment (SA)

tax forms which include income from employment, self-employment and partnerships as well

as other forms of income (see Britton, Shephard and Vignoles, 2018 for more detail). These

individuals are legally required to accurately report their income in these forms. The loan

repayments are taken based on gross income net of salary sacrifice pension contribution in the

UK tax year, which runs from April 6th to April 5th. HMRC informs the SLC about the repayments

made by each individual at the end of the tax year (SLC typically contacts individuals when they

are likely to clear before the end of the tax year so the borrower can send in evidence of

repayment before the end of the tax year to prevent overpaying). Individuals are eligible to

start making repayments on their student loan only in the first full tax year after they have left

college. In most cases, students graduate in the summer and then start making repayments

based on the earnings from the following April.

                                          Part III: Data

       Our data for this analysis comes from Student Loan Company (SLC) records linked to Her

Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) tax records (see Britton, Shephard and Vignoles, 2018

for more detail). We have access to a 10% random sample of all students who borrowed from

the English SLC between 1998 and 2008. This corresponds to around 24,000 individuals, around

55% of whom are female, reflecting the higher share of women who attend higher education in

England. Anyone who was domiciled in England upon application to higher education (typically

in the year before they start university) and attended an institution anywhere in the UK is

eligible to borrow, and we estimate that around 85% of those eligible do choose to borrow. The

SLC and HMRC databases are hard linked based on official National Insurance numbers

(equivalent to Social Security numbers in the US), which are de-identified to ensure researchers

cannot observe them.

       From the SLC data we observe total amount borrowed, “voluntary repayments” and

from the HMRC data we observe earnings. Voluntary repayments are payments made over and

above those required based on income. For example, in a year where the threshold is £10,000,

someone with an income of £15,000 would be obligated to pay 0.09*(£15,000-£10,000) = £450.

However, they can make voluntary repayments over and above that figure which we observe

(more detail on these is documented in Britton et al., 2018b). Combining these factors, we are

able to estimate outstanding student debt for each individual at the end of a given tax year in

our linked dataset. That is, we calculate compulsory repayments based on observed earnings,
take off voluntary repayments and add loan interest. Figure 1 shows our estimated number of

borrowers who are in the labor market and have outstanding debt by tax year, comparing our

estimates from the HMRC dataset with official records from the SLC. Since we are using a 10%

sample, we divide the SLC numbers by ten for direct comparability. The downward tick towards

the end occurs because there are no new graduates entering the labor market in 2014 (since

our last entry cohort is 2008), and some of the older graduates are clearing their debt.

                         Figure 1: Comparison of HMRC and Official Student Loan Company Records




Notes: figure compares the number of borrowers in the labor market with positive debt imputed from the HMRC data with
official records obtained from the SLC. The SLC numbers are divided by ten to compare directly with the HMRC numbers which
are based on a 10% sample. Graduation year is approximated from the HMRC data, while the share with outstanding debt is
also approximated based on voluntary repayments, income and amount borrowed.

         We observe that our estimated numbers are very similar to the SLC official records,

which is a good validation of our dataset. The trends do differ slightly towards the end of the

period, which is unsurprising since there are three main reasons the share with outstanding
debt is imperfectly measured. First, we do not observe the timing of earnings or voluntary

repayments during the tax year, which will affect the interest applied. Second, we do not

observe repayments from people overseas. Individuals who move overseas are eligible to make

repayments based on a threshold that is set specifically by the SLC for each country based on

the cost of living. They are required to alert HMRC when they move abroad, and based on this

Britton, Shephard and Vignoles (2018) estimate that around 4% of our sample do this at some

point in the first 10 years after graduation. In some cases – for example people moving to a very

high paid job in Dubai – these student loan repayments from overseas could be substantial, but

unfortunately we do not have any data on this. Third, we do not observe voluntary repayments

after 2012. This latter factor is likely to explain the majority of the divergence in trends in 2013

and 2014. However, it is not important in terms of the overall conclusions of this paper.

        We also have access to a dataset consisting of non-borrowers. This is essentially the

residual dataset of anyone who is in the HMRC tax records but not in the SLC database. We

observe nothing about these individuals except their age, gender and earnings. Due to the large

sample size, we keep only two individuals from this non-borrower data set for every individual

in the borrower data, which equates to around half of the total non-borrower sample. It

includes people living and working in the UK who:

       Did not go to university;

       Went to university outside of the UK;

       Studied in the UK but did not borrow (either by choice or because they were ineligible).

       Were domiciled in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, went to university in the UK

        and borrowed from the non-English part of the SLC;
         None of these groups will be problematic for our analysis – which effectively uses this

     “residual” dataset as a control group – except for this final group. It is not possible to

     separate them out, but it is possible to quantify them. Indeed, we estimate that they

     account for around 10% of this residual dataset.16

         We observe the earnings of individuals in each of the tax years between 2001/02 and

     2013/14. From Table 1, this means that we observe four different earnings thresholds. We

     will investigate bunch at each of these thresholds following methodology described in the

     following section.

         Table 2 shows the number of individuals in our sample by cohort, which is defined by

     the year they entered the course that we observe them on. There are roughly 25,000

     people in each of the later cohorts, and slightly fewer in the earlier cohorts. In 1998, which

     was the first year of the income contingent loan, there are only around 15,000 individuals,

  This draws on author’s calculations based on Table A2 from Britton, Shephard and Vignoles (2018) and
https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-on-higher-education-initial-participation-rates
    due to slow take-up of the loans. Individuals are only included in the dataset if they have

    “entered repayment” by the 2011/12, which means they need to have left university (but

    not actually started earning above the threshold). The sample sizes are relatively small

    because we have a 10% random sample of the overall cohort of borrowers. Table 2 also

    shows the average amount of debt individuals held upon graduation. This is initially around

    £8,000, increasing to around £15,000 for the 2006 cohort onwards, reflecting the increase

    in availability of credit the aligned with the 2006 increase in tuition fees.

         Table 3 shows the share of borrowers that we observe with positive official earnings, by

    cohort and tax year. We see that for each cohort, the share of individuals with positive

    recorded earnings in the tax data increases with age, up to a maximum of just under 90%.

    Britton, Shephard, and Vignoles (2018) show that the share of borrowers in that are not in

    work in this dataset aligns closely with the share of graduates who are not in work in the UK
   Labour Force Survey. For the younger cohorts, we see that there is a small fraction of

   people with positive earnings before attending university, highlighting that the sample

   includes some mature students. The share of individuals with positive earnings during study

   is also quite large at around 40% for the middle cohorts. This is likely to be primarily people

   who are working during study. This share is higher in the later cohorts (51.8% of the 2007

   cohort in 2007/08; 75.1% of the 2008 cohort in 2008/09), and is likely driven in part by the

   condition that we only observe people who have entered repayment by 2011/12, although

   it could also reflect a rise in working during studying.



                                    Part IV: Empirical Strategy

       Our goal is to assess whether the implicit tax imposed by the income-contingent

repayment distorts subsequent earnings of college graduates who receive the loans.

Accomplishing this goal is complicated by the fact that the receipt of the loan directly impacts

earnings. Those who attend college will have loans while those who don’t attend won’t have

loans, and clearly the earnings of the former group will be higher.

       We therefore consider two complementary empirical strategies in an effort to causally

disentangle the impact of this implicit tax on earnings. The first is to exploit the kink in the

repayment schedule, which is £10,000 at the start of our sample (2001/02-2004/05), transitions

to £15,000 in 2005/06, before increasing to £15,795 in 2012/13 and £16,365 in 2013/14, the

final year of our dataset. We follow Saez (2010) and Chetty, Friedman, and Saez (2013) in using

bunching around kinks in tax schedules to identify the impact of taxes on labor supply.
Intuitively, this approach uses the deviation from a monotonic evolution of tax payers around

the tax kink to identify the magnitude of response to that kink.

         More specifically, (Saez 2010) shows that the elasticity of taxable income (ETI) is given

by:

                                                            𝐵(Δ𝑧)
                                            𝜖(𝑧) =
                                                              Δ(1 − 𝜏)
                                                     𝑘. ℎ0 (𝑧) 1 − 𝜏
                                                                     𝑜

       Δ(1−𝜏)
Here            is the change in the net of tax rate, 𝑘 is the kink point and ℎ0 (𝑧) is the
       1−𝜏𝑜


counterfactual density. Finally, 𝐵 is the excess mass driven by the bunching and is given by:

                                 𝑧 ∗ +𝛿                𝑧 ∗ −𝛿                𝑧 ∗ +2𝛿
                         𝐵= ∫             ℎ(𝑧)𝑑𝑧 − ∫            ℎ(𝑧)𝑑𝑧 − ∫             ℎ(𝑧)𝑑𝑧
                                𝑧 ∗ −𝛿                𝑧 ∗ −2𝛿            𝑧 ∗ +𝛿


We follow Chetty, Friedman, and Saez (2013) and estimate ℎ0 (𝑧) by fitting a flexible polynomial

to the observed distribution of taxable income, excluding the area around the kink point.

         This approach has the advantage that it is a fairly transparent way to assess whether tax

kinks distort behavior, and it relies only on the assumption of a monotonic distribution of

taxpayers around the kink. But it has the disadvantage that it ignores other reasons why

individuals may bunch at that kink (especially when kinks are round numbers like £10,000 or

£15,000). In the analysis we attempt to address this point through a series of placebo tests.

         In particular, as noted above, we have a control sample to accompany the loan holder

sample where we expect to see a labor supply response: those who did not take a loan. This

group is taken from our residual tax dataset and therefore includes people who went to college

but did not borrow, but the majority is made up of people who did not go to college (we are

unable to distinguish between the two groups). This sample will capture any time series reasons
why there is bunching at these thresholds – but only if those reasons operate both for college-

bound and non-college bound students.

       Given the imperfect nature of these controls to capturing other reasons for a spike in

earnings at these round numbers, we consider a complementary “difference-in-difference-in-

difference” (DDD) identification strategy based on the change in the threshold from £10,000 to

£15,000 in 2005/06. Before this change, individuals made loan repayments on their earnings

above £10,000, leading individuals to reduce their earnings to below £10,000 and to reduce

their effort above that level. But after this change, individuals earning £10,000 to £15,000 have

no more loan-based incentive to lower their earnings. As a result, if there is a distortionary

effect of the implicit tax on labor supply, then when the threshold is increased it should lead to

more earnings from (somewhat below) £10,000 to £15,000.

       Of course, a problem with this approach is that other things may have changed in

2005/06 that impact the earnings distribution of recent college graduates, such as changes to

demand for skilled labor. To address this point, we use the control sample of individuals who

did not receive student loans. This is not a perfect control, as it is possible that time series

shocks could differ between college grads and non-grads. Moreover, this approach provides an

estimate of the short run response to a change in the policy, rather than steady-state labor

supply distortions estimated by kinks. But the results from this DDD analysis can provide an

important confirmation (or refutation) of the kink-based approach.

Graphical Evidence on Bunching

         We begin with a graphical description of bunching at the implicit tax thresholds put in

place by the repayment system. In Figure 2, we show the distribution of taxpayers in years

when the £10,000 threshold was in place (2001/02-2004/05). Figure 3 does the same for the

years when the £15,000 threshold was in place (2005/06-2011/12). In every case in our

results, we refer to years by the initial year of the school year – e.g. the 2002-2003 school year

is referred to as 2002.

         These figures show some evidence of bunching, with a notable spike at the £10,000 and

£15,000 notches. But this spike does not appear to be very large relative to the underlying

variation in the data. These results do not immediately suggest an important effect of the

thresholds on earnings.

         Moreover, we see comparable spikes in the control sample of individuals without

student loans, graphed in Figures 4 and 5. This sample does not have the income-contingent

loan repayment incentive to bunch earnings. Yet these figures are largely indistinguishable

from our main sample results, with a small spike at £10,000 and £15,000 in the relevant years.

         Finally, Figures 6 and 7 show the results for the 2013 and 2014 years, when the spikes

were not at round numbers. In both cases, we see no evidence of a spike – further confirming

that the appearance of spikes in earlier years may be due to the round numbers used for those
thresholds. Of course, it is also possible that the weaker responses in these later years reflects

delays in adjusting labor supply responses; we address this point below.

          Table 4 presents our basic estimates of the elasticity of taxable income (ETI). The first

column shows the results for our base sample. In the first row, we pool all years of data, testing

for bunching at the relevant threshold in that year. We also show the results separately for

each threshold, and show results combined for the 10k and 15k thresholds.

          The results across all rows in Column 1 deliver a clear message: there is little impact of

the threshold on earnings. For the 15k, 15.8k and 16.4k thresholds, the estimates are small and

insignificantly different to zero. For the 10k threshold years we estimate a highly significant

elasticity of 0.036. However, this is very small compared to the literature: for example Adam et

al. (2017) estimate elasticities of around ten times this figure for higher rate taxpayers in the

UK, while the wider literature suggests central estimates of around 0.25 (see Saez, Slemrod,

and Giertz, 2012, for a review).
       The second column of the table shows the results for the control sample of individuals

who do not have student loans. We find no meaningful effect in any year for this control

sample.

       Finally, in the last column, we present a placebo test for each of the individual

thresholds. This is done in years where the threshold does not apply. For example, for the £15k

threshold we look at bunching at the £15k threshold in the tax years 2001/02-2004/05 (when

the threshold was £10k) and 2012/13-2013/14 (when the threshold was above £15k)

combined. In all four of the placebo tests we get very small estimates, which are robust the

specific subset of years used.

Adjustment Problems?

       There are a number of possible explanations for our small results. One is that workers

are slow to adjust their earnings to respond to these threshold incentives. We can test this

directly by examining how the response to the new 15k threshold varied over time.

       Figure 4 shows the results year by year for the 15k threshold. If the cause of our small

response were adjustment problems, we would expect the spike at 15k to grow over time. But

this is clearly not the case; the spike grows, then shrinks, then grows again, but in all case

remains small relative to the underlying noise in the data. Our results do not appear to result

from slow adjustment.

Self-Employed vs. Employees

         Previous work on responses to tax incentives have emphasized the role of the self-

employed (for example, Adam et al. 2017), who have more scope to adjust their earnings in

response to such incentives. We can explore this in our data as well by investigating bunching

at the student loan thresholds amongst those who file Self Assessed (SA) tax forms. For

individuals who submit SA forms, the vast majority of individuals are self-employed, for whom

it is a legal requirement to submit a SA form. When looking at these individuals, we include all

income from the SA form to capture other sources of income self-employed individuals may
have. This is appropriate, as student loan obligations are based on income rather than earnings

(the two are equivalent for PAYE filers).

       Table 5 shows results breaking down our estimates to look at self-employed individuals,

distinct from employees. Given sample size restrictions, we are only able to do this for the

£15k threshold due to small sample sizes. For the £15.7k and £16.3k thresholds we only have

one year of data, which turns out to be insufficient. For the £10k threshold, although we have

more years, there is still not enough data as there are fewer cohorts from our data in the labor

market, and those in the labor market are younger, at which point the likelihood of filing an SA

tax form is much lower (see, for example, Britton, Shephard and Vignoles, 2018).

       The first column of Table 5 replicates the basic results from Table 4. The second column

shows those same results for the PAYE (employed) sample, which excludes everybody who has

a SA form, and in the final column we show results for the SA (self-employed) sample. The latter

does include individuals who do not report any self-employed income but are filing a SA for

other reasons (e.g. due to accruing profits from a partnership). It is not clear whether it is best

to include or exclude this group, although in practice the results are unaffected by this choice.

       Not surprisingly, the results for the PAYE sample mimic the overall findings. But what is

striking is the lack of response among the self-employed sample – even for this group that has

been found to be responsive to tax incentives, we see little impact on their earnings. The

effects are larger than for PAYE, and close to significant. But even the upper bound of the

confidence interval is consistent with a quite small elasticity for this population. Thus, no

matter how we examine the data, we see no evidence of bunching in response to the

thresholds used for student loan payments.

Difference-in-Difference-in-Difference Strategy

         One reason for the modest response estimated thus far is that individuals may be

unable to exactly tie their earnings to the tax thresholds, even if they are self-employed.

Therefore, we pursue a second approach, which looks at whether the change in the threshold

from £10k to £15k affected income growth for people with income near to the threshold before

the change.

         We look at income growth from before 2005/06 to after 2005/06, the year when the

threshold was first increased from £10k to £15k. We define the following three groups:

                  Group 1: Pre-treatment earnings in £5k-£10k range

                  Group 2: Pre-treatment earnings in £10k-£15k range

                  Group 3: Pre-treatment earnings in £15k-£20k range

If the student loan program distorts income, theory suggests that we might expect the

threshold increase to affect income growth differentially for the three groups: those just below

the £10k threshold before the policy change (Group 1) experience no income effect as a result

of the policy, but do experience a substitution effect, suggesting they might increase their

income by more as a result of the reform, as less of their income growth is spent on loan

repayments.
       On the other hand, those just above the new £15k threshold (Group 3) experience no

substitution effect, as their marginal income is taxed at a rate of 9% as before, but they do

experience an income effect, gaining 9% of £5k (£450). This pure income effect might induce

those in the £15k-£20k range to increase their earnings by less as a result of the reform. For

those in the £10k-£15k range (Group 2), the effect is ambiguous as they experience a mix of

income and substitution effects.

       We investigate these theoretical predictions using a triple differences (DDD) framework.

For our “treated” group, we use the earnings growth of borrowers from before the threshold

change to after it (i.e. between 2004/05 and 2005/06). For our control group, we use earnings

between 2003/04 and 2004/05, which should be unaffected by the reform. For this we use a

different (older) cohort so we are observing the treatment and control groups at the same

point in their careers. For example, if our treated group is the 1999 cohort, we would look at

their earnings growth between 2004/05 and 2005/06, which correspond (in the majority of

cases) to three and four years after graduation. Our control group in this case would be the

1998 cohort, looking at their earnings growth between 2003/04 and 2004/05, also three and

four years after graduation.

       However, this does not account for wider macroeconomic changes that might affect

earnings growth at the same point in the career of two different cohorts differently. To deal

with this, we use our non-graduate sample as an additional control group. Specifically, we

subtract the difference in earnings growth for the 1999 and 1998 cohorts of non-borrowers

(where “cohort” imputed based on age). Since neither of these cohorts is affected by the

reform, removing this difference should net out the wider macro shocks.
        We also follow a matching technique suggested in Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller

(2010) and implemented more recently in Gruber, Jensen, and Kleven (2017). We take

everybody in our treated sample (in this case, the 1999 cohort) and match them to their

“nearest neighbor” in the control sample.17 Specifically, for each individual, 𝑖, we select

individual 𝑗 to satisfy:

                                                     3

                                              min{∑ |𝑥𝑖𝑡 − 𝑥𝑗𝑡 |}
                                               𝑗
                                                    𝑡=1


        We put equal weight on each of the pre-reform earnings. We do this with replacement,

although the findings are robust to this decision. We use this “synthetic” group as our control

for both the borrowers and non-borrower samples in the DDD regressions.

        The graphical representation of our DDD approach using the synthetic control group is

given in Figure 9 for Groups 1, 2 and 3 as defined above. In each case, the solid colored line is

average earnings for the treated borrower sample, while the colored dashed line is average

earnings for the untreated borrower sample. The gray lines are the equivalent cohorts to the

treated and untreated cohorts in the non-borrower sample. We see that in both the borrower

and the non-borrower samples, the pre-treatment trends are almost perfectly on top of each

other, suggesting our matching approach works very well. A simple version of the DDD

estimation would take the difference between the colored solid and dashed curved and

subtract the difference between the gray solid and dashed curves (for group 1, this would result




17
  We find in practice that the pre-treatment trends for the treatment and control groups are not perfectly parallel
(see Figure A1 in the Appendix).
in a very small positive effect of the reform, with the non-borrower group making very little

difference).

       However, Table 6 shows the results from the DDD within the proper framework, baed

on the following regression model:

               𝑦𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑡 + 𝛽2 (𝑡 ∗ 𝐵𝑖 ) + 𝛽3 𝑇𝑖 + 𝛽4 (𝑇𝑖 ∗ 𝐵𝑖 ) + 𝛽5 𝐵𝑖 + 𝛽6 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 +

                       𝛽7 (𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 ∗ 𝐵𝑖 ) + 𝛽8 (𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 ∗ 𝑇𝑖 ) + 𝛽9 (𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 ∗ 𝑇𝑖 ∗ 𝐵𝑖 ) + 𝜖𝑖𝑡        (1)


Here 𝑦𝑖𝑡 is income for individual 𝑖 at time 𝑡, 𝑡 is a linear time trend, 𝑇 is a dummy indicating that

the individual is in the treated cohort, 𝐵 is a dummy for being in the borrower sample and Post

is a post reform dummy (in Figure 9, this is in the fourth year). So in this framework we control

for differences across treatment vs. control cohorts (𝛽3), borrowers vs. non-borrower (𝛽5), post

vs. pre-reform (𝛽6).

                              borrowers and non-borrowers
Notes: Figure shows average earnings before and after the increase in the repayment threshold from £10k to £15k in 2005/06.
The treatment group is the 1999 cohort, for whom t=4 is 2005/06, the first post-treatment year. The untreated group is the
synthetic 1998 cohort, for whom t=4 is 2004/05, when the threshold is still £10k. The “treated” and “non-treated” non-
borrowers are not affected by the reform, but the cohorts are equivalent to the borrower cohorts. Group 1 is those with
earnings in the £5k-£10k range in the pre-reform years, Group 2 is £10-£15k and Group 3 is £15k-£20k. Figures condition on
having non-zero earnings.
         We also control for “second-level” differences between borrowers in treatment cohorts

vs. borrowers in non-treatment cohorts (𝛽4 ), borrowers post-reform vs. pre-reform, (𝛽7), and

treatment cohorts post-reform vs. pre-reform (𝛽8). The coefficient of interest therefore is (𝛽9)

which is the estimated effect of the reform on the earnings growth of the treatment group,

relative to the control group, among borrowers, relative to non-borrowers, from before to after

the reform.

regression.

         Table 6 shows our estimated effect of the reform on earnings growth for each of the

three groups. Within each column the estimates are from separate regressions, with the

corresponding sample sizes given below. Column 1 shows the estimated effects from the DDD

model based on the data plotted in Figure 9, where the treatment group is the 1999 cohort and
the control group is the synthetic control group constructed from the 1998 cohort. For this

regression, there are three pre-reform years. The estimates show insignificant effects for all

three groups.

       Column 2 and 3 of Table 6 then use different samples to try to answer the same

question. Column 2 looks at growth of the 2000 cohort between two and three years after

graduation, using the 1999 cohort as a control, while column 3 uses the 2001 cohort between

one and two years after graduation with the 2000 cohort as a control. Consequently the

number of pre-reform years reduces in each case. In all cases we observe insignificant results -

in some cases with the opposite sign - suggesting that earnings growth was not affected by the

reform to the repayment threshold.

       This finding is consistent with the results from our bunching estimation, which suggests

that the ETI of graduates is effectively zero.

                                        Part VI: Conclusions

       A college degree is increasing a pre-requisite for success in the modern knowledge-

based economy. Indeed, having a more highly educated population in a location increases the

returns even for those without a college education (Moretti 2004). At the same time, inflation

in college tuitions has exceeded general price inflation in many nations. In the U.S., for

example, the overall CPI since 1983 has risen by less than 250% - while average tuition and fees

have risen by 800%. The result is a large and growing burden of student debt that has been

deemed unaffordable for many. A direct approach to address affordability is to more tightly

link college debt repayments to income, as is true for a minority of U.S. loan recipients – but

almost all college attendees in the U.K.
       One concern with such an approach is that income-related debt repayments put in place

an implicit tax – potentially in a range of incomes where the phase out of other social insurance

programs already. In that case, there may be a distortion to labor supply decisions that may

offset the welfare gains from insuring college graduates against income risk.

       We assess whether such labor supply distortions are quantitatively important by

studying the income contingent loan repayment program for college graduates in the U.K.

Thresholds for repayment at £10k, later £15k, suggest that if this program is distorting earnings,

there should be bunching at those thresholds. In fact, the bunching that we see at these

thresholds is very modest – and is present in a control sample that should not respond to these

incentives. To further confirm our results, we turn to an alternative strategy, examining

whether the density of the income distribution in the range between 10k and 15k increases

when the threshold is moved upwards – and we find it is not. We therefore conclude that

there are not quantitatively important labor supply distortions from this policy.

       The income contingent loan program effectively converts college loans into a social

insurance policy. As with any such policy, there may be other margins of distortion. In

particular, such a policy may induce excess college attendance among those who know that

such education will have little return – but who will have low earnings later on and so therefore

won’t have to pay back. At the same time, there is reason to believe that individuals are sub-

optimally deciding to pass on college (Oreopoulos 2009).

       Another important question is how this financing mechanism impacts behavior once at

college. Recent studies show that loan financing, relative to grants, can lead students to change
to more renumerative majors.18 Would this impact be lessened if the loan repayment were tied

to income? Future work could usefully explore these questions
