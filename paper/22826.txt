                                           ABSTRACT

Theoretical models of competition with fixed prices suggest that hospitals should compete by
increasing quality of care for diseases with the greatest profitability and demand elasticity. Most
empirical evidence regarding hospital competition is limited to heart attacks, which in the U.S.
generate positive profit margins but exhibit very low demand elasticity – ambulances usually take
patients to the closest (or affiliated) hospital. In this paper, we derive a theoretically appropriate
measure of market concentration in a fixed-price model, and use differential travel-time to
hospitals in each of the 306 U.S. regional hospital markets to instrument for market
concentration. We then estimate the model using risk-adjusted Medicare data for several different
population cohorts: heart attacks (low demand elasticity), hip and knee replacements (high
demand elasticity) and dementia patients (low demand elasticity, low or negative profitability).
First, we find little correlation within hospitals across quality measures. And second, while we
replicate the standard result that greater competition leads to higher quality in some (but not all)
measures of heart attack quality, we find essentially no association between competition and
quality for what should be the most competitive markets – elective hip and knee replacements.
Consistent with the model, competition is associated with lower quality care among dementia
patients, suggesting that competition could induce hospitals to discourage unprofitable patients.

I. Introduction

         The question of how competition affects quality of health care is a topic that has received

considerable attention in recent years. Theoretical models imply that when price exceeds

marginal cost in a fixed-price regime, hospitals respond by competing for more patients by

improving quality (Gaynor and Town, 2012; Gaynor, Ho, and Town, 2015). In general, the

empirical evidence is mixed on the association between competition and quality, with evidence

of positive, negative, and zero associations. 1

         Most studies of competition have used acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or heart

attacks, as the representative patient population in measuring hospital quality, but heart attack

patients typically exhibit a very low elasticity of demand for hospital treatment – ambulance

drivers are usually instructed to bring heart attack patients to the nearest emergency room, or to

their affiliated hospital (Doyle et al., 2015), since damage to the heart muscle worsens for every

minute untreated. Therefore, we would not expect improved quality of AMI care to increase

demand by much for a given hospital. While quality for one treatment could provide a proxy for

quality for other conditions – hospitals with better treatments for AMI may have better hip

replacement outcomes – this assumption has been questioned by others (e.g., Skellern, 2015;

Bevan and Skellern, 2011). One English study, for example, found little correlation among

treatment quality for AMI, stroke, and hip fracture patients (Gravelle et al., 2014).

         In this paper, we reconsider the association between competition and outcomes using the

entire population of fee-for-service patients in the U.S. Medicare claims data for the years 2010-

2011. We first derive a theoretically consistent estimating equation for the relevant case in

which hospitals are competing on the basis of quality in a fixed-price regime, such as the U.S.

Medicare program. We find the key summary competition measure in this model is the LOCI

(the Logit Competition Index), originally developed by Antwi, Gaynor, and Vogt (2013) in a

different context for hospitals that compete on prices. We argue that this LOCI approach

provides a better characterization of competition compared to the conventional Herfindahl–

Hirschman Index (HHI), because it captures the influence of hospital size on competition – that a

smaller hospital has proportionately more untapped patients in its spatial market than does a

larger or dominant hospital. To adjust for potential endogeneity, we instrument both the LOCI,

and hospital volume – a key component of quality -- using the Kessler and McClellan (2000)

differential distance approach in a multinomial logit choice model for each of 306 U.S. hospital

market areas.

       We test the standard model by considering a wider range of diseases with either greater

demand elasticity or with lower profit (or contribution) margins (Eappen et al., 2013). We

hypothesize that elective high-margin treatments planned weeks in advance and often sought by

otherwise healthy people, such as reproductive technologies (as in Bundorf et al., 2009), or in

our case, hip and knee replacements (as in Moscelli et al., 2016), would exhibit much greater

underlying demand elasticity for quality of care, and hence lead to a much sharper quality

gradient in competitive markets. Concerns with patient selection issues are addressed by

comprehensive risk adjusters, and by the clinical reality that hospitals should not perform

elective joint replacements for any patient with a high risk of complications.

       We also hypothesize that the association between quality and competition would be

different for diseases with lower or even negative profitability, such as advanced dementia



                                                 2
requiring extensive nursing and physician inputs. In this case, the theoretical model implies

poorer quality care for treatments with negative margins in competitive markets, as hospitals

have greater incentives to avoid such patients. 2

        Briefly, we find that the association between competition and quality for AMI patients is

weakly consistent with the model; more competition is predictive of greater use of appropriate

medications (beta blockers and statins) after discharge and, in the least-squares regression, lower

30-day risk-adjusted mortality. As well, risk- and price-adjusted spending is slightly higher in

more concentrated markets. However, we find that the association between quality of hip and

knee replacements and concentration is minimal. This is inconsistent with the theoretical model

of competition, which would predict the strongest association between competition and quality

for these procedures.

        As in Gravelle et al. (2014) and Skellern (2015), we do not find that AMI quality is a

good summary “marker” for hospital quality; the correlation coefficient between risk-adjusted

AMI mortality and risk-adjusted hip or knee complications is essentially zero. This by itself is

not inconsistent with the economic model, since hospitals should compete on quality very

differently across clinical departments depending on demand elasticities and profit margins, but

it does highlight the limitations of using AMI as a paradigm for hospital competition and quality.

        We also consider the likelihood of poor quality in the treatment of dementia patients.

Our measure of poor quality is the placement of a feeding tube in the terminal phase of dementia

when patients have lost their ability to eat. Feeding tubes for patients with advanced dementia

are viewed as a burdensome procedure for the patient, leading to complications and lower quality

of life, and thus a marker for poor-quality care (American Geriatrics Society, 2013). For

 Although Brekke et al. (2011) discusses the important philanthropic motives of hospital administration and staff
that would work against such behavior.

hospitals in the most concentrated markets, poor quality is more pervasive among dementia

patients. This result is consistent with the theoretical model in which hospitals pay little attention

to quality for treatments with low or even negative margins (e.g., Gaynor and Town, 2012).

        In sum, our evidence provides little support for the view that competition per se raises

quality of care. The weak links in this causal pathway – from measured market concentration to

clinical quality -- may arise at a variety of points. For example, Bynum et al. (2014) suggests

that standard models of competition may not be suited to the more complex world of physician

referrals, where primary care physicians play a dominant role in referring patients to a specific

hospital (Barnett et al, 2012). Nor do physicians and patients always have a good idea of which

hospitals provide high quality (Schneider and Lieberman, 2001; Goldman and Romley, 2008;

Whaley et al., 2014; Desai et al., 2016, although see Chandra et al., 2016, and Santos et al.,

2016). Finally, the findings based on European data that often support a positive association

between competition and quality (e.g., Gaynor et al., 2013, Gobillon and Milcent, 2016) could

arise because single-payer systems there provides more incentives to compete on quality in a

fixed price setting, while Medicare is just one of many insurance providers in the U.S.

II. The Model

        We begin with the standard model of competition as derived in Gaynor and Town (2012)

augmented to include the assumption of fixed prices, as in the Medicare program. We assume

the cost function of hospital j for a specific procedure or treatment, Cj(xj,zj) is increasing with

respect to both the quantity of services provided, xj (i.e., the number of procedures or

admissions), and the average level of quality zj provided for patients at that hospital, given the

fixed price for Medicare services, 𝑝̅. Note that xj = D(zj,z-j) so that demand at hospital j depends

on quality at hospital j relative to quality at all other hospitals in the market except j, z-j. This



                                                    4
demand function could include both competition among hospitals for a given group of patients,

as well as reflecting overall demand for the procedure. 3 However, in our estimation below, we

assume a fixed number of total hospital admissions in each ZIP code.

         Assuming profit maximization on the part of the provider, where quantity is a function of

own-hospital quality 𝑧𝑗 and other hospital quality 𝑧−𝑗 , cost is a function of own-hospital quality

and volume 𝑥𝑗 , where prices are fixed (𝑝̅):

               (1)             𝜋𝑡𝑗 = 𝑝̅ 𝐷�𝑧𝑗 , 𝑧−𝑗 � − 𝐶(𝑧𝑗 , 𝑥𝑗 )

If providers choose their level of quality to maximize profit and there are zero profits in

equilibrium (for derivation see the Appendix),

                                          𝑑𝑥𝑗
                (2)       [ 𝑝̅ − 𝑀𝐶𝑥𝑗 ]       = 𝑀𝐶𝑧𝑗
                                          𝑑𝑧𝑗

The left-hand side of (2) is the incremental profitability from an additional admission to the

hospital, times the number of new admissions (x) that would occur if the hospital improved

quality (z) by one unit. The right-hand side of (2) is simply the marginal cost of increasing

quality by one unit; thus hospitals in this simplified world increase quality to the point where the

marginal net revenue is equal to the marginal cost. Note that when the contribution margin, or

price minus the marginal cost of an extra patient, is small or even negative, hospitals will have a

greater incentive to shed patients when demand responds more readily to changes in quality

(dxj/dzj), as one might expect to observe in more competitive markets. 4 We next turn to a more



3
  For example, people in an area with high-quality academic centers could be more likely to undergo a hip
replacement (rather than put up with the pain) because their chance of a successful complication-free procedure is
greater.
4
  This equation implies that hospitals will discourage patients for as long as marginal cost exceeds price, regardless
of the elasticity of admissions with respect to quality. The marginal costs may also include the high degrees of
stress imposed on nurses and physicians because patients with advanced dementia can be so difficult to treat, thus
requiring additional staffing, greater employee turnover, or higher wages. A more general model of hospital


                                                          5
formal model that characterizes the link between this derivative and the competitive structure of

the market.

        As in previous studies, we assume a multinomial logit model of patient choice. Let total

admissions to all hospitals in ZIP code t = 1,…,T be Nt. In the logistic model, the predicted

number of admissions to hospital j, 𝑥�𝚥 , is a function also of a hospital zip-code fixed effect

(𝑎𝑡𝑗 ) reflecting the convenience and perceived desirability of hospital j for residents of zip-code

t, as well as the clinical quality of the hospital (𝑧𝑗 ):

                                 𝑇
                                            exp�𝛼𝑧𝑗 +𝑎𝑡𝑗 + 𝜖𝑡𝑗 �
              (3)         𝑥�𝚥 = � 𝑁𝑡
                                        ∑𝑇𝑡′ =1 exp�𝛼𝑧𝑗 +𝑎𝑡 ′ 𝑗 + 𝜖𝑡 ′ 𝑗 �
                                𝑡=1

To uncover the elasticity of demand with respect to quality, we can write the derivative of

hospital j’s demand with respect to its own quality under the assumption of a fixed-price model.

As we demonstrate in the Appendix, with fixed prices the summary measure of competition ends

up looking much like the Antwi et al. (2013) derivation of what they call the Logit Competition

Index, or the LOCI:

                             𝑑𝑥�𝚥 /𝑥�𝚥
           (4)                             �𝑗
                                       = 𝛼 𝐿𝑂𝐶𝐼
                              𝑑𝑧𝑗

where

                          �𝚥 = ∑𝑇𝑡=1(𝑥�𝑡𝚥 ) �1 − 𝑥�
                         𝐿𝑂𝐶𝐼                     𝑡𝚥 /𝑁𝑡 �.
                                      �     𝑥𝚥


Thus the proportional responsiveness of admissions to improving quality depends both on the

elasticity of demand with respect to quality, summarized by α, and the LOCI or our measure of




behavior that includes eleemosynary motives towards patients, however, would attenuate these purely profit-
driven incentives to minimize quality (e.g., Gaynor and Town, 2012).


                                                       6
competition that holds even when prices are fixed. 5 In practice, we calculate the LOCI that is

defined on actual admissions 𝑥𝑗𝑡 , written as LOCIj (without a caret). In this case, we’d replace

actual admissions to hospital j in ZIP t, 𝑥𝑡𝑗 , for 𝑥�𝑡𝑗 , and ntj, the share of hospital j’s admissions

coming from ZIP code t, for the first term in parentheses. Note that for perfect competition, the

LOCI converges to 1, and for a monopoly, it is 0.

           For the intuition behind the LOCI, it is useful to compare it with the commonly used

Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). Recall that in our setting using actual rather than estimated

values, the HHI would be

                             (5)               𝐻𝐻𝐼𝑗 = ∑𝑇𝑡=1 𝑛𝑡𝑗 �∑𝐽𝑘=1 𝑥𝑘𝑡
                                                                        2
                                                                           /𝑁𝑡2 �

The HHI is normalized to 1 for a monopoly, and approaching zero for a perfectly competitive

market, the opposite of the LOCI. 6 Note that the LOCI captures the fraction of patients in a

given hospital’s market that are not being admitted to the hospital, or the market share that the

hospital has to gain. Consider for example a scenario in which a small hospital competes with the

larger hospital across the street, and that each hospital drew the same proportional number of

patients from each zip code (ntj). The HHIs for each hospital would therefore be identical, since

the weights would match up, and the zip code HHI is the same regardless of which hospital is

being considered. By contrast, the LOCI would suggest that the smaller hospital is more

competitive, in the sense that it is easier for it to increase proportional capacity when its initial

share is so modest. Because it is easier for the small hospital to increase its share, the LOCI

theoretically better reflects its incentive to improve quality.


5
    While in theory, α varies across regions, for simplicity we adopt a single elasticity.
6
 For comparability with the LOCI, we report the HHI as ranging from 0 to 1, rather than from 0 to 10,000 as is
often done.


                                                              7
        Using equation (2) above, we can write the first-order condition for hospitals competing

on quality as:

                                                 𝑀𝐶𝑧𝑗
                 (6)           𝑝̅ − 𝑀𝐶𝑥𝑗 =               .
                                               𝑥�𝑗 𝐿𝑂𝐶𝐼𝑗

To estimate the association between quality and competition (as proxied by LOCIj), we consider

a Taylor-series approximation of the marginal cost of increasing quality per patient admission:

                  (7)         𝑀𝐶𝑧𝑗 ⁄𝑥�𝑗 ≅ 𝜇𝑗 + 𝑎𝑧𝑗 + 𝑏𝑥𝑗

This approximation captures both a rising marginal cost of improving quality (a > 0) as well as

the degree of proportionality with respect to output. For example, if the hospital provides better

quality by hiring more experienced and skilled nursing staff, the marginal cost of that increment

will be roughly proportional to the number of admissions (or bed-days); thus b ~ 0. If instead

quality was more easily attained with greater volume, for example in surgical quality

(Birkmeyer, et al., 2002, 2003; Ho, 2002; Gaynor et al., 2005), then it could be that b < 0. It’s

also possible that b > 0; the marginal cost of improving quality for dementia patients (for

example) may be higher in bigger hospitals because of challenges in coordinating care across a

much larger number of employees and post-hospital settings.

        By rearranging, we can write

                                 �𝑝
                                  �−   𝑀𝐶𝑥𝑗�𝐿𝑂𝐶𝐼𝑗−𝑏𝑥𝑗−𝜇𝑗
              (8)         𝑧𝑗 =               𝑎

Thus quality is dependent on three basic characteristics. First, it is predicted to be higher the

greater is the marginal profitability, 𝑝̅ − 𝑀𝐶𝑥𝑗 , as noted above. 7 Second, when the marginal

profitability is positive, the nearer is the LOCI to perfect competition, the higher is predicted

7
  Of course, MCxj is itself endogenous, but we assume that changes in zj have second-order effects on 𝑝̅ − 𝑀𝐶𝑥𝑗
(and more importantly, that changes in quality do not cause its sign to flip).



                                                        8
quality of care. Competition also influences hospital behavior by giving a stronger incentive to

hospitals with small market share (and thus a larger LOCI) to capture more business from other

hospitals in the market. But smaller hospitals may also experience diseconomies in providing

high-quality care, for example when b < 0, as noted above (or if the coefficient a is higher for

smaller hospitals). Finally, Equation (8) implies that volume (x) should be included on the right-

hand side of the equation in determining quality. The challenge for estimation is that instruments

are required for both volume and for the LOCI (Gaynor, 2006; Gowrisankarajn, Ho and Town,

2008); we address this in Section IV below.

        Clinical considerations. As noted above, the standard economic model posits that

hospitals will compete more vigorously by improving quality in more competitive markets and

when the profit margins are greater. We consider next three distinct types of treatments that we

know, from prior clinical research, differ substantially along these two dimensions.

        First we consider acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which is the most common clinical

condition considered in previous studies, beginning with Kessler and McClellan (2000). The

onset of an AMI is sudden and patients and ambulances are instructed to go to the nearest

hospital (or to their affiliated hospital, as in Doyle et al., 2015), because treatment is best if

delivered within 90 minutes of symptom onset and requires on-site capabilities that are not

present at all hospitals. While previous studies have argued that studying AMI allows researchers

to worry less about selection bias (that is, healthier patients may seek out one hospital over

another), and that AMI quality signals for other types of hospital quality – a conjecture we test

below -- the poor opportunity for choice makes the clinical case of AMI less than ideal for

studying the relationship between competition and quality.




                                                   9
       That said, there are considerable financial gains, as well as potential reputational gains,

that can be derived by delivering advanced cardiac care, and these may make hospitals continue

to compete in this clinical domain. For example, Robinson (2011) estimated that the average cost

of cardiac valve replacement was $38,667, but the contribution margin (price minus average

variable cost) was $21,967. And Chandra et al. (2016) found evidence showing that hospitals

with above-average AMI performance tended to grow in AMI admissions at the expense of their

lower-quality rivals.

       As an ancillary hypothesis, we consider the association between market concentration

and price- and risk-adjusted Medicare reimbursements during the year post-admission. Because

we adjust for differences across regions in prices paid by Medicare (largely to capture cost-of-

living differences), this measure is best interpreted as an index of utilization. While the theory

does not predict whether utilization will rise or fall in response to improving quality –

readmission rates might fall in response to better quality, thus reducing one-year utilization – we

hypothesize that market concentration should be associated with greater utilization because of

substitution effects: To the extent that competition leads to lower prices in the under-65 privately

insured markets, this creates a greater incentive to do more for Medicare patients (Glied, 2014).

       By contrast, hip and knee joint replacements are elective and planned well in advance

which gives the patient opportunity to make informed decisions about where to have the surgery.

This clinical situation would seem to fit most closely with any predictions based on the standard

model of hospital competition. Furthermore, the profit margins are quite high; one analysis

showed average prices to be above even average total cost (and not just marginal cost); see Healy

et al. (2011). Yet, even for procedures with demonstrated variations in hospital quality, other




                                                 10
amenities such as travel time, as in Ho and Pakes’s (2014) study of mothers’ choices for the

choice of obstetric services, could well offset characteristics of the hospital.

       One potential shortcoming with hip and knee replacements is the problem of risk-

selection; perhaps those seeking a knee replacement at a hospital in a wealthy section of town

will be in better underlying health compared to those in a poorer part of town. We address this

issue by using hierarchical clinical conditions (HCC) risk adjustment, which, despite its biases

(Song et al., 2010), is highly predictive of adverse outcomes.

       Clinical cases that are associated with lower margins (or may even represent a loss if

beds are at full capacity due to the opportunity cost) may create incentives for hospitals to avoid,

rather than compete for, those patients (Anderson et al. 2011). People with advanced dementia at

the end of life are frequently hospitalized, sometimes repeatedly, in the last months of life. Their

hospital stay is not technologically intensive but requires appropriate staffing and can be lengthy,

which can present financial problems for hospitals paid a fixed DRG amount. For example,

Lyketsos, Sheppard & Rabins (2000) estimate average length of stay equal to 10 days for those

with dementia, versus 6 days for those without; also see Bynum et al. (2004). In addition, these

patients may present with symptoms that are difficult to manage (e.g. agitation and confusion),

resulting in non-financial costs, such as stress for staff members. Many advanced dementia

patients come by ambulance from local nursing homes to the hospital, which attenuates the

opportunity for patient or family choice of hospital.

       In sum, we hypothesize that the quality of care for these three conditions should exhibit

very different patterns of association between quality and market structure. Based on clinical

and economic considerations, we would expect a small positive association between quality and




                                                  11
competition for AMI patients, a large and positive association for hip and knee replacement

patients, and a zero or negative association for dementia patients.

III. Data

       We use the entire fee-for-service Medicare data, centered on 2010-11, to create five

cohorts: one cohort of all-cause hospital admissions (to create concentration indices), and 4

disease cohorts of hospitalized patients: AMI, hip replacements, knee replacements, and

dementia patients. The Medicare data files used include MedPAR, Carrier, Outpatient, Hospice,

and Home Health.

       Medicare Payments System Background There are two major healthcare models paid for

by the Medicare program, traditional Medicare and managed care plans operated by commercial

payers (Medicare Advantage plans). Traditional Medicare includes Parts A and B and is

predominately fee-for-service. Under this plan, doctors and hospitals get paid for each service

provided, with little to no oversight on the quantity of services. There are limits on the amounts

hospitals and doctors can charge, however. One example is the prospective payment system for

inpatient care, where hospitals are paid a relatively fixed amount for each diagnostic related

group. In traditional Medicare, Medicare pays a proportion of fees and the beneficiary is

responsible for the remainder, called a coinsurance, which is often paid by a supplemental

private insurance program (called a “Medigap” plan) or under the Medicaid program for low-

income recipients.

       The other major healthcare model is managed care; for Medicare this is referred to as

Medicare Advantage. Managed care organizations supervise the financing of medical care

delivered. Typically, members have limited options for where they can receive their care and

there may be capitation, which means doctors are paid per enrollee, regardless of the amount and



                                                12
type of care provided. Owing to this system, individual services provided are not billed

separately; thus, we do not have claims pertaining to each service, so we limit our attention to the

fee-for-service population only. 8 If individuals with Medicare Advantage exhibit the same

admission patterns as those in the fee-for-service population, then our measures of the LOCI will

not be affected, although our volume estimates will be systematically too low. Biases in the

LOCI will be introduced if those with Medicare Advantage go to systematically different

hospitals. 9

         Hospital admission cohort and competition measures. To measure competition, we

require information about the location of where each patient lives and to which hospital they

were admitted. We created a cohort of all hospital admissions during 2010-2011 in the fee-for-

service Medicare population over age 65, with more than 20 million separate admissions, along

with the zip code of residence and the first hospital admission. (Subsequent transfers are

ignored.) We removed “tourists” living in one hospital region, but admitted to a distant hospital

outside of the region, in this analysis. 10

         To create the concentration measure, we sum across the zip codes from which patients

are admitted to a given hospital (Nt is the number of admissions from zip code t) and calculate

St →j as the share of admissions in zip code t to hospital j. We then calculate a weighted average

across zip codes from which the hospital admits patients, where the weights are the percentage of

8
 Medicare tries to collect encounter data for the managed care population, but has not yet issued such data for
researchers.
9
  In Medicare Advantage, there is also likely less competition by hospitals for patients, but more competition to be
included in insurance-based hospital networks.
10
  One could argue that disease-specific measures of competition are more appropriate. However, Skellern (2015)
found that the disease-specific concentration measures in England were highly correlated with the overall
concentration measure.



                                                         13
the hospital’s all-cause admissions from each zip code. As noted above, the LOCI index depends

on the fraction of the zip code market not admitted to hospital j, and therefore represents the

potential market for that hospital.

        We also created a zip code level HHI for each hospital j. The hospital-specific HHI was

created by taking a weighted average of the zip code-level HHI, where the weights were (as

above) the fraction of patients admitted to hospital j who live in zip code t.

        Four disease cohorts. We created cohorts of fee-for-service Medicare patients at least 66

years of age (to allow for one year of observation prior to admission) with eligibility for

Medicare Parts A and B and no HMO coverage in the study window. Patients must be

hospitalized for 1) AMI; 2) total hip replacement, 3) total knee knee replacement; and 4)

dementia (in the six months before death) in 2010-2011. 11

        For AMI patients, we require the primary diagnosis code to be 410.x1 or 410.x2. The

beneficiary is assigned to the admitting hospital, regardless of whether they were later transferred

to another hospital.

        For total knee replacement patients, we require a hospitalization with the procedure code

for total knee replacement 81.54 and any diagnostic codes 715.09, 715.16, 715.26, 715.36,

715.89, 715.96. For total hip replacement, we similarly require a hospitalization with the

procedure code for total hip replacement 81.51 and any diagnostic codes 715.09, 715.15, 715.25,

715.35, 715.89, 715.95. For both the hip and knee replacement cohorts we exclude patients with

cancer, infections, congenital anomalies, fractures and dislocations from injuries and accidents,

or failure of orthopedic devices.


11
  AMI patients are ≥ 66 years of age, hip and knee replacement patients are ≥ 66 years of age to allow for one year
of observation for the HCC scores and HMO coverage. AMI patients are excluded if they have HMO coverage
within one year of the heart attack.


                                                        14
       For dementia patients, we require one claim in Medpar (acute care hospital, critical

access hospital, or skilled nursing facility), Hospice, Home Health, or evaluation and

management claims in the Carrier file for one of the following diagnostic codes during 2010:

331.0, 331.1, 331.11, 331.19, 331.2, 331.7, 331.82, 290.0, 290.1, 290.10, 290.11, 290.12, 290.13,

290.20, 290.21, or 290.3. To qualify for the dementia decedent cohort, the beneficiary must die

in 2011 and be hospitalized in the 6 months prior to death.

       Patient Characteristics. Patient demographics for the three disease cohorts include age

at time of index hospitalization, sex, race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, other), and Rural

Urban Commuting Area Codes (RUCA) category (urban, suburban, large town, rural) from the

Medicare Denominator file. We also calculate the Hierarchical Clinical Conditions (HCC) score

based on claims in the year before hospitalization (hip and knee replacement cohorts) or death

(dementia cohort) and create quintiles of the mean HCC score in the cohort to allow for non-

linearities. From the Census and American Community Survey (2010) we measure the

percentage in poverty and mean income in each patient’s ZIP code.

       Quality outcomes. For AMI patients, we calculate the following outcome measures: 30-

day mortality, proportion of patients receiving a beta blocker, proportion of patients receiving a

statin, and 30-day spending. We calculate the percent of patients discharged after an AMI that

fill a beta-blocker and statin prescription within 6 months (not risk adjusted because all patients

should receive these treatments; Munson and Morden, 2013). Finally, we consider risk and price-

adjusted total spending in the first year post-admission (Gottlieb et al., 2010), which are logged

in the regression specification. To risk adjust mortality and spending, we adjust for age and sex

of the beneficiary (<69, 70-74,75-79,80-84,85-89,90-99), race/ethnicity of the beneficiary

(Black, Native American, Hispanic, Asian, other) along with presence of vascular disease,



                                                 15
pulmonary disease, asthma, dementia, diabetes, liver and renal disorders, cancer, and the location

of the AMI in the heart (ST-elevated MIs, which correspond to anterolateral, anterior wall,

inferolateral, inferior wall, infero-posterolateral, true posterior, non-ST-elevated MIs, or

subendocardial, and not otherwise specified).

       For total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR) cohorts, we measure

risk-adjusted 30-day readmission to any acute care or critical access hospital after discharge for

any reason and any complication (medical or surgical). Surgical complications include

postoperative deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, postoperative hemorrhage,

postoperative surgical site infection, surgical site bleeding, or mechanical complications.

Medical complications include postoperative pulmonary failure, postoperative pneumonia,

postoperative myocardial infarction, postoperative acute renal failure, or postoperative

gastrointestinal hemorrhage. We risk adjust the complication and readmission rates using race,

sex, and HCCs.

       For dementia patients, we measure feeding tube placement in the last 6 months or life and

whether the patient had a burdensome transition in the last three months of life. We risk adjust

using sex, race, and HCCs. Feeding tube placement is identified by procedure codes in Carrier

file claims (43750, 43246, 44372, 44373, 74350, 43832, 43830, 43653, 49440, 49441, or 49446).

       Hospital-Level Variables. To calculate the competition measures, we require that each

hospital have at least 1000 total admissions during the 2 years of analysis (N = 2,638); this rules

out smaller hospitals. In the cohort-specific regressions, we also require each hospital to have at

least 10 admissions per cohort (AMI, hip, knee, and dementia); this restricts the sample further to

1,376 hospitals. We create measures of the fraction female, the fraction of each race/ethnicity,

and the fraction living in poverty at the ZIP code level (weighted as described above).



                                                 16
        Volume (for both the hospital and the surgeon performing the procedure) is well

understood to be important for quality across many surgical procedures (Ho, 2002, Gaynor et al.,

2006; Birkmeyer et al., 2002, 2003). Because competition measures are often closely associated

with volume, as noted above – small hospitals almost by definition have many more potential

patients in a given region than larger hospitals – we independently adjust for surgical volume

using the (Medicare) number of AMI, total hip replacements, total knee replacements, and

dementia patients in our cohort admitted during the study period; these in turn are instrumented

using total predicted volume (described below). From the Provider of Service File and the AHA

file we obtain hospital teaching status (Council of Teaching Hospitals member or not) and

ownership status (not-for-profit, for-profit, government) of the hospital.

IV. Empirical Specification

        We use both least squares regressions and a two stage linear instrumental variables model

to explore the relationship between competition and risk-adjusted quality at the hospital level. 12

The key explanatory variable in each model is a measure of the competition facing each hospital,

as measured by the LOCI. Of course, the obvious endogeneity issues, both with regard to the

competition measure and volume – since better quality could lead to both greater market share

and volume − require instrumental variables for consistent estimation.

Instrumental Variables. We presume that the quality of the hospital could potentially influence

the hospital’s market share as well as facility-level volume for a given procedure or patient

cohort. For this reason, we use the Kessler and McClellan (2000) instrument for hospital

admissions that depends only on the differential distance – or in our case, travel-time – to the

hospital.

12
  We do not weight by patient volume because our unit of analysis is the hospital and its behavior, not patient
behavior. However, weighted regressions yield similar results.


                                                        17

where dtj is the travel time from zip code t to hospital j. (This is identical to the specification

above in Equation 3, except that the ZIP- and hospital-specific term that depends on quality of

care is removed.) 13 Note that this estimation model provides ZIP-level estimates of admissions

to hospital j (which can be used to calculate a predicted LOCI), but also provides an estimate of

admissions (or volume) at hospital j, 𝑥𝑗∗ , that can be used as an instrument for volume. Thus we

have two separate instruments (predicted LOCI and predicted volume) for our two separate

potentially endogenous variables (actual LOCI and actual total admissions). 14 In practice we use

predicted total volume as an instrument for the procedure-specific volume measures in the AMI,

hip replacement, knee replacement, and dementia cohorts.

         To capture market structure, we include hospitals with at least 1000 admissions in the

fee-for-service Medicare population during 2010-11 (N = 2,638). We consider market structure

within each of 305 hospital referral regions (HRRs) defined by the Dartmouth Atlas project,

excluding Los Angeles. With more than 80 hospitals, the Los Angeles HRR logistics regression

did not convergence, so we used the slightly smaller Los Angeles hospital service area (HSA)

instead. Thus we have 306 hospital market regions, covering nearly all of the United States.

         We draw on methods described in Bekelis et al. (2016) using street-level network data

from ESRI’s StreetMap North America v10.2 (2009 data) and ArcGIS software with the


13
  One could also include additional variables capturing differential travel effects for specific ages or genders, but
this is a fairly homogeneous group; everyone is age 65 or over, and we needed to keep the estimation model
simple given the large number of distinct hospitals in many regions.
14
  Recall that the predicted LOCI for hospital j depends on more than the predicted volume for hospital j, but also
on predicted volumes for other hospitals in the market. Thus these two measures are quite distinct, although they
are based on the same first-stage regression; their correlation coefficient is -0.05.


                                                          18
Network Analyst extension, to estimate optimal driving distance from each ZIP code centroid to

each regional hospital. 15 We then estimated, for each of the 305 HRRs (and the Los Angeles

HSA), a multinomial logistic regression that expressed the likelihood of admission to hospital j

based solely on the differential driving time from ZIP t to hospital j, conditional on driving times

to all other hospitals in the market. 16

        We include additional variables in our regression that could affect quality of care, for

example whether the hospital is for-profit or government, or the share of patients who are

African-American, Hispanic, and the average ZIP code poverty rate of hospital patients. A key

concern with measures of market concentration is that they may proxy for population density;

urban areas tend to exhibit a greater absolute number of hospitals and so exhibit greater degrees

of competition. If patients benefit from being nearer to hospitals, rather than competition per se,

then we might falsely conclude that competition improves quality (Gravelle et al., 2012). We

therefore include as exogenous control variables the fraction of patients from rural, small city,

suburb, and large city regions using rural-urban commuting area measures (RUCAs).

        The instruments are highly predictive in the first stages of the IV estimates; as expected,

differential driving times strongly predict hospital choice. 17 The partial F-statistic for predicted

LOCI (based only on differential driving time) in the LOCI equation is 2,008, while the

corresponding partial F-statistic for predicted total volume in the separate cohort-specific volume

first-stage estimates exceeds 350 for all IV regressions.

15
  Due to the limited street network data in Alaska and Hawaii, driving times there were based on geodesic
distances between the origin and destination centroids.
16
   While the multinomial logistic model follows from the theoretical choice model, one could also use conditional
logit models by HRR.
17
   Of the 2,658 hospitals in this larger sample, 7 exhibited predicted volumes that were less than 100 admissions
for a variety of numerical optimizing algorithms. (In one HRR, we switched algorithms to achieve convergence.)
However, none of these “outlier” hospitals ended up in the sample of 1,376 ultimately used in the data analysis.

V. Results

           Measuring Market Structure. We first show the distribution of LOCI and HHI across

the 2,638 hospitals in the United States in Figure 1. There is a wide range of hospital-level

competition, ranging from near-perfect competition (with a value of 1) to a more competitive

environment (with a value of 0.2). Smaller hospitals tended to exhibit measures of LOCI closer

to 1.0 (as they are better able to proportionately expand capacity), but large New York City

hospitals (e.g., New York Presbyterian, Mount Sinai, NYU) range between 0.76 and 0.91 as

well, reflecting the highly competitive New York market. At the other end of the spectrum,

larger hospitals serving rural areas (e.g., Champlain Valley, Vermont; Lynchburg, Virginia;

Western Maryland) tend to exhibit LOCI values between 0.2 and 0.3. Figure 1 also demonstrates

the association between the LOCI and the HHI. Despite the different construction inherent for

each measure, there is a strong (negative) association between the two. (Recall that for the HHI,

1 is perfect monopoly and 0 perfect competition, the opposite of the LOCI.)

           We also show the association between predicted and actual LOCI in Figure 2. As was

mentioned above, predicted LOCI is a very strong predictor of actual LOCI. Figure 3 shows

predicted and actual volume measures, which again show a very close correlation.

           There is a clear outlier hospital in Figure 3, with much higher 2-year volumes than the

other hospitals. This is the Florida Hospital in Orlando, which (according to Becker’s Hospital

Review) is also the largest hospital in America, with 2,382 beds. 18 That New York Presbyterian

hospital, which is second-largest but has nearly identical beds in 2015 (2,373), has far fewer

admissions in our data likely reflects Florida Hospital’s larger population of over-65 patients,

and a smaller share of elderly patients in Medicare Advantage, the managed care option, and thus

not present in our sample.

        For our regression analysis, we limit the number of hospitals to those with at least 10

admissions for AMI, hip replacement, knee replacement, and dementia during our study period

(N=1,376 hospitals). On average, the sample hospitals had 9,959 admissions during 2010-11

(Table 1), or a total of 13.7 million admissions underlying the hospital-level sample. The average

LOCI competition measure is 0.62 with a standard deviation of 0.16, while the average HHI is

0.22, with a similar standard deviation (0.15).

        Turning next to the cohorts, on average, each of the 1,376 hospitals admitted 96.5

patients for AMI during our study period, and provided beta blockers to 83.8 percent, and statins

to 75.9 percent of patients in the first 6 months (Table 2). The standard deviation for age across

hospitals was 2.2; hospitals do not differ substantially with regard to the average age of their

patients. Risk-adjusted mortality rates following admission for AMI were 14.8 percent in the first

30 days and 32.0 percent in the first year after admission, while Medicare price-adjusted

spending for these patients totaled $44,083 during the first year post-AMI.

        The hip and knee replacement cohorts were 75.3 and 74.5 years old, respectively, on

average, and had very low 30-day mortality rates (0.3 percent for both knee and hip

replacement). Volume (averaged over the 1,376 hospitals) was 43.8 patients for hip

replacements, and 107.3 knee replacements. On average, 9.7 percent of hip replacement patients,

and 8.8 percent of knee replacement patients, experienced either medical or surgical

complications following the procedure. 19


19
  The surgical complication rate, and the medical complication rate, do not add up to the “medical or surgical
complication” rate because a few patients experienced both kinds of complications.



                                                        21
        Our sample of hospitals had 68.6 admissions during our study period on average for

dementia patients in the last six months of life. The mean age of these patients was older than the

other cohorts (85.4 years), 61.4 percent were women, and 9.4 percent were African-American.

During this period, 6.2 percent had a feeding tube, but with considerable variability across

hospitals; the standard deviation was 5.6 percent.

        Correlation of Quality Measures Across Study Cohorts. As shown in Table 3, there is a

surprisingly modest correlation in quality measures across clinical departments in hospitals –

cardiology (for AMI), orthopedic (for hips and knees), and hospitalist/general internal medicine,

or geriatrics (for feeding tube placement), a result others have found (e.g., Bevan and Skellern,

2011; Skellern, 2015; Gravelle et al., 2014).

        Within clinical departments, the correlations are higher; the correlation between knee and

hip replacement complication rates, for example, is 0.285 (p < .001), while for beta blockers and

statins, it is 0.210 (p < .001).

        Association of AMI quality with market power. In accordance with previous studies (e.g.

Kessler and McClellan, 2000), greater competition is, in some equations, associated with better

outcomes in the AMI cohort (Table 4a). The coefficient on LOCI in the simple bivariate

regression is -0.021 (t-statistic 2.21), implying that a two-standard-deviation shift in the LOCI

would reduce mortality by 0.67 percentage points (on an average of 14.8 percent). Model 2

replaces LOCI with the HHI, and suggests the same beneficial effects of competition, but the

estimate is not statistically significant. Results for Models 3 and the fully specified 30-day

mortality regression in Table 4a (Model 4) are similar, with a coefficient on the LOCI of -0.026

(t-statistic of 2.40). The beneficial effects of competition, however, are not found in the IV

model; the fully specified equation yields a coefficient of -0.009, with a t-statistic of 0.67. In



                                                  22
both the OLS and IV specifications, log volume is estimated to be strongly associated with lower

mortality.

        We consider additional measures for AMI quality, and costs, in Table 4b. More

competitive markets were associated with greater use of beta blockers in both the OLS and IV

specification, as were statins; indeed, the coefficients were larger in magnitude for the IV

specification. For example, a two-standard-deviation increase in the LOCI is predicted to

improve statin adherence by 4.2 percentage points (on an average of 75.9 percent). Log one-

year Medicare expenditures are also predicted to rise in more competitive markets, but not by

much. A two-standard-deviation increase in the LOCI is predicted to increase spending by a

modest 2.8 percent (in the OLS) or 3.3 percent (in the IV). This holds even after adjusting for

the fraction African-American and Hispanic in hospitals.

        Association of Hip and Knee Replacement Quality with Competition. In contrast with

the AMI cohort, there does not appear to be a consistent association between LOCI and rates of

complications among hip and knee replacements. For hip replacements, there is essentially no

association between our LOCI competition measure and rates of complications after hip

replacements (Table 4c). The greater preponderance of negative coefficients for knee

replacements (Table 4d) is consistent with theory, but only the fully specified IV regression

(Model 6) exhibits a marginally significant estimate (coefficient -2.45, p-value, 0.044).

Procedure volume is strongly predictive of better quality in the least-squares regressions in

Tables 4c and 4d, but these results do not persist when procedure-specific volume is

instrumented by total hospital volume. 20


20
  These coefficient patterns are consistent with a model in which some hospitals specialize in hip and knee
replacements (reflected in their high volume), but this specialization would not be captured by the instrument --
overall predicted hospital admissions. See Chandra et al. (2016).

       Association of Dementia Patient Quality with Competition. For dementia, the

likelihood of both feeding tube placement and burdensome transitions in patients with severe

dementia are substantially greater in more competitive markets (Table 4e). The coefficient for

the fully specified OLS model, which implies a two-standard-deviation increase in the LOCI

leading to a 1.4 percentage point increase in feeding tube placement (on an average of 6.2

percent), with a similar estimate in the IV specification without the full set of covariates (Table

4e, Model 6). However, the fully specified IV estimate is smaller in magnitude, with a

coefficient of 2.12 and only marginal significance (t-statistic of 1.83). As well, volume is

positively associated with the use of feeding tubes, suggesting poor coordination of care in larger

hospitals. Finally, the regression coefficients on the proportion of Hispanic and African-

American patients in the hospital, and poverty in the region are large and significant. Recall that

our estimates of feeding-tube use already control at the individual level for patient race and

ethnicity, so these coefficients more likely reflect factors such as financial stress arising from

high rates of Medicaid and uncompensated care patients served by these hospitals.

V. Discussion

       Does competition in health care lead to better outcomes and lower costs? There is little

agreement in this controversy, with papers finding positive, negative or zero associations. In this

paper, we revisit this question by deriving a model that expresses in a fixed-price regime the

association between competition and quality. We estimated the model with a national sample of

Medicare fee-for-service patients during 2010-11, aggregated up to the hospital level. Our

primary focus was to test the standard model of competition as to whether diseases or procedures

with either greater demand elasticity or higher profit margins exhibited greater effects of

competition on quality. Generally, we found the answer to be no. While the use of high-value



                                                  24
beta blockers following AMI was greater in more competitive regions, the association between

competition and 30-day AMI mortality was sensitive to model specification. Hip and knee

replacements, arguably the cleanest cohort with high theoretical elasticity of demand and a

reputation for sizable financial margins, showed little consistent association between competition

and quality. For dementia patients, which are likely to exhibit low elasticity of demand with

respect to quality and zero or negative financial margins, poor clinical care was positively

associated with competition – a result arguably consistent with the theoretical model when

financial margins are negative.

       Hospital care is far from a homogeneous product and the difficulty of observing quality is

a well-known problem. We have attempted to include a broad array of available technical quality

measures in our analyses, and have been able to include outcome measures of importance to

patients, rather than solely process measures. There are publically available data for AMI

mortality but not for complication rates after joint replacement or rate of feeding tube placement

among advanced dementia patients. Under these circumstances, competition may mean

recruiting the best physicians, reaching out to primary care doctors, or more traditional

interpretations of market power. Hospitals may choose to invest in amenities rather than quality

if they think the elasticity with respect to quality to be low. Indeed, in more complex models,

Katz (2013) has suggested that in a fixed-price regime, greater competition may reduce the

quality equilibrium in healthcare markets under certain circumstances.

       One of the key questions is whether it’s worthwhile for hospitals to compete on quality if

neither patients nor referring physicians can distinguish between high- and low-quality hospitals,

either because they do not have sufficient information, or because they simply don’t pay

attention? For example, it may be difficult for patients to observe technical hospital quality;



                                                25
quality measures may ignore commonly available objective measures such as hospital infection

rates (Emanuel and Steinmetz, 2013), and quality measures for hip and knee replacements are

often limited to just readmission rates (Chandra et al., 2016). Also, patients may not be familiar

with public reports on quality (Schneider and Lieberman, 2001; Schneider and Epstein, 1998)

and could choose a hospital based on distance or amenities (Goldman and Romley, 2008; Luft et

al. 1990). Newer initiatives seek to inform consumers on public reporting of quality, and

employer-sponsored, crowd-sourced, and mandated price reporting. 21 Research shows that use of

these tools is low (Whaley et al., 2014; Desai et al., 2016), with a variety of explanations for

their low use. Examples include (a) not knowing about their existence, (b) lack of health

insurance literacy, (c) absence of consistency across different rankings, and (d) few incentives to

choose a lower-cost provider.

           A further complexity of the competition story arises from the intermediate role of

physicians in directing patients toward or away from a particular hospital, as in preliminary work

by Bynum et al. (2014). When choosing where to have one’s knee replaced, for example, a

patient may ask their primary care doctor for advice and a referral. Those physicians may

recommend based on the perceived quality of the hospital, but other evidence suggests that

physicians are more likely to refer to their own affiliated hospital, even when it is low-quality

(Baker, Bundorf, and Kessler, 2015).

           Despite this concern that health care markets are uniquely inefficient, several recent

studies provide evidence that patients do make their way to higher quality providers. Chandra et

al. (2016) finds that higher-quality hospitals experience more rapid growth in volume of patients

over time, with roughly one-quarter of the secular gain in AMI survival attributed to reallocation

21
     For example, see www.castlighthealth.com, www.clearhealthcosts.com, and https://nhhealthcost.nh.gov.



                                                       26
from lower to higher quality hospitals, with smaller effects for pneumonia and heart failure. Less

clear is whether regions with higher concentration experience more rapid or slower reallocation

of patients to higher-quality hospitals. 22 Similarly, Santos et al. (2016) have shown that in

England, high-quality physicians (as measured by public ratings) are more likely to attract

patients. Clearly, there must be some information about quality getting through to patients,

although the mechanism is not always clear.

         We acknowledge the limitations of this analysis. Previous studies have used changes

over time in competition to study changes over time in quality of care (e.g., Kessler and

McClellan, 2000), or plausible natural experiments in political alignment or health care reforms

to predict competition (e.g., Gaynor et al., 2013, Cooper et al., 2011, 2013). Our cross-sectional

analysis allows us to test longer-term equilibrium outcomes, but also risks biases arising from

hospital fixed effects that are correlated with competition measures. We do not measure patient-

reported quality measures, such as patient satisfaction, where arguably hospitals may find it most

valuable to compete. 23

        We also recognize the limitations of Medicare fee-for-service claims data, which is only a

fraction of the hospital’s total market, and does not capture the hospital’s Medicare managed

care population. Additionally, in Europe, waiting times are an important component of quality –

one that we do not account for in our theoretical model or empirical work. Finally, we have

followed the conventional literature in measuring “competition” by whether one’s neighbors

seek care at many different hospitals, but these may or may not translate into the motivations and


22
  They do find that transfer patients are more likely to seek out higher-quality hospitals; presumably these
patients, who have been stabilized, are better able to choose from among the universe of nearby hospitals.
23
  Although see Chandra et al., 2016, who find no evidence that patient satisfaction is associated with growth in
patient volume.


                                                        27
actions of hospitals in implementing quality improvement initiatives, nor do our measures reflect

that in some areas, patients may be more skilled at searching than others.

       What do our results mean for the current U.S. debate about competition versus

coordination in health care? Regulators balance allowing mergers based on potential benefits

from clinical integration while trying to promote price and quality competition in commercial

markets and quality competition with fixed-price payers. Our paper (and others) suggests that

consolidation per se is modestly associated with a decline in quality for cardiac care, but that

clinical integration could also lead to higher volumes of patients treated at higher-quality, or at

least higher-volume hospitals. Preliminary evidence is also beginning to emerge that under

payment models incentivizing care coordination and accountability, formal financial integration

is not necessary to achieve clinical integration. Therefore, potential effects of mergers on

commercial prices could still be the most important consideration for regulators.

       In sum, we did not find strong evidence in support of the standard models of competition

on quality. This may mean that the information available to consumers is fragmented and

incomplete, or that potential patients are not very skilled in looking outside of their local

neighborhoods for higher quality facilities (Ho and Pakes, 2014), rather than an indictment of

competition per se. Further validation of quality measures and consumer (or physician)

knowledge about these measures would be of great value, and have implications for the

consolidation currently accelerating under risk-based payment models.
