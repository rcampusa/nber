                                             ABSTRACT

It is well known that a substantial part of income and education is passed on from parents to children,
generating substantial persistence in socio-economic status across generations. In this paper, we examine
whether another form of human capital, health, is also largely transmitted from generation to generation,
contributing to limited socio-economic mobility. Using data from the NLSY, we first present new
evidence on intergenerational transmission of health outcomes in the U.S., including weight, height,
the body mass index (BMI), asthma and depression for both natives and immigrants. We show that
both native and immigrant children inherit a prominent fraction of their health status from their parents,
and that, on average, immigrants experience higher persistence than natives in weight and BMI. We
also find that mothers’ education decreases children’s weight and BMI for natives, while single motherhood
increases weight and BMI for both native and immigrant children. Finally, we find that the longer
immigrants remain in the U.S., the less intergenerational persistence there is and the more immigrants
look like native children. Unfortunately, the more generations immigrant families remain in the U.S.,
the more children of immigrants resemble natives’ higher weights, higher BMI and increased propensity
to suffer from asthma.

I. Introduction

       Even in a society that is considered highly mobile like the United States, it is well

established that socio-economic status is largely determined by parental income. Several

studies have shown that the income of both natives and immigrants is highly correlated to

the income of their parents (Solon, 1992; Zimmerman, 1992; Borjas, 1992), pointing to a

high level of persistence in socio-economic status and limited opportunities for social

mobility. These studies, however, have not decomposed the estimated intergenerational

income correlations into causal components. Such decomposition would help to identify

factors that promote or delay mobility and also identify possible policies to increase social

mobility. A further decomposition would help to identify the extent to which the causal

components reflect genetic or environmental influences addressing the nature versus

nurture debate. Human capital theory suggests that education and health are key

endowments affecting intergenerational transmission of economic status and earnings

(Behrman et al, 1994).

       While a substantial literature focuses on the intergenerational transmission of

schooling, much less work has focused on the intergenerational transmission of health.

However, a growing literature shows that aside from education, health status such as height

(Persico et al., 2004; Case and Paxson, 2008), obesity (Cawley, 2004), and health

conditions (Currie and Madrian, 1999) are also important determinants of earnings

differentials. Health capital is an important component of an individual’s stock of human

capital affecting labor market outcomes (Mushkin, 1962; Grossman, 1972; Currie and

Madrian, 1999). The literature on intergenerational transmission of socio-economic



                                             2
outcomes has so far focused almost exclusively on cognitive skills and investments in

education. Just as importantly, intergenerational mobility in non-cognitive attributes,

including individual’s physical and mental health, may also provide important insights in

understanding high persistence in economic status.

       The objective of this paper is to examine the extent of intergenerational

transmission in health outcomes including weight, height, the body mass index (BMI),

asthma and depression. We investigate these intergenerational correlations separately for

natives and immigrants from different generations. We address two questions about the

intergenerational transmission of health status. First, we examine the extent of the

intergenerational transmission of health for natives and immigrants and ask whether these

intergenerational correlations differ between natives and immigrants. Second, we

investigate whether those who have been in the U.S for various generations are more

mobile compared to more recent immigrants. That is, do immigrants assimilate towards

natives as they stay in the United States for more generations?

       To answer these questions, we use a nationally representative data set, the National

Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which follows mothers in 1979 through 2004 and their

children in 1994 through 2004. This feature of the data set enables us to link mother and

their children as well as sibling mothers. This is important because we can compare the

health outcomes of children of sisters (i.e., cousins), thus controlling for grandparents’

fixed effects and accounting for many prominent genetic and environmental attributes that

are common in a family tree.

       To preview our main results, we find that both native and immigrant children attain

an important fraction of their health capital from their mother. We further show that



                                            3
mother’s health outcomes contribute to generate persistence across generations both in

terms of anthropometric measures: weight, height and BMI as well as specific conditions,

such as asthma, and emotional health outcomes, such as depression. This remains true even

when we introduce a rich set of controls for children’s and mothers’ characteristics and

grandparents’ fixed effects models. We also find that mother’s education increases and

single motherhood reduces children’s health status independently. Finally, we find that the

longer immigrants remain in the U.S. the more mobile they are in terms of health status

and the less their health status is determined by their mothers. In particular, we find less

persistence in weight, BMI and asthma for third generation than for second and first

generation children. However, this also means that the longer immigrant families remain

in the U.S., the more their children resemble native children in their propensity to be

overweight and to experience asthma.

        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the previous

literature on intergenerational mobility. Section 3 describes the main empirical strategy and

Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 presents the main results using Ordinary-Least-

Squares for natives and immigrants as well as the OLS results with averages. Section 6

concludes.



II. Literature Review

       Research on inter-generational transmission of health status was first put forward

by Sir Galton’s well-known pioneering study, in which he examined the relationship

between children’s heights and their parents in 1886. Galton showed that the height of




                                             4
children is some fraction of the parent’s height and that height is not fully passed on, but

rather converges towards the mean (i.e., “regress[es] towards mediocrity”).

       While a handful of studies examine the degree of intergenerational mobility in

earnings and economic status across countries and over time (Solon, 1992; Zimmerman,

1992; Corak, 2004; Ferrie, 2005; Yuksel, 2007), few studies have attempted to investigate

the intergenerational transmission of health outcomes. The intuition that individuals’ health

along with their education endowments may provide important insights in understanding

the mobility of earnings was first argued by Ahlburg (1998). He proposes that further

investigation of mechanisms underlying intergenerational mobility in earnings will help us

to identify the extent to which the causal components reflect genetic or environmental

influences, that is address the nature versus nurture debate. Eriksson, Bratsberg and Raaum

(2007) provide similar analyses using the Danish Youth Cohort Study. They find

significant correlations in health problems across generations. They also show that children

from low-income families are more likely to experience health problems in adulthood, even

when they control for parental health problems.

       Several studies address the intergenerational transmission in birth weight. Emanuel

et al. (1992) find a positive relation between infant and parents’ birth weight using 1958

British Birth Cohort Study. Similarly, Collins et al. (2002) use Illinois vital statistics

records to analyze correlations in birth weight among US-born and foreign-born white and

black women. They document a general increase in average birth weights across

generations among native-born women. However, among immigrant women the pattern

was reversed for black immigrant women who have babies of higher birth weight than their




                                             5
native-born daughters. Currie and Moretti (2007) revisit the same question using individual

birth records from California and show substantial intergenerational correlation in health.

        This study also relates to the literature looking at the association between mother’s

socioeconomic status and children’s health. These studies have shown that mother’s

education is strongly associated with infants’ birth weight both in U.S. and in developing

countries (Strauss and Thomas, 1995, for developing countries; Currie and Moretti, 2003,

for the U.S.). They find that more educated mothers are less likely to have low or very low

birth weight babies, and their babies are less likely to die within their first year of life.

Other studies also find that these effects persist well into adulthood. For example, Case,

Fertig and Paxson (2005) find that mother’s education predicts self-reported health at age

42. In line with this research, we also investigate the impact of mother’s SES on children’s

health outcomes.

        In addition, an extensive literature has clearly established that individual’s health is

an important component of labor market success. For instance, the effects of obesity on

labor market outcomes for the U.S. and Europe have been assessed in a large number of

studies. One of the most robust findings is that obese women tend to earn less than their

non-obese counterparts and there are differences by ethnicity and race in the U.S., while

results are not as robust for Europe (Cawley, 2004, for the U.S.; Garcia and Quintana-

Domeque, 2006, for Europe). On the other hand, Black et al. (2007) use data from Norway

and find that lower birth babies have worse outcomes both in the short-run in terms of one-

year mortality rate and in the longer-run in terms of educational attainment and earnings.

Taken together, these studies suggest that both overweight and low birth weight individuals

tend to earn less.



                                               6
       Other studies also examine the relation between height and earnings and find that a

person’s height is strongly correlated with his or her income. Judge and Cable (2004),

Persico et al. (2004) and Case and Paxson (2008) find similar results and report that for

both men and women an additional inch of height is associated with a one to two percent

increase in earnings in the U.S. Taken together, these studies suggest that labor market

rewards height and penalize obesity and low birth weight.

       Along these findings, we believe that examining to what extent health endowments

are transmitted across generations will improve our understanding of the persistence in

earnings and income. We are not aware of any study that investigates the intergenerational

transmission in health outcomes including height, weight, BMI, asthma and depression.

This study, thus, contributes to this literature by considering new channels of

intergenerational transmission of socio-economic status and by looking at the differential

patterns for natives and immigrants.



III. Estimation Framework

       In this study, we examine the similarity in health outcomes between mothers and

children using the following regression,

                      H1𝑖 = 𝜌H0𝑖 + βX1𝑖 + ε1𝑖                                 (1)

where H1i is child health outcomes including weight, height, BMI, asthma and depression;

H0i is the health outcomes of mother; X1i includes all other characteristics of the mother’s

generation that affect children’s health outcomes as well as the child characteristics; and

ε1i is a random shock. This equation should be regarded as a reduced-form equation, where

ρ being determined by multiple factors containing genetic and behavior attributes



                                             7
transmitted from mothers to children. In this setting, H0i controls for all of the factors that

affected the mother’s health outcomes, while X1i will include additional characteristics of

the mother that did not affect her own health outcomes and grandmother fixed effects to

control for genetic or broader unobservable environmental factors.

        The coefficient ρ measures the degree of persistence or immobility in the society

and is the fraction of the mother’s health status that her child inherits. Estimates of ρ close

to unity imply high persistence and limited mobility whereas values of ρ close to zero

suggest low persistence and almost complete intergenerational mobility in health

outcomes. Most empirical studies in the intergenerational mobility of earnings and

education between father-son pairs find ρ to lie between zero and one, while some studies

investigating the mobility of economic status between father-daughter and mother-

daughter pairs have found negative estimates of ρ.2 Thus, we can expect to find coefficients

between zero and one.

        We begin with models estimating the direct impact of mother’s health outcomes on

children’s health outcomes, turning afterwards to models that incorporate controls for the

child’s race, sex and age to control for potential age differentials. Ignoring variables such

as mother’s total household income, mother’s years of education, mother’s marital status,

and residence in an urban or rural area and unemployment rate in the region of residence

when the mother was first interviewed that might be correlated with children’s health may

yield to upwardly biased estimates of ρ. Therefore, to address the potential omitted




2
  Presumably, any real number could be obtained from the estimation of equation (1); a negative value of ρ
would refer to a situation where mothers are high in their generations’ distribution of health, while their
children tend to be low in their own generations’ distribution.

                                                    8
variables problem, we introduce these additional controls to equation (1). One may expect

the persistence coefficient to fall as we include more controls to the model.

       In addition, we also re-estimate equation (1) including grandparents’ fixed effects.

Grandparents’ fixed effect enables us to assess the effect of mother’s health outcomes on

children’s health outcomes, exploiting variation between children of sisters that have at

least one and generally two common parents. Including grandparents’ fixed effects allows

us to control for genetic traits, mother’s background characteristics as well as the family

environment when the mother was growing up. The difference that may arise between

models with and without grandparents’ fixed effects can be attributed to all other remaining

genetic differences and contemporaneous factors that differentially affect children’s health

outcomes.

       A potentially important limitation in estimating (1) is that health variables are self-

reported, which raises the issue of measurement error. In addition, mother’s health

outcomes may be subject to transitory shocks such as:
                                   ∗
                            𝐻0𝑖 = 𝐻0𝑖 + 𝜇0𝑖                                      (2)

where H0i* is the permanent health outcome and μ0i captures transitory fluctuations around

long-run status due to transitory shocks and random measurement error. Then, applying

least squares to equation (1) using H0i instead of H0i* will lead to a downward bias in

estimates due to classical measurement error in mother’s health outcomes. In particular,

the probability limit of the estimated slope coefficient ρ is

                   𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑚 𝜌̂ = [𝜎𝐻2 / (𝜎𝐻2 + 𝜎𝜇20 )] < 𝜌                           (3)

The magnitude of this bias depends on the ratio of signal to total variance,




                                              9
[𝜎𝐻2 / (𝜎𝐻2 + 𝜎𝜇20 )] where H2 is the variance of mother’s permanent health status, and μ02

is the variance of transitory shocks to the permanent health status. Following the literature

on intergenerational transmission of economic status (Solon, 1992; Zimmerman, 1992), we

attempt to reduce the bias arising due to classical measurement error by averaging mother’s

health outcomes over multiples years. Applying least square estimation and assuming the

errors are uncorrelated over time would yield an estimate of ρ with probability limit
                                              2     2    2
                               𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑚 𝜌
                                    ̂𝑎𝑣𝑔 = 𝜌[𝜎𝐻 / (𝜎𝐻 + 𝜎𝜇0 /𝑇)]                 (4)

where T stands for the number of years. Presumably, the bias will decrease as we average

mother’s health status over more years.



IV. Data Description
       The empirical analysis relies on two data sets to analyze the degree of

intergenerational transmission of health for both natives and immigrants in the U.S. First,

we use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), which has information

on parents’ health outcomes as well as parents’ household characteristics. All young

individuals in the sample were between fourteen and twenty-two years of age as of

December 1978. In accordance with the NLSY79 sample design, all eligible individuals

aged 14 to 21 residing in a surveyed household at the end of 1978 were selected as

respondents. As a result, the 11,406 civilian respondents interviewed in 1979 originated

from 7,490 unique households; 2,862 households included more than one NLSY79

respondent, consisting of 5,914 siblings.

       For the children’s health outcomes, we utilize Children of NLSY79, Young Adult

File. The children’s sample consists of all children born to female NLSY79 respondents.

This sample is nationally representative of the children of women who were born from

                                             10
1957 to 1964 and who are living in the United States in 1978. Starting in 1994, NLSY79

children who were 15 years old or older by the end of the interview year were interviewed

separately as young adults. We focus on these young adults in our analysis.

       The NLSY79 and the Children of NLSY79 Young Adult File have information on

both children’s and parents’ self-reported weight, height, BMI, and prevalence of asthma

and depression. Both data sets also provide information about a rich set of individual and

household characteristics such as race, sex, age, immigration status, marital status, total

household income, and whether the mother and child live in an urban area and the

unemployment rate in the region of residence. Essential to the purpose of this paper, we

are able to link mothers’ health outcomes as well as their demographic data to their

children’s health outcomes and demographic data at the same point in their life cycle,

which is not possible in most of the available data.

       Our analysis is primarily conducted using 3,921 mother-children pairs for natives

and 914 for immigrants. We include all NLSY79 female respondents that have a child in

Children of the NLSY79 Young Adult File and who have non-missing information on

health outcomes between 1981 and 1994. Similarly, for the children’s generation, we

include all children in 2004, who have information about their own health outcomes.

         Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the young adult sample separately for

natives and immigrants from different generations. We define a first generation immigrant

as an immigrant who was born outside the United States herself and whose parents and

grandfather were also born outside the U.S. The second-generation immigrants are those

who were born in the U.S and either their mother or father was born outside the U.S.

NLSY79 also includes information about the birthplace of the grandfather which enables



                                             11
us to identify the third generation immigrants. Using this information, we classify third

generation immigrants as those whose grandfathers were born outside the United States

and both themselves and their parents born in the U.S. In this table, we present descriptive

statistics of for immigrants of first, second and third generation mothers.

       From Table 1, it can be observed that natives are heavier, taller, have higher BMI

and are more likely to report being depressed compared to immigrants from all generations.

Note, however, that column (6) in Table 1 shows that the children of third generation

immigrants look similar to natives in terms of health outcomes. Focusing on children of

third generation mothers, we see that these children are heavier, taller, have higher BMI

and are more likely to have asthma than children of immigrant mothers from more recent

generations. The increase in the resemblance between natives and immigrants who have

been in the United States for various generations points to the assimilation of immigrants

towards native norms in terms of health outcomes.

       Table 2 reports summary statistics of mothers separately for natives and

immigrants. Similar to children, native mothers are also heavier, taller, have higher BMI

and are more likely to have asthma relative to immigrant mothers. In addition, native

mothers have more years of schooling and higher total household income compared to first

and second generation immigrants. On the other hand, third generation immigrant mothers

look very similar to natives in terms of both health outcomes and household characteristics

such as years of education, total household income and marital status in 1979. The fact that

third generation immigrants have more years of education as well as higher total household

income suggests that immigrants also assimilate towards natives in terms of income and

education as they stay in the U.S. for various generations.



                                             12
       Comparing age of children and mothers in Tables 1 and 2 shows that the mean age

for children is 19 years of age, while the mean age for mothers’ generation is 21 years of

age. This pairing represents the earliest observational date for mothers and latest

observational date for children. Mothers and children are captured at around the same stage

of their lifecycle; thus, helping us to avoid any potential issues that may arise due to age

differentials across generations.



V. Results on Inter-generational Transmission of Health Status

       This section presents estimates of intergenerational mobility in health outcomes

using measures of health including weight, height, BMI, asthma and depression.

A. Intergenerational Persistence in Weight, Height and BMI

       All OLS estimations involving weight, height and BMI are conducted using 1981

information for the mothers’ generation and 2004 information for the children’s generation.

We choose these years to eliminate age-related differences in health outcomes. As

indicated above, the mean age for mothers and children is approximately 20 in 1981 for

mothers and in 2004 for children.

A.1. Inter-generational Transmission of Weight

       We begin the empirical analysis with an examination of the association between

mother’s weight and child’s weight. Results are reported in Panel A of Table 3, separately

for children of native-born and immigrant mothers. Columns (1) and (5) show estimations

from models without controls for children of natives and immigrants, respectively. These

estimates can be interpreted as 50% of the mother’s weight is transmitted to her children

for natives, while immigrant children attain 70% of their weight from their mother.



                                            13
Although, we observe a lot of persistence in terms of weight across generations for both

natives and immigrants, comparison of persistence coefficient between natives and

immigrants suggest that persistence is stronger for immigrants. In columns (2) and (6), we

control for children’s characteristics by including children’s sex, race and, in particular, by

including both the child’s and mother’s age to account for the fact that health outcomes

may be sensitive to a person’s age. To illustrate, the coefficient estimate in column (2)

drops by 7.6 percent for natives and by 18.1 percent for immigrants mainly due to the

gender and racial differentials in weight outcomes. In addition, once we control for

children’s characteristics, the persistence coefficient is no longer significantly different

between natives and immigrants. This finding suggests that the differences in the racial

composition of natives and immigrants might lead to a substantial difference in

intergenerational transmission of weight.

       The extent of intergenerational transmission of weight may differ between

individuals belonging to different SES groups. In order to consider such differences, we

estimate models including additional controls for mother’s background characteristics such

as total household income, years of education, and marital status, and the unemployment

rate in the area of residence and whether the mother lived in an urban area in 1979. Columns

(3) and (7) contain corresponding estimates for persistence of weight across generations

introducing controls for mother’s background characteristics. Although the estimated

coefficients on mother’s weight are somewhat reduced after we account for mother’s

background characteristics, we still observe a lot of persistence in weight across

generations both natives and immigrants.




                                              14
       Just as importantly, from column (3), it appears that mother’s years of education

has a large impact on the weight of native mothers’ children. More specifically, every

additional year of mother’s education is associated with 2.41 pounds decrease in child’s

weight in 2004 for natives. On the other hand, column (7) provides evidence suggesting

that mother’s education decreases an immigrant child’s weight as well, though small

numbers of observations makes it hard to detect this effect. Interestingly, immigrant

children of married mothers tend to be 15 pounds thinner compared to children of single

mothers indicating that the detrimental impact of single motherhood is stronger for

immigrant than native children. Moreover, in contrast to previous studies examining the

extent of the intergenerational transmission of birth weight (Currie and Moretti, 2003;

Currie and Moretti, 2007), we find that the mother’s other background variables, whether

being in low income quartile and unemployment rate in the region of residence, have no

effect on children’s health outcomes for both natives and immigrants.

       Finally, columns (4) and (8) show models including grandparents’ fixed effects.

This specification takes advantage of variation among children of siblings as an only source

of variation, and therefore controls for many permanent unobserved factors that might vary

across families. Despite the fact that standard errors increase substantially, the point

estimates on mother’s weight virtually remains unchanged for natives in these models.

Thus, even after controlling for genetic factors, the effects of mother’s health outcomes

remain large.

A.2. Intergenerational Transmission of Height

       Height of population reflects both its genetic endowment and its long-run

nutritional intake and health status (Fogel, 1994). This observation suggests that a child’s



                                            15
height is determined by combination of his/her genetic endowments as well as the

environment the child grew up in and the SES of his/her family. To explore the extent to

which a mother’s height is transmitted to her children, we estimate intergenerational

transmission models for height as well. The persistence coefficients of height are displayed

in Panel B of Table 3 separately for native and immigrant children. The coefficient

estimates on mother’s height reveal a lot of persistence in terms of height across generation

as well, though the persistence in height is slightly less compared to persistence in weight

across different specifications. From Column (1) and (5) of Panel B, it appears that native

children attain 40% of their height from their mothers, whereas the corresponding

coefficient for children of immigrants is 47%. Although children of immigrants are

somewhat more likely to inherit their mothers’ height, the persistence coefficient is not

appreciably different between native and immigrant children. These persistence

coefficients on individual’s height are similar or higher than the persistence coefficient of

education, which was estimated as 0.46 for the U.S. (Hertz et al. 2007). Given the well-

established causal link between height and personal success, our findings underscore the

importance of parents’ health capital for individuals’ health endowments as well as in

understanding the strong persistence in economic status across generations in the United

States.

          Columns (2), (3), (6) and (7) of Panel B show the effects by sequentially

introducing the variables discussed above. Including more controls for both child’s

characteristics as well as mother’s background lead the persistence coefficient to fall as

expected in almost all specifications. Additionally, in contrast to child’s weight, it seems

that mother’s socio-economic status in general does not have any impact on height of native



                                             16
children, while immigrant children from lower-income families attain lower height as

adults. The two remaining columns in Panel B display the estimates obtained using

grandparents’ fixed effects. From these columns, we clearly note that a great fraction of

the mother’s height is transmitted to child, in particular, for natives even when we control

for genetic traits and mother’s background characteristics.

A.3. Inter-generational Transmission of BMI

       We also consider the magnitude of the intergenerational correlation in the body

mass index (BMI), defined as weight measured in kilograms divided by height measured

in meters. BMI has a particular importance, as it reflects both height and weight of the

individual and is known as a standard measure of fatness and obesity in epidemiology and

medicine (Cawley, 2004). Panel C of Table 3 contains the ordinary-least-squares estimates

of the persistence coefficients for BMI. The results clearly indicate that mother’s BMI is

transmitted to her child, suggesting that there is a great deal of intergenerational

transmission across generations even when we incorporate more precise measures of

health. From Panel C, the baseline specification indicates that children of native mothers

attain 45 percent of their mothers’ BMI, while children of immigrant mothers inherit 58

percent of their mothers’ BMI.

       Importantly, the results controlling for mother’s characteristics continue to show

greater persistence for immigrants than natives. In addition, models accounting for

mother’s background characteristics document that the human capital of mothers is

important in determining children’s BMI for both natives and immigrants. In addition,

mother’s marital status also seems to matter for child’s BMI along with mother’s education,

in particular for children of immigrants. Just as importantly, models including



                                            17
grandparents’ fixed effects yield point estimates of the persistence coefficients that remain

virtually unchanged for natives, though standard error are somewhat higher.

A.4. OLS Results with Averages

       Table 4 directs attention toward the possibility of measurement error in the

mother’s health outcomes. Averaging mother’s health status should improve the ratio of

signal to total variance, thus reducing the extent of error-in-variables bias. Results are

presented using children’s health outcomes in 2004 and two and three year’s averages for

mothers’ health status. The estimates corresponding to a three-year averages of mother’s

health status are 0.455 for weight, 0.424 for height, and 0.412 for BMI. Overall, the

persistence coefficient for natives increase, as we average over more years for all health

outcomes. Therefore, comparison of estimates using single year measures for mother’s

health outcomes with those averaging mother’s health status over two and three years

clearly suggests that measurement error is indeed a problem for natives. Therefore,

accounting for error-in-variables will increase the persistence of health status across

generations. On the other hand, for immigrants we find increased persistence merely for

height when we use two- and three-year averages of mother’s health status. In addition, in

line with our previous findings, we find that the persistence for natives is similar to those

of immigrants even when introducing three-year averages of mother’s health status.

B. Intergenerational Persistence of Asthma and Depression

       We only observe whether mothers experienced asthma in 2004 and whether they

experienced depression in 1992 and 1994. Although we are not able to capture mother-

child pairs exactly in the same point in their lifecycle, we still believe that it is worthwhile




                                              18
to conduct analyses using asthma and depression to see to what extent children’s specific

health conditions are influenced by the attributes of the mother.

B.1. Intergenerational Transmission of Asthma

       Studies of intergenerational transmission of health have been generally focused on

special diseases as cancer and Alzheimer’s to understand the association between genes

and specific diseases (Ahlburg, 1998). In this paper, we instead analyze the

intergenerational transmission of asthma to assess to what extent this highly prevalent

disease is being transmitted over generations. Panel A of Table 5 reports estimation results

for asthma conditions. The point estimates on a mother having asthma indicate that the

intergenerational correlation in asthma is approximately 17% for children of natives and

22% for children of immigrants, although these persistence coefficients are not

significantly different from each other.

B.2. Inter-generational Transmission of Depression Status

       Having shown that there is indeed a lot of persistence in physical health measures

including weight, height, BMI and asthma, we will now describe the results for a

psychological health outcome, depression. We define depression as an indicator variable

that equals to one if the respondent has experienced depression. Panel B of Table 5 displays

the estimation results for depression. Native children of depressed mothers are more likely

to report they experienced depression as well, suggesting intergenerational transmission of

mental health across generations. Surprisingly, we do not observe the same pattern for

immigrants. The point estimates of persistence coefficient range from 7.6% to 8.6% across

different specifications suggesting that the children of depressed native mother are on

average 8% more likely to be depressed latter on in their life compared to children of non-



                                            19
depressed mothers. We also find that children of less educated mothers are more

susceptible to depression, while other household characteristics seem to be unrelated to

depression. By contrast, there is no evidence of any intergenerational transmission of

depression among immigrants.

C. Intergenerational Persistence in Health for Immigrants of Different Generations

         Table 6 and 7 shows results of intergenerational persistence for children of first,

second and third generation immigrant mothers. The results show that persistence

coefficients in weight and BMI are smaller for third generation than second and first

generation immigrants.3 Thus, as immigrants remain longer in the U.S., they resemble less

their mother’s weight and BMI and these measures depend more on other factors. In fact,

third generation children show a tendency to assimilate towards native children. As shown,

in Table 1, third generation immigrant children look more similar to native children. The

tendency towards higher weight and BMI are, however, not necessarily positive since these

move immigrants towards being overweight.



VI. Conclusion

         In this study, we use National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to investigate the

extent of intergenerational correlation in health separately for natives and immigrants.

         We provide new evidence on intergenerational transmission of health status across

generations. We find that both native and immigrant children inherit anthropometric health

measures such as weight, height and BMI from their mothers. We also find that children’s


3
 Interestingly, the persistence coefficients for height in Panel B of Table 6 do not show this same patterns.
Similarly, the results for asthma and depression in Table 7 do not show a clear change in the persistence
coefficients.


                                                    20
health conditions such as asthma and mental health conditions such as depression are, to a

great extent, also inherited from their mothers. This high correlation persists even when a

rich set of controls, including mother’s background characteristics and grandparents’ fixed

effects are introduced into the models. We also show that mother’s education is negatively

associated with children’s weight and the body mass index. In addition, we find that single

motherhood increases weight for both native and immigrant children.

       Finally, we find evidence of immigrant assimilation in health as immigrants remain

for more generations in the U.S. The intergenerational correlation coefficient decreases for

third generation compared to second and first generation immigrant children. This means

that the longer immigrant families remain in the U.S., the less likely immigrant children’s

health outcomes are to look like their mothers’. Indeed, higher generation immigrant

children are more likely to resemble native children in terms of higher weight and BMI.
