               LDC's Foreign Borrowing and Default Risk: An
                      Empirical Investigation 1976—1980



                                  ABSTRACT



     This paper investigates to what extent the international financial

community has taken into account the risk characteristics of borrowing less

developed countries when granting loans. Specifically, this study analyzes

the determinants of the spread between the interst rate charged to a

particular country and the London Interbank Borrowing Rate (LIBOR). The

empirical analysis uses data on 727 public and publicly guarantied

Eurodollar loans granted to 19LDC's between 1976 and 1980. The results

obtained show that lenders in Eurocredit markets have tended to take into

account (some of) the risk characteristics of borrowers. In particular it was

found that the level of the spread will be positively related to the debt/GNP

ratio and the debt service ratio. On the other hand, the spread will be

negatively related to the international reserves to GNP ratio and the

propensity to invest. The results obtained also show that an increase in the

foreign debt coupled with an equivalent increase in international reserves

will tend to leave the perceived probability of default unaffected. The

empirical analysis presented in this paper also indicates that as late as 1980

the international financial community had not perceived any significant

increase in the probabilities of defaulting in the countries that eventually

run into serious debt problems (i.e., Argentina, Brazil, Mexico).

  1. Introduction

       The recent foreign debt crisis faced by some less developed
                                                                   countries
  (LDC'S) —   i.e.,,   Mexico, Brazil, Argentina — has generated concern among

  economists, bankers and politicians. In
                                                particular, the ability of the
  international banks to distinguish
                                        between "good' and "bad" risks has been
  questioned. It has even been
                                   suggested that the inability to restrict credit
  to countries with low "credit
                                   worthiness" has resulted in the overextension of
  some major banks and that, as a
                                     consequence, this has increased the probabil-
  ity of a global international financial
                                             collapse.1
       The purpose of this paper is to investigate to what extent the

 international financial community has taken into account the risk characteris-

 tics of borrowing less developed countries when granting loans.
                                                                       Specifically,
 this study analyzes the determinants
                                         of the spread between the interest rate

 charged to a particular country and the London
                                                     Interbank Borrowing Rate
 (LIBOR). If the financial
                               community distinguishes between countries with

 different probabilities of..default, these perceptions will be reflected in the

 spreads over LIBOR, with riskier countries
                                                (i.e., countries with a higher

 probability of default) being charged a higher risk premium or spread. When

the perceived probability of default
                                         exceeds a given level, however, that
particular country will be completely excluded from the credit market (Eaton

and Gerowitz 1980, l98la,b; Sachs and Cohen 1982, Folkers—Landau 1982.)

     The empirical analysis of the determinants of the default risk premium is

important for several reasons. First,
                                          an understanding of the factors that

influence lending behavior, is useful for borrowing countries. With this

knowledge LDCs can take positive
                                    steps towards managing their economies in a

way such that the perceived default risk is kept at a level compatible with

what lenders think is prudent.
                                   Second, additional information on how the
                                      2



market assesses default risk will be helpful for determining the probability

that the present repayment difficulties faced by some LDC's can be transformed

into a major global crisis. Also, this analysis will provide insights on the

international banks lending behavior, that will be helpful to assess to what

extent they have been (partially) responsible for the present debt crisis.

And third, empirical information on the relationship between the level of the

foreign debt and its cost is useful for the analysis of optimal borrowing

strategies and of the social rate of discount in an open economy.2

     A number of papers have recently analyzed the theoretical determinants of

default country risk.3 Early studies (i.e., Bardhan, 1967) mainly focused on

the relationship between the level of foreign debt and the cost of foreign

borrowing, trying to define "optimal" borrowing strategies. More recent work,

however, has expanded the analysis in several directions: First, the

existence of credit ceilings, above which countries cannot borrow, has been

explicItly introduced into the analysis (Eaton and Gersowitz, 1980, 1981a,b,

Sachs and Cohen, 1982 and Folkerts—Landau 1982.) Second, variables other than

the level of foreign debt have been explicitly considered as affecting the

default risk premium. In particular, it has been argued that in a general

equilibrium framework the level of international reserves will be related to

the level of debt, and thus could affect the level of default risk (Feder and

Just, 1979; Eaton and Cersowitz, 1980, 1981a). Also it has been pointed out

that the propensity to invest will be negatively related to the risk

premiums. The reason for this is that a higher propensity to invest will

generally indicate a higher potential for future growth, and thus, a lower

probability of default (Sachs and Cohen, 1982). Third it has been argued that

the current account will affect the default premium (Sachs, 1981; Sachs and

Cohen, 1982).
                                            3




      Recent theoretical analyses have also made a distinction between bond and

 bank foreign financing, and have explicitly Introduced the possibility of

 rescheduling debt payments (Sachs and Cohen, 1982; Sachs, l982). Finally, it

 has been argued that if borrowers and lenders have different perceptions with

 respect to the probability of default, the analysis of optimal borrowing

 strategies would be substantially affected (I-Iarberger, 1976a,b, 1980).

      The empirical work on the subject has investigated several aspects of the

problem, including the probability of a country rescheduling its payments

 (Frank and Cline, 1971; Sargen, 1977), and the probability that a particular

LDC borrower has reached its credit ceiling (Eaton and
                                                         Cersowitz, 1980,

1981a,b). Generally, those studies that have analyzed lending behavior in

international financial markets have found that lenders tend to take into

account the riskiness of borrowers in making their lending decisions (Frank

and Cline, 1971; Feder and Just, 1977a,b; Feder and Ross, 1982; Sachs,

1981). In particular, it has been found that the interest rate spread, or

risk premium, will be higher for countries with a higher foreign debt ratio

(Frank and Cline, 1971; Feder and Just, 1977; Sachs, 1981). Moreover, in a

recent paper, Feder and Ross (1982) used data from the Institutional Investor

creditworthiness ranking to show that lenders risk perceptions are systemat-

ically reflected in the spreads charged in Euromarkets. Also, this study

shows that the expected losses lenders expect to incur in case of default are

quite low ——   typically   between 4 and 7 percent.

     The analysis presented in this paper extends previous work on the subject

In several directions. First, while most of the previous work used cross—

section data for a particular year or quarter, the present study covers

several years (1976—1980). Second, the sample considered in this paper only

includes loans denominated in Eurodollars, thus avoiding the problem of
                                      4



different currency composition of loans, mentioned by McDonald (1982,

p. 630). Also this paper only includes public and publically guaranteed

loans, thus restricting the analysis to the determinants of country risk, as

distinct from financial risk.5 Finally, the present study has considered a

larger set of possible determinants of the probability of default than

previous work.

     In Section 2 of this paper a simple framework for analyzing the

determinants of the (subjective) probability of default is presented. It is

argued here that these determinants will basically depend on the nature of the

present value of the expected cost of defaulting. From a modelling point of

view, different assumptions regarding the specific form of this cost will

yield different sets of determinants of this probability. In this section a

specific example is presented, assuming that in a two periods world the cost

of default can be represented as a fraction of the second period output (Sachs

and Cohen, 1982). Section 3 presents results obtained from the empirical

analysis of the determinants of the spread between LIBOR and the interest rate

charged to different countries. The analysis uses data on 727 public and

publically guaranteed Eurodollar loans granted to 19 developing countries

between 1976 and 1980. The results obtained show that lenders in Eurocredit

markets take into account some of the risk characteristics of borrowers. Even

though the results obtained are quite robust they are, in some cases, somewhat

surprising, leading us to conclude that even though international banks have

taken into account some of the borrower's characteristics, they have tended to

overlook others. In that sense, the results presented in this paper provide

some basis to presume that the present crisis is partially a result of banks'

lending practices. However, these results do suggest that by and large the

main causes of the present foreign debt crisis have been the unexpected
                                             5




  external shocks of the late 1970s and
                                             early l980s (i.e., the oil price shock
  of 1979—1980, the world recession of 1980
                                                 and the high interest rates that
  prevailed during this period). This section also presents estimates of the

 perceived probabilities of default implicit in the econometric estimates,

 Finally, in this section I present an analysis of the
                                                            residuals obtained from
 the regression analysis. Section 4 contains some concluding remarks,



 2. The Determinants of the Probability of Default

      The principal distinction between a sovereign and a private borrower is

 that the former can repudiate its debt without
                                                     (totally) losing control of the
 assets financed by it (see Buiter, 1980; Eaton and Gersowitz, 1980). General—

 ly, however, the repudiation of the foreign debt will result in some costs to

 the borrower. These costs can take several forms, including the country's

 complete exclusion from future borrowing in the international capital market,

      The decision to repudiate the debt will depend both on the level of the

debt and the cost of repudiating it.
                                            Broadly speaking, a country will
repudiate its debt if its value exceeds the present value of the (expected)

cost of repudiating it. Assuming that thIs cost (C)         is a continuous non-

negative random variable, and denoting the value of the debt      as D, the
probability of default can be written as:



                   p = prob{C   (   D}                                         (1)



By a well known theorem it is possible to write (Mood, Graybill and Boes 1974,

p. 71):

                   1 — p =                    E(C)
                           Prob{C    ) D}
                                                                               (2)
                                       6




where E(C) is the expected value of C. Then, considering (2) with an

equality sign, the probability of default can be written as:



                                                                          (3)



This expression has the following desirable properties: P/3D > 0;

aP/E(C) < 0; and lim p = 1.     Also, recognizing the p has to be bounded

by 0 and 1 (i.e., 0         p   1), we find that,      lim P = 0.
                                                    E(C)+oo



      Equation (3) is a very general expression that simply states that the

determinants of the probability of default will depend on the initial value of

the debt and on the nature of the cost of repudiating it. From a modelling

perspective, different sets of determinants of this probability can be derived

depending on the nature of the expected cost chosen. In that sense then, it

is not surprising that Sachs and Cohen (1982) find that the probability of

default will be a decreasiug function of the propensity to invest.6 The

reason for this is that they assume that the cost of default is a function of

future output which, on its turn, will depend on the present propensity to

invest.

      In order to further illustrate this point, assume that the expected cost

of repudiating the debt can be expressed as a proportion a of the present

value of output. Furthermore, in order to simplify the exposition assume that

the case of a two period world where output in period 2 (q2) can be written

as:

                                                                          (4)
                    q2=q1+a111+a2n+X2

where q1 is output in period 1;     Ii is net investment in period 1; n is
                                                 7




  the rate of growth of the labor force;
                                                     a1 and a2 are constant parameters;
  and X2 is a random shock with mean i and variance ci2.7 Then, the
                                                                    present
  value of the expected cost of
                                     repudiating the debt is (where r is the
  interest rate on the debt):8



                               aE(q2) =      1
                    E(C) =
                                   l+r     •n- {aq1     + aa111 +
                                                                    aa2n + ap}          (5)



 and the probability of default          p can be written as:



                    p =   {i   -   all   + a1f1 + a2n/q1 + J} [(l+r)d1]                (6)



 where f1 is the average propensity to invest in period 1 (f1 =
                                                                11/q1)
 and d1 is the debt—output ratio      = D1/q1).
                                           (a1

      According to this expression then, if the cost of repudiating the debt is

 a fraction of future output, the probability of default will
                                                                          depend positively
on the debt—output ratio d1, and negatively on the propensity to invest

 (f1) and the rate growth of population (a).

     It can be further assumed that the cost of repudiating the debt will not

be a constant function of future output, but that a will depend on some

economic variables. In particular, it may be argued that a will depend

positively on the level of internation reserves holdings. There are several

ways to rationalize this assumption. On the one hand, an important proportion

of international reserves are held in the form of financial instruments

maintained in foreign banks which can easily be secured by the lender in case

of default. Secondly, it may be assumed that the international financial

community will impose harsher penalties on countries who, in spite of holding

highly liquid reserves, decide to default on their debt.              Then, if we include
                                           8




these considerations and denote the ratio of reserves to output by R, it is

possible to postulate that the probability of default can be written as:



                   p     p( d, f, R, ...;13)                                 (7)
                           (+) (—)   (-)

where the signs in parentheses refer to the signs of the respective partial

derivatives, and where       captures other possible determinants of p not

explicitly considered by the previous analysis. In Section 3 below data on

over 700 Eurodollar loans granted between 1976 and 1980 to LDC's are used to

investigate the extent to which some of these variables (i.e., d, f, and

R), among others, affect the spread between the LIBOR rate and the interest

rate actually charged on these loans.



3. Estimation

     Assume that, as postulated by Feder and Just (l977a,b), Eaton and

Gersovitz (1980) and Sachs (1981) among others, the spread (s) over LIBOR

charged on Eurodollar loans reflects the probability of default (p) of a

particular country. Then, observed data on the spread can be used to formally

analyze the way in which variables like the debt—output ratio, the propensity

to invest, and others affect the level of this perceived probability.

However, before empirically analyzing the determinants of the spread two

important questions should be addressed: (1) What is the functional form of

the probability of default (p); and (2) What is the exact form of the

relationship between these two variables (s and p). A related question,

that was partially answered in the previous section, has to do with the

determinants of p.
                                               9



       Assuming that banks maximize the present value
                                                             of profits, Feder and Just
  (l977a) developed a model where the spread (s) can be written in the

  following form:



                     s =   [p/(l—p)J A                                              (8)



 for A =   (/rj—i) 8; and where          ii
                                              is the elasticity of demand for loans;
  h is the expected loss in case of default; and
                                                           0 captures the cost of
 capital for the bank. Equation (8) is highly convenient for the empirical

 analysis, since by assuming that p has a logistic form it is possible to

 write the logarithm of the spread as a linear function of the determinants

 of p (Theil, 1971):


                                   k
                    log    =    + E           X1 + log A                            (9)
                                  i=l


where the X11s are the determinants of the probability of default (i.e., the

debt—output ratio, the reserves—output ratio, the propensity to invest), and

where the &s are the respective coefficients.

      In this section the results obtained from the estimation of an equation

of the type of (9) using data on 727 public and publically guaranteed loans

granted to 19 LDC's during 1976—1980 are reported.



     3.1 The Data

     The analysis reported in this paper uses annual data for 19 LDC's, who

received 727 public and publically guaranteed loans during 1976—1980. The

spread variable for each country in a particular year was constructed as a

weighted average of spreads actually charged for the individual public and

publically guaranteed loans granted to that particular country. The basic

data were obtained from various issues of the world Bank's Borrowing in

International and Capital Markets. Table 1 contains the data on loan

characteristics, including the yearly average spread or "risk premium', for

the countries used in this study.9 The data presented in this table is quite

interesting. In particular it may be noted that, within each year, the

variation of the spreads across countries is not too high. For example, in

1979 the difference between the highest and lowest premiums are only 1.1

percentage points [1.603 for Ivory Coast and .517 for Greece.]

      A number of variables were considered as possible determinants of the

level of the spread, including those suggested by the model presented in the

preceding section. Specifically, the following variables were included as

possibly affecting s n the empirical analysis:

(1)    The debt—output ratio. As the model developed in Section 2 indicates ——

       and has been argued by Frank and Cline (1971), among others —   it   is


       expected that this variable will have a positive coefficient in the

       regression analysis. (See, also, Hanson 1974.) The data on this

       variable refers to public and publically guaranteed debt and was

       obtained from the World Bank World Debt Tables;

(2)    The ratio of debt service to exports. This indicator measures possible

       cash—flow problems faced by a particular country. This variable has

       been previously included by Frank and Cline (1971) and Feder and Just

       (l977a) in related studies, and it is expected that its coefficient will

       be positive. Data on this ratio was obtained from the World Debt

       Tables.

(3)
       Ratio of international reserves to GNP. This indicator measures the

       level of international liquidity held by a country and as suggested in

         Section 2, it is expected that its coefficient will be positive. Some

        previous work on the subject have also included some kind of

        international liquidity indicator. See, for example, Frank and Cline

        (1971). This variable was constructed from data obtained from the

        International Financial Statistics.

 (4)    Loan duration. This variable is measured in years, and measures the

        (weighted) average maturity of loans granted to a particular country.

        As has been shown by Feder and Ross (1982) its a priori sign in the

        regression analysis Is ambiguous. The weighted average was constructed

        from data reported in Borrowing in International Capital Markets and is

        presented in Table 1.

(5)     Loan volume. This variable shows the average value of each loan

        obtained by a particular country in a given year, and was obtained from

       Borrowing in International Capital Markets. Also, a priori, its sign is

       ambiguous.

(6)    Propensity to invest. This variable, previously considered by Sachs

       (1981) in his empirical study on the determinants of the spread, will

       tend to capture the country's perspectives for future growth. As is

       shown   in   Section 2, and in Sachs and Cohen (1982), it will be negatively

       related to the level of the spread. This indicator was obtained from

       data reported in the World Tables and in World Development Report

       (various issues).

(7)    Ratio of the current account to CMI'. It has been argued by Sachs (1981)

       that this variable will be negatively related to the spread. The data

       on this variable was obtained from World Tables and various issues of

       the World Development Report.

(8)    Average propensity to import. This indicator was constructed as the

       ratio of imports to GNP, and measures the degree of openness of a

       country. To the extent that this ratio captures the degree

       vulnerability of a country to foreign shocks, it is expected that it

       will be positively related to the probability of default (Feder and

       Just, 1977a). This variable was constructed from data obtained from the

       International Financial Statistics.

(9)    Growth of per capita GDP. It has been argued that a higher rate of

       growth of output will result in a lower probability of default (see

       Avramovic, et al., 1964; Feder and Just, 1977a). Data on this indicator

       was obtained from World Tables and the World Development Report.

      Other variables were also considered as possible determinants of the

probability of default, including GNP per capita (Feder and Just, l977a), the

rate of inflation (McDonald, 1982), the variability of exports (Frank and

Cline, 1970), and the ratio of government expenditure to GNP. However, due to

space considerations, and since their inclusion did not affect the results in

any significant way, the estimates obtained when they were included are not

reported here.



      3.2 Results

      Equation (9) was estimated using pooled cross—section time—series data

for 19 countries during five years (1976—1980). For a list of the countries

see Table 3. For estimation purposes it was assumed that log Ant was equal

to a constant k plus a random element TJ (log Ant = k —     ut).    It was

further assumed that this random term Ut was formed of a country—specific

random error        with zero mean and variance c; a time—specific random

element w, with zero mean and variance          and an independently

  distributed random term
                             c, with zero mean and variance a21° (See Feder
  and Just 1977b, for a similar
                                         assumption.) Then the equation to be estimated

 The results presented in this paper were obtained using the technique

suggested by Fuller and Batesse (1974) for estimating this kind of equation.

In the estimation ( + k) was combined into a constant
                                                                          8.
       One possible problem with the estimation of (10) is that, to the extent

that banks determine the spread and loan duration at the same time, use of

Fuller—Batesse's technique would be subject to a simultaneity bias. However,

following Feder and Ross (1982), and Beim (1977) it was assumed that the

duration of the loan is determined by banks prior to the determination of the

spread. This indeed appears to be the case in the Eurocurrency credit itiarkets

(see Euromoney, September 1978).

  both from the point of view of
                                    the mean square errors of the regressions, and
  from the perspective of the signs and level of significance of

                                                                 that

  economic characteristics of the
                                    specific borrowing countries. As may be seen,
  in all regressions the debt—output ratio is significantly
                                                                positive, and
  smaller than one. This result
                                   suggests that a higher level of indebtedness
 will be associated with a higher
                                     probability of default and thus, a higher
 spread over LIBOR, With respect to the
                                            debt—service ratio, its coefficients
 are also positive, as expected, and
                                        significant either at the 5 or 10 percent
 level.

      One of the most interesting
                                    findings of this analysis is that the
 coefficient of the reserves to GNP ratio is consistently negative,
                                                                    as
 expected, and with the exception of equation
                                                  (10.3) it is always significant
 at the 5% level. Also, the estimated values of these coefficients
                                                                   are high,
 indicating that the behavior of the reserves
                                                 ratio has played an important
role in the determination of the
                                    perceived probability of default. The main
importance of thIs result is that, from
                                           a policy point of view, countries that
want to reduce the probbility o being excluded from the International

financial market due to an increase in
                                         the perceived probability of default,
should be particularly careful in managing their international reserves.

Also, these results suggest that the analysis of the demand for international

reserves should incorporate the level of foreign indebtedness as an additional

determinant of the desired level of
                                      international liquidity. It is also
interesting to note that coefficient of the
                                                reserves ratio is quite high in
absolute terms, exceeding in all cases the estimated value of the coefficient

of the debt to GNP ratio.

    The coefficients of loan duration and loan value are negative, but

insigificant, as are the coefficients of the imports—output ratio and

growth. In all regressions the estimated coefficient of the gross

investment/GNP ratio was negative, as expected. Also in all cases, except in
                                                  that, as the model in Section

one of the cases. This is a somewhat puzzling result, since it indicates

a lower deficit (or higher surplus) will result in a higher and perceived

probability of default and spread.     The problem with this is that, with other

deficit means that the same investment is being financed with a higher

proportion of foreign savings, and one would generally expect that in this

case (i.e., lower domestic savings ratio) the perceived probability of default

would be higher.

      It is interesting to note that in all cases the estImated variance of the

 time—specific element         exceeds the estimated countryspecific variance

      indicating that during the period under consideration differences across

 consideration (1976—1980) the level of world liquidity varied significantly.

 On the whole, however, the low value of the mean square error of the

 regressions (MSE) show a quite satisfactory fit.

      From the results presented In Table 2 it would be interesting to

  country increases its foreign debt to finance the accumulation of

 international reserves.'3 In order to answer this question it is important to

 realize that in this case, three right hand side variables from our default

 risk equation (10) wIll be affected: (1)          the debt/GNP ratio will increase,

 tending to raise the spread; (2) the international reserves/GNp ratio will

 rise, exercising a downward pressure on the spread, since its estimated

 coefficient is negative; and (3) the debt service/exports ratio will also go

 up, generating additional positive pressure on the spread. The final effect

 of this policy, aimed at financing the accumulation of reserves with new

 foreign debt, on the spread will depend on the sum of these three effects, and

 can be written in the following form:



                                              a3 (y+j)
                   d log s =         + a2 +              ]d DR

where a1, a2 and a3 are the estimated regression coefficients of the

debt/GNP, reserves/GNP and debt service/exports ratios
                                                                 respectively; y is
the fraction of the debt's principal that has to be amortized every year

(i.e., one over the duration of the debt); I is the interest rate actually

charged (LIBOR plus the spread); XR is the exports/GNP ratio; and DR is

the debt/GNP ratio. In order to illustrate the total impact of this policy,

on the spread, consider the case where y = 0.125           (i.e., the duration of the
loan in 8 years), i = 0.12     and XR =   0.225.         The expression in square

brackets in (10) will have a value of —0.069 for the a's            obtained from

equation (10.1) in Table 2; a value of —0.050 for the a's obtained from

equation (10.2); and for the a's obtained in equation (10.3) this
                                                                            expression
in square brackets has a value of 0.034.
                                         22




     For all practical purposes, then, the results presented in Table 2

indicate that an increase in the foreign indebtedness ratio by 10%, coupled

with an increase of the international reserves ratio by 10% will tend to leave

the spread (and the perceived probability of default) unaffected. This could

be considered to be somewhat surprising, since international reserves are a

short—term highly volatile asset, which can be equickly depleted, while

foreign debt is a long term liability. (This case corresponds closely to the

recent experiences of Argentina and Chile.)

     Summarizing, the evidence presented in this section shows that during the

recent past, lending behavior by international banks in Eurocurrency markets

has taken into account (some of) the economic characteristics of borrowers.

Even though some of the coefficients were sensitive to the specification of

the estimated equations, the general results tend to be consistent with what

was expected.

 these probabilities can be observed. First, it can be seen that, within each

 year, there is a fairly wide variation in the perceived probability across

 countries. For example, the results in Table 3 show that in 1976, p ranges

 from a lower value of 5.9% (Venezuela) to 10.6% (Uruguay). Second, for each

 country, these probabilities of default show some variation through time.     For
 example, for the case of Ecuador the probability increases steadily between

1976 and 1979. On the other hand, for the case of Brazil, one of the

countries that eventually ran into serious foreign debt problems, there is an

increase in the perceived probability of default of approximately one full

percentage point. Surprisingly, however, Argentina's probability declined

throughout the period.

     The computations presented in Tables 3 and 4 suggest that even as late as

1980 the international financial market had not predicted in any important way

the future payment difficulties faced by Argentina, Mexico, Uruguay and

Venezuela. At the present time a number of these countries are facing foreign

debt crisis that have forced them to renegotiate a rescheduling of their

payments. Table 5 presents a picture of the rescheduling negotiations

underway as of March of 1983.

     One possible explanation for the fact that the implicit probabilities in

Tables 3 and 4 don't seem to capture the 1981-1982 payments difficulties faced

by some countries, is that these problems were basically triggered by

unexpected events. In fact, according to some experts, including the

International Monetary Fund, these payments difficulties are (basically) the

result of external events that took place in the late 1970s, including the

increase in the price of oil in 1979—1980, the world recession that began in

1980 and the huge increase in world interest rates. Even though these

external factors indeed have had a role in the present crisis, it is important

  not to minimize the role of domestic
                                            policies. In particular, the fact that
  in most cases a large proportion of the new indebtedness
                                                           was used to finance
  consumption should be pointed out (see
                                             Kindleberger, 1977). For example, this
  was the case of Chile 1979—1981 where
                                            the foreign debt almost doubled, with

  domestic savings falling (see Edwards 1983).



       3.4 Residuals Analysis and Other Possible Determinants of Country Risk

       The analysis presented in the preceding sections has focused exclusively

 on the economic determinants of the
                                          premium over Libor charged by the
 financial community to sovereign borrowers. However, it is highly
                                                                    likely that
 this premium is also affected by the lenders perception of political
                                                                      Stability
 in a particular country (see, for
                                   example, Buiter, 1980). In order to
 investigate this possibility the residuals from the regressions were analyzed,

 and an average (for 1976—1980) residual for each country was computed.



                     RES =    Z
                                             GS
                                    [log s — h       Xth]/5                      (13)
                             t =1




where 5nt is the spread actually charged in period t to
                                                        country n, and
           LS
where z
                Xth is the estimated log of the spread using Fuller—Batesse's
GLS procedure. Then, a positive value of RES will indicate
                                                           that, on
average, the spread being charged to that particular country exceeds the

model's prediction. If the residuals
                                          are capturing the effect of omitted
variables related to political
                                    stability, countries with positive RES should
be considered as being politically more risky than the average.

     Table 6 contains the estimated
                                        average residuals obtained from equation
(10.1). These results are quite interesting.'7

information on their relative stability. This suggests that other effects are

also being captured by residuals.18



4. Concluding Remarks

     This paper has analyzed the relationship between foreign debt and default

country risk. The analysis presented suggests that, the probability of

default will depend on the relationship between the cost of defaulting and the

value of the debt. Once a particular function for the cost of default has

been chosen, the determinants of the country risk can be easily found.

     The empirical analysis has used data on 727 public and publically

guaranteed loans granted to 19 LDCs during 1976 and 1980. The result obtained

suggest that banks lending behavior has tended to consider (some of) the

economic characteristics of countries when determining the spread they

charge. However, the results also suggest that, at least during this period,

banks might have overlooked some aspects of the developing countries'

economies. In particular, the finding of a large negative value for the

coefficient of the international reserves ratio suggests that banks might have

given excessive weight to this value ifl their lending decisions.

                                   Footnotes



     'See, for example, Time (January 10, 1983), The Economist, (5—11 March

1983),   Martin Feldstein (1983), Folkerts—Landau (1982). The indebtedness

situation is particularly critical regarding Latin American debtors. For

example, U.S. private banks have "extended credit of more than U.S. $50

billion to Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, an amount that exceeds 80 percent of

the banks equity" (Feldstein, 1983, p. 2). The extent of the indebtedness

crisis is reflected by the fact that in 1982 twenty countries undertook debt

renegotiations, while in the second half of the l970s an average of only 4

countries per year renegotiated their debts.

     2See, for example, Harberger (1976, 1980).

     3See McDonald (1982) for an excellent and exhaustive survey on the

subject. See also the analysis in Buiter (1980).

     4From a historical perspective, it is interesting to notice that in the

recent time the number of defaults have been dramatically reduced, with the

number of debt rescheduling increasing substantially. For a historical

analysis of LDCs debt rescheduling and defaults, see Sachs (1982).

     51n a previous paper (Edwards, 1981) I used data that included both

publicly guaranteed and private loans. Using data for the second quarter of

1980 it was found that the government guarantee resulted, on average, in a

reduction of the spread of one quarter of a percentage point.

     6This is only true in their case "without" renegotiation.

     71t is useful to think of equation (4) as being derived from a Cobb—

Douglas aggregate production function.

     81n (5) the interest rate on the debt (r) was used to compute the

present value of the expected cost of repudiation. More generally, however,
                                       31




the domestic rate of time preference (p) should be used. In (5), then, it

is implicitly assumed that r =   p.   It should be noted, however, that the main

results are not altered if r     p.

     9Actually, Table 1 contains data for 23 countries. However, the results

reported in this paper refer to those 19 countries that have data for all five

years (1976—1980). It is important to note that these averages were

constructed using data on publicized loans only. To the extent that, on

average, the characteristics of non—publicized loans do not differ from that

of publicized, the results will not be affected.

     '°In pooled time—series cross—section analysis it is usually assumed that

the error term has this form. For detailed discussions see Anderson and Hsiao

(1981) and Nerlove (1971). In the present case it is possible to think that

the country—specific term v will capture some characteristics specific to

each country, while the time—specific element (wt) will capture, among other

things, different liquidity situations in the market in every   year.   Equation

(9) was also estimated assuming fixed—effect country—specific and time—

specific terms. The results obtained, however, did not alter in a significant

way those reported in Table 2.

     11Also, in the analysis presented in this paper, as in previous work

(i.e., Feder and Just l977a,b; Sachs 1981; and Feder and Ross 1982), the

possible role of fees and commissions has not been incorporated.

     2These results were obtained using contemporaneous values of the spread

determinants (as in Feder and Just, 1977b). Sachs (1981), however, used

lagged values of the spread determinants. When lagged values of these

variables are used in the estimation of (10) some of the results reported in

Table 2 (i.e., the levels of significance) are affected.

     '3A recent case where this type of policy was deliberately persued is

Chile 1979—1981. During this period the increase in the level of foreign debt

was used almost in a one—to—one basis to accumulate international reserves.

See, for example, Harberger (1982) and Edwards (1983).

     14These are reasonable values for these parameters. As may be seen from

Table 1, most of the loans considered in this study had a duration of around 8

years. On the other hand the LIBOR rate had the following values during this

period: 1976 = 7.12%; 1977 = 7.42%; 1978 = 10.35%; 1979 = 13.15%; 1980 =

17.98%.   Finally, the average value of the exports/GNP ratio for these

countries was 0.233 in 1976 and 0.248 in 1980.

     15me reason for the presence of               in (12) Is that in order to

estimate the perceived probability of default we need estimated values for all

the a's from equation (9), including a0. Since our estimations only give

us the value of      =       +   k we need to find plausible values for k, and of

     in order to find these probabilities.

     16Since k = log A —            and A =      [/(-1)]hO1,    a reasonable range

for k can be obtained under alternative assumptions regarding n,            i and
0. For example, if       =   1.2,   h =   0.10 and 0      0.08, log A = 2.01.

     17For example, according to these results, Mexico, Malaysia, Spain and

Greece appear to be the "more stable" countries, with Yugoslavia, Ivory Coast,

Argentina and Brazil the less stable ones.

     '8One possibility is that these residuals are capturing the fact that

some of these countries are oil—producers. However, when a dummy for oil—

producing countries was included its coefficient was insignificant, and the

main results were not affected.
