               REAL BUSINESS CYCLES AND THE TEST OF THE ADELHANS


                                   ABSTRACT


     This paper conducts a modern variant of the test proposed and carried out
by Adelman and Adelman [1959). Using the methods developed by Burns and
Mitchell (1946). we see if we can distinguish between the economic series
generated by an actual economy and those analogous artificial series generated
by a stochastically perturbed economic model. In the case of the Adelmans, the
model corresponded to the Klein-Goldberger equations. In our case, the model
corresponds to a simple real business cycle model. The results indicate a
fairly high degree of coincidence in key economic aggregates between the
business cycle characteristics identified in actual data and those found in our
simulated economy.
