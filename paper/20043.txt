Capital Taxation under Political Constraints

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper studies optimal dynamic tax policy under the threat of political reform. A policy will be
reformed ex post if a large enough political coalition supports reform; thus, credible policies are those
that will continue to attract enough political support in the future. If the only credible reform threat
is to fully equalize consumption, we find that optimal marginal capital taxes are U-shaped, so that
savings are subsidized for the middle class but are taxed for the poor and rich. If ex post the government
may strategically propose a reform other than full equalization in order to secure additional political
support, then optimal capital taxes are instead progressive throughout the income distribution.

1    Introduction
In a democratic society, the credibility of a course of public policy depends on the level
of political support it can be expected to enjoy in the future. This level of support is
degenerate in representative-agent economies: a policy is credible if and only if it is time-
consistent from the representative agent’s perspective (Kydland and Prescott, 1977). If, on
the other hand, society consists of diverse individuals, a democratic government needs
to take the resulting heterogeneity of political preferences into account when formulating
policy, and in particular must realize that a policy is credible only if it will continue to
receive the support of a large enough coalition of citizens in the future.
   This paper adopts the above perspective on the credibility of public policy to reexam-
ine the classical capital taxation problem in a heterogeneous society. We consider a sim-
ple two-period model where individuals produce in the first period only but consume in
both periods. A utilitarian government has access to arbitrary nonlinear labor and capital
taxes. The key feature of the model is that the government is able to reform its original
policy in period 2 if there is sufficient political support for a reform. Thus, the government’s
ability to commit to intertemporal tax policy is limited and determined by politics.
    In the simplest version of the model (the “equalizing reforms” version), the only cred-
ible reform involves full redistribution of capital: since the government tolerates inequal-
ity only if this enhances the incentives for production, it prefers to fully equalize period-2
consumption once production has occurred. In this case, poor voters tend to support
reform, rich voters tend to oppose it, and middle-class voters tend to be close to indiffer-
ent and thus pivotal. Therefore, the government can make its original policy credible by
making the status quo as appealing as possible to the middle class, relative to full equal-
ization. It does this both by subsidizing saving for middle class voters (so they have high
period-2 consumption under the status quo) and by taxing capital for the poor and rich
(so consumption under an equalizing reform is low). That is, the socially optimal manner
for the government to forestall reform is to impose a U-shaped marginal tax on capital.
As we argue in more detail in Section 5.3, this novel prediction of U-shaped marginal
capital taxes resonates well with policy in many advanced economies, once the savings
incentives implied by means-tested government benefits are taken into account.
    The prediction of U-shaped marginal capital taxes crucially depends on the fact that
full equalization is the only credible reform in this version of the model. If other reforms
are also credible, the government may have a strong incentive to propose reforms other
than full equalization in order to secure more political support; for example, it may want
to expropriate the richest 1% in period 2 to sweeten the reform for the remaining 99%. To


                                               1
allow for this possibility, we next consider the polar case where the government is able
to credibly propose any reform in period 2, with the reform again being implemented if
it has sufficient political support relative to the status quo (the “strategic reforms” ver-
sion of the model). In this case, we show that the government’s planning problem may be
written as a standard welfare maximization problem with an additional “no-reform” con-
straint, where a marginal increase in a given individual’s period-2 consumption under the
status quo relaxes the no-reform constraint on net if and only if her period-2 consumption
is higher under the reform than under the status quo. Furthermore, the reform is always
more egalitarian than the status quo, so it is the poor who have higher period-2 consump-
tion under the reform, and hence they face lower capital taxes under the government’s
optimal policy. Thus, when the government may strategically propose reforms other than
full equalization, the prediction of U-shaped marginal capital taxes is replaced with the
prediction of progressive marginal capital taxes throughout the income distribution.
   Putting our results together, we find that when the government’s credibility is limited
by the possibility of future political reform, optimal capital taxes may be either U-shaped
or progressive, depending on the government’s ability to credibly tailor reforms to pop-
ular demand. We formally consider the two polar versions of the model—where only
fully equalizing reforms are credible, and where all reforms are—and reality is likely to
lie somewhere in between. However, we can roughly map the two versions of our model
to more representative and more direct versions of democratic government, respectively:
in representative democracies, politicians retain the final say on fiscal policy, and are thus
unlikely to be able to commit to reforms that they have a strong incentive to modify ex
post; while in direct democracies, politicians may have the “agenda-setting” power to
propose a specific policy, while being unable to modify it after it is approved by the vot-
ers. With this interpretation, our model predicts that capital taxes are more likely to be
U-shaped when fiscal policy is ultimately determined by representatives, and more likely
to be progressive when fiscal policy is determined by direct referendum.1,2
    This paper lies at the intersection of the public finance literature on dynamic taxation
   1 This prediction is hard to test directly for two reasons.
                                                           First, effective marginal capital taxes are difficult
to measure, as discussed below. Second, obvious ways of measuring whether a democracy is “direct” or
“representative” are likely to pick up effects that are outside the model but that could also affect fiscal
policy. For example, the recent empirical paper by Hinnerich and Pettersson-Lidbom (2013) argues that
representative democracies are more redistributive than direct democracies because they are less easily
captured by elites.
   2 An alternative interpretation is that the two versions of the model differ in the government’s degree

of sophistication. In the strategic reforms version, the government is able to design (and commit to) so-
phisticated vote-buying strategies at the reform stage. In the equalizing reforms version, the government
simply pursues its most-preferred (fully equalizing) reform. This can capture naïvety on the part of the
government, as well as an inability to commit at the reform stage.


                                                        2
with limited commitment and the political economy literature on endogenous coalition
formation. Relative to the public finance literature, we introduce a new model of limited
commitment based on political coalition formation: our perspective is that a policy is
credible if it retains the support of a large enough coalition to block reform. The most
classical branch of the literature on limited commitment assumes a representative agent
(Fischer, 1980, Klein, Krusell and Rios-Rull, 2008), which makes the coalition formation
problem degenerate; this remains true in models where “reputation” can mitigate the
government’s time-inconsistency problem (Kotlikoff, Persson, and Svensson, 1988, Chari
and Kehoe, 1990, Benhabib and Rustichini, 1997, Phelan and Stacchetti, 2001). Hassler et
al. (2005) consider a two-type model, which again precludes non-trivial coalitions.3
    More closely related are the few papers where the extent of commitment is explicitly
determined by political economy factors. One such paper is due to Acemoglu, Golosov,
and Tsyvinski (2010), who analyze an infinite-horizon Mirrlees model with self-interested
politicians and study whether the resulting distortions eventually vanish. A particularly
closely related paper that we build on is Farhi et al. (2012). They consider a model sim-
ilar to ours, but assume that the government is always able to reform its original policy
(at a cost) in period 2, without the need for political support in the population. This
leads to progressive capital taxes: the government is tempted to fully equalize period-2
consumption, so it reduces this temptation by partially equalizing period-2 consumption
under the status quo—relative to the Atkinson-Stiglitz (1976) benchmark of zero capital
taxes—which corresponds to taxing saving for the rich and subsidizing it for the poor.
The strategic reforms version of our model also predicts progressive capital taxes, but
the logic is quite different. In particular, all reforms in Farhi et al.’s two-period model
involve full equalization—indeed, we show below that the equalizing reforms version of
our model nests their model as a special case—but with equalizing reforms we predict
U-shaped capital taxes.
    There is also an influential positive political economy literature on capital taxation
with heterogeneous voters and linear taxes (Bertola, 1993, Alesina and Rodrik, 1994, Pers-
son and Tabellini, 1994a). One paper in this literature that emphasizes time-inconsistency
is Persson and Tabellini (1994b), who consider a two-period model with linear taxes and
show that voters may want to elect a government that is biased against taxing capital.
   3 Similar commitment problems can arise in moral hazard models rather than the Mirrleesian adverse
selection model considered here. See, for instance, Fudenberg and Tirole (1990) and Netzer and Scheuer
(2010) for two-period models where, ex ante, the principal optimally offers incomplete insurance to a risk-
averse agent in order to provide incentives for efficient effort, but ex post, once effort is sunk, prefers to
provide full insurance. Our approach to modeling limited commitment could also be applied to moral
hazard models like these.



                                                      3
Restricting to linear taxes leads to a median voter theorem, which again rules out many
of the the coalition formation issues that underlie our approach.
    Relative to the coalition formation literature, we sidestep the indeterminacy inherent
in most such models by viewing coalition formation as a constraint in a planning problem:
that is, we ask what coalition will be formed by a utilitarian government that needs a cer-
tain level of political support. While we assume that the government is utilitarian—rather
than inherently representing the interests of certain groups in society—this could easily
be endogenized as resulting from political competition in a probabilistic voting model
with uniform taste shocks (Cox and McCubbins, 1986, Lindbeck and Weibull, 1987). We
also relax the assumption that the government is utilitarian in Appendix D, and show
that if the government is biased toward certain groups in society then our results on
the shape of optimal capital taxes continue to hold within each group. The alternative
modeling approach of studying competition among political parties offering nonlinear
tax schedules—while interesting—would lead to a Colonel Blotto (or “divide-the-dollar”)
game, which is notoriously difficult to analyze even in the simplest redistributive settings
(Myerson, 1993, Lizzeri and Persico, 2001; see also Aumann and Kurz, 1977, for a cooper-
ative game theory approach). Our approach is thus both more tractable and closer to the
public finance literature on limited commitment.
   The result in the coalition formation literature that is most closely related to our ap-
proach is Director’s Law (Stigler, 1970), which observes that public redistribution tends
to benefit the middle class rather than the poor. The literature on Director’s law typically
considers static settings (Lindbeck and Weibull, 1987; Dixit and Londregan 1996, 1998);
to the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to ask how such coalition formation
concerns affect optimal dynamic tax policy. Another difference with this literature is that
Director’s Law is usually interpreted as predicting a coalition of the poor and middle-
class against the rich: for example, in Stigler (1970) this happens because ganging up to
rob the rich is more profitable than ganging up to rob the poor. In contrast, the problem
in our model is how to form a coalition to forestall an equalizing reform, which natu-
rally leads to a coalition of the middle-class and the rich. It should also be emphasized
that this “coalition” exists only in terms of opposition to reform; the government remains
utilitarian, and labor taxes redistribute toward the poor as in standard Mirrlees models.
    Finally, our results about the shape of the nonlinear capital tax schedule mirror an ex-
tensive literature on the shape of optimal income taxes in static Mirrlees models. In par-
ticular, many authors have found U-shaped marginal income taxes to be optimal (see e.g.
Diamond, 1998, and Saez, 2001). However, whereas this property crucially depends on
the shape of the underlying skill distribution (specifically on an unbounded Pareto-tail at


                                             4
the top), our results about U-shaped or progressive marginal capital taxes are completely
independent of the form of the skill distribution.
   The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces our basic framework, which is a
standard two-period Mirrlees model as discussed above. Section 3 analyzes the version
of the model where only fully equalizing reforms are credible. Section 4 considers the
version where the government can credibly propose more sophisticated strategic reforms.
Section 5 offers a quantitative illustration of our results based on a calibrated version of
the model and discusses various extensions. Section 6 concludes. Omitted proofs, as well
as technical details on several extensions of the model, are presented in the appendix.


2    Model
We consider a standard Mirrlees model with two periods, t = 1, 2. There is a continuum
of individuals indexed by their ability q 2 Q. Assume that Q is an open subset of R and
that q has cumulative distribution function F with positive density f on Q.
    Individuals produce in period 1 only and consume in both periods. A type q individ-
ual has utility function

                           u (c1 (q )) + bu (c2 (q )) − h (y (q ) , q ) ,

where c1 (q ) and c2 (q ) are consumption in periods 1 and 2; u is a strictly increasing,
strictly concave, and twice-differentiable consumption utility function satisfying the In-
ada conditions limc!0 u0 (c) = • and limc!• u0 (c) = 0; b > 0 is the discount factor; y (q )
is production in period 1; and h is a continuous function, strictly increasing and convex
in y and with strictly decreasing differences, that measures the cost of production.
    There is a linear saving technology, so the economy faces aggregate resource con-
straints in t = 1, 2 given by
                             Z                          Z
                                  c1 (q ) dF + K           y (q ) dF,
                                    Z
                                        c2 (q ) dF  RK,

where K is aggregate capital and R > 0 is its gross rate of return. These may be combined
to form a single intertemporal resource constraint
                           Z ✓                    ◆    Z

                                 c1 (q ) + c2 (q ) dF  y (q ) dF.                        (1)

                                                 5
   In addition to the continuum of individuals, there is a government, assumed for now
to be utilitarian (we relax this in Appendix D).4 As in Mirrlees (1971), the government
cannot observe ability. Therefore, the revelation principle implies that the government’s
problem when it can fully commit to an intertemporal allocation is
                                    Z
                        max             (u (c1 (q )) + bu (c2 (q )) − h (y (q ) , q )) dF
                        c1 ,c2 ,y


subject to the intertemporal resource constraint (1) and a standard incentive compatibility
constraint

u (c1 (q )) + bu (c2 (q )) − h (y (q ) , q ) ≥ u c1 q 0 + bu c2 q 0 − h y q 0 , q for all q, q 0 ,
                                                                                            (2)
where c1 , c2 , and y are arbitrary measurable functions from Q to R + .
    Most of our results will concern the implicit marginal capital tax, defined by

                                                          u0 (c1 (q ))
                                         tk (q ) ⌘ 1 −                  < 1.                           (3)
                                                         bRu0 (c2 (q ))

This “wedge” is well-defined in any allocation, and in addition can be interpreted as the
actual marginal capital tax rate faced by agents of type q in a nonlinear tax implementa-
tion of the optimal allocation, as we will discuss in Section 5.2.5 At a solution to the above
full-commitment problem, Atkinson and Stiglitz’s (1976) uniform taxation result implies
that tk (q ) = 0 for all q.6 As we will see, this result does not continue to hold when the
government’s credibility is limited by the possibility of reform in period 2.
    We will consider two versions of limited commitment on the part of the government,
which differ in the government’s ability in period 2 to commit to the details of a proposed
reform. In both versions, the timing of the model is as follows.

   1. The government proposes consumption and production schedules (c1 , c2 , y).

   2. Production and period-1 consumption occurs.

   3. The period-2 consumption schedule c2 may be reformed to an alternative schedule
      ĉ2 .
   4 As is standard, this could be interpreted as the outcome of political competition between two parties
in a probabilistic voting model with uniform taste shocks. In the equilibrium of such a model, both parties
offer the same platform, which maximizes a utilitarian welfare function.
   5 For results on the intratemporal labor wedge, see also Section 5.1.
   6 Throughout, we omit caveats regarding measure-0 sets when stating results. We address this issue in

various proofs where it may cause confusion.


                                                           6
    The two versions of the model differ in how the “reform” consumption schedule ĉ2 is
specified; the details of this are described below. In both versions, the reform is defeated
if and only if                    Z
                                         H (c2 (q ) , ĉ2 (q )) dF ≥ a,                                    (4)

for some bounded function H of status quo consumption c2 and reform consumption
ĉ2 and some constant a 2 [0, 1]. The interpretation is that the status quo is supported
by fraction H (c2 (q ) , ĉ2 (q )) 2 [0, 1] of those individuals with status quo consumption
c2 (q ) and reform consumption ĉ2 (q ), and that the status quo prevails if it is supported
by at least fraction a of the total population.7 In particular, one can interpret H as the
cumulative distribution function of taste shocks in a probabilistic voting model (e.g., Cox
and McCubbins, 1986, Lindbeck and Weibull, 1987). An interesting extreme case obtains
when these taste shocks are all zero, so that H is a step function with
                                                      (
                                                          1 if a ≥ b
                                        H ( a, b) =
                                                          0 if a < b.

In this case, the “no-reform” constraint (4) simply requires that the fraction of the popu-
lation who receive higher consumption (or utility) under the status quo than under the
reform exceeds the critical threshold a. For most of the analysis, we make the technically
convenient assumption that H is continuously differentiable in each argument, and thus
admit step functions only as a limiting case. However, step functions themselves are also
easy to work with—and indeed yield particularly sharp results—so we sometimes con-
sider them separately. Another natural specification is where H (c2 (q ) , ĉ2 (q )) depends
only on the difference c2 (q ) − ĉ2 (q ) or the difference u (c2 (q )) − u (ĉ2 (q )), and its corre-
sponding density is single-peaked at zero (so H is S-shaped in the difference), which is a
common assumption in the probabilistic voting literature. This captures a situation where
taste shocks can be non-zero but are concentrated around zero, for instance following a
normal distribution.
    Constraint (4) can capture formal political rules according to which previously an-
nounced policies can be reformed only if a sufficiently large number of voters are in fa-
vor, for instance a (super-)majority rule (indexed by a) in parliament or in a referendum.
Alternatively, it can be interpreted as an informal stability requirement, where the gov-
ernment needs to maintain sufficient support for its policies to prevent major unrest or
a coup in the future. Even if such revolts do not occur along the equilibrium path, their
   7 Theassumption that the range of H is [0, 1] is natural and is required for this interpretation, but is not
technically required for the analysis.



                                                      7
possibility will induce the government to offer platforms that appeal to a large enough
share of the population at any point in time, as captured by (4).
   In Appendix C, we formulate the model as a game between the individuals and the
government. The timing of the game is that the government first sets labor and capital
tax schedules; individuals then choose how much to produce and consume in period 1;
and finally the capital tax schedule may be reformed, and individuals consume their final
capital in period 2. We then prove a version of the revelation principle, which says that
any optimal (for the government) equilibrium allocation (c1 , c2 , y) satisfies (1), (2) and (4)
when viewed as a direct mechanism. Thus, as far as optimal allocations are concerned,
it is without loss of generality to restrict attention to feasible, incentive compatible di-
rect mechanisms that satisfy the no-reform constraint. We thus restrict attention to such
mechanisms throughout. The revelation principle proved in Appendix C does however
require some mild assumptions on H, which differ in the two versions of the model. These
assumptions are discussed in the relevant sections below.


3        Equalizing Reforms
In this section, we consider the version of the model where the only credible reform con-
sumption schedule ĉ2 involves full equalization in period 2, that is
                                                  Z
                                     ĉ2 (q ) =       c2 (q )dF − k for all q,                        (5)

where k ≥ 0 is an exogenous cost of implementing a reform, which can equal 0.8 This
assumption is appropriate if the government (rather than the voters) always has the final
say on fiscal policy, as the (utilitarian) government’s most-preferred reform is always full
equalization.9 In other words, the timing of a possible reform is as follows.

    1. Individuals vote on whether to allow a reform to c2 .

    2. If a reform is allowed, the government chooses the reform consumption schedule
       ĉ2 .

   We also impose the following mild assumption on H throughout this section, which
says that a reform that makes everyone weakly worse-off is always defeated.
    8k   may include both physical and “reputational” costs, as discussed in Section 5.5.
    9 See Section 5.4 and Appendix D for how this would change if the government uses more general welfare

weights. It is also worth noting that “ratchet effects,” where the government could exploit information
about individual types revealed in period 1, are not an issue here, because no information is required to
implement the reform most preferred by the utilitarian government.

Assumption 1 If c2 (q ) ≥ ĉ2 (q ) for all q, then (4) holds.

    As k ≥ 0, Assumption 1 implies that constant period-2 consumption schedules are
never reformed. This in turn implies that any equilibrium allocation satisfies the no-
reform constraint when viewed as a direct mechanism, and thus that the revelation prin-
ciple applies (see Appendix C). The government’s problem is therefore
                                      Z
                          max             (u (c1 (q )) + bu (c2 (q )) − h (y (q ) , q )) dF
                          c1 ,c2 ,y


subject to (1), (2), and (4), where in (4) ĉ2 is given by (5).
   We note at the outset that the government’s problem is typically not concave, because
H (c2 (q ) , ĉ2 (q )) is typically not concave in c2 (q ); for example, step functions are not
concave. This is not a “technical” problem (although it will lead to some mathematical
complications), but rather a central economic ingredient of the model. In particular, to
design a credible policy, the government must in effect select a coalition of voters that will
support this policy against a potential future reform. This coalition-formation problem is
non-concave under natural assumptions, as it is natural to assume that the voters who
are closest to indifferent between the status quo and the reform are the ones who are
most sensitive to slight changes in these policies. For example, if H (c2 (q ) , ĉ2 (q )) is a
cumulative distribution function that depends only on the difference c2 (q ) − ĉ2 (q ), then
it is natural to assume that H is S-shaped in the difference, while it is not possible for H
to be concave in the difference over the entire real line.
   While the government’s problem is not concave, it is still true that it must be solved
by any solution to the dual problem

violate (1) for small enough #.

The first-order (necessary) conditions of this program deliver the following characteriza-
tion.

Lemma 1. In any solution to the government’s problem, the intertemporal wedge tk (q ) satisfies

                            tk (q )
                                      = − Rh [ H̄2 (c2 , RK − k ) + H1 (c2 (q ) , RK − k )] ,                               (10)
                          1 − tk (q )

where h ≥ 0 is the multiplier on (8), subscripts on H denote partial derivatives, and
                                                                Z
                                   H̄2 (c2 , RK − k ) ⌘             H2 (c2 (q ) , RK − k ) dF.

Proof. Substituting out for c1 (q ) using (7), and letting h ≥ 0 and µ ≥ 0 be the multipliers on (8) and (9),
respectively, we form the Lagrangian
    Z ✓                                                  ◆      Z                            ✓    Z          ◆

                                                R

The first-order (necessary) condition with respect to K yields

                                                        µ
                                                          = − H̄2 (c2 , RK − k ) .
                                                        h

Next, rewrite the Lagrangian as
          Z ✓                                                       ✓                                      ◆◆

                u        (U (q ) − bu (c2 (q ))) + c2 (q ) − h           H (c2 (q ) , RK − k ) − c2 (q )        dF − µRK,
                                                  R                                             h

and differentiate under the integral with respect to c2 (q ) to obtain the necessary condition

                                                                    bRu0 (c2 (q ))
                               u0 (c1 (q )) =                                                         .
                                                1 − Rh [ H̄2 (c2 , RK − k ) + H1 (c2 (q ) , RK − k )]

Finally, use (3) to rewrite this condition as (10).



                                                                    10
    Equation (10) is the key tool for drawing conclusions about the progressivity of opti-
mal capital taxes. In order to use it, however, we need to know the shape of c2 (q ). While it
is quite intuitive that c2 (q ) should be non-decreasing, this is not immediate in the current
context because the problem is not concave. The following mathematical lemma will let
us conclude that c2 (q ) is non-decreasing in some solution to the government’s problem.
We will make use of this lemma repeatedly in different contexts throughout the paper,
so we state it in general language. Note that the lemma concerns randomized consump-
tion schedules, while the model allows only deterministic consumption schedules. The
strategy is thus to show that monotone, deterministic consumption schedules are optimal
in the class of all deterministic schedules by showing that they are optimal in the larger
class of all randomized schedules. A side benefit of this approach is that it shows that
our results would not change if we allowed randomized schedules in the model, as such
schedules would not be optimal.

(i) In any solution P, if t (q 0 ) < t (q 00 ) then a (q 0 )  a (q 00 ) for all a (q 0 ) 2 supp P (q 0 ) and
a (q 00 ) 2 supp P (q 00 ).

  12 That is, constraint C is a more general version of constraint C’ that allows the functions y to depend
                                                                                                 x
on the aggregate allocation A ( P). Note also that constraint C may equivalently be written as

                                         sup         y x ( a, A ( P)) dPdF  0,
                                         x2X

and similarly for constraint C’.

(ii) If a solution exists and t is non-decreasing, then there exists a deterministic solution in which
a is non-decreasing.

Proof. See Appendix A.1.

    To see the intuition for Lemma 2, restrict attention to deterministic allocations and
assume that t is the identity, X is a singleton, and the constraint takes the simpler form of
constraint C’. The program in the lemma is then
                                                 Z
                                          sup        w ( a (q ) , q ) dF

                                                y ( a (q )) dF  0.

The corresponding Lagrangian is
                                   Z
                                       (w ( a (q ) , q ) − ly ( a (q ))) dF.

Standard monotone comparative statics results (e.g., Theorem 4’ of Milgrom and Shan-
non, 1994) imply that any (right-continuous) function a⇤ that maximizes the Lagrangian
is monotone in the sense of (i), even if y is not convex. However, if y is not convex, then
a saddle point of the Lagrangian may not exist, so it does not immediately follow that
any solution to the constrained optimization problem is monotone. The proof of Lemma
2 uses an explicit variational argument to show that this must nonetheless be the case.
Lemma 2 is the key monotone comparative statics tool of this paper—and seems like it
could also be useful in other contexts—but it does require somewhat carefully chosen as-
sumptions; in Appendix D, we point out both possible generalizations and limitations of
the lemma.
   We use Lemma 2 to establish the desired result about the shape of c2 (q ).

Lemma 3. There exists a solution to the government’s problem in which c2 (q ) is non-decreasing.

Proof. See Appendix A.2.

    The remaining results in this section concern such monotone solutions to the govern-
ment’s problem; by Lemma 2, the only possible loss of generality involved in this re-
striction is that other solutions may involve non-monotonicity of c2 (q ) in q over intervals
where both U (q ) and y (q ) are constant (i.e. for types that are pooled).

                                                       12
   Our first main result is the following. Note that H1 (c2 (q ) , RK − k ) being single-
peaked in c2 (q ) corresponds to H (c2 (q ) , RK − k ) being S-shaped in c2 (q ), which we
have argued is a natural assumption.

Proposition 1. If H1 (c2 (q ) , RK − k ) is single-peaked in c2 (q ), then optimal marginal capital
taxes are U-shaped in q.

Proof. By (10), tk (q ) is non-increasing in H1 (c2 (q ) , RK − k ). As c2 (q ) is non-decreasing in q, if H1 (c2 (q ) ,
RK − k ) is single-peaked in c2 (q ) then H1 (c2 (q ) , RK − k ) is single-peaked in q, and therefore tk (q ) is
U-shaped in q.

    Proposition 1 says that when a proposed policy is credible only if the period-2 alloca-
tion is preferred to full redistribution by a large enough share of the population, optimal
marginal capital taxes are U-shaped. Although the derivation of this result was com-
plicated by the non-concavity on the government’s problem, the intuition is quite sim-
ple. Ex post, most poor agents will support a fully equalizing reform, most rich agents
will oppose it, and middle-class agents will tend to be pivotal; this feature that those
in the middle are most sensitive to the details of their allocation under the status quo
relative to the reform is captured by the assumption that H1 is single-peaked. Thus, in
order to make the status quo credible, the government ensures that middle-class agents’
period-2 consumption is high under the status quo and low under the reform. Consid-
ering variations in the timing of consumption that leave fixed total consumption utility
U (q ) = u (c1 (q )) + bu (c2 (q )) (and thus do not affect the incentive compatibility con-
straint), this may be achieved by subsidizing capital (i.e., backloading consumption) for
the middle class (which increases middle-class period-2 consumption under the status
quo) and taxing capital (i.e., frontloading consumption) for the poor and rich (which de-
creases middle-class period-2 consumption under the reform). Note that which agents
end up being “poor,” “rich,” and “middle-class” in terms of period-2 consumption is en-
dogenous to government policy, and one of the key results behind Proposition 1 is Lemma
3, which shows that it is indeed optimal for agents’ rankings in terms of their period-2
consumption to match their rankings in terms of ability.
   We now consider the implications of Proposition 1 for some leading specifications of
H. These stronger functional form assumptions will also let us sign optimal marginal
capital taxes.

Definition 1. H depends on consumption differences if H (c2 (q ) , ĉ2 (q )) = H̃ (c2 (q ) − ĉ2 (q ))
for some H̃. H depends on utility differences if H (c2 (q ) , ĉ2 (q )) = H̃ (u(c2 (q )) − u (ĉ2 (q )))
for some H̃.


                                                          13
    H will depend on consumption (utility) differences if it is the probability of supporting
the status quo in a probabilistic voting model with additive consumption (taste) shocks.
   Whether H depends on consumption or utility differences, it is natural to assume
that H̃ is S-shaped, so that H̃ 0 is single-peaked. Under this assumption, we obtain the
following corollary of Proposition 1.13

Corollary 1. If H depends on consumption (utility) differences and H̃ 0 is single-peaked ( H̃ 0 u0
is single-peaked in c2 (q ) for all ĉ2 (q )), then optimal marginal capital taxes are U-shaped in q.
In addition, if the allocation (c1 , c2 , y) is non-constant and H̃ 0 is strictly single-peaked ( H̃ 0 u0 is
strictly single-peaked in c2 (q ) for all ĉ2 (q )), then optimal marginal capital taxes are negative for
individuals with intermediate q, and are positive for individuals with low and/or high q.

Proof. See Appendix A.3.

    To interpret the condition that H̃ 0 u0 is single-peaked, note that if H depends on utility
differences then (10) becomes
                     Z                                                                       �

1 − tk (q )

When H̃ is uniform—so that H̃ 0 is constant—we recover precisely the optimal capital tax
formula of Farhi et al. (2012), which prescribes increasing marginal capital taxes. If H̃ 0 is
single-peaked, we then obtain a U-shaped adjustment to their progressive tax schedule,
with taxes being U-shaped overall if and only if H̃ 0 u0 is single-peaked.
    Indeed, the version of the model studied in this section is a strict generalization of
Farhi et al.’s model whenever consumption utility can be bounded. To see this, let u =
infc2C u (c) and let ū = supc2C u (c), where C is some (large) set of relevant consumption
levels. Suppose that

                                                                       1 1 u (c2 (q )) − u (ĉ2 (q ))
          H (c2 (q ) , ĉ2 (q )) = H̃ (u (c2 (q )) − u (ĉ2 (q ))) =    +                             ,
                                                                       2 2           ū − u

so that H̃ is a uniform cumulative distribution function that is symmetric around zero in
u(c2 (q )) − u(ĉ2 (q )). In addition, suppose a = 1/2. Then the no-reform constraint in the
current model, (4), becomes

which is precisely the no-reform constraint in Farhi et al. (2012). To understand this co-
incidence, recall that the no-reform constraint in their model requires that a utilitarian
government does not wish to equalize consumption at resource cost k, and observe that
this is the case if and only if a simple majority of voters does not wish to equalize con-
sumption at resource cost k in a probabilistic voting model with uniform taste shocks.
From this perspective, the results of this section may be viewed as a generalization of
Farhi et al.’s analysis to the case where voters’ probabilities of supporting reform are not
all equally sensitive to marginal policy changes. This in turn is exactly the case where
political coalition formation matters.
   We close this section by noting that the finding that optimal capital taxes are U-shaped
holds in a particularly sharp way when H is a step function.

Proposition 2. If H is a step function, then in every monotone solution to the government’s
problem there is an interval of types [ql , qh ] such that

  1. Marginal capital taxes are positive and constant for q < ql and q > qh , and in particular
     are given by
                                 tk (q )
                                           = Rµ for all q < ql , q > qh
                               1 − tk (q )
     where µ ≥ 0 is the multiplier on (9).

  2. Period 2 consumption c2 (q ) equals RK − k for all q 2 [ql , qh ]. In addition, marginal capital
     taxes are non-decreasing on the interval [ql , qh ], and if c2 is non-constant then

                                    tk (q )
                                               Rµ for all q 2 [ql , qh ] .
                                  1 − tk (q )

Proof. See Appendix A.4.

    Figure 1 illustrates the pattern derived in Proposition 2. To sustain support from a
large enough fraction a of the population, the government raises the consumption of
the “middle class” (types between ql and qh ) to RK − k, making them just indifferent
to a reform. To achieve this, the government imposes a flat savings tax on the “poor”
and “rich” (to depress consumption under a reform) and an increasing, lower tax (or a
subsidy) on the middle class (to raise their period-2 consumption under the status quo).
As in the case where H is smooth, this leads to a U-shaped marginal capital tax schedule.

                     Figure 1: Equalizing reforms when H is a step function

4     Strategic Reforms
In this section, we consider an alternative version of the model where the government can
credibly propose an arbitrary reform in period 2. While fully equalizing consumption
remains the government’s most-preferred reform, in period 2 it may wish to propose a
reform other than full equalization in order to secure additional political support. As we
assume that such “vote-buying” proposals are credible, the implicit timing of the reform
stage in this section is

    1. The government proposes a reform consumption schedule ĉ2 .

    2. Individuals vote on whether to implement the status quo c2 or the reform ĉ2 .

   This reversed timing compared to Section 3 captures situations where voters, rather
than the government, have the final say on fiscal policy, for instance through a referen-
dum. We will establish the unexpected result that in this version of the model, optimal
capital taxes are progressive throughout the skill distribution, even if H is strictly single-
peaked. Indeed, a weak form of progressivity holds completely independently of the
shape of H.


                                              16
    Before stating our results formally, we impose the assumption, maintained through-
out this section, that the government would rather implement the optimal policy that
forestalls reform than pay the resource cost k to implement the full-commitment solution.
This assumption ensures that a reform does not actually occur in an optimal equilibrium
for the government, as the government’s payoff in an equilibrium in which reform oc-
curs is at most its full-commitment payoff minus k; in Appendix C, it is shown that this
lets one restrict attention to feasible, incentive compatible direct mechanisms that satisfy
the no-reform constraint. The assumption always holds if, for example, k > 0 and a is
sufficiently small, as in that case the full-commitment solution itself forestalls reform.14

Assumption 2 The value of the government’s problem described below is greater than
          the value of the government’s full-commitment solution minus k.

     We also maintain the following assumption on H throughout this section.

Assumption 3 H either depends on consumption differences or utility differences, and
    H̃ 0 is single-peaked at 0.

    The following proposition summarizes our findings in this section, proven in the sub-
sequent Propositions 4 and 5 in this section and Propositions 7 and 8 in Appendix B. In
what follows, a type q is non-pooled if c2 (q ) 6= c2 (q 0 ) for all q 0 6= q.

Proposition 3. Suppose Assumptions 2 and 3 are satisfied. Then in any monotone solution there
is a threshold type q ⇤ such that capital is subsidized for all types q < q ⇤ and taxed for all non-
pooled types q > q ⇤ . In addition, tk (q ) is non-decreasing for all q < q ⇤ and all non-pooled q > q ⇤
if
(i) H depends on consumption differences and u000 (c) ≥ 0, or
(ii) H depends on utility differences and −u00 (c) /u0 (c)2 is non-increasing.

     The most delicate issue in this result concerns the qualifications regarding non-pooled
types. As we will see, these qualifications can be completely dispensed with in several
leading cases, including when H is a step function. In addition, note that the progres-
sivity result in (i) goes through under the additional assumption that u000 ≥ 0, which is a
necessary condition for non-increasing absolute or relative risk aversion. The assumption
in (ii) that −u00 (c) /u0 (c)2 is non-increasing is somewhat stronger than the assumption of
non-increasing absolute risk-aversion, which says that −u00 (c) /u0 (c) is non-increasing.
It is satisfied by CRRA utility with coefficient less than or equal to one, for example.
  14 It
      can also be easily shown that for any k > 0, there exists an a > 0 for which the assumption holds but
the full-commitment solution does not forestall reform, so that the no-refom constraint is binding.


                                                    17
    We analyze the case where H depends on consumption differences in the text, and
defer the case where H depends on utility differences to Appendix B. The analysis in the
two cases is similar.
    By the revelation principle (see Appendix C), the government’s problem is exactly
same as in Section 3, except that the credibility constraint is no longer

but rather the condition that there does not exist any consumption schedule ĉ2 : Q ! R
such that

                                               Z                         Z
                                                       ĉ2 (q ) dF          c2 (q ) dF − k,                 (11)

In words, this requires that there is no reform that the government prefers to the status
quo, that is resource feasible and that would defeat the status quo in terms of popular
support.15 This constraint is clearly equivalent to the value of the following deviation
                                                            R
program (DP), which we denote by VD (c2 ), being less than u (c2 (q )) dF.

subject to (11) and (12).
     As with the government’s problem in Section 3, non-convexity is an unavoidable fea-
ture of the deviation program under natural specifications of H, and hence its solution
ĉ2 (q ) may not be unique. Letting x (q ) ⌘ ĉ2 (q ) − c2 (q ), it is useful to rewrite (DP) as
                                                   Z
                                       max               u (c2 (q ) + x (q )) dF                             (14)
                                           x

subject to
  15 Given the convention from the previous section that the status quo is implemented when (12) is satisfied

with equality, the correct constraint here would involve a strict inequality in (12). However, whenever there
exists some ĉ2 that satisfies (11) and
                                           Z
                                               H (c2 (q ) , ĉ2 (q )) dF < a,                                (13)
            R
then supĉ2 u(ĉ2 (q ))dF s.t. (11) and (13) equals VD (c2 ) by continuity of F and H̃, so using the weak in-
equality in (12) does not make a difference. If on the other hand there does not exist any ĉ2 that satisfies (11)
and (13), then the no-reform constraint is not binding and the full commitment solution applies.


                                                               18

Observe that (DP) does not depend directly on heterogeneity in q, but only on the distri-
bution of c2 in the population.16 Let

                                    X (q ) ⌘ { x (q ) : x is a solution to (DP)} .

Using our general Lemma 2, we can collect the following results about solutions to (DP).
Lemma 4. (i) A solution to (DP) exists.
(ii) If c2 (q ) < c2 (q 0 ) then inf X (q ) ≥ sup X (q 0 ).
(iii) For any c2 -schedule and any c2 2 R, let Qc2 ⌘ {q : c2 (q ) = c2 }. Then for almost all c2 ,

   q 2Qc2 X ( q ) is a singleton.
                                                                   S
(iv) For every c2 2 R, there exists at most one s > 0 such that s 2 q 2Qc X (q ).
                                                                                       2

Proof. See Appendix A.5.

    In words, property (ii) shows that any solution x must be non-increasing in c2 , formal-
izing the intuition that, even though reforms are no longer necessarily fully equalizing,
they still reduce the inequality implied by c2 (since reform consumption is ĉ2 = c2 + x).
Properties (iii) and (iv) concern the uniqueness of x in terms of c2 , which are important
later on for establishing differentiability of VD (c2 ). Properties (i) to (iii) hold indepen-
dently from the shape of H̃. If H̃ is single-peaked at 0 (as we assume), then in addition
property (iv) shows that there can be at most one strictly positive value of x for any c2 .
    With these preliminary observations about the deviation program in hand, we con-
sider the following dual formulation of the government’s planning problem.17

(2) and (6). Using (7) to substitute out for c1 (q ), the planning problem becomes
          Z ✓                                                      ◆        Z

  16 Consequently, ratchet effects again do not arise here, as c2 is observable and the government cannot
gain from information about q revealed in period 1.
  17 The same variation as in footnote 3 shows that a solution to the primal must also solve the dual.

Let h ≥ 0 denote the multiplier on the constraint, so that, as in Section 3, h denotes the
multiplier on the relevant no-reform constraint.
  The following result characterizes optimal marginal capital taxes. It is the basis of our
main results on the progressivity of optimal capital taxes with strategic reforms.

Lemma 5. (i) In any solution c2 , for almost all q where X (q ) is single-valued, we have

             tk (q )       ⇥                                    ⇤
                       = Rh u0 (c2 (q ) + x (q )) − u0 (c2 (q )) , where X (q ) = { x (q )} .                    (18)
           1 − tk (q )

(ii) For almost all non-pooled types q, X (q ) is single-valued, so (18) holds.

Proof. (i) Suppose toward a contradiction that (18) fails on a positive measure set of types with single-
valued X (q ) for some optimal consumption schedule c2 . Then there exists either a positive measure set
Q0 on which tk (q ) /(1 − tk (q )) is less than the right-hand side of (18) (and X (q ) is single-valued for all
q 2 Q0 ), or a positive measure set Q00 on which tk (q )/(1 − tk (q )) exceeds it (and X (q ) is single-valued for
all q 2 Q00 ). Assume the first case applies; the argument for the second case is symmetric.
     Consider the variant consumption schedule c̃2 given by
                                                       (
                                                             c2 ( q )        for        q2/ Q0 ,
                                          c̃2 (q ) =

for t 2 R. Slightly abusing notation, for variants c̃2 of this form, let VD (t) be the corresponding value
function in (DP). Letting VD0 (0−) and VD0 (0+) denote the left- and right-derivative of VD (t) at t = 0,
respectively, Corollary 4 of Milgrom and Segal (2002) implies that VD0 (0−) and VD0 (0+) exist and satisfy
                                                                            Z
                               VD0 (0−)    =            inf                          u0 (c2 (q ) + x (q )) dF
                                                x that solve (DP)               Q0
                                                                            Z

                                                                                Q0
                                                x that solve (DP)


Since X (q ) is single-valued for all q 2 Q0 by hypothesis, the supremum and infimum must coincide, so
VD (t) is differentiable at t = 0 with
                                                           Z
                                            VD0 (0) =               u0 (c2 (q ) + x (q ))dF.

Together with the fact that Q0 has positive measure, this contradicts the initial hypothesis that

for all q 2 Q0 . Hence, no such set Q0 can exist.
      (ii) If (18) fails on a positive measure set of non-pooled agents for some optimal consumption schedule
c2 , there exists either a positive measure set Q0 on which tk (q ) /(1 − tk (q )) is less than the right-hand
side of (18) (and c2 (q ) is strictly increasing in q 2 Q0 ), or a positive measure set Q00 on which tk (q )/(1 −
tk (q )) exceeds it (and c2 (q ) is strictly increasing in q 2 Q00 ). Consider again the first case and recall that
[q:c2 (q )=c̄2 X (q ) is single-valued for almost all c̄2 , by Lemma 4 (iii). Since c2 (q ) is strictly increasing on Q0 ,
this implies that X (q ) is single-valued for almost all q 2 Q0 , so the argument from (i) can be applied.

   We discuss both the intuition for formula (18) and the requirement that X (q ) is single-
valued below. Before doing so, however, we apply Lemma 2 to show the existence of a
monotone solution (as in Section 3).

Lemma 6. There exists a solution to the government’s problem in which c2 (q ) is non-decreasing.

Proof. See Appendix A.6.

   In what follows, we restrict attention to such monotone solutions. They feature pro-
gressive marginal capital taxation in the following sense.

Proposition 4. In any monotone solution, there exists a threshold type q ⇤ such that capital is
subsidized (tk (q ) < 0) for all types with q < q ⇤ and capital is taxed (tk (q ) ≥ 0) for non-pooled
types with q > q ⇤ .

Proof. Let c2⇤ = inf {c2 : 9q such that c2 (q ) = c2 and x (q )  0 for some x (q ) 2 X (q )}, and let q ⇤ = inf{q :
c2 (q ) ≥ c2⇤ }. Note that if q satisfies equation (18) then

                                                            sign (tk (q )) = sign (− x (q )) .


                                                                            21
We will show that q satisfies (18) for (almost) all q < q ⇤ and non-pooled q > q ⇤ , and that x (q ) > 0 for
q < q ⇤ while x (q )  0 for non-pooled q > q ⇤ . This will complete the proof.
     If q < q ⇤ then c2 (q ) < c2⇤ and hence, by definition of c2⇤ , x (q ) > 0 for all x (q ) 2 X (q ). By Lemma 4 (iv),
for such types X (q ) is single-valued if H̃ 0 is single-peaked at 0. Hence by Lemma 5, such types satisfy (18).
In sum, types with q < q ⇤ satisfy (18) and x (q ) > 0.
     If q > q ⇤ is non-pooled then c2 (q ) > c2⇤ and therefore x (q )  0 for some x (q ) 2 X (q ), by definition of
c2⇤ and Lemma 4 (ii). By Lemma 5 (ii), for almost all non-pooled types X (q ) is a singleton and satisfies (18).
In sum, non-pooled types with q > q ⇤ satisfy (18) and x (q )  0.

    The intuition for Proposition 4 relies on the fact that the capital tax, given by equation
(18), is designed to make individuals of each type q internalize the effect of an additional
unit of their saving on the no-reform constraint. This involves comparing the effect on
period-2 welfare under the most tempting reform, given by u0 (c2 (q ) + x (q )), with the
effect on welfare under the status quo, u0 (c2 (q )). Since by Lemma 4 a reform will equalize
period-2 consumption relative to the status quo (i.e., x (q ) is decreasing), low q types
face x (q ) > 0, so their saving relaxes the no-reform constraint (as u0 (c2 (q ) + x (q )) <
u0 (c2 (q )) when x (q ) > 0), motivating the capital subsidy. In contrast, high q types face
x (q ) < 0, so their saving tightens the no-reform constraint, which makes it optimal for
them to face a capital tax.
    Note that this logic is independent from the shape of the function H̃; notably, it does
not depend on whether H̃ 0 is single-peaked or not.18 This is in contrast to our results
in Section 3, where the shape of H̃ is crucial for the U-shaped pattern of the intertem-
poral wedge. The reason for this difference is that, in Section 3, the key comparison
for determining the capital tax is between c2 (q ) and RK − k, which implies that agents
with intermediate c2 (q ) are “pivotal” when H̃ 0 is single-peaked, and are therefore sub-
sidized. In contrast, in the current section the key comparison is between u0 (c2 (q )) and
u0 (c2 (q ) + x (q )), so that agents with x (q ) > 0 are more sensitive to their period-2 con-
sumption under the status quo than under the reform—regardless of the shape of H̃—
which leads them to be subsidized (and x (q ) is decreasing regardless of the shape of H̃,
as for any status quo schedule c2 , the most tempting reform schedule is more egalitarian
than c2 ).
    In Appendix B, we show that a similar tradeoff determines the shape of tk when H̃
depends on differences in utility rather than consumption. In this case, both the gov-
ernment’s planning problem and deviation program can most conveniently be written in
dual utility space, where period 2 consumption utility u2 (q ) ⌘ u(c2 (q )) is chosen for each
  18 The only place where single-peakedness of    H̃ matters in this section so far is part (iv) of Lemma 4, which
says that X (q ) can have at most one positive element for almost all q. This in turn implies that formula (18)
applies for almost all q < q ⇤ without restricting to non-pooled types. Without this assumption, Proposition
4 would still hold for non-pooled types.

individual. The no-reform constraint can then be framed as requiring that the optimal de-
viation must be more costly in terms of resources than the status quo when achieving at
least the same level of welfare. Hence, the key tradeoff becomes F0 (u2 (q ) + x (q )) versus
F0 (u2 (q )), where F = u−1 and x (q ) = û2 (q ) − u2 (q ) (so that now x (q ) is reform mi-
nus status quo utility, rather than consumption). Since x (q ) will again be decreasing, the
same qualitative results apply in this model. Table 1 summarizes these key tradeoffs and
results.
   We also have the following stronger result about tax progressivity, which completes
the proof of Proposition 3 for the case where H̃ depends on consumption differences.

Proposition 5. In any monotone solution, the following hold.
(i) If u000 ≥ 0, then tk (q ) is non-decreasing on {q : q < q ⇤ }.
(ii) tk (q ) is non-decreasing on {q : q is non-pooled and q > q ⇤ }.

Proof. See Appendix A.7.

   To understand Proposition 5, note that, when formula (18) applies, tk (q ) is non-decrea-
sing in u0 (c2 (q ) + x (q )) − u0 (c2 (q )). Supposing for now that c2 and x are differentiable,
and omitting q arguments, the derivative of this difference with respect to q may be writ-
ten as either
                             � 00                    �
                              u (c2 + x ) − u00 (c2 ) c20 + u00 (c2 + x ) x 0                (19)

or
                                      u00 (ĉ2 ) ĉ20 − u00 (c2 ) c20 .                              (20)

If u000 ≥ 0, then the first way of writing the derivative shows that tk (q ) is non-decreasing
over types for which x (q ) ≥ 0, or equivalently types q < q ⇤ . The proof of Proposition 5
also shows that, if H̃ is single-peaked, then ĉ2 (q ) is non-increasing over non-pooled types
q > q ⇤ (in fact, ĉ2 is single-peaked overall), so the second way of writing the derivative—
combined with Lemma 6—shows that tk (q ) is also non-decreasing over these types.
    We close this section with a brief discussion of the caveats regarding pooled types in
Proposition 3, while providing the details in Appendix E. These caveats become irrele-
vant whenever (i) the set of solutions to the deviation program X (q ) is single-valued for

almost all q, or (ii) the government’s problem (17) is convex. As the following proposition
shows, these sufficient conditions are indeed satisfied in some natural cases in terms of
model fundamentals.

Proposition 6. Propositions 4 and 5 hold without the caveats regarding pooled types if either (i)
H̃ is a step function, or (ii) u is quadratic.

     A sketch of the proof is provided in Appendix E.19 For example, if H̃ is a step function,
then it may be shown that X (q ) is single-valued almost everywhere, and in particular that
it is flat at x [q ] = 0 for all q in an interval (ql , qh ) (corresponding to those types that are
indifferent between the status quo and the reform), and is decreasing on the intervals
(−•, ql ) and (qh , •) (in order to fully equalize final consumption under the reform for
types in those intervals).20 Figure 2 depicts the resulting shape of ĉ2 compared to c2 as well
as the intertemporal wedge tk . Even if the conditions in Proposition 6 are not satisfied,
  19 One might think that if u is quadratic then the comparative statics in Proposition 5 (i) would never

hold strictly, as that result assumes u000 ≥ 0. However, inspecting the proof reveals that there is slack in
this sufficient condition, and that in fact the comparative static holds strictly at any type q where x (q ) is
differentiable and non-constant, even if u000 = 0.
  20 Unlike in the equalizing reforms section, we do not need a separate result to cover the step function

case here, as the optimal tax formulas derived in this section do not assume that H̃ is differentiable.


                                                      24
however, we argue more generally in Appendix E that the caveats regarding pooled types
may be viewed as a technicality rather than an important feature of the model.


5     Discussion
In this section, we discuss how to numerically solve for the entire allocation in a quanti-
tative example, how to implement the optimal allocation with taxes, how the predicted
patterns of capital taxes relate to effective capital taxes in practice, how our results extend
to more general versions of the government’s objective function, and how to move from
two periods to overlapping generations.


5.1   Labor Wedge and Numerical Illustration
This paper focuses on qualitative properties of the implicit marginal capital tax (3). We
consider it a strength of the model that it allows for sharp results on this margin, despite
the complexity of characterizing the entire optimal allocation (which is a standard feature
of Mirrlees models). Nonetheless, it is interesting to compute the full optimal allocation
numerically in an example. This gives some feel for the quantitative implications of the
political economy constraints we consider, and also demonstrates that adding these con-
straints does not make the model intractable numerically.
    We first show how to compute the intratemporal labor wedge, defined as

                                                         h y ( y ( q ), q )
                                       tl (q ) ⌘ 1 −                        ,                       (21)

where hy denotes the partial derivative of the disutility function h with respect to y. In
particular, and specializing to the standard case with h(y, q ) = h(y/q ), it is straightfor-
ward to show that—both in the models with equalizing reforms from Section 3 and with
strategic reforms in Section 4—the implicit labor income tax (21) has to satisfy

is the multiplier on the resource constraint (1).21
    The key observation here is that formula (22) is exactly the same as in a static Mirrlees
model (see Mirrlees, 1971, or Saez, 2001, for standard interpretations), as well as in our
two-period model when there is full commitment (since (22) is completely independent
of the form of the political support constraint). In this sense, the labor tax schedule is
affected by our political economy constraint only indirectly through the c1 (q )-schedule on
the right-hand side of (22). This justifies our focus on the intertemporal wedge (3) as the
key margin of interest, and demonstrates that introducing political economy constraints
does not make the model less tractable along the intratemporal dimension.
    Formula (22), together with our characterization of the capital wedge, also allows
us to numerically compute the entire optimal allocation (c1 (q ), c2 (q ), y(q )) for a cali-
brated version of our model. We illustrate this using the equalizing reforms model from
Section 3. We consider iso-elastic preferences of the form u(c) = c1−s /(1 − s) and
h(l ) = yl 1+1/# /(1 + 1/#) where l = y/q, so that the Frisch elasticity of labor supply is
constant and given by #. s is set to be 0.9, which is close to the standard log-specification
and ensures that utility is bounded below, and we set # = 1, consistent with the evidence
in Kimball and Shapiro (2010) and Erosa, Fuster and Kambourov (2011). We interpret a
model period as T = 10 years and accordingly set b = 0.9510 (so the annual discount fac-
tor is 0.95) and R = 1/b (so the optimum under full commitment involves consumption
smoothing with c1 (q ) = c2 (q )).
    For the skill distribution F, we follow Mankiw, Weinzierl and Yagan (2009) who fit
a lognormal distribution to the empirical wage distribution from the 2007 Current Pop-
ulation Survey and append a Pareto distribution for the upper tail of wages to obtain
asymptotic marginal tax rates as in Saez (2001). We extend their numerical procedure
for a static Mirrlees model to our dynamic setting in order to compute both tl (q ) and
tk (q ) and follow them in setting the scaling factor for the disutility of labor y = 2.55.
We perform our simulations for k = 0 and assume that the distribution of taste shocks
H depends on consumption differences and is given by a normal cdf with mean 0 and
standard deviation 2.5 (corresponding to just under 20% of mean consumption).
    The left panel in Figure 3 shows the resulting optimal labor income tax rates (for wages
up to $100/hour) both under full commitment (a = 0) and when the political economy
  21 Bunching does not occur whenever the (global) incentive constraints (2) can be replaced by the local
incentive constraints V 0 (q ) = hq (y(q ), q ) 8q, where

                            V (q ) ⌘ max u(c1 (q 0 )) + bu(c2 (q 0 )) − h(y(q 0 ), q ),
                                       q0

and the monotonicity constraint—requiring that y(q ) is non-decreasing—is not binding. This can be easily
checked numerically as in the example we provide below.

constraint (4) binds (in which case we assume majority voting with a = 50%). The right
panel shows the optimal annualized marginal capital tax rate t̃k (q ) on the net return to
saving for the case where the political support constraint binds with a = 50% (the op-
timal capital tax under full commitment is zero).22 As can be seems from the graphs,
the labor tax schedules are very similar under full commitment and limited commitment,
confirming that the key effects of the political economy constraint are on the intertempo-
ral margin. Both schedules exhibit the typical U-shaped pattern emphasized in Diamond
(1998) and Saez (2001), which is driven by the phase-out of the lump-sum transfer for low
wages and by convergence to the asymptotic marginal tax rate due to the Pareto tail for
high wages. The right panel demonstrates the U-shaped pattern for the capital tax rate
emphasized here and predicted by Corollary 1. In particular, capital tax rates are nega-
tive for intermediate wages between $15 and $30 per hour and positive otherwise (and of
sizable absolute amounts).
    The intuition for this pattern is illustrated in Figure 4. The left panel shows consump-
tion in both periods. While c1 and c2 coincide under full commitment (as shown by the
red line for a = 0), they are distorted when the threat of reform is binding. In partic-
ular, the capital subsidy increases c2 (the green line) for intermediate wages in order to
increase political support for the status quo to 50% of the population (from 39% under the

full commitment solution). Of course, this must lead to an aggregate welfare loss, which
here is equivalent to a 1.5% consumption drop for everyone in both periods compared
to the full commitment solution. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in how
this welfare loss is distributed across the population. In fact, as shown in the right panel,
intermediate types with hourly wages between between $15 and $40 benefit from the
presence of the political support constraint, whereas all other types lose. This illustrates
how our model can generate a pattern of redistribution where the middle class actually
benefits from political economy constraints—rather than just having their consumption
backloaded—consistent with Director’s law.


5.2                        Tax Implementation
Our analysis so far has implicitly considered direct mechanisms, where the government
allocates c1 (q ), c2 (q ) and y(q ) conditional on individual reports about q, taking into ac-
count technological, incentive compatibility and political credibility constraints. It is
straightforward to show that these allocations can alternatively, and more realistically,
be implemented through a tax system where each individual is confronted with the same
budget set and picks her preferred allocation within this set. In particular, with a non-
linear labor income tax Ty and a non-linear capital income tax Tk , individuals are faced
with the budget constraint c1 + k  y − Ty (y) in period 1 and c2  Rk − Tk ( Rk ) in period 2
and choose c1 , c2 , y, k to maximize u(c1 ) + bu(c2 ) − h(y, q ) subject to these two constraints.
    By Proposition 3 in Farhi et al. (2012), any incentive compatible allocation (c1 (q ), c2 (q ),


                                                                            28
y(q )) that is non-decreasing in q can be implemented using such a tax system. Since
we show that c2 (q ) is always non-decreasing in an optimal allocation and y(q ) is non-
decreasing by incentive compatibility, their result can be applied to our framework.23
Moreover, the first-order conditions from the above utility-maximization problem imply

                                u0 (c1 (q )) = bR(1 − Tk0 ( Rk (q )))u0 (c2 (q ))

for all q whenever Tk is differentiable, so the wedge tk (q ) defined in (3) and character-
ized throughout this paper coincides with the actual marginal capital income tax rate
Tk0 ( Rk(q )) faced by individuals of type q in this implementation.24


5.3     Relation to Capital Taxes in Practice
Our results make clear-cut predictions about the shape of marginal capital taxes depend-
ing on the ability of governments to commit and the dynamics of political constraints.
While our model is admittedly stylized and the level and progressivity of effective capital
taxes in advanced economies are hard to measure, it is worth pointing out the consistency
between our results and the patterns observed in practice.
   First, as also noted by Farhi et al. (2012), policies such as income, estate, and wealth
taxes, as well as the tax treatment of retirement accounts and subsidies to savings and
education by the poor and middle class, contribute to the progressivity of capital taxa-
tion. However, it is plausible that overall capital taxes are U-shaped in many countries
once means-tested government benefits are accounted for. For example, in the US, only
individuals with sufficiently few assets qualify for Medicaid or Federal Student Aid, and
only individuals with sufficiently low investment income qualify for the Earned Income
Tax Credit. These asset tests can lead to very high effective savings distortions for the
poor. More generally, the contribution to capital tax progressivity of subsidies to savings
and education by the poor are at least partially offset by the phase-out of these subsidies,
unless eligibility is solely determined by labor income.
   In addition, some of these programs are targeted more directly at middle-class voters
than the very poor. Examples include subsidies to college education, many retirement
savings programs (where the subsidy is increasing in the marginal income tax rate up to
some caps) and the mortgage interest deduction, which subsidizes the accumulation of
  23 The   statement of Proposition 3 in Farhi et al. (2012) also requires c1 (q ) to be non-decreasing, which
holds at the optimum in their framework but may or may not hold in our model. However, inspecting their
proof reveals that this condition is in fact not needed for the result.
  24 If T ( Rk ( q )) is not differentiable because there is pooling at consumption level c ( q ) (so T has a convex
         k                                                                                 2           k
kink), tk (q ) is still bounded between the (well-defined) left- and right-derivatives of Tk .


                                                        29
housing wealth. Finally, Doepke and Schneider (2006) show that the inflation tax effec-
tively redistributes from rich, bond-holding households to middle class households with
fixed-rate mortgage debt, consistent with the prediction of U-shaped capital taxes.


5.4   General Objective Function
Our maintained assumption that the government is utilitarian can be relaxed substan-
tially. This is shown in Appendix D, where we relax the utilitarian assumption in two
ways. First, we let the government use general Pareto weights G to evaluate welfare,
which can differ from the population distribution F. Second, we let individuals differ
along a second dimension r in addition to q, where r is observable to the government
and enters into the government’s Pareto weights, but is otherwise payoff-irrelevant. This
second dimension of heterogeneity allows for a government that is “non-benevolent,” in
that it favors certain groups in society over others: for example, r could capture an indi-
vidual’s race, ethnicity, or other minority status, her age, her geographic region of origin,
or any other observable marker of membership in some group that the government may
favor or disfavor. We show that our main results go through within each group r if the
government’s redistributive preferences are at least as inequity averse as the utilitarian
criterion would imply. Formally, if g(q, r) is the density corresponding to the Pareto
weights G over the two dimensions of heterogeneity, then our main results go through
whenever g(q, r)/ f (q, r) is decreasing in q, holding r fixed, where f is the joint density
corresponding to F.
    For example, this implies that—perhaps somewhat surprisingly—the U-shaped pat-
tern of marginal capital taxes from the first version of our model emerges even if the
government puts very high weight on low-q types, as with a Rawlsian objective.


5.5   Overlapping Generations
It is straightforward to extend the two-period model here to an infinite-horizon overlap-
ping generations (OLG) setting, as for instance in Farhi et al. (2012). This would allow us
to endogenize the cost of reform k as a “reputational” cost borne by the government when
it deviates by reforming its proposed policy. In particular, consider an OLG-version of our
model where individuals of each generation live for two periods. Suppose that whenever
a reform occurs, play reverts to the worst continuation equilibrium for the government.
This worst continuation equilibrium is the one where no further production takes place,
and the government fully equalizes future consumption, spending down the remaining



                                             30
capital stock optimally. In such “grim trigger” equilibria, the results from our two-period
model, both from Sections 3 and 4, would continue to hold.
  One technicality here is that, unlike in Farhi et al. (2012), grim trigger equilibria would
not necessarily be the best equilibria overall from the perspective of the government in an
OLG version of our model. To see this, note that an optimal equilibrium for the govern-
ment is one in which it is punished as harshly as possible for any deviation. In grim trig-
ger equilibria, the government gets its lowest possible continuation payoff (correspond-
ing to full equalization) starting in period t + 1 after a deviation in period t, but in period
t voters approve the proposed reform if it is myopically optimal for them to do so. In
general, it might be possible to punish the government more harshly by specifying that
continuation play after a deviant reform proposal that is myopically appealing to voters is
such that the reform is not approved, while continuation play is something other than full
equalization (for example, continuation play might specify that the government rewards
“pivotal” voters in the future if they do not support a deviant reform today).25 Note that
this issue would go away if, for example, we assumed that only the old generation votes,
which is a relatively common assumption in OLG models of political economy (Glomm
and Ravikumar, 1992, Saint-Paul and Verdier, 1997, Benabou, 2000).


6      Conclusion
This paper has studied dynamic non-linear taxation under the assumption that a pol-
icy is credible if it maintains the support of a large enough political coalition over time.
Optimal taxes in this setting differ starkly from those in settings where the government
can fully commit to policy, or where it can always change policy at a fixed cost. Rather
than predicting zero capital taxes (as in the full commitment case) or purely progres-
sive capital taxes (as in Farhi et al., 2012), the simplest version of our model (which is
still a generalization of both the full commitment case and the baseline model of Farhi
et al.) predicts U-shaped capital taxes, so that saving is subsidized for the middle class
but taxed for the poor and rich, recalling Director’s law of redistribution (Stigler, 1970).
In a more complicated version of the model where the government can engage in sophis-
ticated vote-buying schemes, we instead find that purely progressive capital taxation is
optimal. These versions of the model can be interpreted as capturing varying degrees of
government commitment at the reform stage, as for instance resulting from more direct
    25 Such a punishment might be harsher than grim trigger because it gives a lower instantaneous payoff for

the government, even though it also gives a higher continuation payoff (note that there is no contradiction
with the results of Abreu (1988) and others here, as the current model is not a repeated game).

versus indirect forms of democracy. More generally, our analysis suggests that the na-
ture of potential political reforms is an important determinant of the progressivity and
middle-class bias of capital taxes, and of redistribution more broadly.

and therefore that the same holds for every measurable set of allocations A ✓ R. Since t is constant on Q0 ,
this implies that replacing P with a on Q0 does not affect the objective or the constraints of the program.
Therefore, performing this replacement on all intervals on which t is constant yields a deterministic and
monotone solution.

We relax the government’s problem by allowing randomized consumption schedules, and show that there
exists a deterministic solution to the relaxed problem with c2 (q ) non-decreasing. This implies that there
exists a solution to the original problem with c2 (q ) non-decreasing.
     Formally, allow the government to choose, for each q 2 Q, a distribution P (q ) over consumption levels
(c1 (q ) , c2 (q )) such that P (q ) is right-continuous in the weak topology and U (q ) = u (c1 (q )) + bu (c2 (q ))
is constant for all (c1 (q ) , c2 (q )) 2 supp P (q ). Rewrite the dual problem as

Our assumptions ensure that a solution to this problem exists because the objective is continuous and the

Note that u−1 (U (q ) − bu (c2 (q ))) has strictly decreasing differences in U (q ) and c2 (q ) by strict concavity
of u, and that U (q ) is right-continuous and is non-decreasing by the incentive-compatibility constraint (2).

be greater than H̃ 0 (c2 (q 0 ) − RK + k ) dF for some values of q and less than H̃ 0 (c2 (q 0 ) − RK + k ) dF for
others,26 so tk (q ) is negative for some individuals (who must be those with intermediate q) and positive
for others.
     The argument when H depends on utility differences is identical, except that now

                                H1 (c2 (q ) , RK − k ) = H̃ 0 (u (c2 (q )) − u ( RK − k )) u0 (c2 (q ))

If c2 (q ) 6= RK − k, then differentiating under the integral with respect to c2 (q ) yields first-order condition

                                                                  tk (q )

Hence, in any solution either (25) holds or c2 (q ) = RK − k. Furthermore, in any monotone solution, the set
of types q with c2 (q ) = RK − k forms an interval [ql , qh ], so it remains only to show that marginal capital
taxes are non-decreasing on [ql , qh ] and (if c2 is non-constant) satisfy tk (q ) /(1 − tk (q ))  Rµ on [ql , qh ].
The former statement follows immediately from the fact that U (q ) is non-decreasing on [ql , qh ] and (3). For
                                                                 �            �

U (q ) is non-constant then c2 (q ) must be non-constant by (10).

Rµ̃ for all q 2 Q0 , and hence for all q such that c2 (q ) = RK − k. Finally, since c2 = c2⇤ at a solution to the
subproblem and y (q ) = 0 for all q such that c2 (q ) > RK − k, we have

                              tk (q )
                                        = Rµ̃ = Rµ for all q such that c2 (q ) > RK − k.
                            1 − tk (q )

As such a type q exists whenever c2 is non-constant (by (9) and k ≥ 0), we may conclude that µ̃ = µ and
hence that tk (q ) /(1 − tk (q ))  Rµ for all q such that c2 (q ) = RK − k.


A.5      Proof of Lemma 4
(i) follows from the fact that the objective (14) is continuous and the constraint set defined by (15) and (16)
is closed (by continuity of H̃ and F) and can be bounded by the Inada conditions on u. (ii) follows from
Lemma 2 (i’) because u (c2 (q ) + x ) has strictly decreasing differences in c2 (q ) and x, due to the concavity
                                    S                                  S
of u. For (iii), let x̄ (c̄2 ) = sup q 2Qc̄ X (q ) and x (c̄2 ) = inf q 2Qc̄ X (q ). It follows from (ii) that x̄ and x
                                           2                                  2
are monotone, and thus continuous for almost all c̄2 , and also that x̄ (c̄2 ) = x (c̄2 ) whenever x̄ and x are
                                                                       S
continuous at c̄2 . Hence, x̄ (c̄2 ) = x (c̄2 ) for almost all c̄2 , so q 2Qc̄ X (q ) is single-valued for almost all c̄2 .
                                                                              2
Finally, to see (iv), note that a necessary condition for x (q ) 2 X (q ) is that

                                      −u0 (c2 (q ) + x (q )) + l = µ H̃ 0 (− x (q )) ,                                (28)

where l ≥ 0 and µ ≥ 0 are the multipliers on (15) and (16). Since the left-hand side of (28) is strictly
increasing in x (q ) whereas the right-hand side is weakly decreasing in x (q ) for x (q ) > 0 when H̃ 0 is single-
peaked at 0, there can be at most one solution with x (q ) > 0.


A.6      Proof of Lemma 6
                         R                                           R                R
Note that the constraint u(c2 (q ))dF ≥ VD (c2 ) can be written as u(c2 (q ))dF ≥ u(c2 (q ) + x (q ))dF for
all x 2 X, where X is the set of all x-schedules that satisfy (15) and (16). The constraint set therefore takes
the same form as (C’) in Lemma 2, so the result follows from Lemma 2 (ii) by exactly the same argument as
in Lemma 3.



                                                               39
A.7      Proof of Proposition 5
Note that if (almost) all q in a set Q0 ✓ Q satisfy (18), then tk (q ) is (almost everywhere) non-decreasing on
Q0 if and only if u0 (ĉ2 (q )) − u0 (c2 (q )) is (almost everywhere) non-decreasing.
     For the first part, recall that types q < q ⇤ satisfy (18) as well as x (q ) > 0. If u0 (c2 (q ) + x (q )) − u0 (c2 (q ))
is differentiable at q, then (omitting the q-arguments) its derivative equals (19). Note that c20 (q ) ≥ 0 by
Lemma 6 and x 0 (q )  0 by Lemma 4 (i), so if x (q ) > 0 and u000 ≥ 0 then (19) is non-negative. In addition,
if u0 (c2 (q ) + x (q )) − u0 (c2 (q )) is discontinuous at q, then either c2 (q ) jumps up or x (q ) jumps down,
and when x (q ) > 0 and u000 ≥ 0 either of these jumps increases u0 (c2 (q ) + x (q )) − u0 (c2 (q )). Hence,
u0 (c2 (q ) + x (q )) − u0 (c2 (q )) is non-decreasing on {q : q < q ⇤ }.
     For the second part, we first claim that ĉ2 (q ) is non-increasing on Q0 = {q : c2 (q ) > c2⇤ and q > q ⇤ }
(which is a superset of {q : q is non-pooled and q > q ⇤ }). To see this, write (DP) as

Fix a solution ĉ2⇤ : Q ! R. Let

Then a necessary condition for optimality is that the restriction of ĉ2⇤ to Q0 solves the subproblem

If c2 (q ) > c2⇤ then c2 (q ) ≥ ĉ2⇤ (q ) for every solution to (DP), by the definition of c2⇤ and Lemma 4 (ii). Hence,
a necessary condition for optimality is that ĉ2⇤ still solves the above subproblem when ĉ2 is restricted to
satisfy c2 (q ) ≥ ĉ2 (q ) for all q 2 Q0 . Now, since H̃ 0 is single-peaked at 0, the objective in this subproblem
has strictly increasing differences in c2 (q ) and ĉ2 (q ) over this range, while c2 (q ) does not enter in the
  27 This dual approach to (DP) is valid whenever the no-reform constraint in the government’s problem is
binding: if theR value of this dual program is less than a, then varying ĉ2 toward more equal consumption
will increase u (ĉ2 (q )) dF without violating the resource constraint and will still receive enough support
relative to the status quo.



                                                                             40

constraints except through the constant u(c2 (q ))dF, so Lemma 2 (i) implies that at every solution ĉ2 (q ) is
non-increasing in c2 (q ), and hence in q.
     Finally, note that if u0 (ĉ2 (q )) − u0 (c2 (q )) is differentiable at q, then (omitting the q-arguments) its
derivative equals (20). Thus, if c2 is non-decreasing and ĉ2 is non-increasing, (20) is non-negative. If
u0 (ĉ2 (q )) − u0 (c2 (q )) is discontinuous at q, then either c2 (q ) jumps up or ĉ2 (q ) jumps down, and ei-
ther or these jumps increases u0 (ĉ2 (q )) − u0 (c2 (q )). Hence, u0 (ĉ2 (q )) − u0 (c2 (q )) is non-decreasing on
{q : c2 (q ) > c2⇤ and q > q ⇤ }. Finally, non-pooled types satisfy (18), so tk (q ) is non-decreasing on
{q : q is non-pooled, c2 (q ) > c2⇤ , and q > q ⇤ } = {q : q is non-pooled and q > q ⇤ }.

                                                                                                              R
This constraint is equivalent to the value of the following deviation program being less than                     u (c2 (q )) dF.
                                                                  Z
                                                        max           u (ĉ2 (q )) dF
                                                        ĉ2


subject to (29) and (30). Letting x (q ) = u (ĉ2 (q )) − u (c2 (q )), F = u−1 , and ut (q ) = u(ct (q )), this is in turn
equivalent to the value of the following dual program, which we denote by R D (u2 ), being greater than
R
  F(u2 (q ))dF − k.                               Z
                                              min             F (u2 (q ) + x (q )) dF

subject to

                                                                      x (q )dF   ≥ 0,

This deviation program—which we denote by (DP’)—is framed in utility space, while the deviation pro-
gram (DP) in the text is framed in consumption space. The key feature which makes (DP’) tractable is that
the status quo utility schedule u2 does not enter the constraints, just as the status quo consumption schedule
c2 does not enter the constraints in (DP).
    Denote the set of possible solutions to (DP’) at each q by

                                      X (q ) ⌘ { x (q ) : x is a solution to (DP’)}.

The next lemma, which parallels Lemma 4 in the text, again collects properties of these solutions:


                                                                        41
Lemma 7. (i) A solution exists.
(ii) If u2 (q ) < u2 (q 0 ) then inf X (q ) ≥ sup X (q 0 ).
                                                                                               S
(iii) For any u2 -schedule and any u2 , let Qu2 ⌘ {q : u2 (q ) = u2 }. Then for almost all u2 , q 2Qu X (q ) is singleton.
                                                                       S                             2
(iv) For every u2 2 R, there exists at most one s > 0 such that s 2 q 2Qu X (q ).
                                                                                        2


Proof. Noting that the objective has strictly increasing differences in u2 and x by convexity of F, the proof
is analogous to the proof of Lemma 4.

    We can now write the government’s planning problem as follows.
                   Z ✓                                                     ◆                   Z
                                                     1
         min             F (U (q ) − bu2 (q )) +       F (u2 (q )) − y (q ) dF s.t. R D (u2 ) ≥ F (u2 (q )) dF − k,
         U,u2 ,y                                     R

subject to                                       Z
                                                     (U (q ) − h (y (q ) , q )) dF ≥ V,
                                                                      � �     � � � �
                                          U (q ) − h (y (q ) , q ) ≥ U q 0 − h y q 0 , q .

Since the constraints of this program only depend on U and y, u2 must solve
                                  Z                                                 Z
                            min       (F (U (q ) − bu2 (q ))) dF s.t. R D (u2 ) ≥           F (u2 (q )) dF − k.              (31)
                             u2


Using this, we can reproduce Lemma 5, denoting by h ≥ 0 the multiplier on the constraint in (31).

Lemma 8. (i) In any solution u2 , for almost all q where X (q ) is single-valued, we have

                       tk (q )       ⇥                                      ⇤
                                 = Rh 1 − F0 (u2 (q ) + x (q ))/F0 (u2 (q )) where X (q ) = { x (q )} .                      (32)
                     1 − tk (q )

(ii) For almost all non-pooled q (i.e. q such that u2 (q ) 6= u2 (q 0 ) for all q 0 6= q), X (q ) is single-valued, so (32) holds.

    The proof is analogous to the proof of Lemma 5. Next, note that Lemma 6 goes through because
F (U (q ) − bu2 (q )) has strictly decreasing differences in U (q ) and u2 (q ), so there exists a solution in which
u2 is non-decreasing. This immediately leads to the following result reproducing Proposition 4.

Proposition 7. In any monotone solution, there exists a threshold type q ⇤ such that capital is subsidized for agents
with q < q ⇤ and capital is taxed for all non-pooled agents with q > q ⇤ .

Proof. Analogous to the proof of Proposition 4, using Lemmas 7 and 8 in place of Lemmas 4 and 5. The
basic idea is that, as in the case where H̃ depends on consumption differences, sign (tk (q )) = sign (− x (q ))
whenever q satisfies (32), and x (q ) is non-increasing whenever X (q ) is a singleton.

    We can also reproduce Proposition 5 if the condition that u000 ≥ 0 is strengthened to non-increasing
−u00(c) /u0 (c)2 .

Proposition 8. In a monotone solution, the following hold.
(i) If −u00 (c) /u0 (c)2 is non-increasing, then tk (q ) is non-decreasing on {q : q < q ⇤ }.
(ii) tk (q ) is non-decreasing on {q : q is non-pooled and q > q ⇤ }.



                                                                  42
Proof. For simplicity, we prove the proposition under the additional hypothesis that the functions u2 and x
are differentiable. This hypothesis can be dispensed with as in the proof of Proposition 5.
    Note that tk (q ) is non-decreasing if (32) is satisfied and F0 (u2 (q ) + x (q )) /F0 (u2 (q )) is non-increasing.
    For the first part, this holds whenever (omitting q-arguments)
                                                 �         �
                           F0 (u2 ) F00 (u2 + x ) u20 + x 0 − F0 (u2 + x ) F00 (u2 ) u20  0,                     (33)

or
                                       F00 (u2 + x ) � 0      � F00 (u2 ) 0
                                                      u2 + x 0  0       u .
                                       F ( u2 + x )
                                         0                      F ( u2 ) 2
As x 0  0 by Lemma 7, a sufficient condition for this is

                                               F00 (u2 + x )  F00 (u )
                                                              0 2 ,
                                               F ( u2 + x )
                                                 0            F ( u2 )

or, since x ≥ 0 for q < q ⇤ , F00 (u2 ) /F0 (u2 ) non-increasing. This is easily seen to be equivalent to −u00 (c) /u0 (c)2
being non-increasing.
     For the second part, we first argue that û2 (q ) = u2 (q ) + x (q ) is non-increasing for q > q ⇤ . To see this,
write the deviation program (DP’) as
                                                    Z
                                             min        H̃ (u2 (q ) − û2 (q )) dF
                                              û2


subject to
                                         Z
                                             F (û2 (q )) dF          RK − k,
                                               Z                       Z
                                                     û2 (q )dF    ≥       u2 (q )dF,

and apply the same argument (using Lemma 2) as in the proof of Proposition 5, which implies that every
solution û2 (q ) is non-increasing in u2 (q ), and hence in q, for q > q ⇤ . Finally, rewrite (33) as

                                   F0 (u2 ) F00 (û2 ) û20 − F0 (û2 ) F00 (u2 ) u20  0.

Since F0 ≥ 0, F00 ≥ 0, û20  0 and u20 ≥ 0, this is satisfied.



C      Appendix: Revelation Principle
This section formulates the model as a game between the individuals and the government, and establishes
the relevant version of the revelation principle. Individuals’ and the government’s preferences are as in the
text. The game is as follows.
                                                      �     �
     First, the government proposes a tax schedule Ty , Tk . A tax schedule is required to satisfy the re-
source constraint whatever production decisions individuals make. Formally, let G be the set of probability
distributions on R + , corresponding to possible distributions of output or capital. A labor tax schedule Ty
is a map from R + ⇥ G !R such that          Z
                                                             Ty (y, G ) dG ≥ 0
                                                    y 2R +


                                                                43
for all G 2 G . A capital tax schedule Tk is a map from R + ⇥ G !R such that
                                                    Z
                                                                  Tk ( Rk, G ) dG ≥ 0
                                                        k 2R +

for all G 2 G .
    Second, individuals produce, pay labor taxes, and consume in period 1. More specifically, this part of
the game resolves as follows:

   1. Individuals simultaneously choose production y.

   2. Given the resulting distribution of output G y , an individual who produced y pays labor tax Ty (y, G y ).
                                                                                               ⇥                 ⇤
   3. An individual with after-tax income y − Ty (y, G y ) chooses period-1 consumption c1 2 0, y − Ty (y, G y ) .
      This leaves her with capital k ⌘ y − Ty (y, G y ) − c1 ≥ 0. Denote the resulting distribution of capital
      by G k .
                                                                                      ⇣      ⌘
   Third, the government either implements the status quo capital tax schedule Tk ·, G k or implements
a reform capital tax schedule T̃k : R + ! R such that
                                                     Z
                                                                  T̃k ( Rk ) dG k ≥ k,                    (34)
                                                         k 2R +


where k ≥ 0 is the resource cost of a reform. (Note that G k is determined before the reform schedule,
so there is no need to let T̃k depend on the distribution of capital.) If the status quo⇣tax schedule
                                                                                                 ⌘    is im-
                                                                                               k
plemented, an individual with capital k receives period-2 consumption c2 = Rk − Tk Rk, G . If reform
schedule T̃k is implemented, an individual with capital k receives period-2 consumption c2 = Rk − T̃k ( Rk).
    To complete the description of the game, it remains only to determine which capital tax schedule is
implemented. This depends on the version of the model under consideration.
    In the equalizing reforms model, the reform schedule is given by

                                                     T̃k ( Rk) = Rk − RK + k,

where                                                                 Z
                                                              K=              kdG k .
                                                                          k

(Note that under this schedule, an individual with capital k receives period-2 consumption c2 = Rk −
( Rk − RK + k ) = RK − k.) The status quo schedule is implemented if
                                      Z        ⇣       ⇣       ⌘        ⌘
                                              H Rk − Tk Rk, G k , RK − k dG k ≥ a.
                                          k

Otherwise, the reform schedule is implemented.
   In the strategic reforms model, define the deviation program by
                                                            Z      �              �

                                                T̃k :R + !R k


subject to (34) and           Z        ⇣       ⇣       ⌘                ⌘
                                      H Rk − Tk Rk, G k , Rk − T̃k ( Rk) dG k  a.
                                  k


                                                                      44
If the value of the deviation program is not more than
                                          Z        ⇣       ⇣       ⌘⌘
                                                  u Rk − Tk Rk, G k dG k ,
                                              k

then the status quo schedule is implemented. Otherwise, an arbitrary reform schedule is implemented
among those that solve the deviation program.
      A (symmetric, pure strategy, subgame perfect) equilibrium then consists of a proposed tax schedule
�        �
  Ty , Tk and production and consumption strategies

                                                  Y   :   Ty ⇥ Tk ⇥ Q ! y,
                                                  C   :   T y ⇥ T k ⇥ Q ! c1 ,

(where Ty and Tk are the sets of possible tax schedules Ty and Tk , respectively), such that:
        �      �
   1.  Ty , Tk maximizes the government’s payoff given (Y, C ).
                                                              �         �

    In the text, attention is restricted to feasible, incentive-compatible direct mechanisms that satisfy the
appropriate no-reform constraint. This approach is justified by the following result. Recall that the no-
reform constraint in the equalizing reforms model is
                                          Z
                                                  H (c2 (q ) , RK − k ) dF ≥ a,
                                              q

while the no-reform constraint in the strategic reforms model is that the value of the deviation program
defined in the text does not exceed the value of the status quo.



                                                              45
Proposition 9 (Revelation Principle). In the equalizing reforms model, under Assumption 1, every implementable
allocation is feasible, incentive-compatible and satisfies the no-reform constraint. In the strategic reforms model,
under Assumption 2, every optimal allocation is feasible, incentive-compatible and satisfies the no-reform constraint.

     Note that the converse also holds for monotone allocations, as shown in Section 5.2 (building on Propo-
sition 3 of Farhi et al., 2012).

Proof. Showing that any implementable allocation is feasible is a simple accounting exercise. Any imple-
mentable allocation is incentive-compatible as a direct mechanism, by the usual revelation principle argu-
ment (whether or not the allocation is optimal, and whether or not it is implemented in an equilibrium in
which a reform occurs): a unilateral deviation does not affect G y or G k , and hence does not affect the tax
schedules faced by the deviator, so if y (q ) and c1 (q ) are the optimal production and period-1 consumption
choices of a type q individual given others’ behavior, then in particular she prefers (c1 (q ) , c2 (q ) , y (q )) to
(c1 (q 0 ) , c2 (q 0 ) , y (q 0 )) for all q 0 2 Q. Thus, it suffices to show that every implementable (resp., optimal)
allocation satisfies the no-reform constraint when viewed as a direct mechanism in the equalizing reforms
model under Assumption 1 (resp., in the strategic reforms model under Assumption 2).
     For the equalizing reforms case, if an allocation is implemented in an equilibrium in which no reform
occurs, then it satisfies the no-reform constraint when viewed as a direct mechanism, as the condition for no
reform to occur in equilibrium is precisely the no-reform constraint for the corresponding direct mechanism.
In addition, if an allocation (c1 , c2 , y) is implemented in an equilibrium in which reform does occur, then c2
is constant. Therefore, (c1 , c2 , y) satisfies the no-reform constraint when viewed as a direct mechanism, as
                                              Z
                                                      H ( RK, RK − k ) dF ≥ a
                                                  q

for all K ≥ 0, by Assumption 1.
     For the strategic reforms case, let (c1 (q ) , c2 (q ) , y (q )) be a monotone solution to the government’s
problem, which exists by Lemma 5 in the text. As is shown in Section 5.2 (using Proposition 3 of Farhi et
al., 2012), (c1 (q ) , c2 (q ) , y (q )) is implementable in an equilibrium in which no reform occurs. In addition,
by Assumption 2, the government’s payoff under (c1 (q ) , c2 (q ) , y (q )) is greater than its payoff under any
allocation that is implementable in an equilibrium in which a reform occurs. As every optimal allocation
must give the government at least as high a payoff as does (c1 (q ) , c2 (q ) , y (q )) (since (c1 (q ) , c2 (q ) , y (q ))
is implementable), it follows that every optimal allocation is implementable in an equilibrium in which no
reform occurs. Finally, as we have seen, such an allocation necessarily satisfies the no-reform constraint
when viewed as a direct mechanism.



D       Appendix: General Welfare Weights
  In this appendix, we discuss situations where the government uses general Pareto weights G to evaluate
welfare, which could be different from the population distribution F. Moreover, we allow the govern-
ment’s Pareto weights to depend not only on q, but also on a second dimension of heterogeneity r, which
is assumed to be payoff-irrelevant and observable to the government. As discussed in the text, this second
dimension of heterogeneity allows for a government that is “non-benevolent.” We let F (q, r) be the joint cdf
over q and r and let G (q, r) be the corresponding cdf of the government’s welfare weights. We assume that
F and G are absolutely continuous with respect to each other, so that the government puts positive weight


                                                              46
on the welfare of all groups in society (although these weights may be arbitrarily close to 0).28 We will
show that all of our main results continue to hold within each group r, with little or no modification, under
this more general specification of the government’s objective, so long as g (q, r) / f (q, r) is non-increasing
in q for each r: that is, we require that, within each group, the government is at least as redistributive as
a utilitarian would be. This shows that our results are not overly sensitive to either the assumption that
the government has utilitarian preferences for redistribution, or that the government cares equally about
all groups in society.


D.1        Non-Strategic Reforms
We begin with the case where the government cannot commit to the details of a reform. This corresponds
to the “equalizing reforms” model of Section 3, except that the government’s most-preferred reform is no
longer full equalization of consumption due to the Pareto weights G (q, r). Instead, the dual problem for
c1 , c2 , and K becomes                      Z ✓                      ◆

    It should be pointed out that in this model abstracting from ratcheting is no longer without loss of
generality. This is because the government in period 2 allocates consumption using the information about
q revealed in period 1 (as a consequence, the deviation program does not involve incentive constraints).
In principle, the government may therefore do better by offering an allocation in period 1 that reveals less
information about types. It would thereby tie its hands and prevent itself from offering perfectly q-targeted
consumption at the reform stage, which may relax the no-reform constraint. Nonetheless, we feel that the
most direct way to study how our main results change with a non-utilitarian government is to continue to
assume that the government employs a fully revealing direct mechanism, so we maintain this assumption
throughout.
    This leads to the following result about the implicit marginal capital tax.

Lemma 9. With Pareto weights G (q, r), the intertemporal wedge at any solution to the government’s problem satis-
  28 The absolute continuity also rules out the possibility that the government may put non-zero weight
on the welfare of a measure-zero set of agents, such as for example the leader of the government herself.
This differentiates the model from one with a self-interested politician, such as Acemoglu, Golosov, and
Tsyvinski (2010).

Proof. Note that the reform consumption ĉ2 depends on the choice variables c1 , c2 , K only through K, so we
may write ĉ2 (q, r, K ) in the following. ĉ2 (q, r, K ) must satisfy the first order condition

                                         u0 (ĉ2 (q, r, K )) = l(K ) f (q, r)/g(q, r),                              (40)

where l(K ) is the multiplier on the post-reform resource constraint as a function of K. We can use (40) to
                             −1
solve for ĉ2 (q, r, K ) = u0 (l(K ) f (q, r)/g(q, r)), so l(K ) is implicitly determined by
                                     Z
                                              −1
                                         u0        (l(K ) f (q, r)/g(q, r))dF = RK − k.

Implicitly differentiating this equation and (40) yields

                                                                                                       −1
             ∂ĉ2 (q, r, K )  ∂ĉ (q, r) ∂l       (u00 (ĉ2 (q, r)) g(q, r)/ f (q, r))
                             = 2            = RR                                                      ⌘ Rm(q, r).

Using this in the first order condition for K corresponding to the planning problem (35) to (38) and combin-
ing it with the first order conditions for c1 (q, r) and c2 (q, r) delivers the result.

    Observe that, with utilitarian welfare weights G = F, (40) implies full equalization of post-reform
consumption ĉ2 , so m(q, r) = 1 for all r, q, and (39) collapses back to the standard formula from Section 3.
However, even if G 6= F, we will see that the results from Section 3 will continue to hold within each group
r. For instance, if H depends on consumption differences with H (c2 , ĉ2 ) = H̃ (c2 − ĉ2 ) and H̃ 0 is single-
peaked, marginal capital taxes are U-shaped in q for any given r whenever c2 (q, r) − ĉ2 (q, r) is monotone
in q (a similar result holds when H depends on utility differences and H̃ 0 u0 is single-peaked). This will be
established in the following proposition:

Proposition 10. Suppose H (c2 , ĉ2 ) = H̃ (c2 − ĉ2 ) depends on consumption differences and H̃ 0 is single-peaked.
Then for any given r, marginal capital taxes are U-shaped in q if g(q, r)/ f (q, r) is non-increasing in q given r.

Proof. Fix a solution c1 , c2 , K to (35)-(38), with reform consumption schedule ĉ2 . Consider any given r and

Since ĉ2 does not depend on c2 (holding K constant), we can apply Lemma 2, which implies that c2 (q, r) is
non-decreasing in U (q, r) and hence q. A sufficient condition for c2 (q, r) − ĉ2 (q, r, K ) to be non-decreasing
in q is therefore that ĉ2 (q, r, K ) is non-increasing in q. By (40), ĉ2 (q, r, K ) is non-increasing in q if and only if
g(q, r)/ f (q, r) is non-increasing in q, for any given r and K.

     Proposition 10 shows that, unsurprisingly, we can think of the problem for each group r separately, and
thus, for any given r, the marginal tax rate is U-shaped in q whenever the relative social welfare weights
g(q, r)/ f (q, r) are non-increasing in q. This is because these relative welfare weights determine the shape
of post-reform consumption. With utilitarian weights G = F, they are constant and equal to one, leading
to fully equalized ĉ2 . Whenever g(q, r)/ f (q, r) is decreasing, ĉ2 (q, r) will be decreasing in q for any given
r. This is because the government values low q-types relatively more, and therefore allocates them higher
consumption. Since c2 (q, r) is still weakly increasing in q by Lemma 2, this makes sure that c2 (q, r) − ĉ2 (q, r)
is also weakly increasing. The case where H̃ depends on utility differences may be treated analogously.
     Hence, our main result about the shape of the marginal capital tax from Section 3 continue to hold
within each group r whenever the government is utilitarian or more redistributive than utilitarian within
each group, in the sense of putting higher Pareto weights on low-skill types. What does change is the
average level of the distortion, due to the additional weighting factor m(q, r) in H 2 (c2 , ĉ2 ) in equation (39).
Intuitively, m(q, r) measures the effect of a marginal increase in period 2 aggregate resources RK on post-
reform consumption ĉ2 (q, r) of an individual of type (q, r). The overall effect of an additional unit of RK on
                                                                                   R
political support for the status quo is then given by the weighted average H2 (c2 (q, r), ĉ2 (q, r))m(q, r)dF,
which includes both the effect of RK on post-reform consumption (through m(q, r)) and the effect of a
change in post-reform consumption on the probability of supporting the status quo (through H2 ). For
instance, if g(q, r)/ f (q, r) is decreasing in q and u000 ≥ 0, then m(q, r) is increasing in q, so more weight
is put on the political responsiveness of high-q individuals (those whose post-reform consumption moves
more in response to aggregate savings).


D.2        Strategic Reforms
We now turn to the case where the government can commit to the details of a reform, corresponding to
Section 4 of the text. We will see that most of our results in that section can also be extended to allow for
general Pareto weights, although the analysis is somewhat more complicated. In this appendix, we restrict
attention to the case where H depends on consumption differences; the case where H depends on utility
differences can again be treated similarly.

The following result shows that Lemma 4 extends to this more general framework for any given r if
g(q, r)/ f (q, r) is non-increasing in q:

Lemma 10. If g(q, r)/ f (q, r) is non-increasing in q for a given r, then x (q, r) ⌘ ĉ2 (q, r) − c2 (q, r) is non-
increasing in c2 (q, r), for any selection x (q, r) 2 X (q, r), where X (q, r) is the set of solutions to the deviation
program.

Proof. We first show that, as in the non-strategic reforms case, the subproblem for each r can be considered
separately. To see this, fix a solution c2 with implied x and let
                                                                      Z

Hence, the deviation program (41) has the same structure, for each given r, as (DP) in Section 4, except for
the fact that the integrals in the objective and the constraints involve different weights G and F. To extend
the comparative statics result from Lemma 4, we therefore require a generalized version of our technical
Lemma 2, which is as follows:

Lemma 11. Consider the same setting as in Lemma 2 but with the modified program
                                                                 Z Z

Assume that w is continuous and has strictly increasing differences in a and t, y x is continuous for all x 2 X, and t
is right-continuous. Suppose that either


                                                                       50
(i) w( a, t) is non-decreasing in a and g(q )/ f (q ) is non-decreasing in q, or
(ii) w( a, t) is non-increasing in a and g(q )/ f (q ) is non-increasing in q.
Then for any solutions P0 and P00 , if t (q 0 ) < t (q 00 ) then a (q 0 )  a (q 00 ) for all a (q 0 ) 2 supp P0 (q 0 ) and a (q 00 ) 2
supp P00 (q 00 ). Moreover, if a solution exists, there exists a deterministic solution in which a is non-decreasing in t.

Proof. The proof follows the same variational argument as the proof of Lemma 2, where the perturbed
randomized schedule P̂ is defined as before. As before, P̂ satisfies the constraints. The difference appears
when comparing the value of the objective under P̂ and P, which becomes

For each q 2 Q0 , t (q ) < t (f (q )), and because w has increasing differences, the first term in the second line
is non-increasing in a as before. Moreover, the second term is also non-increasing in a if either condition (i)
or (ii) in the lemma is satisfied. This ensures that the entire expression in the first line is decreasing in a for
all q 2 Q0 , so the rest of the proof of Lemma 2 goes through.
                                                                                                                               r
    Applying Lemma 11(ii) to the modified deviation program (41) with a = − x r (q ), t(q ) = c2 (q ) and
w( a, t) = u(c2 − x ) immediately implies that, for any given r, x r (q ) is non-decreasing in cr (q ) when
g(q, r)/ f (q, r) is non-decreasing in q, which is the desired result.

     We can also reproduce Lemma 5 as follows:

Lemma 12. In any solution, for almost all non-pooled q,

                         tk (q, r)       ⇥                                          ⇤
                                     = Rh u0 (c2 (q, r) + x (q, r)) − u0 (c2 (q, r)) g (q, r) / f (q, r) .                         (43)
                       1 − tk (q, r)
                                                          r
Proof. Observe first that, for each given r, c2 must solve
                    Z ✓                                                    ◆          Z

where V D (c2 ) is defined in (41). This is the same as (17) except that the constraint involves the weights G
rather than F. Accounting for this when following the same steps as in the proof of Lemma 5 yields the
result.


                                                                     51
    Since Lemma 10 has shown that x (q, r) is decreasing in c2 (q, r) for any given r, Lemma 12 immediately
yields the following analogue of Proposition 4:

Proposition 11. Suppose g(q, r)/ f (q, r) is non-increasing in q for each r. In any solution, for each r, there exists
                                           r⇤
a threshold level of period 2 consumption c2 such for almost all non-pooled agents, capital is subsidized for agents
                  r⇤                                      r⇤
with c2 (q, r) < c2 and taxed for those with c2 (q, r) > c2 .

Proof. Analogous to the proofs of Propositions 4 and 7, now using Lemmas 10 and 12.

     By inspection of the formula in (43), Proposition 5 also goes through if c2 (q, r) is increasing and g(q, r)/
f (q, r) is decreasing in q given r. In words, the marginal capital tax is increasing in q in this case for non-
pooled agents, as it was in Section 4.
     The one major way in which the results in this appendix are weaker than those in Section 4 is that
we cannot conclude that c2 (q, r) is non-decreasing in q, even when g(q, r)/ f (q, r) is decreasing in q. The
reason is that our generalized monotonicity lemma, Lemma 11, is still not general enough to deliver com-
parative statics with respect to c2 (q, r). This is because Lemma 11 requires that w( a, t) is monotone in a.
Yet, the objective in (44), while satisfying increasing differences, is not monotone in c2 . The monotonicity
requirement on the objective can be dropped only when the relative weights g(q, r)/ f (q, r) are constant in
q. Thus, the full set of comparative statics from Section 4 can be guaranteed only when the government is
utilitarian within each group r.29



E     Appendix: Pooling
In this appendix, we discuss the caveats regarding pooled types in Proposition 3. It is first worth recalling
that tk (q ) is non-decreasing at all types q for which formula (18) applies, which by Lemma 5 holds whenever
there is a unique solution to the deviation program for type q, or, even if this not the case, type q is not
pooled with other types in terms of c2 . The reason why we need one of these two assumptions is that we
use an envelope theorem in the proof of Lemma 5, and the deviation value function VD (c2 ) may not be
differentiable if X (q ) is not single-valued (the left- and right-derivatives are always well-defined, but they
may not coincide).
    However, by Lemma 4 (iii), we know that the solution to (DP) is unique for almost all c2 -levels (recall
that (DP) does not directly depend on q but only through the implied c2 -schedule). Hence, potential non-
differentiability of VD can occur almost nowhere in terms of c2 , and problems could only arise when a
non-unique solution to (DP) happens to occur at a c2 -level at which there is a strictly positive mass of
agents, i.e. where there is pooling. This is illustrated in Figure 5, where types in [q1 , q2 ] are pooled at c̃2 ,
and X happens to be non-singleton at c̃2 (note that, by Lemma 4 (iv), such non-uniqueness can only occur
for negative x-values, i.e. for types q > q ⇤ ). In this case, the marginal capital tax could be non-monotone
overall, although it is still increasing among the non-pooled types. There is no obvious reason, however,
to expect that non-unique solutions to (DP) are more or less likely to emerge at c2 -levels at which there is
pooling, so we view this as a technicality that needs to be accounted for but not as a particularly important
economic feature of our model.
  29 Ofcourse, the conditions on g (q, r) / f (q, r) in Lemma 11 are only sufficient, so it is certainly possible
that our full set of results goes through even when the government is not utilitarian.

    In fact, these caveats can be completely dispensed with if for every period-2 consumption schedule c2 ,
one of the following two conditions holds.

     1. The set of solutions to the deviation program X (q ) is single-valued for almost all q.
        R
     2. u (c2 (q )) dF − VD (c2 ) is convex in c2 (which implies the government’s problem is convex).

      Both of these points require some explanation. For the first one, note that if X (q ) is (almost) always
single-valued, then the argument of Lemma 5 (i) applies—and therefore (18) holds—for (almost) all types q.
Simpler versions of the proofs of Propositions 4 and 5 then imply that both of these results will hold without
the qualifications concerning pooled types. Furthermore, X (q ) is indeed single-valued almost everywhere
in some natural cases. For example, if H̃ is a step function, then it can be shown that X (q ) is single-valued
almost everywhere, as discussed in the text.
                                                                                   R
      For the second point, observe that the government’s problem is convex if u (c2 (q )) dF −VD (c2 ) is
convex. The intuition is that, unlike the government’s problem in the model with equalizing reforms or the
deviation problem in the current model, the government’s planning problem in the current model does not
directly depend on the non-concave political support function H̃ (though of course it depends indirectly on
H̃ through VD ), so there is some hope that this problem might actually be convex. If it is convex, then an
explicit variational approach can be taken to minimizing the Lagrangian (19) in the proof of Lemma 5 (as
now an extremum of the government’s problem must also be an extremum of the Lagrangian), and it may
be shown that the following version of (18) holds for almost all types q (whether or not q is pooled), where
x̄ (q ) = sup X (q ) and x (q ) = inf X (q ):

             tk (q )    ⇥ ⇥                                      ⇤    ⇥                                    ⇤⇤
                       2 Rh u0 (c2 (q ) + x̄ (q )) − u0 (c2 (q )) , Rh u0 (c2 (q ) + x (q )) − u0 (c2 (q )) .
           1 − tk (q )

Lemma 4 may then be used to show that Propositions 4 and 5 hold without the qualifications about pooled
                                                       R
types. It is worth pointing out that the condition that u (c2 (q )) dF − VD (c2 ) is convex is not overly strong.
For example, it is straightforward to check that it holds if u is quadratic. Proposition 6 in the text summa-
rizes this discussion.
