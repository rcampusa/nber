Pork for Policy: Executive and Legislative Exchange in Brazil

                                           ABSTRACT

The Brazilian Constitution of 1988 gave relatively strong powers to the President. We model and

test Executive-Legislative relations in Brazil and demonstrate that Presidents have used pork as a

political currency to exchange for votes on policy reforms. In particular Presidents Cardoso and Lula

have used pork to exchange for amendments to the Constitution. Without policy reforms Brazil

would have had greater difficulty meeting their debt obligations. The logic for the exchange of pork

for policy reform is that Presidents typically have greater electoral incentives than members of

Congress to care about economic growth, economic opportunity, income equality and price

stabilization. Members of Congress generally care more about redistributing gains to their

constituents. Given the differences in preferences and the relative powers of each, the Legislative

and Executive benefit by exploiting the gains from trade.

   Section 1 - Introduction



       It is part of the folklore of the democratization process in many Latin American

countries that the power of the executive should be limited. No doubt this emerged because

of past abuses. Limiting executive power by giving power to a Congress is not costless. In a

utopian world representatives should vote for the “good of the country,” but in the real

world they vote for geographic redistribution, e.g., one member of Congress wants a road

while another wants an irrigation project. The incentive of the executive differs from that of

members of Congress; as head of the country the executive is in a position to internalize the

costs and benefits from policies affecting national interests more so than regional interests.

As a result of differing electoral connections between the President and members of

Congress, the President should care more about economic growth and inequality than

members of Congress. To better achieve these goals, it makes sense to give the executive

relatively strong powers provided the power is checked, e.g., by a veto in Congress, and a

free press. When Brazil returned to democracy in 1985 they structured their federal

institutions of governance in a way that retained strong powers for the President. The

transition from a military dictatorship to a civilian government in Brazil during the first half

of the 1980s was gradual and peaceful rather than revolutionary. As a result many

institutions continued from the military regime to democracy, most notably for our analysis

was the retention of strong presidential powers. Had there been a clean break between

regimes this might not have been the case. We argue that strong presidential powers are the

key component in the relationship between the president and Congress. It should be made

clear, however, that we are not claiming that strong presidential powers arose because they
                                                                                           Alston
                                                                                             -4-
facilitate gains to trade, rather they arose historically and have persisted and evolved

because they benefited those who had the power to change them.

       Within the governance system of Brazil, seven parties currently play a significant

legislative role. With seven active parties and a weak committee structure one might

imagine that policy is highly unstable in Brazil. Policy stability is important for economic

development because it induces private investment, provided the policies are not punitive to

investors. There may be a fine line between the ability to reform when needed, and policy

stability. In short, policy stability should not be confused with policy gridlock. One of the

fundamental dilemmas in all representative democracies is how to induce stability in

governmental outcomes while maintaining the ability to reform. Governments need a

certain amount of elasticity in the policy space to adapt to changing domestic or

international conditions.

       We propose to analyze the mechanism in Brazil for inducing policy reform, along

with expectations of policy stability. In Brazil parties and committees are far too weak to

induce stability. Our analysis rests on the existence of strong executive power that in turn

enables the President to mold a stable coalition in Congress. The coalition then functions as

a strong party, though with an important caveat: the President is necessarily the leader of

the coalition. Without the President at the helm of the coalition, it would be inherently

unstable. Like most cartels, some enforcement mechanism is necessary to ensure

compliance and prevent defections. Having the President as head of the coalition enables

him to capture a large part of the gains from trade between the executive and legislative

branches. Importantly, the electoral connection for the President rests on a strong economy

and one perceived as satisfying the goals of economic growth, economic opportunity, and

greater income inequality,
                                                                                     Alston
                                                                                         -5-
       As is the case of its American counterpart, the Brazilian Congress presents great

potential for gains from trade, as well as similar kinds of problems concerning the

enforcement and durability of such trades. Although there is a committee system in the

Brazilian Congress it does not fulfill the same purpose as that suggested by Weingast and

Marshall (1988) for the case of the US Congress. Pereira and Mueller (2000, 2004) show

that party leaders routinely change deputies from one committee to another, even against

their will, so that having a committee seat does not guarantee property rights over the

agenda of the committee. Furthermore, bills can be (and are) routinely taken out of

committee by the College of Leaders.1 As a result committees are not in a position to

coordinate legislative exchanges.

       Similarly parties cannot play the coordination role because there are too many

parties and no one party is large enough to ensure stability. Currently there are seven

effective parties in Brazil. It is conceivable that a Congressional institution could arise that

would enable a cartel arrangement (coalition) to act as a dominant party but so far this has

not happened and we will argue that it is unlikely to happen given the powers of the

executive.

       For our purposes the most notable feature that emerged from the Constitution of

1988 was the extent of legislative powers conferred to the Executive.2 The powers of most

importance are: 1) the power to establish the status quo through provisional decrees; 2) the

sole authority to initiate certain types of legislation, e.g. budgetary and administrative

issues; 3) the execution of the budget; 4) the ability to appoint a cabinet (though like the

U.S. this is subject to the approval of the Senate); and 5) immense discretion over

patronage jobs. We will elaborate briefly on each of these powers.
                                                                                         Alston
                                                                                           -6-
       Provisional Decrees

       The President has the power to change the status quo policy by issuing decrees that

remain in force for 30 days unless overturned by a majority vote in a joint session of

Congress. After 30 days the President can reissue the decree. Provisional decrees have been

used extensively and increasingly since 1988. According to Figueiredo and Limongi

(2000a: 155), from 1989 to 1997, Presidents issued 446 provisional decrees (without

counting reissues) and Congress rejected only 3%.3 Monteiro (2000b) computed the

number of provisional decrees in effect every month (including reissues) for each bill

enacted through regular legislative procedures. During President Cardoso’s first and second

term that number oscillated from 1.8 decrees per regular bill in April 1995 to 6.5 in July

1999, with a clear increase in the trend over time. The average life of a provisional decree

over this period was approximately 20 months.4

       Exclusive Initiation Rights

       The executive has exclusive constitutional rights to initiate budgetary and

administrative legislation. Budgetary legislation involves the elaboration and subsequent

changes to the budget. Administrative legislation includes: laws that create new ministries,

agencies and even public corporations; new positions within the public sector; the mandates

of the public entities; and the determination of wages within public entities excluding

Congress and the Judiciary. Presidents use their exclusionary rights often and successfully:

from 1989 to 1994 the President initiated almost 70% of the 1,259 laws approved by

Congress from 1989 to 1994 - 41% were budgetary, 10% administrative and 18%

provisional decrees (Figueiredo and Limongi, 1996: 69).5 The President also initiated

successfully an additional 10% of the laws passed in areas over which he does not have
                                                                                      Alston
                                                                                        -7-
exclusive rights. Cardoso continued the same pattern: he initiated 80.5% of all enacted

legislation from 1995 to 1998 (Pereira and Mueller, 2000: 48).

       Execution of the budget

       The executive office not only initiates the budgetary process but also carries it out.

After the executive submits a bill to Congress, the legislature may amend it. Many of these

amendments entail pork barrel projects in a legislator’s district. After Congress as a whole

amends, the budget goes first through a Combined Budget Committee that prunes out some

pork.6 From Congress the bill goes back to the President who has line-item veto power.

Once a bill is passed the President decides which amendments get executed, based on

political and budgetary considerations. For example, the President can argue that he will

not implement an amendment because of insufficient tax receipts to cover the expenditure.

Discretion over execution gives the President enormous power to reward or punish

legislative behavior. Ames (1995a) first related budget amendments to roll call votes.

Pereira (1999) and Pereira and Mueller (2000) provide further evidence that the President

uses his discretion strategically.

       Cabinet Appointments

       One mechanism by which the President rewards legislative behavior is through

Cabinet appointments.7 This power is used throughout a President’s term to reward or

punish voting behavior in favor of or contrary to the President’s preferences. Cabinet

appointments are usually distributed to parties, whose leaders then have more means to

discipline their members. However, in some cases these appointments can go to particularly

influential individuals who are able to deliver the support of several congressmen.

Throughout his terms, Cardoso has been explicit about this mechanism in the media,
                                                                                  Alston
                                                                                     -8-
making it well known that the appointment remained contingent on continual support in

Congress.

       Patronage

       Patronage positions are numerous. Fleischer (1998) states that the executive

controls over 40,000 jobs throughout Brazil. These positions range from cabinet positions

to second and third rank jobs, which in most countries would be civil service appointments.

Rather than simply rewarding friends who got out the vote, some of these positions go to

standing members of Congress, suggesting that these positions can bring influence or

wealth. Indeed in many instances, time spent in Congress is an investment made to secure

an executive appointment.

       As a result of these five powers the President has dominated the legislative agenda

both in timing and content. The legislature rarely defeats the proposals of the President.8

The preponderance of the Executive in legislative procedures accounts for the claim by

some scholars that the Brazilian Congress has abdicated its main constitutional authority to

the Executive.9 We will argue that this notion goes too far because Congress as a whole

has the power of veto to resist the Executive’s advances, or even to change the rules that are

the underpinning of the Executive’s powers. The fact that it has not done so suggests that a

majority of members of Congress benefit from the status quo as compared to a

counterfactual world of multiple parties facing a severe collection action problem in the

legislative arena. The College of Leaders has the potential to organize legislative exchanges

but it currently lacks any enforcement mechanisms for legislative exchanges. In short,

outside of the powers of Presidency, there is no apparent extant institution within Congress

that could improve on the status quo. The powers of the executive fill this void, enabling
                                                                                     Alston
                                                                                        -9-
members of and parties within the coalition to achieve many of the gains from trade that

arise through other mechanisms (e.g. committees) in other countries.

       Our paper contributes to the literature that analyzes the effect of political institutions

on public policy and policy outcomes (North and Weingast 1989, North 1981 and 1990,

Levy and Spiller 1996, Haggard and McCubbins 2001, Dixit 1996, Moe 1990, Spiller and

Tommasi 2002). More specifically it is concerned with how countries’ political institutions

affect the trade-off between gridlock and instability that permeates all policy-making

(Shepsle and Weingast, 1981; Weingast and Marshall, 1988). The way in which the

political structure maps into the ability to reform and to commit has been a subject of

growing interest in the literature. Our paper relates closely to several recent strands in this

literature, particularly those concerned with institutions that determine legislative-executive

relations. Our focus on the strong powers of the Brazilian president and his ability to

bargain with a coalition with different preferences is directly related to the notion of

separation of power and separation of propose in Cox and McCubbins’ (2001) and Shugart

and Haggard (2001). In this regard we argue that Brazil is an example of political system

that provides both high levels of governability and responsiveness to the median voter

preferences. Our analysis can also be seen as a veto player model where the coalition must

agree with the President’s proposals for them to be realized, much in the spirit of the

models in Tsebelis (2002). Persson and Tabellini (2000; 239-246) and Persson, Roland and

Tabellini (1997) provide models that show conditions under which the separation of powers

between Congress and the president benefits voters by leading to policies that promote

general welfare rather than private benefits to individuals or groups. Our paper is also

related to the analysis in Epstein and O’Halloran (1999) regarding how the institutional

characteristics of legislative-executive relations, such as divided government and party
                                                                                     Alston
                                                                                      - 10 -
conflict affect the decision by Congress whether to delegate policymaking. Finally, our

analysis is perhaps most relevant to the comparative literature on the variation among

presidential systems (Haggard and McCubbins, 2001, Shugart and Carey 1992). We present

a case study of a coalition-based presidential system with strong presidential powers in a

context of multiple parties. Although this basic configuration may occur frequently in

developing countries, the specific details of the Brazilian case lead to a much less common

result; a divided government that can act decisively and where “pork” does not necessarily

have significant negative consequences. Understanding the conditions under which this

occurs is a contribution towards a better understanding of the relation between political

institutions and policy.

       Our paper also contributes to the specific literature on Brazilian executive-

legislative relations. For the particular case of Brazil there is considerable debate regarding

how the political institutions affect the costs of governability and consequently outcomes.

The traditional argument has been that electoral rules based on an open list system lead to

multiple, fragmented and undisciplined parties, where party leaders are unable to control

their members’ votes and presidents consequently face high costs in getting their proposals

approved (Ames; 1995a,b, 2001; Carey and Shugart, 1995; Shugart and Carey, 1992;

Lamounier 1994a,b; Mainwaring 1993, 1999; Mainwaring and Shugart, 1997). This view

has recently been disputed by scholars who argue that Brazilian Presidents since the 1988

Constitution have had remarkable success in enacting their legislative agendas, and that

parties are disciplined and able to control their members (Figueiredo and Limongi, 2000a,

2000b; Pereira 1999, Pereira and Mueller 2002; Santos 1997). According to this revisionist

view, incentives from the electoral arena that push towards individualistic behavior are

countered by the incentives within Congress that derive from the legislative powers of the
                                                                                      Alston
                                                                                       - 11 -
President. We argue that not only have Presidents achieved high levels of success in the

legislative arena but they have done so at relatively low cost. One of the contributions of

this paper is an explicit model of the micro-foundations of legislative-executive relations

that are consistent with the revisionist view.

       In the following section we present a model in which a President uses his control

over the agenda and patronage to pursue his preferred policy. We stress the trade-off

between policy outcomes and patronage. In Section 3 derive several results about the gains

from trade and who receives the gains. In Section 4 we analyze pension reform from 1995

to 2004 and data from budget execution as a test of our model. In Section 5 we offer some

concluding remarks.



       Section 2 – A Model of the Brazilian Congress

       In this section we present a model that captures the main elements of the executive-

legislative relationship in Brazil. The important feature of the relationship is the agenda

power held by the President. This does not mean, however, that the President can

unilaterally impose his preferences on Congress: a majority coalition can restrict the policy

preferences of the President. To the extent that the President has a greater electoral

connection associated with economic growth, stability and national public goods than

members of Congress it is desirable to give the President relatively strong legislative

powers. However, to the extent that the President has other goals in his objective function

or is incompetent, it is important that Congress be able to check the actions of the President.

       Our model is largely driven by the trade-off between policy outcomes and

patronage, where the outcomes depend on both preferences and on the value of patronage

to both members of Congress and the President, that is, on the existence of gains to trade.
                                                                                       Alston
                                                                                        - 12 -
In our model we have five political parties, each of which negotiates directly with the

President. Although this is often a good representation of reality, as party leaders have

several instruments to reward and punish their members, in some cases the transactions are

with individual legislators. The model can be easily adapted to having each of the five

coalition parties being a legislator in a five member legislature. All legislators belong to a

political party and parties either belong to the government’s coalition or are part of the

opposition. Both of these groups interact in congressional proceedings, constrained by the

legislative institutions, and subject to the powers of the executive. We assume that the

parties are able to discipline their members.10 The coalition and the opposition, on the other

hand, face the usual coordination problems, however the coalition is able to overcome this

by having the executive at the lead.11

       Figure 1 shows the preferences of the President (P) and five parties (Ki i=1…5) in a

two-dimensional space composed of a policy issue on the horizontal dimension and

patronage on the vertical dimension.12 The policy can be, for example, the minimum

retirement age, with the president preferring a higher age than that preferred by each of the

parties.13 The patronage dimension measures the value of patronage in the form of such

benefits as individual budget amendments, cabinet posts, jobs or cash provided by the

Executive to each party. Suppose that the number of legislators in each party are such that

the President needs support of any three parties to have a majority (and a 3/5 majority in the

case of constitutional amendments.) Thus in this example K3, K4 and K5 will form the

President’s coalition and K1 and K2 are in the opposition.

                                                                                      Alston
                                                                                        - 13 -
        The horizontal line shown in Figure 1 is the zero-patronage line. The points with

asterisks are the parties’ preferred policy points along the zero-patronage line. Whereas the

president’s bliss point is on the zero-patronage line, as he would rather not concede any

patronage, the parties prefer infinite amounts of patronage so their bliss points do not

appear in the figure. The points shown with asterisks are thus the projection of their bliss

points on the zero-patronage line. The ellipses show the indifference curves of each

legislator to the status quo point SQ. These are labeled as K iSQ (⋅) , i=1…5, where the

superscript indicates that the curve represents all the points for which the party is

indifferent to SQ. All points within the ellipse are preferred by the party to those on or

outside the ellipse. Thus if the president used his agenda power to propose a policy at his

preferred point P*, all parties would vote against the proposal.

        The president anticipates this outcome and thus acts strategically proposing some

point more palatable to a majority of parties. In order to show which point exactly the

president would propose so as to improve on the status quo with the least cost in terms of

patronage, Figure 2 shows a close-up of the previous figure with the point where each

legislators’ indifference curve through SQ crosses the zero-patronage line labeled

as K iSQ ( 0 ) .14 Without the use of patronage, the best the President could do would be to

propose a policy at point K 3SQ ( 0 ) , as this would be preferred to the status quo by both K5 and

K4 and would be indifferent to K3 (so we assume she would vote in favor). Note, however,

that the President can do better than this by using patronage. By proposing a policy at point

B and offering a value in patronage to K3 valued at AB, the president gets favorable votes

from a majority composed of K3, K4 and K5, and reaches a higher indifference curve than

would be achieved without the use of patronage ( U P ( K 3SQ ( 0) ) > U P ( A) ). Point A is the best
                                                                                      Alston
                                                                                        - 14 -
the President can do with this configuration of preferences. Note that although the President

incurs a higher cost in terms of patronage by proposing A rather than K 3SQ ( 0 ) , he is better off

doing so as are K4 and K5. At the same time K3 is indifferent to both situations. Thus the

President and some parties realize gains from trade by having a policy-patronage point at A.

        <<Place Figure 2 about here>>

        In the example portrayed in Figure 2, the president only provided patronage to one

of the parties. This was a result of the specific preferences portrayed by the indifference

curves. In Figure 3 we slightly alter those preferences by moving K 4SQ ( 0 ) closer to K 3SQ ( 0 ) to

show a situation where more than one party receives patronage. In this case, the previous

solution, policy at B and AB patronage to K3, would no longer defeat the status quo. This is

because K4 prefers SQ to policy at B. Without giving patronage to K4 the best that the

President can do is to propose policy at K 4SQ ( 0 ) and give patronage to K3 worth the distance

from K 4SQ ( 0 ) to C. However, he can do better than this by giving patronage as well to K4. The

dark line labeled K 3SQ (⋅) + K 4SQ (⋅) is the vertical summation of the indifference curves of both

K3 and K4 and thus shows the amount of patronage that the President would have to

concede in total to compensate both K3 and K4. The most favorable indifference curve of

the President is tangent to this curve at point D. The equilibrium in this case would thus be

for the President to propose policy at point E and to give patronage worth DE in total to

both K3 and K4. The amount given to each is the vertical distance from E to their

indifference curve K iSQ (⋅) , the sum of which equals DE. In this situation K3, K4 and K5

would vote for the policy and the President’s utility would be UP(D). Note that if K5’s

policy prefference moved sufficiently to the left, that party too could receive patronage.

                                                                                           - 15 -
       The model presented above stylizes the main forces that we believe mold the

relationship between the executive and its coalition in Congress. There are several

characteristics of that relationship that are not explicitly addressed in the model that should

also considered. The first is that the analysis so far has been made in the context of a one-

off negotiation over a single bill; however the relationship is a recurring one involving a

series of bills and other procedures besides plenary voting. Therefore the exchange of

support for patronage may not be tallied on a bill-by-bill basis, but rather as the cumulative

support provided by the party during the legislative year. Only exceptionally is there

specific negotiation over individual bills that are particularly controversial and high profile

(some examples involving pension reform are given in section 4). The fact that the

executive and the coalition play a repeated game helps ensure cooperation, as a party will

be willing to forgo a chance to cheat on any given bill so as not to upset the relationship.

Repeated play also limits strategic behavior.

       Another characteristic of the relationship between the executive and the coalition

during the two terms of President Cardoso is that the coalition held a supermajority of

seats, approximately 66% in 1994 and 74% in 1998. This means that it was often the case

that the executive would be able to pass several bills even without the support of some of

the parties in the coalition. This fact also mitigates the weight of our assumption that party

leaders are able to perfectly control their members. Even if some members of each party

vote against or abstain on any given proposal, the coalition will still be able to approve the

bill. This allows some parties or individuals to oppose, with the executive’s concurrence,

some bills that are particularly harmful to their constituencies, thus avoiding the electoral

cost of supporting the bill. Of course the leeway is less in the case of constitutional
                                                                                   Alston
                                                                                    - 16 -
amendments, which require a three-fifths majority (60%) and usually involve the more

important issues.



Section 3 – Gains from Trade in the Brazilian Congress

        The gains from trade are most easily illustrated in Figure 2. If the legislative

institutions were such that the President still retained agenda power but did not have the

ability to offer patronage, then the best he could do would be to propose K 3SQ ( 0 ) . This

represents an improvement for all coalition members considered together (President plus

the coalition parties) compared to the status quo where utilities were the same for K3 but

lower for K4, K5 and the President. But it is an inferior situation compared to that of the

President offering patronage, because with patronage the President can improve his position

and the party are no worse of compared to the status quo.

        The gains from trade, as always, arise from one actor having property rights to a

good that is more highly valued by another. That is, they arise when the President gains

more utility by giving patronage than the utility cost he incurs in doing so, and the parties

gain more utility from the patronage than they lose by having policy move away from their

preferred points. Clearly, some issues are sufficiently dear to the parties that it would

require more patronage than the President would be willing to offer. In such cases the

President would not even bring the proposal to a vote, which explains why some crucial

issues, such as political system reform and tax reform, are consistently being postponed.

Occasionally the President may miscalculate and propose a bill that will be rejected,

however such cases should be relatively rare.

        Our model implies that all of the gains from trade go to the President, while the

coalition parties that receive patronage remain just as well off as they did at the status quo.
                                                                                       Alston
                                                                                         - 17 -
Coalition parties that do not receive patronage, such as K5 in the example in Figure 3, are

better off because the final policy improves their utility compared to the status quo. This

result derives from the agenda power held by the President.15 If the legislative rules were

such that the President could not influence the agenda, and assuming that the same coalition

were able to remain united, then the coalition could propose a bill at its median point and

have it approved, because it has a majority of the votes to pass the bill and override any

vetoes. If the legislative rules allowed the President to offer patronage, then he could still

pull policy towards P, but the final outcome would be further from his preferred point than

in the case where he had agenda power, as the reversal point would then be the coalition’s

median preference rather than SQ. It is the agenda power of the President that provides a

structure-induced equilibrium that prevents cycling problems and provides stability to the

coalition and policy decisions. If the President did not have agenda power and there were

no other institution that had this effect, such as a strong committee system, we expect that

the coalition would break and outcomes would become unpredictable. In short there is

currently no legislative institution that can solve the collective action problem within

Congress of monitoring and enforcing legislative exchanges.

           In our model the President receives all the gains from trade but we stress that this

does not imply that he is unconstrained by the coalition. The further apart are the

President’s and the coalition members’ preferences, the less the President will be able to

accomplish of his reform agenda. Our analysis also demonstrates that if an incompetent or

ill intentioned President proposes extreme policies, Congress would check the policies.

           The major conclusions from the discussion above are summarized in the following

results:
                                                                                    Alston
                                                                                     - 18 -
   Result 1 – The Brazilian legislative rules are such that there are significant gains

   from trade for the members of the coalition and the executive from the exchange of

   support for patronage. The President’s agenda powers guarantee the stability of the

   relationship and allow him to appropriate most of the gains.

        The model can also be used to determine the effect of parametric changes in the cost

of patronage to the President. Providing patronage involves a series of costs that are

reflected in the inclination of the President’s indifference curves. These costs arise for two

reasons. The first is the opportunity cost to the President of depleting his capital, since the

patronage used to purchase support for a given set of causes cannot be used for other ends.

The second is the efficiency cost that arises from the fact that patronage, by transferring the

right over specific decisions to members of party Ki, implies that policies and resource use

in those areas may be distant from those that the President would prefer.16 The slope of the

President’s indifference curves measures the cost of providing patronage because by

definition those curves show how much patronage the President is willing to give in

exchange for having policy move one unit closer to his preferred point along the no-

patronage line. The greater the slope of the President’s indifference curves at each point

(that is, the more vertically elongated his preference ellipses) the more he cares about

policy relative to patronage. Thus, the lower the cost of providing patronage, the greater the

slope (in absolute value) of the President’s indifference curves and consequently the closer

will be the equilibrium outcome to the President’s preferred point. In Figure 3 an increase

in the slope of UP(D) would imply a tangency point to K 3SQ (⋅) + K 4SQ (⋅) that would yield a

policy closer to P than E, with more patronage being given to K3 and K4 than DE.

       The shape of the President’s utility curves are primarily determined by his

preferences for policy versus patronage. However, they are also determined by the
                                                                                       Alston
                                                                                         - 19 -
institutions in Congress and the Executive, which influence the level of costs that determine

the amount and quality of patronage a President has to offer, as well as the level of

transaction costs involved in doing so. In Section 1 we showed that in Brazil political

institutions endow the President with several means of providing patronage at low cost,

such as the control of the execution of individual budget amendments by the President. If

any of these institutions were altered, affecting the costs of providing patronage, the

President’s indifference curves would change which in turn would lead to a different

outcome. The effect of a parametric reduction in the cost of patronage to the President is to

move the policy outcome closer to the President’s preferred point. This happens because

greater gains from trade can then be realized from the exchange of each unit of patronage.

   Result 2 – Changes that reduce the cost of patronage to the President and the cost of

   transacting with the coalition parties, lead to greater gains from trade, and policy

   outcomes more favorable to the President.

       Policy outcomes can also be affected by parametric changes in the indifference

curves of the coalition parties. These curves measure how much patronage a party must

receive in order to vote for a policy further away from their preferred point and remain just

as well off. The steeper these curves, the lower the value of patronage to the party relative

to the value of the policy. Thus the less vertically elongated their preference ellipses, the

more the parties value patronage. In addition to the parties’ innate preferences for policy

and patronage, political institutions also influence the shapes of their indifference curves.

Changes in legislative or electoral rules, or changes in the voters’ preferences or behavior,

may alter those curves. In Figure 3, a parametric increase in the value of patronage to the

parties implies flatter indifference curves and consequently more favorable policy outcomes

to the President. For example, if the President is undergoing a period of intense popularity
                                                                                       Alston
                                                                                        - 20 -
it will be more valuable for a party or individual to hold or control a governmental post, as

this popularity may rub off onto those seen by the electorate as participating in the

government. As another example, the easier it is for the legislators to use patronage so as to

benefit themselves, the more highly it will be valued. If the country’s institutions make it

more acceptable for a legislator to derive rents from a pork barrel project taken home, then

the execution of a personal amendment to the budget is more valuable to a legislator.

   Result 3 – The larger the benefit that the members of the coalition are able to derive

   from a given amount of patronage, the greater the gains from trade and the more

   favorable will be policy outcomes to the Executive.



        Finally, a perhaps counterintuitive implication of our model is that the President

will have to offer more compensation to those coalition parties that are further from his

preferences. In Figure 3, for example, K3 is the furthest from P and received the majority of

patrontage, DE, the total amount of patronage that was given. K4 was more aligned with the

President than K3 but nevertheless received less patronage. And K5 , who was even closer to

P received no patronage at all.17 K1 and K2 who are not part of the coalition also received

no patronage. In this regard our model has a similar implication to the model in Snyder Jr.

(1991): “in order to obtain favorable legislation the president should allocate the

distributive benefits he has at his disposal to the congressmen who are slightly opposed to

his proposal.”18 In the following section we will test this implication with data on patronage

distribution.

   Result 4 – The further the preference of a coalition party from that of the President,

   the greater the patronage that party will receive. Therefore coalition parties that

   have more divergent preferences from those of the President will receive, ceteris
                                                                                          Alston
                                                                                           - 21 -
   paribus, more compensation than those parties closer to the President up to the

   point where the President has the number of votes that he needs.



Section 4 – Evidence from Pension Reform

       The success rate of the Brazilian Executive in getting its projects approved in

Congress has been impressive. Of the 1,881 bills presented by the various Presidents from

1989 to 1997, 77% were approved and only 1.3% were rejected, the remaining having been

withdrawn or still in progress (Figueiredo and Limongi 2000a; 155). The performance of

the Cardoso Presidency has been even stronger with an approval of 95.3% of its proposals

in the House during his second term (Jornal do Brasil, 2001). At first sight this record may

lead one to believe that the Executive is able to pursue its agenda with practically no

interference from Congress. However, the same outcome can also be explained by a

relationship between the Executive and the Legislature as modeled in the previous section.

The Executive achieves a high rate of success in getting its proposals approved through its

power to set the agenda together with the strategic use of patronage. Providing evidence to

support this model is not easy, because a high rate of approval is predicted by both

hypotheses.19

       The percentage of Presidential bills approved per se does not provide much

information on the prior explicit and implicit bargaining between the Executive and

Congress in order to assure approval. For many proposals the preferences of the coalition

are close to the preference of the President and approval follows without bargaining. In

other cases preferences are further apart but the combination of patronage and compromise

in changing the policy leads to approval. In still other cases the preferences are so divergent
                                                                                    Alston
                                                                                     - 22 -
that no such compromise is feasible. When the President perceives preferences as widely

divergent, he most likely will withhold the proposal rather than face defeat.

       According to our first result, there are significant gains from trade from the

exchange of support for patronage. Evidence of patronage should be particularly visible in

those instances where preferences diverged but not so much as to rule out exchanges. We

should expect to find that the voting behavior of members of the coalition are rewarded and

punished by the Executive in the following ways: (i) granting or removing the right to make

appointments to patronage positions and (ii) executing or failing to execute the amendments

in the budget related to specific legislators. Although there is systematic data available on

individual amendments (which we describe below), there is no systematic data on posts in

the federal government that have been assigned to deputies. It is usually quite clear which

political party, and sometimes even which individual within a party, has been given

property rights to appoint cabinet members and several other high-ranking positions. Even

with lower positions, such as the head and directors of local branches of many federal

companies, pundits and the press will often comment on which congressman choose the

appointee. However, given the huge number of posts available for negotiation (Fleischer

1998, estimates this number at 40,000), the unofficial nature of the link between patron and

appointee and transitory nature of appointments, it is very difficult to collect systematic

information.

       To test the hypotheses from the previous section we will look at pension reform

during both Cardoso terms, 1995-2002. Our strategy is to associate the use of patronage

with specific instances when Congress voted on divisive issues. This will be done in two

ways; the first using evidence from the press and the second econometrically testing the

determinants of the execution by the President of the amendments to the budget proposed
                                                                                  Alston
                                                                                   - 23 -
by Congressmen. We choose pension reform because it is a key element in any plan for

economic growth and stabilization, and it has been by far the most contentious issue

discussed in Congress in the past ten years. Cardoso sent his first proposal on pension

reform to Congress in March 1995, shortly after he took office, and in eight years achieved

only limited reform. President Lula who took office in January 2003 chose pension reform

as the first major reform to be tackled. (See Table 1 for a chronology of activity.)

       At first sight, the choice of focusing on pension reform may seem odd, as this is the

major reform where the President was able to approve less of his initial proposal.

Resistance by Congress not only forced compromises in terms of policy proposal changes,

but even those proposals that did get through did so with great difficulty. Given that we are

arguing that the Brazilian system provides high levels of governability at relatively low

cost, pension reform would seem to be proof of just the opposite. However, the advantage

of focusing of pension reform is that this is perhaps the issue over which the preferences of

President Cardoso and his coalition most differed, but where nevertheless the President

insisted in pushing forward. Whereas most other issues appeared to be routinely approved

without much scrutiny from Congress, resulting in the high success rates for the President

described above, in this issue conflicts are more visible and it becomes easier to analyze

how these are dealt with. Given the critical state of the Brazilian pension system, any

reform would necessarily involve diminishing benefits considered as an acquired right by

most of society. The upshot was that practically all voters, and especially several well-

organized groups such as civil servants, military and judges, strongly opposed. Therefore

congressmen were very reluctant to be seen as supporting the reform, and what ensued was

the negotiation between the President and Congress that is described below. That Cardoso

insisted in the reforms, and that President Lula has done the same, despite its electoral
                                                                                        Alston
                                                                                         - 24 -
unpopularity, is testimony to the internalization by the president of broader issues such as

monetary and fiscal stability.20

       The Cardoso administration viewed pension reform as urgent because since 1997

contributions of workers no longer covered the expenditures on pensions. The fiscal

demand of funding pensions is in part reflected in the borrowing costs of the government

and has perverse consequences for price stability and continued economic growth. Outside

observers (economists in academia, the World Bank and IMF and the press) have noted the

lavish and unsustainable nature of Brazil’s pension system.

         The Brazilian pension system has broken just about every rule known to actuaries. It

         fixes no minimum retirement age, and allows a host of exceptions and special cases. It

         allows retired people (called, wonderfully inaccurately, "inactive workers") not only to

         draw more than one pension but also to go on getting a wage as well. Perhaps uniquely,

         Brazil not only allows some pensioners to retire on a higher income than they had when

         working, but also increases their pension every time their working colleagues get a wage

         rise. (The Economist, June 7, 1997).



       Although the need for change is not controversial, the devil is in the details. Those

who are already retired and those who are currently in the workforce have come to see the

benefits promised by the current rules as a property right. The courts have tended to agree.

Any solution necessarily implies redistribution and generates opposition, which is reflected

in Congress. In addition, many Congressmen have a direct stake in pension reform; 120

members of the 518-seat house collect pensions.21

<<Place Table 1 about here>>
       The first defeat to the Executive’s pension reform occurred in March 1996. The

proposed bill addressed some of the more blatant distortions of the pension system. It

required 35 years of contributions for men and 30 years for women, rather than simply
                                                                                       Alston
                                                                                         - 25 -
years of service. In the private sector there was no age requirement for retirement but in the

public sector the bill imposed a minimum retirement age of 55 for men and 50 for women,

which would be increased to 60 and 55 in 2001. The bill would have capped pensions for

the private sector at 10 times the minimum wage (approximately US$1000). Civil servants

would continue to receive the same as their pre-retirement wage but the current 20% bonus

on retirement would be deleted. The bill also eliminated the accumulation of multiple

pensions. Elected politicians who retired from another job were allowed to continue to

receive a salary in addition to their pension.

       Many issues in pension reform require a Constitutional amendment, which entails a

three-fifths majority of the House (308 of the 513 deputies) and the bill must be approved

in two separate votes in both the House and the Senate. After the first vote in the House the

government came up fourteen votes short. President Cardoso responded quickly and sent a

new bill to Congress in two weeks. This time Cardoso was very careful about his strategy.

He attenuated some of the more controversial parts of the reform and made intense use of

patronage, leading to passage in the House:

       For the next two weeks, the President went to work. He held a meeting with 64 PPB
       congressmen, hosted a gala luncheon with one leading critic in the PMDB, and made
       telephone calls to state governors. Just what went on behind closed doors is anyone's guess,
       though the evidence is mounting that it was plenty. By March 21st, order was restored. The
       lower house backed the welfare reform.
                 So all's well? Not quite. The welfare reform has been weakened, to tinker with
       encrusted privileges not dismantle them… Still, "we made the only advance that was
       possible," said a relieved Mr Cardoso, thanking the legislators who supported him. And he
       paid for it. ...
                 Pork was on the menu in several states. The first time round, all seven
       congressmen from Rondonia, a small state in the Amazon, voted against the government's
       welfare reform. After a cordial chat at the Planalto, all seven changed their minds. Soon
       $16m in federal cash will go to improve an important road in Rondonia, and one of the
       state's favourite sons will be heading the local arm of the federal telephone company. Pure
       coincidence, say officials in Brasilia. The drought-parched north-eastern state of Paraiba
       won money for an irrigation canal and reservoirs. A power plant was promised for Rio
       Grande do Sul. The government was no less open-handed with jobs and promotions. (The
       Economist, March 30, 1996)
                                                                                          Alston
                                                                                           - 26 -
       The difficulties encountered in approving pension reform signaled to the

government that the successful completion of more of its reforms would be a more

demanding task than had been anticipated. In the following month Cardoso reshuffled the

cabinet so as to strengthen the government’s base of support in Congress. In addition

Cardoso created a Special Ministry for Political Coordination whose purpose was to

intermediate and facilitate the channeling of the demands of coalition members to the

Executive, and the distribution of patronage in return for political support (Fleischer, 1998,

pg. 91). Keeping track of each legislator’s demands and voting performance is a formidable

task so it is natural that means to do this more effectively would be sought. To better

monitor legislative behavior over time the Ministry of Political Coordination created the

System of Legislative Performance (SIAL) that centralized all requests by legislators to any

governmental agency or Ministry, thus preventing any double granting of patronage or any

omission (Pereira, 1999, pg. 107-108). In announcing the creation of the ministry President

Cardoso justified that “… when Congress wants to say yes and can’t manage to do so it is

necessary that we get together to create conditions to make the dialogue flow better” (O

Estado de São Paulo, April 30 1996).22

       The second defeat to pension reform came in May 1998 when a proposal instituting

a minimum retirement age of 60 for men and 55 for women lost by one vote. The proposed

legislation would have significantly reduced the government’s pension bill. The bill was

defeated despite the Executive’s usual appeals and negotiation with its coalition in

Congress, a sign of how divisive this issue was, particularly in an election year. After the

upset the Executive announced that those deputies that had had their requests granted

before the vote and didn’t keep their part of the bargain risked having their individual
                                                                                                       Alston
                                                                                                        - 27 -
amendments to the budget shelved and their appointments to positions in the federal

government reexamined (Gazeta Mercantil, May 8 1998).

       Two weeks later the President sent another bill to Congress.23 This time Cardoso

changed the minimum age for retirement to 53 for men and 48 for women, valid only for

those already in the social security system. In terms of our model this change can be seen as

a compromise in the policy proposed by the government. The defeat in the House showed

that the coalition’s preferences, which are for a much lower age, were more intense than

expected. Even the negotiation of patronage did not guarantee the approval of the bill.

Rather than simply offer more patronage to assure the next vote, the Executive opted to

mitigate the age requirements. The new bill was approved and finally sealed in a second

vote in November 1998. For this final vote the Executive took no risks:

         President Cardoso dispensed with his trademark aloofness of his first term and openly
         pushed for his program, meeting with party leaders and sending telegrams summoning
         coalition members to vote. A bloc of 37 legislators representing agricultural businesses
         was promised by the Government that it would delay repayment of more than $1 billion
         in farmers' debt in return for their votes, said Hugo Biehl, leader of the farmers' bloc in
         Congress. The Government also granted farm businesses $280 million in concessions in
         exchange for their support. (The New York Times, November 6 1998.)

       Having exhausted his options regarding age requirements, the President turned to

addressing two different margins of pension reform: the size of the tax on income for

pensions and the number of taxpayers. This was especially important to the President

because it would provide some immediate financial relief at a time of imminent monetary

crisis.24 In December 1998 the House voted to increase pension contributions of civil

servants from 11% to 20% of their wages, and also to start taxing the pensions of retired

civil servants. This measure would provide an added U$2.2 billion dollars to the

government’s coffers over the next year. This measure was bitterly opposed by civil

servants who already saw their contributions as too high, and by the retired who saw their

pensions as too low. The measure was defeated in the House:
                                                                                                   Alston
                                                                                                    - 28 -
         As the vote on the pension approached, some coalition allies jostled for Cabinet posts.
         Others fielded calls from opponents of the bill. One hundred legislators just stayed
         away. … Political analysts say the pension bill failed because the Government, overly
         confident, neglected the legwork to rally support. The administration also packed too
         much into one measure, focusing on active and retired government workers along with
         other groups because of time pressure. (The New York Times, December 12 1998.)


       In the following month Congress called off its summer recess in an effort to vote a

series of backlogged bills. At the same time Cardoso changed several ministerial

appointments in order to adapt his Cabinet to changes in the newly elected Congress that

would commence in two months. In part, due to the failed pension reform the pressure on

the Real became overwhelming and Brazil set the Real afloat, resulting in a large

devaluation.

       Under this scenario Cardoso sent to the House a new measure to increase the

pension contributions of active and retired civil servants. This time the Executive argued

that pension reform was necessary to pull the country out of the economic crisis arising

from the devaluation of the Real. In addition the heightened need for the measure made

Cardoso more willing to exchange pork for support. Congress approved the bill by a safe

margin and instituted the new contributions immediately. But, a few months later (October

1999) the Supreme Court declared the law unconstitutional, forcing the government to

revert to previous levels of contributions and return the additional revenue that it had

obtained. Cardoso threatened to change the Constitution so as to allow higher levels of

contributions but sensing the difficulty of getting these changes through Congress

attempted only minor changes to the pension system during the remainder of his term

       In January 2003 the new Lula government stepped into office and immediately

announced that pensions would be the first major reform it would address. Lula hoped to

make the most of his high level of popularity and the momentum from his electoral victory

to tackle pension reform, taking advantage of the sense that a left wing government would
                                                                                         Alston
                                                                                          - 29 -
have greater legitimacy to impose the kinds of fiscal changes that are necessary

(Abranches, 2003:62). Interest groups immediately mobilized to pressure against losing

their so-called “acquired rights.” Federal judges, civil servants and the military were quick

to express their opposition to losing their privileges. By the end of 2003 the government

had succeeded in passing pension reform through Congress.25



Evidence on the Strategic use of Individual Budget Amendments

        In this section we analyze the relationship between the voting behavior of the

Deputies and the execution of their budget amendments by the President. In Brazil the

Executive first proposes the yearly budget and then it passes through Congress where it can

be amended by legislators. The amendments generally consist of expenditures in the

Congressmen’s district, with the hope of yielding both votes and rents from constituents.26

Following passage of the budget in Congress, the bill goes back to the President who has

discretion over implementation. The process gives the President enormous leverage for

rewards and punishments. The President frequently shelves some amendments on the

grounds that tax receipts are insufficient to cover all expenditures, though in many

instances there appears to be little fiscal merit to his veto.

        One of the implications of our model is that there should be a direct link between

the voting behavior of the members of Congress and the execution of their individual

budget amendments. In order to test this implication we focus on one particular instance

when the President had a proposal rejected and a couple of weeks later submitted a new

attenuated proposal that Congress approved. The specific case, already described above,

involved a second round defeat in the House of establishing a minimum age for retirement

of 60 for men and 55 for women (May 6, 1998), and the subsequent approval of a minimum
                                                                                       Alston
                                                                                        - 30 -
age of 53 for men and 48 for women (May 23, 1998). Our strategy is to regress the

percentage of the total value of each deputy’s amendments that were executed in 1998 on a

series of variables that should affect the President’s decision whether to execute those

amendments. The key explanatory variables will be two dummies: 1) those deputies who

switched their vote from no, against the President’s proposal to yes in favor of the

President’s proposal; and 2) those deputies who switched their vote from yes in favor of the

President’s proposal to no, against the President’s proposal. For pension reform a

supermajority is needed. The first vote tallied 307 in favor, 148 against and 11 abstentions,

missing the 308 approval mark by 1 vote. The second vote tallied 333 – 149 – 3, with 15

switching from no to yes and 9 from yes to no, the balance being explained by abstentions

and absences.27

       The other explanatory variables are: (i) Votes - the percentage of times the deputy

voted favorable to the President’s position in the 1995-1998 period; (ii) Exec. Amend. 1997

- the percentage of the total value of individual budget amendments that were executed in

the previous year, 1997; (iii) Position - a dummy that equals 1 if the deputy held a powerful

position within Congress during that year, such as speaker, party leader, committee

president or rapporteur; (iv) N0 Amendments - the number of amendments submitted by the

deputy that year; and (v) Seniority – the number of terms served by the deputy.

       Votes should capture the degree to which the President uses the execution of the

budget amendments to reward and punish those who vote for or against his proposals. To

control for the endogeneity of voting behavior we estimated Votes simultaneously using

instruments, including dummies identifying whether the deputy was a member of a party in

the core coalition, on the fringe of the coalition or in the opposition.28
                                                                                        Alston
                                                                                         - 31 -
       Exec. Amend. 1997 should capture any persistent capacity to get amendments

executed. For example, a given deputy might have a more capable staff than others, which

can affect her chances of execution. The Position and Seniority variables should capture the

effect of influence and experience, and the N0 Amendments is primarily a control variable

and should measure whether those who propose more amendments have a greater or lesser

likelihood of having amendments executed.

       <<Place Table 2 about here>>



       <<Place Table 3 about here>>


       We present descriptive statistics and results in Tables 1 and 2. Deputies who voted

in accord with the President received more pork in terms of budgetary amendments. A 10

percentage point increase in Votes (.4 of the standard deviation) increased the proportion of

the value of a deputy’s amendments that were executed by almost 3%. Not surprisingly

there appears to be considerable stasis in the reception of pork as indicated by the

coefficient on Exec. Amend. 1997. This may partially explain why the coefficients on

Position and Seniority are not reliably different from zero. Of course this does not rule out

that Position and Seniority have pay-offs other than budget amendment execution. The

coefficient on N0 Amendments is small; an additional amendment leads to an increase of

only 0.42% in the value of total amendments that are executed.29

       The results of most importance for our model of exchange of pork for policy are the

coefficients No to Yes and Yes to No. Switching votes from opposition to the President’s

proposal for establishing a minimum age for retirement to support for a minimum age

increases the value of amendments by 11%. Changing votes from yes to no had less of an

impact but was still reasonably large: a 5% decrease in pork. Overall the results are
                                                                                   Alston
                                                                                     - 32 -
consistent with our expectations and when combined with the qualitative evidence indicate

a strong case in favor of our model of gains from trade between legislators and the

President.

       Finally we test result 4 of our model: the President will deliver more benefits to

legislators who are in the coalition but further from his preferences than he will to those

who are closer. To do this we use the index created by Leoni (2000, 2002) as a measure of

the “ideological” position of each legislator and the President.30 This index is the first

dimension of a W-Nominate procedure (Poole and Rosenthal, 1985) which alone typically

explains over 90% of the variation of deputies’ votes in Brazil (Leoni, 2002). It can be

interpreted as the deputies’ position on a left-right spatial dimension. Our test consists of

explaining the value of each deputy’s congressionally approved amendments that the

President chose to execute in the 51nd legislature (1999-2002). For the test we fitted a

polynomial equation using the absolute value of the distance of each deputy to the

President.31 This strategy allows for a non-linear relationship between the distance of each

deputy to the President and the value of patronage received through amendments. Thus we

can see whether the President distributes benefits based on the ideological distance of the

deputy from the President. We are most interested in whether deputies who are slightly

further away receive more than those that are very close and very far. For 1999 and 2000

(Cardoso years) the predicted relationship between executed amendments and distance to

the President exhibited a pattern where the value of amendments first increased and then

decreased as the deputies became more divergent from the President’s preferences, see

figure 5.32 For 2001 and 2002 we found the same relationship but the statistical reliability

was weak.33

       <<Place Figure 4 about here>>
                                                                                         Alston
                                                                                          - 33 -
       Though this test is supportive of our model we stress that our statistical test only

controls for the value of amendments as pork whereas the President has several other forms

of patronage to trade, such as posts in government, as well as instruments to punish deviant

behavior. Nevertheless the results suggest that the “prodigal son” effect may hold.

Section 5 – Conclusion

       The media in Brazil commonly laments the exchange of pork for policy. Such

complaints ignore the counterfactual: in the absence of exchanging pork for policy the

President would accomplish less of his policy agenda and policies would be either highly

unstable or in gridlock. One could conceive of some other Congressional institution, such

as strong committees, as stabilizing policy. But, because of a differing electoral connections

between votes and policies, Presidential power as the stabilizing factor has the advantage

that the President, more so than members of Congress, should place a higher weight in his

utility function on the national interests of economic growth, income equality, economic

opportunity and price stabilization. The concerns of Congressmen are more likely more

parochial because Congressmen are in less of a position to internalize the gains from

growth enhancing policies whereas they do internalize the benefits from pork. With the

extant Congressional institutions in place, if Congress curtailed the power of the President

we envision even more pork and less prudent developmental policies.

       Prior to the new administration of Lula, the institutionally driven exchange model

that we present could not be separated from the administration of Cardoso. Fortunately for

us the new Lula government has behaved remarkably consistent with our model. After 8

years of fierce criticism and opposition to the policies of the Cardoso administration, Lula

in his first year in office has proposed objectives very similar to Cardoso, e.g., pension

reform and more independence for the Central Bank. Though the proposed policies have
                                                                                       Alston
                                                                                         - 34 -
surprised some analysts and irritated radicals within the Lula’s party, Lula’s agenda is

consistent with the extant incentives derived from the existence of strong Presidential

powers stipulated in the 1988 Constitution of Brazil.

    The College of Leaders is composed of the President of the House, the leaders of all

parties, and a non-voting deputy appointed by the President. It arose informally during the

drafting of the 1988 Constitution in order to expedite deliberations. Party leaders met prior

to the constitutional sessions to negotiate the proposals that would be taken to the floor.

The College seemed to suit the preferences of the party leaders and it became

institutionalized in the House’s legislative regiment in 1989 (Figueiredo and Limongi 1996:

31-36). The College of Leaders has close control of the legislative agenda deciding which

bills are taken to the floor. One of its main instruments for this purpose is the use of

urgency petitions (discharge petition), which take a bill from a committee and put it in the

next day’s order of business to be voted on the floor. Decisions within the College of

Leaders are taken by majority vote weighted by the proportion of deputies in each party, so

that the majority coalition is able to control the decision making process.

    Issuing provisional decrees may be a low cost way of establishing policy and should not

be interpreted as absolute power by the President. Given the veto power of Congress, the
                                                                                         Alston

President must be establishing decrees that make a majority of members of Congress better

off.
4
    In 2002 Congress changed the rules governing the use of decree power were changed,

diminishing the president’s discretion. Nevertheless provisional decrees are still a key

policy instrument for the executive.
5
    The provisional decrees are not necessarily in areas where the President has exclusive

rights of initiation.
6
    Figueiredo and Limongi (2000b) argue that the members of the Combined Budget

Committee are part of the coalition within Congress that aligns itself to the President.

    See Amorim Neto (1994 and 2000) for analysis of cabinet appointments in Brazil.
8
    See Figueiredo and Limongi (1996 and 2000a) for descriptive statistics. Some of the

proposals may be strategically watered down or withheld by the president as suggested by

Ames (2001). Nevertheless the record for the Brazilian presidents since 1988 and for

Fernando Henrique Cardoso in particular are still impressive. The model presented in the

next section explicitly shows how and when these trade-offs occur.

    This thesis is defended for example by Monteiro (1997) and Pessanha (1997), cited in

Amorim Neto (2000: pg.8) and by Monteiro (2000a,b).

     This is a controversial issue among students of Brazilian politics. The existence of party

discipline within Congress has been strongly argued by Figueiredo and Limongi (1996,

2000a, pg.162). Examining the data for the period of 1989-98 they show that when a party

in the coalition supported the President, its individual members generally did too, and when

the party did not support the President on an issue, most members followed the party. The

lack of party discipline on the other hand has been argued by Ames (1995a,b, 2001),

Mainwaring (1993, 1999), Mainwaring and Shugart (1997) and Lamounier (1994a,b).

     Leoni (2000 and 2002), applied the W-NOMINATE procedure (Poole and Rosenthal

1997) to the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies using roll call data from 1988 to 1998. His

results show that the first spatial dimension explains over 90% of the deputies’ individual

votes for the 50th legislature (F.H. Cardoso, 1995-98). This justifies the use of a single

dimensional policy issue in the model presented here. Also, the results show a clear spatial

divide between the government’s coalition (PMDB, PSDB, PPB, PTB and PFL) and the

opposition. Considering the first dimension the spatial location of the medians of the major

parties in the 50th legislature are as follows (range from –1 to1):

PT -0.826, PDT -0.514, PMDB 0.435, PSDB 0.457, PPB 0.518, PTB 0.546, PFL 0.682.
12
     We thank an anonymous referee for suggestions on modifications to our original model.
13
     The empirical section of this paper will use pension reform to test our model and

retirement age was one of the major policy concerns of Cardoso and now Lula. Both

Presidents preferred a higher minimum age than the median of each of the parties.

14
     Note that this is different from K iSQ (⋅) .

15
     If there were a coordinating mechanism within the coalition that would enable them to

credibly commit to a veto even when the President’s offer was in the interest of some

members then the coalition would be a position to extract the lion’s share of the gains from

trade.
16
     There may also be a public opinion component to this cost given that the media tends to

denounce the use of patronage as if it were less than legitimate.
17
     Clearly this creates an incentive for coalition members to falsify their preferences so as to

obtain more patronage and a disincentive for the like-minded parties to remain loyal.

Because our model is a one-shot game it cannot be used to address this issue, which is
                                                                                           Alston
                                                                                            - 56 -

inherently dynamic. However, we note once again that these perverse incentives are partly

checked by the recurring nature of the relationship as well as (when this is the case) by the

existence of a supramajority. Also, in a congressional setting it is not easy for a legislator to

falsify his/her preferences as their history, past behavior, constituency links etc. are

constantly scrutinized and are consequently well known by other players.
18
     We thank an anonymous referee for bringing Synder’s article to our attention.
19
     Other authors that have stressed the importance of patronage in executive-legislative

relations in Brazil include Ames (1995a,b), Amorim Neto (1994, 2000), Figueiredo and

Limongi (1996), Pereira (1999), Santos (1997).

     Although the major objective of reforming the pension system should be to avoid the

bankruptcy of the social security system and to establish a system that is fair and feasible, it

is probable that the President may be primarily concerned with reducing the large deficits

generated by the system, which have important short term consequences on the economy’s

performance for which the president is seen as directly responsible by voters.

22
     The creation of the Special Ministry for Political Coordination is consistent with Result 2

from our model: changes that reduce the cost of transacting between the Executive and the

coalition, lead to greater gains from trade and policy outcomes more favorable to the

Executive. The purpose of the new ministry was to facilitate transactions and thereby

prevent future defeats in Congress.
23
     Below we examine the impact of the votes on pension reform May 6 and May 23 of 1998

on the President’s approval of budgetary amendments.
24
     By this time there was a widespread belief that the Brazilian Real was substantially

overvalued.
                                                                                           Alston
                                                                                            - 57 -
25
     It is noteworthy that a left-wing government that strongly opposed the reform proposed

by its successor, adopted basically the same proposal and pursued it in Congress using the

same methods based on distribution of patronage, which it customarily criticized as

immoral and illegitimate. This behavior is consistent with our framework of executive-

legislative relations in Brazil, as it postulates that the actors’ behavior is determined by

political institutions. Because these institutions did not change it is reassuring that political

behavior also remained the same.
26
     Samuels (2002) argues that the relationship between pork and re-election is indirect. In

return for pork, e.g. a construction contract, a construction company will give money for

financing a campaign which in turn improves the probability of a Congressmen of being re-

elected.
27
     Considering abstentions and absences as strategic did not significantly alter our results.
28
     Our determination of which instruments to use was based on the assumption that being a

member of the coalition or not affects how a deputy votes, which in turn affects the

execution of the deputy’s amendments.
29
     It could be argued that the choice of how many amendments to submit is affected by the

deputy’s expectation of having them approved and executed, in which case this variable is

endogenous. Treating N0 Amendments as endogenous reduced the size and significance of

the coefficient by did not affect the other results.
30
     See footnote 12. We thank Eduardo Leoni for calculating the index for the 51st legislature

for us.
31
     For this period we did not have the index for the President so we used instead the index

of the government’s leader in the House (Arnaldo Madeira), which was 0.74 on a scale
                                                                                          Alston

from –1 to 1. This would put the President in the 25th rightmost spot amongst

approximately 600 deputies.

     The estimated relationships are:

1999 Value Executed = 722,453.14 + 412,215.91 Distance – 464,762.25 Distance2

                            (5.69)         (2.44)                 (-4.64)

33
     This could be due to the use of other Presidential powers, e.g. the use of patronage. We

did find very similar results for the earlier 50st legislature. We chose not to report those

results because instead of value of amendments we only have data on the proportion of the

value of approved amendments that were appropriated.
