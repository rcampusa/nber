                                           ABSTRACT

Governments and non-profits devote substantial resources to increasing take-up of the Earned
Income Tax Credit (EITC) through educational outreach. We study a different approach: policies
that encourage tax filing. In a large field experiment, we find that IRS letters about free tax
preparation modestly increased filing, with a large share of the new filers claiming the EITC. The
results suggest policies that increase filing can be an effective way to increase take-up of tax-
administered social benefits, even policies that do not raise awareness or directly target the
benefit in other ways.

1     Introduction

Incomplete take-up of social benefits is an important concern among policy-makers and ad-
vocates. For example, an estimated one in five of the individuals who qualify for the Earned
Income Tax Credit (EITC) ≠ the largest anti-poverty program in the United States today ≠
fail to claim it (IRS, 2020). A common strategy for increasing take-up is to conduct informa-
tional outreach to eligible but non-participating individuals. Along these lines, governments
and non-profits spend millions of dollars annually on informational outreach efforts to en-
courage EITC participation and a number of states require employers to send notifications
to their employees each year (Goldin, 2018).
    In this paper we consider a different approach to raising benefit take-up that draws on
three contemporary features of the United States safety net. First, a large and growing share
of income-support programs are administered through the tax code (Tahk, 2013). Second,
in recent years the vast majority of taxpayers have prepared their tax returns with software
assistance (either purchased themselves or via a professional preparer) (IRS, 2018a). Third,
approximately two-thirds of individuals who qualify for but fail to claim the EITC do not file
a tax return (Census, 2013). Together, these facts suggest a potential way to increase take-up
for a tax-administered program is simply to induce individuals who qualify for the program
to file a tax return. In particular, tax preparation software prompts taxpayers to provide
all information necessary to determine eligibility for these benefits and automatically maps
their answers into a completed tax return. As a result, filing a return with these methods
should typically result in taxpayers taking up all tax-administered benefits for which they
qualify, even benefits of which they are unaware.1
    To shed light on this approach, we analyzed an experimental outreach intervention con-
ducted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) directed at individuals who did not file a tax
   1
     Low-income taxpayers tend not to distinguish the EITC from other tax code provisions that contribute
to their refund (Tach and Halpern-Meekin, 2014). Despite the outreach described above, awareness of the
EITC is far from universal, and is particularly low among Hispanics and among those who have completed
fewer years of schooling (Maag et al., 2005).



                                                   2
return during the prior year. To induce this group to file a tax return using an assisted
preparation method, the intervention targeted the perceived financial cost of using these
methods ≠ a potentially important barrier to filing. Specifically, the intervention consisted
of a one-time letter providing information about free, IRS-sponsored in-person or software-
assisted tax preparation methods ≠ filing methods that are available to approximately 70%
of taxpayers but that are used by only a small share of that group.
       Our analysis of the intervention yields mixed results. On the one hand, we observe statis-
tically significant but fairly modest effects of the intervention on filing rates (an increase of
approximately 1 percentage point), suggesting that the intervention did not increase aware-
ness of the free filing methods or that the financial cost of tax preparation is not the primary
barrier to filing. On the other hand, we find that among those who filed a tax return because
of the intervention, the vast majority (approximately 80%) claimed a tax refund. We also
observe a statistically significant increase in EITC claims ≠ approximately 43% of the new
filers claimed the credit with an average credit amount of $861. Thus, although the specific
intervention we study was only moderately effective at causing nonfilers to file a return, our
results underscore the potential of policies that increase tax filing as a method for raising
the take-up of tax-administered social benefits.
       We contribute to an established literature in public economics that studies barriers to
social benefit take-up and program participation (Currie, 2006). Evaluations of interventions
that aim to increase EITC awareness ≠ the most common approach to increasing take-up ≠
have mostly found zero or small effects on EITC claiming (Cranor, Kotb and Goldin, 2019;
Chetty and Saez, 2013; Guyton et al., 2016; Jones, 2010; Linos et al., 2020). Bhargava
and Manoli (2015) and Manoli and Turner (2014) document substantial effects from IRS
notices to filers who appear to have missed the EITC; however, those interventions combined
promoting awareness with a simplified process for claiming the credit, making it difficult
to distinguish which element led to the increased EITC claiming.2 Outside of the EITC
   2
    Relative to our intervention, these studies also focus on a different population ≠ i.e., individuals who
have already filed a tax return establishing their likely eligibility for the credit.


                                                     3
context, evaluations of awareness interventions have yielded mixed results, with a few studies
showing substantial effects (e.g., Armour, 2018; Finkelstein and Notowidigdo, 2019), but
most finding either no effect or effects that are modest in magnitude (e.g., Bettinger et al.,
2012; Bergman, Denning and Manoli, 2019; SBST, 2016). In contrast, the indirect approach
for increasing EITC take-up that we focus upon does not require instilling awareness of the
credit's existence or of its complicated eligibility rules.
   Several prior papers have shed light on specific aspects of the link between tax filing
with an assisted preparation method and EITC take-up. Kopczuk and Pop-Eleches (2007)
exploit the staggered introduction of state electronic filing programs to study how electronic
filing shapes EITC claiming. They find a positive effect of these programs on EITC claiming
but cannot distinguish whether the increase in take-up is due to an increase in tax filing
or to changes in preparation method among current filers. Gunter (2019) also studies the
relationship between electronic filing and EITC claiming, drawing on state and time variation
in broadband internet access. Gunter finds that broadband access leads to more electronic
filing of tax returns, but no positive effect on EITC participation and observes mixed evidence
on tax filing rates. Finally, Ramnath and Tong (2017) study the effects of the 2008 Economic
Stimulus Act, which provided an additional one-time financial incentive to file a tax return.
They find this policy raised both tax filing and EITC claiming. Although this paper relied on
a different identification strategy than ours (quasi-experimental versus random variation) and
targeted a different element of the tax filing decision (the financial benefits versus perceived
costs of filing a return), its findings are consistent with our hypothesis that policies that raise
filing rates can be an effective method for increasing EITC take-up, even when the policy
itself has no direct connection to the EITC.

2     Background

This section provides background information on the EITC, tax preparation methods, and
tax filing.


2.1     Take-Up of the Earned Income Tax Credit

The EITC is the largest anti-poverty program in the United States today. Operating through
the tax code, it provides a refundable credit to low-income taxpayers who have positive
earnings from employment or other work. Over 25 million taxpayers claimed the credit in
2018; among those who qualify, the credit amount varies by income and by family size, with
maximum benefits ranging from $519 for taxpayers without children to $6,431 for taxpayers
with three or more children. In that year, the average benefit amount among EITC-claimants
was approximately $2,500 (IRS, 2018b).
    Notwithstanding the financial value of claiming the credit, a significant share of those
who appear to qualify for the EITC fail to claim it. In recent years, for example, the
EITC take-up rate has been estimated to be between 78 and 80% (IRS, 2020). Among the
approximately 5 million low-income individuals who appear to qualify for but not claim the
EITC each year, approximately two-thirds do not file a tax return. Among filers, the EITC
take-up rate is approximately 92% (Census, 2013). The relatively high take-up rate among
filers is likely due to both the widespread use of assisted tax preparation methods (discussed
below) as well as the success of automated IRS notices that inform apparently eligible but
non-claiming filers of the EITC and provide a simplified process for amending one's return
to claim it (Bhargava and Manoli, 2015; Manoli and Turner, 2014).
    Incomplete take-up of the EITC has been a persistent policy concern, motivating signif-
icant investments in outreach by governments and non-profits, such as flyers, social media
campaigns, direct mailings, and "street teams" organized to canvas low-income communities
(see Goldin (2018) for a summary of such efforts). In addition, certain states and cities



                                              5
(and in some cases, the federal government) require employers to mail annual reminders to
their employees about the EITC; Cranor, Kotb and Goldin (2019) estimate that in 2016,
such requirements covered over 46 million employees. Note that the efforts described in this
paragraph aim to increase EITC take-up by increasing awareness of the credit.


2.2       Tax Filing

In the United States, individuals who owe an income tax balance due are required to prepare
and file an annual income tax return during the subsequent calendar year. In contrast,
individuals who are owed a tax refund ≠ because of refundable tax credits like the EITC or
the Child Tax Credit or from over-withholding ≠ generally face no legal consequence from
failing to file a return. During the 2018 filing season, approximately 88% of the potential
taxpayers appearing on information returns filed a tax return.
       Among filers, most taxpayers use one of several methods to file their tax return. First,
they may file their tax return by paper, without assistance. The share of individuals prepar-
ing their returns in this way has fallen in recent years, to approximately 4% during the 2018
filing season. Second, and much more commonly, taxpayers may file using a professional
tax preparer, such as an accountant, lawyer, or other trained professional (e.g., an employee
of an HR Block or Liberty Tax). In 2018, approximately 55% percent of taxpayers used
paid preparers to help file their returns. Third, taxpayers may file their own returns using
commercial software, such as TurboTax (approximately 41% of returns filed during 2018).
       Additionally, the IRS facilitates two free assisted tax preparation services: the Volunteer
Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program and the Free File program.3 VITA offers free in-
person tax preparation services from IRS-certified volunteers to taxpayers whose income for
the year is less than or equal to an annually adjusted threshold ($55,000 for the 2019 filing
   3
     In addition to VITA and Free File, the IRS operates the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) program,
which provides free tax preparation assistance targeted at taxpayers aged 60 and above. Other than the
difference in eligibility requirements, TCE sites resemble VITA sites, and there is significant overlap in the
administration of the two programs. In our empirical analysis, we treat taxpayers who prepare their return
at a TCE site as if they had used a VITA site.


                                                      6
season). VITA is available to the vast majority of taxpayers whose incomes fall below this
threshold, although certain complicated but uncommon tax situations are excluded from the
program's scope, such as taxpayers who claim a net loss from operating a business.4
      The Free File program is a partnership between the IRS and a consortium of for-
profit firms providing specialized commercial tax software such as HR Block and TurboTax.
Through the program, participating companies offer free versions of their online tax prepa-
ration software to qualifying individuals. Eligibility for the Free File program is determined
based on a taxpayer's income. By agreement, the annual income threshold is set so that
70 percent of the tax filing population will qualify for the program ($66,000 for the 2019
filing season). In addition, each company sets its own (more restrictive) eligibility conditions
concerning which taxpayers qualify for its version of the software based on characteristics
such as income, age, military status, and EITC eligibility. Depending on the company and
the taxpayer's state, the Free File software may also provide a free state income tax return.
Taxpayers participate in the Free File program by initiating their return through the IRS's
Free File website.
      Despite broad eligibility for Free File and VITA, the share of taxpayers using these
services has consistently been quite low. For tax year 2018, among taxpayers whose incomes
qualified them to participate in Free File, approximately 2% filed their taxes using the
program. In the same year, with respect to VITA, approximately 3% of the taxpayers whose
incomes qualified them to participate in VITA prepared their taxes through the program.
Because many nonfilers would have qualified for these programs had they chosen to file,
the overall take-up rate was even lower than these figures suggest. A potentially important
factor driving the low rate of participation in these programs may be a lack of awareness in
the programs' existence among qualifying taxpayers (e.g., TIGTA, 2020).

3         Experimental Sample and Design

During early 2019 (i.e., the prescribed time period for filing 2018 tax returns), the IRS
conducted an experiment in which certain individuals were mailed informational letters de-
scribing the availability of free assisted tax preparation methods.
        The experimental population consisted of taxpayers who did not file a tax return for the
prior tax year (2017), but who, based upon information returns filed with the IRS, appeared
to have 2017 income above zero and below $55,000 - the maximum threshold to qualify
for free assistance through both Free File and VITA. In addition, we restricted the sample
to individuals who lived within 30 miles of at least two VITA sites. Finally, because the
intervention could not have affected their behavior, we excluded from the sample individuals
who filed a 2018 tax return before the experimental letters were sent (i.e., returns posted
to the IRS database prior to mid-March, 2019).5 After imposing these restrictions, the final
experimental sample consisted of 1,804,420 individuals.
        The experimental intervention consisted of a one-time letter from IRS addressed to the
taxpayer. The letters contained information about free filing programs ≠ either Free File,
VITA, or both.6 Individuals were randomly assigned across letter variants (collectively,
56,015 letters) or to a control group that did not receive a letter (see Appendix Table A.1
for more details).7 A sample letter is contained in Appendix Figure A.1.
        Our data come from administrative tax records housed at the IRS. For each individual
in our experimental sample, we observe tax filing, return preparation method, filed returns,
and third-party information reports for tax years 2017 through 2019. To reduce the influence
    5
     Although we intended for the IRS to mail the letters at the start of the 2019 filing season (late-January),
the government shutdown that occurred during that time period delayed the mailings until the second week
of March, 2019.
   6
     Treatment letters containing information on Free File directed taxpayers to either the main Free File
website or to an "eligibility wizard" page to assess eligibility; for the most part we pool those variants for
purposes of our analyses here. The VITA treatment letters included addresses and contact information for
two VITA sites closest to the taxpayer's address.
   7
     In conducting random assignment, individuals were stratified based on whether they: lived within 5
miles of at least one VITA site; had withheld income in 2017; were over 30 years old; and had apparent
income of at least $25,000.



                                                       8
of outliers, we winsorized the non-categorical variables used in our analysis at the 1% and
99% levels. We supplemented this administrative data with information about undeliverable
letters from the contractor hired by IRS to conduct the mailing.



4         Results

Table 1 provides summary statistics and balance checks for the experimental sample of
nonfilers. Column 1 provides characteristics for the full experimental sample. Individuals in
the sample tended to be relatively young (with a mean age of 35), disproportionately male
(58% of the sample), and low income (approximately $13,300) during 2017. As shown in
Columns 2-4, these characteristics appear balanced across the treatment and control groups.8


4.1        Main Filing Outcomes

We next investigate the effect of the intervention on tax filing behaviors. To account for the
fact that not all letters were successfully delivered to the intended recipient, and that we do
not know which individuals in the control group would have had their letters returned as
undeliverable had they (counter-factually) been assigned to the treatment group, we report
specifications that instrument for successful delivery with treatment status.9 Appendix Table
A.3 reports the first stage of this specification; approximately 38% percent of letters were
returned to the IRS as undeliverable.
        Table 2 reports the effect of the intervention on decisions relating to tax return filing.10
Column 1 shows the overall effect on tax filing (across all filing methods). Individuals who
received the letters were 0.74 percentage points more likely to file a 2018 tax return ≠ a
3.5% relative increase relative to the control group mean. Panel A of Figure 1 investigates
    8
     Appendix Table A.2 shows that these characteristics appear balanced across treatment variants as well.
    9
     Of course, we do not observe whether the intended recipient of a successful delivery actually opened or
read the letter, or whether it reached the intended individual residing at an address.
  10
     Appendix Table A.4 shows the reduced form effect of the intervention on these outcomes. We observe
similar effects when controlling for randomization strata indicators (Appendix Table A.5).



                                                     9
the timing of this effect and shows that it is concentrated in the first few weeks following
treatment, and, to a lesser extent, the weeks shortly after the tax filing deadline (when most
returns filed around the deadline post to the IRS database).
   We next explore the effect of the intervention on filing method. Column 2 shows that
the letters increased the share of individuals using a free tax preparation method by 0.39
percentage points ≠ an effect that is modest in absolute magnitude but that represents a 33%
increase relative to the control group of mean. Panel B of Figure 1 shows that the increase
in free filing methods appears largest in the first few weeks after the treatment was sent.
Columns 1 and 2 of Appendix Table A.6 show that the increase in free filing methods was
driven by roughly equal increases in Free File and VITA.11
   Importantly, the results in Columns 1 and 2 suggest that the effect of the intervention
was not limited to increasing the use of free methods ≠ the point estimate on filing was twice
as large as the point estimate on the use of free preparation methods. In principle, the letters
could reduce the use of other filing methods by prompting individuals to substitute to free
methods or, alternatively, could increase the use of other methods by preventing taxpayers
from forgetting to file a return or by channelling individuals who intend to use Free File
toward commercial software (Elliott, 2019; Elliott and Waldron, 2019). Columns 3 and 4
of Appendix Table A.6 investigate these possibilities; we find positive, but statistically in-
significant, effects on the use of commercial software and paid in-person preparers. Similarly,
Column 5 of Appendix Table A.6 shows no effect of the letters on the share of individuals
who file a tax return without computer or professional assistance.
   Column 3 of Table 2 turns to the effect of the letters on EITC claiming. We estimate the
letters increased the share of individuals claiming the EITC by 0.32 percentage points, a 7%
increase relative to the control group mean. Again, we observe that the increase in EITC
claims appears in the first few weeks following the mailing of the letters (Panel C of Figure
1), consistent with the hypothesized link between filing and EITC-claiming. In addition,
  11
     Appendix Table A.7 explores these effects by treatment variant and confirms that treatments focusing
on a particular free method were associated with larger increases in use of that method.


                                                   10
apart from EITC claims, filing a return may yield a refund because of other refundable
credits or over-withholding, or alternatively, may generate a balance due because of other
tax liabilities. To assess the overall effect of the intervention on taxpayer refunds, Column 4
of Table 2 and Panel D of Figure 1 investigate the effect of the intervention on the likelihood
of filing a return that generates a refund. We estimate an effect of 0.60 percentage points -
a 4% increase relative to the control group mean.
       Given that the intervention appears to increase the number of EITC claims and returns
filed for refund, we next investigate more formally the characteristics of the returns that were
filed because of the intervention. To do so, we use the intervention to instrument for the
effect of filing on EITC and refund claiming. As above, our interpretation of this analysis
requires that the effect of the intervention on tax filing was monotonic (i.e., that the letters
did not cause anyone to choose not to file a return) and that the intervention did not affect
EITC or refund claiming among those who would have filed even absent the intervention.12
       Table 4 contains the results of this analysis. We find that approximately 43% of the
individuals who filed a return because of the intervention claimed the EITC (Column 1) and
that the average amount of EITC claimed among these marginal filers was $861 (Column
2). In addition, we estimate that approximately 80% of the returns filed because of the
intervention generated an overall refund (Column 3), with an average refund amount of
approximately $2000 (Column 4). The magnitude of this refund is substantial, suggesting
that the new filers benefitted by claiming other refundable credits or a refund from over-
withholding, although we caution that the point estimate for the overall refund amount is
imprecisely estimated.
       To the extent that the intervention provided new information about free filing methods,
  12
     Although neither of these assumptions is directly testable, both seem likely to hold within our setting.
With respect to monotonicity, there is little reason to expect a letter about free tax preparation methods
would discourage someone from filing. With respect to the exclusion restriction, the assumption could be
violated if the intervention caused current filers to switch to a filing method for which they are more or less
likely to claim the EITC or receive a refund, such as by substituting from paid to free methods. However,
we observe an absolute increase in the share of individuals using paid methods following the intervention,
rather than the reduction one might expect if such substitution was significant.



                                                      11
we may expect to see effects on filing and EITC claiming in subsequent years as well. Simi-
larly, if the intervention served as a reminder to file, that reminder may have had persistent
effects. Table 3 investigates the effect of the intervention on tax filing outcomes for 2019, the
second year following the intervention. We find positive, but small and statistically signifi-
cant effects of receiving a letter on subsequent year use of free tax preparation, filing, and
EITC claiming. These finding are consistent with Guyton et al. (2016), which finds that
increases in EITC claiming due to EITC informational outreach do not persist in subsequent
years.13
         Finally, we report results from several additional analyses to assess the validity and
robustness of our results. Appendix Figure A.2 presents results from a permutation test
for the reduced form effect of the intervention for our main filing outcomes; the resulting
p-values are comparable to those reported in Table 2. Appendix Table A.8 replicates the
analyses in Table 2, but uses each treatment variant as a distinct instrument for a successful
letter delivery. The results are nearly identical to those in our main specification. Last, as
a placebo test, Appendix Table A.9 investigates the effect of the letters on tax returns filed
during the early weeks of 2018, prior to the intervention being sent out.14 As expected, we
observe no statistically significant differences in the treatment and control group means for
use of free filing, EITC claiming, or refund claiming among this set of individuals.



5         Discussion

We evaluate an informational letter sent by the IRS to nonfilers describing the availability
of free tax preparation methods. We estimate that this intervention led to modest increases
in tax filing, EITC claiming, and the use of free tax preparation methods. We interpret the
    13
     Note that the control group's 2019 filing rate was twice as high in 2019 compared to 2018, likely due to
the filing requirement contained in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. This increase
may have swamped any persistence in our intervention's effects.
  14
     As described above, individuals who filed during this time period were initially assigned to either the
treatment or control group but were ultimately excluded from the sample after a government shutdown
delayed the mailing.

results as evidence that policies that increase tax filing can be an effective way to increase
EITC take-up ≠ even policies that do not increase awareness of the credit or directly target
the credit in other ways.
       Although our results suggest a strong link between tax filing and EITC take-up, the spe-
cific intervention we studied was only modestly successful at increasing filing, and therefore,
yielded only a small (absolute) increase in EITC participation.15 Thus, although interven-
tions like the one we studied do not appear to be a silver bullet for raising EITC take-up,
our findings suggest that policies that do succeed at significantly raising filing rates among
EITC-eligible individuals would be quite effective at achieving this goal. The challenge of
course is identifying which policies those would be. One set of possibilities include policies
that would more drastically reduce the financial and non-financial costs of tax filing, such as
if the IRS were to mail tax returns that were pre-populated with the taxpayer's information
from administrative records and prior tax years (Bankman, 2008). A different alternative for
increasing filing would be to adopt policies that make filing more beneficial, such as by ex-
panding refundable credits, adjusting withholding schedules (Jones, 2012), or administering
additional social benefit programs through the tax code (Alm et al., 2012).




  15
    In this regard, our main conclusion concerning the link between filing and take-up is consistent with
the findings of another recent paper, Linos et al. (2020), which studies a similar intervention conducted in
parallel with our own, and with prior studies in the literature such as Gunter (2019) and Cranor, Kotb and
Goldin (2019), all of which find no positive effects on either filing or, potentially as a result, on EITC take-up.

The Figure displays the estimated effect of receiving one of the experimental letters on tax filing outcomes
for tax year 2018 during the specified week following the intervention. The tax filing outcomes shown in
each panel are as follows: whether the individual filed a tax return (Panel A); whether the individual filed
a tax return through the VITA or Free File program (Panel B); whether the individual claimed the EITC
(Panel C); whether the individual filed a return claiming a refund (Panel D). Units are percentage points
(0-100). In each panel, week 1 refers to the 12th week of the year, beginning on March 18, 2019. Each
estimate is derived from a two-stage least-squares specification in which an indicator for successful letter
delivery is instrumented for by an indicator for treatment status. Bars denote the 95% confidence interval
derived from heteroskedasticity robust standard errors.

The table presents summary statistics for individuals in the full sample of 2017 nonfilers (Column
1), the pooled treatment group (Column 2), and the control group (Column 3). Column 4 presents
the p-value for a test of equality between the treatment and control group means. All characteristics
are based on data for tax year 2017 (the pre-intervention year). Age and sex are derived from
Social Security Administration records housed by the IRS. Income is derived from information
returns such as Form W-2 and 1099-Misc. "Any Wages" indicates the presence of income reported
on Form W-2. "Any Withholding" indicates the presence of withheld income on one or more of the
individual's information returns. The joint test p-value is derived from a test of the null hypothesis
that each characteristic listed in the table is equal between the treatment and control groups.

Each panel of the figure plots the distribution of t-statistics corresponding to the estimated reduced form
effect of the intervention on the specified outcome variable, generated from 500 random reassignments of
the treatment indicator variable across individuals in the experimental sample. The reassignments were
conducted with the "ritest" Stata command (Heﬂ, 2017). The vertical line denotes the t-statistic estimated
using the actual treatment assignment. The outcomes specified in panels (a)-(d) correspond to the
outcomes evaluated in Columns (1)-(4) of Table 2. The p-values implied by the analyses depicted in panels
(a) through (d) are, respectively: 0.008, <0.001, 0.026, and 0.014.

Notes: The table contains summary statistics and balance checks relating to the assignment
of individuals across treatment variants. Each individual included in the table was assigned to
receive one of the treatment variants. Columns (1)-(5) provide summary statistics for individuals
assigned to Treatments (1)-(5), respectively. Column 6 presents the p-value for a test of equality
across the treatment group means. All characteristics are based on data for tax year 2017 (the
pre-intervention year). Age and sex are derived from Social Security Administration records housed
by the IRS. Income is derived from information returns such as Form W-2 and 1099-Misc. "Any
Wages" indicates the presence of income reported on Form W-2. "Any Withholding" indicates the
presence of withheld income on one or more of the individual's information returns.

The table reports the estimated effect of receiving one of the experimental letters on tax filing
outcomes for tax year 2018 among the subset of the sample that filed a 2018 return during the first
12 weeks of 2019 (i.e., before the IRS letters were mailed). Filing date for a return is proxied by
the date that the return is posted to the IRS database. Units are percentage points (0-100). Each
column is derived from a two-stage least-squares specification in which an indicator for successful
letter delivery is instrumented for by an indicator for treatment status. The outcome variables
are as follows: whether the individual filed a tax return through the VITA or Free File program
(Column 1); whether the individual claimed the EITC (Column 2); whether the individual filed
a return claiming a refund (Column 3). Parentheses contain heteroskedasticity robust standard
errors. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.
