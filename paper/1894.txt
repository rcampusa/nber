                             I. Introduction


      In the early 1980's, several LDC's   with   very large debts to foreign
 banks did not meet the payments schedules to which they had originally

 agreed. Various participants in, and observers of, these markets began

 to speak of a crisis, one which they feared might shake the banking

 system of the developed countries. So far there has been no dramatic

 event to resolve the status of these loans. The absence of overt clues

 to what will happen to those involved with these debts generates a wide-

spread interest in a conceptual framework useful in interpreting the

current situation.

     In this paper, we seek to articulate very general principles for

looking at the most essential problems posed by international lending,

ones that will be common to the relationships of most sovereign debtors

and their creditors. This set of £oncepts is a necessary, although

admittedly not a sufficient, tool kit for understanding current events

and prescribing public policy.

     Our concern, then, is with the pure theory of sovereign lending or

country risk. We discuss the roles of borrowers, of lenders and of the

various public authorities who mediate between the two groups, or

regulate the lenders, or insure deposits in the banks. We make use of

the literature on LDC indebtedness, which is related to recent advances

in the general theory of credit markets. This work, in turn,

incorporates recent advances in the general theory of the economics of

information and the theory of games.

     Loans are a particular contractual arrangement between suppliers of

capital and the users of capital. The borrower promises to pay the

lender certain amounts at certain times. A paramount concern in
                                     2




 designing the contract is that the borrower may not be able to or may not

 wish to make payments under certain circumstances. The possibility that

 the lender will not recover his money is reflected not only in a high

 interest rate, but in the covenants of the loan contract. The purpose of

 these covenants is to protect the lender by precluding the borrower from

 engaging in certain activities, and ensuring that he engages in others.

 The loan contract also stipulates conditions under which the lender can

 intervene, e.g., in the event of a default on another loan.

      Credit markets, like labor markets, are characterized by implicit as

 well as explicit contracts. For example, it is frequently the case that

 a lender makes a short-term loan for a long-term investment. There is an

 understanding that the loan will be renewed, except under unusual circum-

 stances. The advantage of the short-term contract is that the lender can

insist on additional restrictions on the borrower to renew the loan. To

stipulate all of these restrictions on a conditional4jasjs beforehand, at

the time of the original loan, would have been virtually impossible.

What prevents the lender froii taking unfair advantage of the borrower

are, as usual, reputation and competition from other lenders.

     Consequently, the distinction between equity and debt, that the

borrower is required to repay the principal plus interest on the latter

and not on the former, becomes somewhat blurred.   Though indeed the

borrower is required to service a debt, there is no way that, in general,

the borrower can be forced to do so under all contingencies. Debt and

equity are both contingent claims, although they clearly differ in the

nature of the contingencies involved. What factors are observable, and

therefore can be used to condition contractual obligations, is an impor-

tant determinant of the relationship between debtors and creditors.
                                     3




 1.1 Defining Default

      We have not, so far, said what we mean by default. In a two- period

 model of the economy, default may easily be defined: Whenever the

 borrower gives resources to the lender that are less than the fixed

 amount that he is committed to pay the lender, then there is a default.

      In multi-period models, however, the concept is somewhat more

 elusive. A default occurs whenever the lender formally declares that the

borrower has violated a certain condition of the loan.' A loan may be

declared in default when a borrower refuses (or is unable) to pay another

loan. The lender does not have to declare a loan in default, however;

the contract only provides him the right to do so.

     Thus, in most situations, a default is a result of a set of

decisions, not the mechanical realization of some outcome. The proximate

cause is generally the result of the horrower's decision not to make all

or part of a loan payment that is due. But that decision, in turn, is

frequently the result of the lender's decision not to extend further

credit.

     When the relationship between debtor and creditor can, in principle,

last beyond the period in question, a violation of the repayment

schedule, with or without a default, is neither necessary nor sufficient

for the lender to realize less than the (present-discounted) value of the

loan. A failure to make current payments does not necessarily imply that

future payments will not be .ade, and conversely. This is one reason why

observers of, and participants in, the market cannot expect any very

overt sign of the status of these loans.

    There is therefore an ilportant difference between two-period and

finite horizon, but multi-period, models. Furthermore, as we shall show,
                                      4



 finite-horizon   and infinite-horizon models can have qualitatively quite

 different properties when lenders can only ensure repayment through

 exclusion from future borrowing.

     Much of the recent literature has failed to recognize these aspects

of default. Thus, some writers attempt to relate default to insolvency,

which arises in the case of unsecured loans when the borrower's debt

exceeds his net worth (presumably inclusive of the debt). This is

neither necessary nor sufficient for the declaration of a default. The

declaration of a default usually has a large cost associated with it; an

ongoing firm is almost always worth more than the value of its assets

sold in a bankruptcy sale.2 And in international banking, declarations

of default may trigger certain actions of bank regulators that are costly

to lenders, in the firs.t instance, and possibly to debtors as a

consequence. What is at stake is rnore than the distribution of claims

between debtors and creditors. More importantly, ma formal sense,

insolvency is not really an issue in lending. to foreign governlnents. The

debt of a country in almost all instances is less than the value of the

assets owned by nationals and the government of the country. There may

be limits on the extent to which governments can appropriate the assets,

but these limits themselves are, in general, not hard and fast

constraints, but involve trade-off s.3

     While some writers have linked default to insolvency, others have

linked it to illiquidity. A borrower with a positive net worth who

cannot convert the required portion of his net worth into a means of

payment is said to be illiquid. The question is: why would no supplier

of capital be willing to supply credit, if it were unambiguously clear

what the net worth of the asset were? Frequently, it is the withdrawal
                                     S




of credit that leads to the borrower's illiquidity; but it is precisely

this withdrawal of credit that the theory should explain.


1.2 Domestic Versus International Lending

       The ambiguity in the notion of default is relevant to both domestic

and international lending. But there are also very important differences

between the two, with consequences for the applicability of various

concepts. We review briefly three problems traditionally addressed in

theories of credit markets: enforcement, moral hazard and adverse

selection.

       One problem in all lending is enforcement, the difficulty in ensur-

ing that both sides of a contract adhere to its terms. Here, the partic-

ular concern is the difficulty of ensuring that the borrower pays the

lender. The major difference between domestic and international debt is

that the former are legal obligations, enforceable in courts. Another

difference is that, domestically, debtors who cannot meet their

obligations have the option of filing for bankruptcy. Repayment of

international debt, however, is largely voluntary; the penalties to be

imposed on a country that does not honor a contract are, at best,

indirect. On the other hand, there is no systematic procedure

corresponding to bankruptcy, by which a country that has undertaken an

excessive amount of debt can discharge its obligations and proceed on its

way.

       For similar reasons, collateral, which can be important

domestically, plays little role in international lending.4 If the

collateral is retained in the borrowing country, there is no mechanism by

which the creditor can seize it.    If the collateral is moved outside the

country where the creditor can seize it, the borrower will usually lose
                                     6




fully the use of it, so that the value of the loan is reduced by the

value of the collateral.5 A fully and effectively collateralized loan

would then be of no value to the borrower. As we shall see, the

inability to provide collateral may significantly exacerbate the problems

facing credit market participants.

     When making loans to borrowers within the developed countries, lenders

need to pay relatively little attention to enforcement problems, but

instead must worry about problems of moral hazard. These arise because

it is difficult for the lender to monitor actions of the borrower to

ensure that they do not affect adversely the prospects for debt service.

For instance, a firm may have an investment opportunity with low expected

return, but with the possibility of a high return under some circumstanc-

es. In the good states, the firm pays its creditors and reaps large net

benefits; otherwise, the firm goes bankrupt, and the creditor loses.

Such a project may be quite attractive to the firm, a'lthough quite

undesirable from the creditor's viewpoint.

     In international loans, such problems are much less prominent in the

relationship between country borrowers and their creditors. As we have

argued, the resources of the debtor are likely to be adequate to repay

the loans regardless. In a sense, it is the very importance of the

enforcement problem that, as we shall explain, keeps creditors from ever

lending so much that moral hazard problems involving choice among risky

investments become central. On the other hand, moral hazard problems may

arise if (1) borrowers can affect their susceptibility to penalties that

enforce payment; or (2) they can affect the likelihood that creditors

will impose penalties (if creditors cannot precommit fully); or (3) the

total amount that they have borrowed cannot be observed by individual
                                     7




lenders. In each of these situations, borrowers' actions affect the

probability of payment.

     Moral hazard issues also arise in the relationship between banks and

the governmental insurers of bank deposits. This insurance obviates the

need for depositors to monitor adequately bank portfolios. There is a

consequent incentive for banks to lend in a risky fashion, hoping for big

profits but able to transfer large losses to their insurers. The

traditional role for bank regulators is to prevent these actions by rules

on portfolio composition, but these have been loosely designed, and have

not prevented the lending of multiples of bank capital to LDC's.

     A third set of problems facing lenders are ones of adverse selec-

tion. Here the difficulty is one of ascertaining the characteristics of

a borrower, both transitory and permanent, -relevant to designing a

repayment schedule and judging whether.aborrower will adhere to it.

Without this ability, the lender is vulnerable to atttacting only those

borrowers who know that their. repayment prospects are poor or who c1ain

that they cannot pay when they can. In many cases, however, outside

lenders are as fully informed as domestic politicians about the country's

economic situation, and so adverse selection may be less important

internationally than domestically.

     In our view, then, the problems of moral hazard and adverse

selection deserve attention, but really central to— our understanding of

credit relations between developed and developing countries is

identifying the incentives for borrowers to repay, and for suppliers of

capital to continue supplying capital. As we shall show, actions of the

borrower (or lender) may affeét these incentives. To the extent that

borrowers can take actions that increase the likelihood€hat they will
                                   8




repay their loans, they will be better off. By doing so, they can

increase the willingness of lenders to lend. Similarly, to the extent

that lenders take actions that increase the likelihood that they will

continue to renew the loans, borrowers may be more willing to borrow and

repay.


                II. The Willingness-to-Pay of Borrowers


     In the introduction, we sketched our basic view, that in most

situations, what happens to a loan is a result of a series of decisions,

not the mechanical realization of some outcome. Thus, the analysis of

international credit markets must focus on how borrowers and lenders make

their decisions. Surprisingly, a few simple notions can help to delimit

the possible relationships between debtors and creditors. For instance,

the fact that loans are voluntary rules out situations in which all

future net transfers as of any date are always from the lender to the

borrower. Later on, we show that in an important class of models, ñèt

transfers also cannot always be from the borrower to the lender.

     In this section, we focus on the behavior of borrowers, and in the

next section, we turn to the lenders. In a fundamental sense, the

dichotomy is artificial: A borrower's willingness to pay depends criti-

cally on his beliefs about (1) the lender's resolve to penalize a recal-

citrant borrower, and (2) the lender's willingness to lend in the future.

For now, we assume that the potential penalties we discuss will always be

imposed.

11.1. The General Structure of Models With Penalties


      We begin with an extremely simple two-period model. A loan of

amount L is made in the first period with an obligation to repay r(L) in

the second period. The model ends after the second period, so that there

are no further considerations that affect the participants.

      If the borrower does not discharge this obligation, he suffers a

penalty, P expressed in the same units as r(L). The borrower's welfare

is a function U[L, xl which increases with the amount borrowed, L, and

decreases in the obligation imposed by the loan, x, where


                 r(L)        if he repays
(1)      x —
                P            if he defaults.


      The borrower who defaults receives total utility of



(2)      Ud =   U[L,    P1




in the second period. If he does service the debt as agreed, his utility

is




(3)              U[L, r(L)].
          Up



The borrower chooses to pay if



(4)      Up > Ud.



This comparison of alternatives is at the heart of a wiliingneSStOPaY

approach.
                                    10




      Under the assumptions that lenders are competitive and face an

opportunity cost of funds of i, the repayment lenders require is



(5)      r(L) =   (1+i)L.


Substituting (1), (2), (3), and (5) into (4) implies that repayment

occurs for



(6)      L <   P/(1+i).


      As long as lenders understand the borrower1s situation some central

conclusions follow:

(1) Borrowers may be credit constrained. If the borrower wishes to

borrow a little more than P/(1+i) at rate i, he cannot. On the other

hand, the borrower need not wish to borrow as much a"he can.

(2) There is never any inconsistency between a loan contract that says

the loan must be repaid with interest at rate i and what happens.

(3) Penalties are never imposed.

(4) If the borrower wants to borrow more, he benefits from an increase

in the penalty P.

(5)   If there is no penalty, one observes no lending rather than a rash

of loan-contract violations. At its simplest, willingness-to-pay is a

theory of rationing, not one of lender losses.


We use the simple model and its conclusions as a mechanism to organize

other formulations of the willingness-to-pay approach.

      For instance, one modification that undermines the fourth conclusion

on the welfare effects of enhanced penalties, while maintaining the
                                    11




others, can occur if the borrower is large, or if we consider

simultaneous increases in the penalties applied to a large number of

borrowers. An increase in P may then raise the world interest rate, to

the borrowers' detriment. In the extreme, if funds available for this

kind of lending are fixed, an increase in P raises i without raising L.


11.2 Models with Uncertainty


       Next, we begin to introduce uncertainty into the model, otherwise

returning to all the assumptions of eqs. (1) -   (5).   For simplicity,

assume that the penalty depends on the state of nature, s,



(la)     P =   P(s).


Utility of the borrower if he defa,Uts is



(2a)     Ud =   U[L,P,s],


and if he does not



(3a)     U      U[L,r(L),s],



where the argument s indicates that utility may depend on s in other ways

than through P. Note, however, that r(L), the amount of payment, does

not depend on s.

       The debtor pays off his obligations in all states s in S for which



(4a)      U >
                Ud
                                               12




and otherwise not, for s in S'. The borrower's expected utility is



            5   U   f(s)ds + 5
            S                   SI
                                     Uf(S)dS


where f(s) is the probability of state s.           If lenders are competitive,

risk-neutral and face a constant cost of funds i then



(5a)      it r(L) =     (1+i)L


where the probability of repayment is



(7a)        it =    5 f(s)ds.
                    S



       The existence of uncertainty means that payment may not be made, and

the penalty may be imposed. An increase in the penalty need not increase

a borrower's expected utility. While it will normally increase the

amount lent, to the borrower's benefit, in those states when the country

does not pay it may be worse off.6

       On the other hand, uncertainty need not imply it < 1 if the repayment

schedule can also be made contingent on the state of nature. In this

case, the state contingent repayment, r(L,s), is chosen so that              > Ud

for all s. This is the approach taken by Grossman and Van Huyck (1985).

The explicit legal contract, however, conventionally specifies a single

interest rate (or a single spread above the market rate). Lenders do not

have the scope to revise the contractual interest rate upward, unless the

borrower violates the contract. The contractually specified payment must

therefore be the maximum of payments in all possible states,
                                   13




r+(L) = max r (L,s). Any state s with r(L,s) <   r+   could then be

called a situation of excusable default, in the Grossman-Van Huyck

terminology. Penalties are only imposed if the country pays less than

r(L,s), not less than r+. This is one interpretation of the current

reschedulings. It presupposes that the state s can be observed by both

parties after the fact, and that disputes over what has happened do not

arise. The issue therefore remains of what situations can be used to

condition contracts.

     A further set of complications arise if the actions by the borrower

can affect the burden of the penalty. Actions that lenders perceive as

increasing the burden may improve the terms of loans. To do so such

actions must be observable by the lender and costly to reverse. Actions

that are unobservable but still raise the burden of the penalty give rise

to a whole range of moral hazard issues (Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981 and

1983).


11.3. The Nature of Penalties


     The simple models just discussed do not show how the penalty origi-

nates; its size is exogenously given and does not depend on the charac-

teristics of debtors or creditors. In fact, however, we believe that the

penalties available to creditors are rather indirect, and that

identifying their ultimate implications for debtors is one of the basic

issues in the pure theory of country risk. Only by modeling the penalty

realistically can one tell which countries are most susceptible to them.

     Eaton and Gersovitz (1981b) discuss some of the legislation that

potentially provides for penalties imposed by the U.S. government, while

Kaletsky (1985) provides a comprehensive review of the relevant legal,
                                  14




institutional and political issues. What concerns us here are two types

of exclusions that creditors can potentially impose on debtors: (1) an

embargo of future borrowing, and (2) various forms of interference with

the debtors' international transactions and transfers.

    Eaton and Gersovitz (1981a) consider what it means to a borrower to

be excluded from future loans. Some very simple situations in which such

a penalty has no force can be mentioned. First, such a penalty only

makes sense in a model with an infinite horizon. If there were a last

period, no loans would be repaid in that period since there would be no

future exclusion to worry about. Lenders knowing this would never make a

loan coming due in this period. But, this in turn would render a threat

of exclusion meaningless from the viewpoint of the penultimate period, so

no loan coming due in this period would be possible.     And so on, by

backward induction, the penalty would be unable to support any lending.

Second, even in an infinite-horizon world, such a penalty would be

ineffective if the model ever predicts that a point will be reached after

which the flow will always be from debtor to creditor, via arguments

similar to those just made.

     It is only when the future always holds some possibility of trans-

fers in both directions that this penalty becomes operative. It is for

this reason that Eaton and Gersovitz focus on a model in which the income

of the borrower alternates between low and high values, either in a

deterministic or stochastic way. If borrowers are risk averse, the

demand for loans derives from a desire for consumption smoothing.        The

cost of the denial of credit is that the country must resort to other

methods for consumption smoothing (e.g., building up stockpiles), or it

must accept a greater fluctuation in its consumption pattern.
                                  15




     If lenders are risk neutral and borrowers risk averse, the lenders

can smooth borrowers' consumption at no cost to themselves. In effect,

the penalty is the loss of consumers' surplus on being excluded from the

market; it is inframarginal from the borrower's viewpoint.   The penalty

(and hence the supply of credit) is higher the greater the cost to the

borrower of exclusion, which in turn is higher: (1) the greater the

borrower's elasticity of marginal utility; (2) the more variable its

income; (3) the lower the cost of smoothing via the international capital

market, i.e. the lower the world interest rate; and (4) the more limited

are domestically available options for smoothing consumption.   A country

with limited risk aversion may still want to make great use of the

possibilities for consumption smoothing afforded by international lending

if its income is highly variable. The cost of losing this option may not

be large, however, so that the current- demand for the facility is not

necessarily related to the penalty occasioned by the 1oss.

     Uncertainty, or at least income variation, seems crucial for the

penalty of exclusion to have force. By contrast, the argument is

sometimes made informally that countries that need funds for development

are likely to suffer if denied loans. It is true that they may benefit

greatly from being able to borrow, but this is not the same as saying

that the penalty of exclusion can assure the lender that he will be

repaid. Borrowing for capital accumulation or productive investment

implies that a point will be reached beyond which the debtor will begin

making transfers to his creditor. Once the marginal product of capital

equals the interest rate, there will be no further gain to moving capital

to the debtor. At this point, the debtor will lose nothing by being

denied access to credit markets, and will refuse to service his debts.
                                   16




And, by backward induction as before, it will never be possible to lend

with prospects of payment.

     Owners of capital can entrust it to others who have the opportunity

for profitable investment, and obtain payment by threatening exclusion

from future access to capital, but in situations that do not seem

relevant to financial lenders. Allen (1983) discusses how landowners may

be able to ensure that they are paid even if those who use their land

could, in principle, abscond without paying their rents. In his model,

the land must be left behind, and those who do not pay landlords cannot

get land to farm in the future. As a result, they may have diminished

income opportunities in the future, in which case the penalty has

deterrent value.

     Eaton and Gersovitz (1983) discuss a model of direct foreign invest-

ment. In this case, capital depreciates and cannot be replaced without

the help of foreign investors. If they are expropriated, foreign inves-

tors refuse to cooperate, and exclude the country from the market fZor

physical   capital in the future. Here again, financial lenders do not

seem able to impose such a penalty package.

     International lending appears to play an important role in financing

international trade. Borrowing does not simply finance the current

account deficit, but is associated with the level of international

purchases. In principle, a country could trade on the basis of barter,

but to do so is likely to be costly. Kraft (1984) reports that Nexican

officials perceived the disruption of trade as the primary cost of

default. Iran, when faced with a temporary credit embargo, found trade

difficult, even though the country was a net creditor.
                                   17




     When countries can anticipate problems in effecting transactions,

however, they can act to shield themselves. Waiting to impose penalties

may diminish their efficacy. Countries may accumulate foreign reserves

to finance post-default trade, rather than use income to pay debts.

Trading partners that gain from trade with debtors may help to facilitate

transactions; it is hard to know what potential institutions will try to

substitute for banks, thereby undermining the sanctions available to

banks.

     Gersovitz (1983) develops a model in which the penalty associated

with default depends positively on the importance to a debtor of its

opportunity to trade. An implication is that a borrower's commitment to

increase investment raises the credit ceiling if it increases the value

of the option to trade. In the factor endowment model this is not always

the case. If the investment is in_import—competing industries, then the

country may be better able to withstand a credit embá'rgo. If the

investment is in export industries, requiring at the same time large

imports of certain key materials, then the country may be in a much worse

position t withstand a credit embargo.

     In   series of papers Sachs (1984) and Cooper and Sachs (1985),

Sachs and Cohen (1985) assume that the penalty is proportional to income.

This assumption is useful in illustrating certain basic aspects of

creditor-debtor relationships, as is the model of-subsection 11.1, but

the penalty is clearly not a plausible one in the same way as an exclu-

sion from future borrowing or trade transactions. As a consequence, some

of their conclusions seem questionable, such as their emphasis on the

benefits obtained by a credit-constrained borrower who can precommit to

investment rather than consumption; see Gersovitz (1985).

                       III. The Resolve of Lenders


     So far, we have assumed that lenders always penalize debtors who do

not adhere to loan agreements. But will lenders do so? There is no

obvious way that lenders can commit themselves at the time the loan is

made to punish a country that refuses to pay. Depending on the

situation, it may be costly to penalize recalcitrant debtors. Moreover,

punishment may not affect the prospect of a resumption of debt service.

If it is not in the interest of lenders to punish, then the threat of

punishment will not be credible to borrowers. An equilibrium with

positive lending will be infeasible.

     In some cases the penalties may be fairly automatic. For instance,

if a country that refuses to pay banks tries to transact with the help

of these same banks, itmay find that its transactions balances are

offset by the banks against its outtanding obligations. The country

will then have to seek alternative means of effecting transactions,

presumably at higher cost, to avoid this threat. In fact, a promise by

the banks not to seize the country's balance may itself not be credible.

This mechanism is part of the justification behind the trade-cost model

in Gersovitz (1983).

     There is more doubt, however, about the resolve of lenders to

exclude debtors from future loans. Below, we discuss two models. In

one, lenders do cut off credit from those who are in default (as part of a

reputational equilibrium), but in the other they do not, and the loan

market ceases to function.
                                    19




111.1. Penalties in Reputation-Based Models


     Contracts that are unenforceable through the legal system may still

be enforced by some kind of reputational mechanism. The threat of losing

one's reputation (credit rating) is what induces so-called good behavior

(repayment of the loan). There are two classes of reputational models.

In one there are markets in which there are inherently good and bad

borrowers. Lenders make an inference concerning individuals according to

their past behavior. Thus it is the fear of being classified as a bad

borrower that induces good behavior. But even if there is only one type

of borrower, reputational mechanisms may be effective. To construct a

reputational equilibrium one must show that, if a borrower does not

service a loan, it will not pay the lender (or any other lender) to

extend credit to him. Thus reputational models entail the simultaneous

analysis of borrower and lender behavior.               -




     In   Eaton and Gersovitz (1981a), lenders are competitive, and each

occupies a small share of the market, earning zero profit on any loan.

It therefore costs the lender nothing to refrain from future lending.

Moreover, in their model, the borrowers and lenders interact over a

potentially infinite horizon. [In a finite horizon, a loss of reputation

means nothing in the last period, and therefore cannot justify any

last-period lending. By backward induction, reputation is meaningless,

as in the chain-store paradox discussed by Selten (1978).]

     If there is no finite upper bound on the number of times players

expect to play a game, however, and their identity is remembered by their

opponents, then the players! reputation as cooperative players can

succeed in enforcing some degree of cooperation. A player who fails to
                                  20




cooperate at any single play will not find cooperative partners for

subsequent plays. If players' discount rates are zero then full coopera-

tion is ensured, while infinite discount rates leads to no cooperation.

With a finite but positive discount rate, some co-operation emerges, and

in Eaton and Gersovitz (1981a) this is embodied in the credit ceiling

that sets the maximum loan that lenders will extend to countries that

have paid in the past.

     For the threat of withdrawal of credit to be a credible sanction, it

must not only be in the interests of the current creditors to withdraw

credit, but it also must be in the interests of potential creditors not

to extend credit. The relatively small number of international banks may

be able to sustain the cooperative outcome (in which they all punish

defaulters) within a non-cooperative context. Since they deal with each

other repeatedly, those who fail to cooperate will themselves be pun-

ished. Moreover, the country's current bankers are likely to be more

informed concerning the country than other potential lenders. Hence, the

refusal of the current lenders to continue extending credit may lead

others to refuse as well; see Greenwald, Stiglitz, and Weiss (1984).

Indeed, the current lender usually has more to gain from the continuation

of credit than do others, for it stands to recover earlier loans as well.

     Finally, seniority clauses in international loan contracts could be

enforced by earlier lenders against subsequent lenders in the courts

of developed countries, thereby dissuading other potential lenders.

Such clauses are attractive because they do not require a suit or

enforcement of a judgement against the sovereign debtor. Stiglitz and

Weiss (1983) show that if there are seniority provisions in outstanding

 loans, then if the current lender refused to lend, others will as well.
                                      21




        Because individuals are finite lived, they may lack incentives to

impose penalties, so lending among individuals may not be sustainable.

Infinitely-lived institutions, such as banks, can emerge, however, that

can credibly threaten to punish debtors in order to maintain their

reputation as lenders. Maintaining the value of their equity investments

in a bank provides the incentive to the owners of the bank to punish

default. The failure to do so would cause the value of a bank's equity

to fall to zero.

        For this mechanism to work, the value of bank equity must exceed the

cost of imposing the penalty. If it is costly to punish, a bank must

earn a profit strictly in excess of zero. The interest rate on loans

consequently exceeds that on deposits. Even though in equilibrium the

penalty is never imposed, the cost of implementing the penalty causes the

equilibrium allocation to differ from what would emerge if loan repayment

were automatic, see Eaton (1985).                          -




111.2     Information and the Lender's Problem


        Lenders need information to make sure that they can prevent the

debtor from getting into situations in which debt is not serviced. In

subsection 11.2, we discussed a model in which debtors did not pay in

some states of nature, but debtors and lenders had the same information

about the likelihood of these states of nature. Borrowers may, however,

have more information than lenders about their own attributes that

determine their susceptibility to penalties, and even about the total

amount of debt they have undertaken which, with the penalty, determines

the set of states when the borrower does not pay as he contracted.
                                  22




    Kletzer (1984) analyzes some of the problems that arise under these

circumstances in a model similar to that of Eaton and Gersovitz (1981a).

He focuses on knowledge about the amount lent, a crucial determinant of

borrower behavior. (See also Arnott and Stiglitz, (1983) for the basic

structure of such moral hazard problems).

     If lenders can observe the total quantity lent, competition will

assure a loan-interest-rate combination that maximizes borrower utility

subject to the zero-profit condition. The equilibrium is consequently

determined by a tangency of a borrower's indifference curve to the supply

curve. The borrower will be constrained in that, given the interest

rate, he would prefer to borrow more.

     On the other hand, the total amount lent may be unobserved by

lenders. If an equilibrium with positive debt exists under these circum-

stances, it will be characterized by both a higher debt and a higher

interest rate than if debt is observable. The borrower .is better off

when debt is observable, however; the lower rate of interest morethan

compensates for the rationing of credit. Kletzer interprets lending

through syndicates and the importance of short-term debt as institutional

arrangements in international financial markets that facilitate lenders'

monitoring and control of the borrower's total debt.

     As we noted in section II, borrowers may be able to take actions

that affect penalties, and thereby undermine their willingness to pay.

To the extent that these actions are observable, and lenders can deter

them by credibly threatening sanctions, no moral hazard problems arise..

But when the action is unobservable, moral hazard problems are a concern

(Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981 and 1983). Furthermore, if different borrowers

have different unobservable susceptibilities to penalties, creditors will
                                     23




have an incentive to design contracts that improve the quality of their

borrowers, or that sort borrowers. As a result market equilibria may be

characterized by credit rationing and/or a nonlinear relationship between

interest payments and loan size; see Jaffee and Russell (1976) and

Stiglitz and Weiss (1981 and 1983). For instance, In the context of

international loans, whether debtors are prepared to adopt an IMF program

or not may serve to distinguish between countries that do and do not

intend to service their debts.


111.3 The Breakdown of Lending


     So far, we have looked at models in which lenders may manage to deal

with problems of asynmietric information and credibility, at least

sufficiently to justify some lending. Hellwig (1977) provides a model

that stresses the inability of lenders to cope with enforcement problems,

and their consequent inability to lend.                  -




     In   this model, the breakdown of lending results from the lender's

inability to precommit himself to a ceiliiig on indebtedness. The borrow-

er is an agent with zero current income. At some unknown future date the

borrower's income is expected to jump to a permanently higher level. If

by that time the borrower has not defaulted then any debt up to some

maximum is repaid. In the meantime, the borrower finances his consump-

tion from loans. The lender extends a line of credit which the borrower

draws down as he consumes. If the line is depleted before income rises,

the loan goes into default unless more credit is forthcoming. If default

occurs, the borrower's utility from that moment onward is specified

exogenously as a decreasing. function of indebtedness.
                                   24



     A particular consumption profile corresponds to each amount of total.

credit that the borrower believes available. The lender wants the

borrower to draw on credit slowly, minimizing the probability of default

before income rises. If the lender could precommit to providing a

particular amount of credit then a loan to the borrower can provide a

non-negative expected yield. The problem is that if the borrower ex-

hausts the initial line of credit before his income rises, the lender has

an incentive to provide more. Cutting the borrower off ensures default;

extending credit maintains a hope of repayment. Part of the return on

additional funds committed to the borrower is the possibility of salvag-

ing some of what has already been lent. The lender will consequently

make loans that would not yield a profitable expected return on their

own. It pays him at that point to throw good money after bad.8

     The borrower perceives that when he exhausts the initial loan the

lender will provide more. He consequently draws down the initial loan

more quickly. This raises the probability of his incurring the maximum

amount of debt that will be repaid before, income rises, at which point

credit is cut off.

     By initially extending credit, then, the lender places himself in a

situation in which the commitment of additional funds may be profitable

even though the expected return on all funds committed is negative. To

avoid this imbroglio he desists from lending in the first place. He

suffers from his inability to control the borrower's consumption once the

loan has been made, and from his inability to control his own future

lending behavior. While some features of Hellwig's model may seem

special, the point raised is more general as shown by Stiglitz and Weiss

(1981).
                                    25




111.4.   Panics by Lenders


     The previous section explained why enforcement and commitment

problems may constrain lending in some circumstances, even though

additional lending r.y be mutually beneficial in the absence of these

problems. We now examine situations in which banks that have been

lending suddenly cut off credit. There is some similarity between such

credit runs and the traditional problem of bank runs.

     While bank runs have long been a source of concern, only recently

have researchers developed simple models to analyze them; see Diamond and

Dybvig (1983) and Nakamura (1985). Diamond and Dybvig analyze runs using

game theory. All lenders are better off if none withdraws his funds.

But if some depositors run, the others are better off if they

simultaneously withdraw their funds, or, indeed, anticipate the others'

action and withdraw first. There exist perfect equilibria in which all

try to withdraw and others in which none do.

     Nakamura observes that the expected rate of return on deposits is a

function of the number of depositors withdrawing their funds; while at

the same time, the number of depositors withdrawing their funds is a

function of the expected rate of return. There may be multiple solutions

to this pair of equations, in one of which many depositors withdraw funds

(a run), and in the other of which few do. The existence of multiple

equilibria raises questions about which equilibrium prevails, and why and

how the economy moves among them.

     Depositors are, of course, the bank's creditors; the phenomenon of

runs can arise whenever a borrower has many creditors and there are

short-term liabilities. Each creditor wishes to protect himself; in
                                   26




doing so, he may actually increase the likelihood that others will be

unable to recoup what they have lent. This is a potentially important

externality.

     The occurrence of runs depends critically on the form of the debt

instrument. For instance, in the Diamond-Dybvig model, the bank must

allow any customer to withdraw his entire deposit at the posted yield on

a first-come-first-served basis. Other contract arrangements avoid this

problem; for instance, if there is a well-defined seniority structure,

runs will not occur. Runs do not occur against mutual funds, since the

asset value is continuously redefined. To the extent that the runs

problem is important, one needs to explain why a contractual form that

leads to runs is employed.

     Sachs (1984) and Krugman (1985) present models similar to Diamond

and Dybvig with respect to syndicated bank loans to developing countries,

only with the borrowing country assuming the role of the banks and the

lending banks that of the individual depositors. In period one th,e

borrower owes debt to a large number of bank lenders, an amount that

exceeds current income.

     The central problem in explaining credit runs is why it does not pay

other banks to step in when one lender withdraws credit. Sachs resolves

this difficulty by assuming that each bank faces a rising marginal cost

of loans, an assumption that can be justified by bank exposure

regulations or by managerial risk aversion. Because individual banks

face an increasing marginal cost of lending, it may not pay any single

bank to extend a loan to avoid a default in the first period.    It is in

 the collective interest of all creditors to extend further credit in

 concert, guaranteeing themselves the necessary return.-   The reason for
                                      27




this in Sachs' model is that a failure to renew any loan in thefirst

period brings about a situation in which no loan is repaid in either

period. ?lore generally, this will be true if the return on one loan

increases with the amount lent by others. This hypothesis can be

contrasted with that of Kletzer (and moral hazard analysis, in general)

where the return on one loan decreases with the amount lent by others.

     The assumption of an increasing marginal cost to each bank of

lending may be questioned. The senior debtor knows that if he refuses to

renew credit others will do so as well; see also Stiglitz and Weiss

(1981). Even if the cost of capital increases with exposure, once some

amount   has   been extended, a bank may be willing to commit further funds

to prevent the loss of the original commitment even if, standing alone,

the yield would be inadequate. Consequeutly, it is a bank with an

initially large exposure that will find the value of extending further

credit the greatest.

     The criticisms levied earlier at the Diamond-Dybvig model app'y here

as well. In particular, to the extent that this is a serious problem, it

should have been anticipated. To the extent that it was anticipated, the

problem could have been forestalled, e.g. by each bank lending for two

periods, and only on the condition that other banks lent for a similar

period. There is, moreover, one important difference between bank

behavior and the behavior of depositors. Because banks are engaged in

economic relations with each other repeatedly over an extended period of

time, there may exist a cooperative equilibrium that sustains the effi-

cient outcome (no-runs).

     As Gersovitz (1985) has pointed out, there is a basic difference

between a situation in which the debtor would like to obtain a new net
                                  28



flow of funds and one in which he merely wants to postpone debt service.

It is the latter situation that most debtors have confronted who have

recently engaged in reschedulings. They are making net payments to their

creditors, but less than would be required by the original loan contracts

in the absence of new loans. In this case, the debtor can deal with

reluctant creditors by declaring a unilateral, partial moratorium on debt

service. If all creditors have the same upward-sloping cost of funds,

the debtor will minimize their losses by making proportional (although

partial) payments. By contrast, the upward-sloping cost of funds and the

associated externality means that it may not be possible for the debtor

first to pay all creditors and then to ask them for further funds. It is

this difference between a pro-rated moratorium or rescheduling and a

refinancing after payment that the Sachs and Krugman models explain. On

this interpretation current problems are more ones of form than sub-

stance, assuming, of course, that there is no fundamental reason, such as

willingness-to-pay, why debt service will not be resumed.

     It would be quite another thing if debtors needed positive flows.

For instance, a debtor may have an investment project already underway

that will become valueless without a further infusion of funds to allow

its completion. In this case, the debtor could not unilaterally initiate

a solution and the prospects for success under the Sachs and Krugman

assumptions would be very much reduced. The problem would then be closer

to that originally postulated by Diamond and Dybvig who assume that

two-period investments are inherently more productive.

                IV. A Re—Examination of the Solvency Issue


      Earlier, we remarked that it seems implausible that lending to

developing countries is constrained by their ability to pay, or solvency.

Debt levels do not seem so high, and, we argue, for a good reason: Long

before a countryts ability-to-pay would become relevant, its

willingness-to-pay constrains its access to credit.

      An earlier literature did analyze the sovereign debt problems from a

solvency viewpoint, however, and in this section we briefly re-examine

this literature using the framework we have just presented. Although

primary reliance on ability-to-pay models is dangerous, some important

insights can be gained from this approach. Indeed, as noted, some of the

models of lenderst resolve we reviewed use solvency concepts in determin-

ing when payment occurs.

      A useful way of understanding the problems that arise in evaluating

the ability of the borrower to repay a loan is to look at the basic

balance of trade identities. If D is total debt, D repayment of debt, r

the interest rate, and B the trade balance then in any period


(8)       tD-rDEB.


If S is private savings, I domestic investment, T tax revenue and G

government spending, another identity is that


(9)       D(S—I)+(T—G).


Thus debt service is related both to the trade surplus and to private and

government savings. If domestic product Y is independent of T, an

unconstrained government could in theory set TY, and IO, in which
                                    30




case S0 and óD+rDY. Though eqs. (8) and (9) are nothing wore-than

identities, they provide a framework for understanding possible sources

of problems in a country's meeting its foreign debt obligations.

     An early paper by Domar (1950) made the point that a lender country

could perpetually run a current account surplus only if the growth rate

of loanable funds permanently exceeded the interest rate. Avramovic

(1964) applies an analysis somewhat like Domar's to a borrowing country.

There are fixed savings, tax and import parameters. In this context a

borrower eventually cannot repay his debt unless his growth rate perma-

nently exceeds the interest rate.

     Such models suffer from two problems. First, the variables that

they take as exogenous, such as the growth rate, are endogenous. Second,

if they were exogenous, a variety of conundrums would arise. If the

borrower's growth rate remains permanently above the interest rate, there

would be the problem of matching loanable funds to the -implied loan

demand. On the other hand, how is repayment to occur if and when the

growth falls below the interest rate?

     Since sovereign loans are owed by the governments of countries,

repayment is not constrained by the net worth of the country, but by that

component of net worth that the government can (or is willing to) appro-

priate. For a government that can impose lump-sum taxation at no admin-

istrative cost, national wealth and maximal government revenue do

coincide. Taxes typically impose excess burdens and are costly to raise,

however, so that the maximal amount that the government can extract from

an economy falls short of the net worth of the economy. Nonetheless, it

seems implausible that governments are anywhere near making the maximum

feasible debt service.
                                    31




     Kharas (1984) and Sachs (1984) model solvency in terms of a con-

straint on government revenue. The first is a variant of the Domar

(1944) and Avramovic (1964) models with an exogenous, fixed proportional

tax rate, as well as an exogenous saving rate. Sachs (1983) considers a

two-period optimizing framework in which a government faces a revenue

constraint only in the repayment period. He emphasizes that such a

government should borrow less than the amount that equates the world

interest rate to the domestic marginal product of capital. The reason is

that the binding resource constraint implies a higher marginal cost of

government revenue in the repayment period than in the borrowing period.

     The argument that a binding government budget constraint reduces

optimal borrowing does not, however, generalize much beyond this example.

If the government were, constrained in total resources from domestic

sources in the initial, rather than the repayment, period then the

marginal cost of funds in that period would exceed that' in the repayment

period. Efficiency would demand borrowing more than the amount thlt, .

invested,   would equate the domestic marginal product of capital to the

world interest rate. The argument also assumes that the revenue from

investments financed by the loan does not accrue to the government, but

must be taxed from the private sector. Otherwise the standard condition

for optimality would apply.

     More generally, there is not a rigid constraint on raising taxes in

any period. Efficient borrowing-cum-tax policy will take into account

three factors: (1) the marginal (social) cost of raising revenue in-

creases with the amount raised in any period; (2) additional investment

at one date may affect the marginal cost of raising funds at a later

date; and (3) borrowing costs may increase as a country borrows more
                                      32



within any period. Plausible models may be constructed that         imply a
country    should borrow more than the amount   that   would, if invested,

equate the domestic marginal product of capital to the world interest

rate.

        A second reason why national net worth may overstate resources

available for repayment to lenders abroad is the difficulty in

transferring national assets to foreigners. Simonsen (1985) provides an

extreme version of this view which postulates an autonomous trade

balance. A country's net worth, from a lender's perspective, is

consequently the discounted present value of its trade account. For a

solvent borrower this amount exceeds the value of debt. The value of

resources within the country is irrelevant since there is no way to

transfer them to foreigners except through the trade account. A less

extreme version of this view models the trade account as a function of a

set of variables that are partially responsive to policy. Repayment then

requires that the government pursue policies that yield the necessry

trade account surplus. This view precludes the possibility of repayment

by a direct sale of domestic assets to foreigners without their contempo-

raneous export.

        One argument why the trade balance constrains a debtor's ability to

repay is the traditional transfer problem, an issue raised by

Diaz-Alejandro (1984). Repayment could worsen the terms of trade of a

debtor, consequently reducing his capacity to service debt. But the

transfer of purchasing power (as represented by the repayment of loans)-

from a small debtor to a larger creditor probably will not have a signif-
                                                  9
icantly adverse effect on the terms of trade.
                                     33



        These solvency models emphasize how borrowers can come up against a

net-worth constraint and become unable to pay. A more complete picture

is given by other models that incorporate the behavior of lenders, who

only lend if there is a reasonable probability that this situation can be

prevented. In these models credit crises never arise since no bank lends

more than the borrower can repay. If repayment capacity is stochastic

the bank will in general lend so much that in some contingencies

repayment is impossible, at least without rescheduling (recall section

11.2).

        Jaffee and Hodigliani (1969) present a model of a borrower with

limited resources next period to repay a loan. They make the point that

if the resources available to repay a loan are limited, then there is

cle4rly an upper bound on the amount that a lender will be willing to

lend.

        The models of solvency that we have discussed up to this point have

treated the value of the borrower's resources available for repaymentas

an exogenous variable, and have assumed that borrowers and lenders share

the same subjective probability distribution about that value. In fact,

borrowers are more likely to have better information about their worth in

the repayment period than lenders, and borrowers' actions affect what

that distribution will be. Consequently lenders face problems of adverse

selection and moral hazard.

        The terms of the contract affect both the mix of applicants and the

actions undertaken by those who get loans. Thus, increasing the rate of

interest may actually lower the bank's expected return, both because the

best risks (from the lender's perspective) decide not to apply and

because the higher interest charges induce borrowers to undertake greater
                                   34




risks. The consequence of this is that banks may find it profitable to

charge an interest rate below the market clearing level. This results in

credit rationing; see Keeton (1979) and Stiglitz and Weiss (1981)

     Stiglitz and Weiss (1983) also show how a bank involved repeatedly

in lending to a particular borrower can use the terms of subsequent loans

to modify the selection of borrowers or decisions of borrowers to its own

advantage. They assume that the bank can credibly commit itself to the

terms of subsequent loans when the initial loan is extended. In particu-

lar they show that a bank may exclude a borrower in default from subse-

quent loans to discourage (ex ante) risky investinents.° They also have

analyzed the role of collateral, showing that its absence exacerbates

problems, although credit rationing may still exist with collateral.

Thus credit rationing may be more important in country loans, where

collateral is not feasible, than in domestic loans.

     The Modigliani-Jaffee and Stiglitz-Weiss papers show how credit

rationing can arise when the borrower's insolvency threatens a loan. An

implication of the Stiglitz and Weiss papers is that solvency itself

cannot be defined independently of the actions of borrowers and lenders.

Even though, ex post, the lender receives all the borrowerts assets if a

default occurs, the borrower can affect the probability of being able to

pay. Ex ante the lender's return is affected by the borrower's actions.

Even when the solvency constraint is binding ex post, the borrower's

willingness-to-pay is important in this ex ante sense.


              V. Operationalizing and Testing the Theories


     Economists have investigated a fairly large number of theoretical

notions in their discussion of international lending. While many of the
                                      35




models complement each other, we have remarked upon important conceptual

differences among them. In this section and the next, we are motivated

by a set of very general questions about the empirical relevance of these

models: How can these theories help to interpret recent developments in

international lending? How can they be used to identify future topic" of

importance and to make predictions? How can experience in the markets be

used to distinguish which theories are relevant? What are the priorities

for further theoretical research? In short, what are the connections

between the theories, empirical research and what is happening in these

markets?

     Specific empirical questions facing the researcher range from

knowing the facts to understanding the actual behavior of borrowers and

lenders. Some examples are: How much has been lent and what determines

the amount lenders wish to lend, borrowers wish to borrow, and the actual

amount of debt outstanding? What are the terms of the-loans, and what

determines them? What types   of   ruptures occur between lenders and

borrowers, and why? Do lenders maintain unity in confrontations with

debtors, and under what circumstances? What are the terms of the

reschedulings? of HIP agreements?

     Some of these questions are informational, and knowledge of particu-

lar facts can answer them. No econometric analysis is needed. Others

involve evidence on the motivations of borrowers and lenders, and involve

inferences about behavior. In principle, econometric analysis is appro-
                                                                        -
priate; in practice, there are limitations to the application of

econometric methods. One obstacle to econometric work arises because the
informational questions are logically prior to econometric analysis, and
                                   36




when they cannot be answered in a satisfactory manner, there may be

little point to pressing on with econometric analysis.

     One basic problem confronting all econometric studies of sovereign

debt is that the unit of analysis is unavoidably the country. Conse-

quently, it is very difficult to identify exogeneous variables that vary

by the unit of analysis. The interpretation of many results in the

literature is clouded by the inclusion in the estimated relationships of

many endogenous variables as explanatory variables. The terms of trade,

however, is one important source of external shocks that may be roughly

exogenous for many developing countries, which tend to be relatively

small in world markets. Similarly, it may be possible to. introduce

climatological variables to measure an important set of domestic shocks

when agriculture is an important source of income, exports and government

revenues.

     Existing studies fall into two groups corresponding.to an earlier

and a later stage in the relationship between borrowers and lenders. One

group focuses on an environment of voluntary lending, and seeks to

identify the determinants of the quantity of debt, and the terms at which

it is contracted. The second type of study focuses on when debt problems

arise. So far there are no studies that address the prospects for a

resumption of voluntary lending to countries that have experienced

problems.

     Estimating the determinants of debt outstanding is quite difficult.

Even in the absence of problem cases, it is necessary to allow for the

possibility that observed debt is the minimum of the credit ceiling and

desired debt. This implies two regimes. An appropriate econometric

technique produces not only coefficient values but also a probabilistic
                                      37




separation of the sample into the two regimes. The existence of problem

debtors whose debt exceeds the level desired by creditors means that

three or more regimes are required in empirical work if both cases of

voluntary and involuntary lending are to be treated in a unified

analysis.

     At present, only the two-regime model has been estimated (Eaton and

Gersovitz 1980, 1981a). In these studies the observations on individual

countries were from 1970 and 1974, so that there was no need to account

for problem debtors. By the same token, however, these results apply to

only a very early period in the evolution of lending to developing

countries. Bank lending was much less important before 1973-74. The

results of these studies indicate that two regimes rather than only one

are justified; the credit-constrained regime was relatively more

prevalent.11 In 1974 relatively more countries were credit-constrained.

Some of the oil exporters that were included in the sample for both years

moved against this trend, however, as one would expect. The analysis of

Eaton and Gersovitz (1980), which considers determinants of foreign

reserve holdings as well as international indebtedness, suggests that

debt was a substitute for reserves.

     In the analysis of debt levels and debt problems, an important

distinction is between the long-run characteristics of countries (for

instance, the standard deviation of the terms of trade about trend) and

transitory shocks that they may experience (the actual deviation of the

terms of trade from trend in any one year). For instance, Eaton and

Gersovitz (1981a) present a model in which an increase in the permanent

variability of a debtor's income can increase the debt ceiling it faces,

although a failure to repay, if it occurs at all, will occur in a period
                                  38




of relatively low income: Existing studies use some constructed measures

for long-run country characteristics such as the variability of exports.

They do not, however, incorporate variables capturing transitory factors

into the estimation. Under reasonable distributional assumptions, the

omission of these variables (and their implicit inclusion in the error

term) need not bias the estimated coefficients. Of course, their omis-

sion does mean that these models do not reflect the role of shocks in

determining indebtedness.

     Gersovitz (1985) presents graphical evidence that debt has tended to

increase most markedly when the terms of trade would seem to have been

temporarily high. Thus, debt does not seem to have helped countries to

smooth their absorption, despite the theoretical presumption that debtors

would want this pattern, and that creditors should want to accomodate

them to the extent that debt is below the borrower's credit ceiling. It

may be that when shock variables are included in the formal econometric

work, this casual impression will be reversed. If it is not, howeter, it

may be possible to determine whether this pattern reflects behavior of

leaders, borrowers, or both groups.

     Finally, there is scope for improving these models by using data

available since the earlier studies and variables that could be con-

structed from unpublished data sources. The Eaton-Gersovitz studies use

the World Bank's World Debt Tables series on debt to private creditors.

It is important to add short-term debt guaranteed by the debtor country

to the World Bank figures to produce a dependent variable that is more

comprehensive. Cline (1984, pp. 291-2) discusses one way this can be

done. It would also be useful to integrate debt owed by the private

sector that is not guaranteed by the debtor's government. This leads to
                                   39




questions of model specification as well as of data because such debt is

subject to sovereign risk in rather special ways, as well as subject to

conventional risks of corporate failure. At the same time, a significant

part of debt owed to private creditors is guaranteed by the governments

of these creditors, and these debts must be treated more like debt to

public creditors.

     Bank loans to sovereign borrowers typically specify an interest rate

that is the suni of two components, a reference rate from an OECD finan-

cial market, usually the London Inter Bank Offer Rate, and a spread. The

reference rate component is adjusted at fixed intervals to its current

market value, so that the loans are at floating rates. The spread is set

for the duration of the loan, and is the component specific to the loan.

     There are several, econometric investigations of these spreads.

McDonald (1982) provides references and some description of individual

studies. These studies focus on an interpretation of the spread as a

risk premium, and attempt to infer the lenders' perception of los from

the size of the spread. The type of loan problem leading to the spread

is not, however, explicitly specified, nor could it be, given the method-

ology and information. Insofar as a probability of loss is inferred, it

seems to correspond to a probability (7z)   of   total loss of present value,

via the condition (1—n)(1+r+s)(1+r) where r is the safe, base rate and s

is the spread.

     In fact, however, the spreads may reflect other factors. There may

be higher costs of originating loans in certain countries. Tax treatment

of interest income earned by foreigners in the borrowing countries may

have implications for spreads. For instance, in Mexico, the Mexican

withholding tax may be paid by the borrower but still-generates U.S. tax
                                   40



 credits for the lender. Other components of the loan contract, such as

 the front-end fees, affect the total return to the lender.

      In general, these studies use an eclectic list of explanatory

variables that are not derived from a clearly stated model of sovereign

 lending and borrowing. Because they share this characteristic with

models of debt problems, we postpone a discussion of individual

variables.

     One problem that is specific to these models, however, is the

inclusion of other conditions of the loan agreement as explanatory

variables, and these are most probably endogenous. The motivation for

their inclusion is that these factors are known to be related to interest

rates even in markets without a risk of repayment. For instance, there

is a term structure relationship between rate and maturity on U.S.

government bonds. On the other hand, such loan characteristics can play

a special role in the context of sovereign lending. For instance, we

have already noted that loans of short maturity allow for more frequent

and effective monitoring of the sovereign, debtor, the so-called short

leash. On the other hand, very short-term debt is often poorly recorded

and it is often feared that debtors who anticipate debt problems and

credit constraints may surreptitously run up their short-term

indebtedness, the problem modeled by Kletzer (1984). Thus these

econometric studies have included explanatory variables that are

themselves endogenously determined by lenders and borrowers with

reference to considerations of sovereign risk.

     By far the largest number of econometric studies of sovereign

lending attempt to explain instances of so-called problem debtors.

tlcDonald (1982) and Saini and Bates (1984) provide extensive surveys of
                                   41




variablea used, estimation methods, coefficient estimates and success in

predicting the events studied. Edwards (1984) and McFadden et al (1985)

are recent studies in this tradition.

     All these investigations try to understand the determinants shifting

a country from being a good to a bad borrower. The fundamental difficul-

ty with these models is defining appropriately the dependent variable,

the occurence of a debt problem. The earliest study, Frank and Cline

(1971), asked when multilateral reschedulings of debt owed to official

creditors occur in Paris-Club type arrangements. This type of question

is well posed, and has some obvious policy interest. But it is not the

question that seems central to the current debate over sovereign lending;

namely, will banks regret having made loans to developing countries?

None of the observable events (arrears, reschedulings, or IMF programs)

that these econometric studies analyze answer this question. Within the

group of countries experiencing each of these events are presumably good

credit risks and bad. It is just not possible to say based on an event

analysis what the prospects for ultimately realizing the present value of

loans are. Even in the case of an explicit repudiation, the rupture

between debtors and creditors is never irrevocable. Furthermore, even in

very bad situations from the banks' viewpoint, there may be reason for

the banks to avoid calling a default and for the country to demur from an

explicit repudiation. Such actions may trigger intervention by bank

regulators that is unwelcome to creditors, and consequently to debtors.

Debt problems are therefore hard to define. We have come full circle to

our opening comments about the difficulties of ascertaining loan status

inherent in situations in which the relationship between debtors and

creditors potentially stretches over an indefinite future.
                                   42




     As an alternative to the study of such events as arrears,

reschedulings or IMP problems with their hazy implications for market

participants, it is probably better to focus on flows of funds between

creditors and debtors. In other words, the critical question is: When

will a country with certain characteristics owing a certain amount of

debt under certain contractual arrangements pay or receive funds from

creditors with certain characteristics? One could then, in principle,

make an estimate of the present value that creditors will realize on

their original loan, as well as whether countries can expect to receive

more funds. This strategy means a return to the estimation of debt

supply and demand equations, as in Eaton and Gersovitz (1980, 1981a) but

with potentially more regimes. McFadden et al. (1985) introduce a

multi-regime model of sovereign debt, but it focuses on arrears and

reschedulings, and therefore analyzes events rather than the flow of

funds.

     Another shortcoming of these econometric models is their incorpora-

tion of many variables on a rather ad hoc basis (see Eaton and Gersovitz,

1981b for a further discussion). For instance, some studies have used

the ratio of capital inflow to debt service, a variable that is likely to

be simultaneous with default. Others use variables like the inflation

rate with little obvious theoretical justification. If the notion is

that a government short of revenue will resort to the inflation tax as

well as run arrears, then the variables are endogenous.

     While econometric analysis of international lending faces severe

difficulties, there are other types of empirical approaches that have

been tried in an attempt to forecast the prospects of debtors and credi-

tors. Kaletsky (1985) reviews the prospects for sanctions of various
                                      43



types and   their Costs to debtors. This type of analysis is potentially

prescriptive; it provides the type of information that banks and debtors

may use in making decisions. By contrast, the econometric analysis

assumes that the participants know what they should do, and are doing it.

     A   second type of exercise used to determine repayment prospects is
represented by Cline's (1984) projection of    exports, imports and other

balance of payments entries. He argues that if the credit entries grow

relative to the debit entries excluding debt service, the prospects for

debt service are enhanced. This approach neglects that the magnitudes of

all these variables are jointly determined. A country may decide that

its creditors will neither extend it new funds nor be aJle to deploy

effective sanctions. It can then choose to increase its imports or

reserves or decrease its exports relative to the levels projected by

reference to past trends and OECD variables.



                             VI. Conclusions


     The rash of debt reschedulings led to a widespread view that banks

had lent too much. Though bankers may now regret having made some of

these loans, the relevant question is whether there was some market

failure leading to inappropriate lending behavior. We have already noted

that the unenforceability of contracts can imply that credit is rationed,

and that lending is probably too low relative to what would be optimal if

contracts were enforceable, and that borrowers would prefer this latter

situation. Now we turn to a related set of questions: (1) Are there

factors motivating bankers to lend more than what is likely to be repaid?

(2) What is the role of bank regulation in this context? and (3) What is

the interpretation of rescheduling?
                                  44



    These questions are inherently very difficult to answer because

there is a one-shot aspect about the debt situation. The players do not

make repetitive choices in similar situations. There is the comparative

behavior of many countries, but they all borrow from more or less the

same group of banks. Analysts can refer, therefore, to only a rather

limited experience.


VI.1 Potential Inefficiencies in International Lending


     One potentially important inefficiency results when lenders cannot

observe the magnitude of outstanding loans. In this case, the lending of

an additional dollar has an externality since it increases the likelihood

of default. As Kletzer (1984) shows, this factor can increase the amount

lent and the probability of default, as well as the initial interest

rate. This type of problem may be more relevant to international lending

than domestic lending to individual firms. In sovereign lending, senior-

ity clauses are less important, and a number of lenders make loans to a

multitude of government ministries, agencies and public enterprises.

     There is another informational externality of potential importance:

The fact that one lender is willing to lend funds conveys information

about the creditworthiness of the borrower. Similarly, the refusal of a

bank to lend funds conveys information to other suppliers of capital.

This externality may contribute to the occurrence of runs. In our

earlier discussion, we noted that one might view a lending crisis as a

run. Each creditor wishes to protect himself; in doing so, he may

actually increase the likelihood that others will be unable to recoup

what they have lent.
                                    45



     It is not only that the   forced   liquidation of assets consequent upon

an unexpected withdrawal of credit has a deleterious effect on the net

worth of the borrower. The withdrawal of credit by some creditors

induces a revision in others' estimates of the likelihood of a default,

and this by itself can lead to a run.

     Lenders must make inferences about the likelihood of a default on

the basis of partial information. Some of the risks facing one borrower

are similar to those facing another borrower. Withdrawal of credit

against one borrower may even cause a re-evaluation of credit extended to

other similarly situated borrowers. Thus, there are informational

externalities extending across borrowers as well as across lenders. But

in general, our conclusion is that if a runs externality were the sole

cause of debt problems., it can be handled by a lender-initiated

moratorium since new funds net of interest payments do not seem to be

required.

     Banks are limited liability institutions. Thus, when a bank pnder-

takes a risk, it may be imposing some costs on its creditors which it

does not fully take into account, just as firms or countries to which it

lent money did not fully take into account the costs that their actions

had on the bank.

     Nany governments of developed countries insure deposits by their

citizens in the banks that lend to developing countries. This insurance

obviates the need for depositors to supervise bank portfolios, a

presumably costly activity for small depositors that provides the

rationale for the insurance. In addition, there may be a role for

insurance in removing the incentive for bank panics, as discussed by

Diamond and Dybvig (1983).
                                       46




     To ensure that this insurance does not lead to moral hazard on the

part of banks, various regulations have been adopted to circumscribe

their behavior. In the United States, loans to individual borrowers are

not to exceed a fraction of bank capital, but all loans to a single

country or even to all agencies of a single government were never

classified as being to an individual borrower, in this sense. This

provision has therefore not prevented the aggregate of loans to entities

in individual developing countries from becoming a significant fraction

of bank capital.

     One important policy that regulators can take is to force banks to

increase their net worth. This is particularly important in a situation

of involuntary lending (rescheduled loans that otherwise would be in

default). Banks are induced to make these loans because they can pay

dividends based on interest income that is only paid to them because they

extend new loans. Unless these regulators prevent banks from paying

these dividends, their loans to developing countries will continuously

rise relative to their capital. This process will increase the

contingent claim on,   the   insurance schemes, potentially without bound. In

fact, U.S. regulators have required two major banks to increase their

capital. There is really very little cost to extending this program

since it requires no judgment on the ultimate worth of the loans.

     A related policy that regulators could adopt is to require full

disclosure of loans made to individual countries. Increased reporting

requirements have been promulgated by U.S. regulators. This information

can help uninsured depositors and shareholders to monitor the portfolio

decisions of bank managements and thereby to deter moral hazard.
                                   47



     Insurance agencies can also deter the undesirable risk-taking
consequences of insurance by adopting differentiated premia that increase

with the riskiness of loans and with their proportion in an individual

bank's portfolio. This has not been a general feature of insurance

programs, but would deter banks from undertaking correlated loans that

yield expected returns net of insurance payments below those on a safe

loan, but expected profits to the banks above those on a safe loan.

Similarly, the categorization of loans as requiring loss reserves can

also be further differentiated.

     The moral hazard problems caused by deposit insurance are reinforced

by typjcal (implicit) managerial compensation schemes in which judgments

concerning performance are based on relative performance. This too may

lead to excessive correlation of risks undertaken across banks. Assume

most banks are undertaking higher yielding loans to LDC's. If all loans

go into default, then it is unlikely that all (or possibly any) bank

managers will be punished; each manager's judgment is confirmed by.the

actions of the others. On the other hand, if any one refuses to lend,

and there is no default, the lower return earned by the bank will count

against the manager. Thus, as emphasized elsewhere in the New Theory of

the Firm, one must take into account the incentives of the managers;

risks faced by the firm and risks faced by the manager are not

necessarily the same. It may be possible to deter moral hazard if

regulators directly penalize managers, as happened to some extent in the

Continental-Illinois case.
                                      48




VI.2 Interpreting the Reschedulings


     In terms   of   the models discussed so far, rescheduling has a number

of interpretations. One is simply that it is a device to extend the term

of the loans in question; rescheduling a short-term loan is simply

another means of issuing a long-term loan.

     As we have noted, the option for certain types of unspecified

interventions that a short-term loan contract allows provides it with

certain advantages over long—term contracts. In particular, rescheduling

a short-term loan gives creditors more control over the borrower's

indebtedness. That is why short term loans may be employed, even when it

is (correctly) anticipated that there will be a high probability of a
                12
rescheduling.

     Still other explanations are that rescheduling is an action by

creditors to bring a solvent, willing-to-pay debtor through a liquidity

crisis or that it is an attempt by an insolvent or unwilling-to-pay

borrower to postpone the inevitable sanctions it will suffer when

repayment ultimately is not made. Creditors go along in the latter

instance because they hope: (1) that the problem is really one of

liquidity; (2) that, by waiting, they may find other, more gullible

lenders or a public institution to assume the debt; or (3) that the

moment of public realization of the worthlessness of the loan can be

postponed until the bank personnel responsible for it have left.

Heliwig's (1977) model suggests another rationale, that rescheduling is

the lender's throwing of good money after bad to keep alive some prospect

of the debtor's repaying.
                                   49




     In most cases, rescheduling reflects a failure to contract

completely against all possible contingencies.13 Ozier (1984) has

developed a model analyzing the consequences of this when, after the

initial loan, the two parties confront each other as bilateral

monopolists (even though initially the loan market is competitive). From

the perspective of the initial period two magnitudes are in doubt, the

borrower's income in the second period and the penalty of default. The

borrower is ultimately solvent, however. The initial loan is extended

for one period. Three outcomes are possible. First, the borrower's

income and the default penalty both exceed the repayment obligation; the

loan is repaid on schedule. Second, the borrower's income falls short of

the repayment obligations. A liquidity problem forces the borrower to

reschedule at terms moire favorable to the lenders than the initial loan,

since lenders are now monopolists vis-à-vis the borrower. Third, the

penalty of default falls below the borrower's debt service obligation.

The borrower uses the threat of nonpayment to negotiate a reschedu'ing of

the loan on terms more favorable to himself.

     Two features of the model may have particular relevance to actual

lending in international capital markets. First, even though default

never actually occurs, borrowers can use the threat of default to extract

better loan terms. Kraft's (1984) description of Hexico's debt resched-

uling indicates that Mexican negotiators raised the specter of default

for exactly this purpose. Second, reschedulings may take place for

different reasons, with different implications for borrowers and lenders.

Ozier studies the effect of rescheduling announcements on the value of

the equity of banks involved. She finds that during the late 1970's

reschedulings typically raised equity, suggesting a liquidity
                                   50




explanation. The opposite is the case for the early 1980's, which she

interprets as reflecting a decline in the perceived cost of default to

the debtor. This view also seems consistent with the pattern of

interest-rate spreads on rescheduled loans, which were first higher and

then lower than those on so-called voluntary loans.

VI.3 Final Remarks


     The central role played by the enforcement problem and the absence

of collateral make the international loan market fundamentally different

from domestic credit markets. In a sense, our analysis leads to a view

that it is perhaps more surprising that there has been as much lending to

developing countries as that there is not more. It is hard to interpret

events to ascertain the future course of payments by debtors to creditors

and by creditors to debtors. But we believe that our framework can help

to organize thinking about the topics raised by sovereign lending and

country risk, and to point up inconsistencies that could otherwise plague

analysis in this area.

                              ENDNOTES




    We only use default in this restricted sense.

2   Consider a firm   for   which it has suddenly become apparent that there

    is a large probability that output will be zero. The expected

    present discounted value of its future income stream is less than

    the value of its outstanding obligations. The firm is (by standard

    definitions) insolvent. But a rational lender would not declare the

    firm in default, if there were no moral hazard problem. For doing

    so would simply waste away some of the value which the lender might

    otherwise be able to appropriate.



    Consider, by contrast, a similar firm for which a new investment

    opportunity suddenly becomes available. The new investment is very

    risky. The expected present discounted value of the firm is very

    positive. If the firm undertakes the project, however, the expected

    return of the bank will be substantially decreased. The bank only

    obtains a return when the firm does not go bankrupt; it does not

    share in the bonanza which accrues if the risky investment project

    is successful. The bank would like to stop the project, but its

    loan contract does not have any provision enabling it to do so. If,

    however, there is a provision in the loan contract, which enables it

    to declare the loan in default, it would be in the interests of the

    lender to do so, even though the firm is not insolvent.

3    We emphasize our dissatisfaction with models that simply take

     critical parameters of the economy as exogenous and, by so doing,

     create a problem.

4    Note that the losses to the borrower often exceed the gains to the

     lender. This suggests that, at least in some circumstances, the

     incentive effects of collateral are more important than its guaran-

     tee effects.

5    There may, of course, be some exceptions such as the opportunity to

     seize airplanes owned by a national airline in default that tries to

     use them in international service.

6    For instance, Sachs and Cohen (1985) point out that the opportunity

     not to pay may substitute for insurance, allowing a risk averse

     borrower to offset bad shocks elsewhere. See also Eaton and

     Gersovitz (1984) on penalties under uncertainty.

7    Kreps and Wilson (1982) suggest how imperfect information of a

     particular kind can sustain a reputational equilibrium even in a

     finite-horizon game.

8    Note that the current lender's incentives for extending credit are

     thus greater than the incentives of other potential lenders (recall

     our earlier discussion and Stiglitz-Weiss, 1983).

9    It is worth noting, however, that the initial extension of the loan

     must have been accompanied by a terms-of-trade gain to the borrower,

     if repayment implies a loss.

10   Their analysis thus provides part of the explanation of why lenders

     wish to cut bad borrowers off from credit.

11   Identification of the regimes is difficult because theory suggests

     that almost all variables influencing the desired debt should also
                                 58




     influence the credit ceiling, and conversely. Eaton and Gersovitz

     use restrictions on the signs of coefficients as well as the fact

     that when the credit ceiling is binding it affects desired reserves.

     A further possibility is to assign certain countries to different

     regimes with probability one based on prior knowledge, something

     that may be attractive now that cases of apparently intractable

     debtors have emerged.

12   Several recent papers have attempted to model this idea formally.

     See, in particular, Kletzer (1984), and Sachs and Cohen (1985) who

     provide models in which rescheduling agreements prohibit the borrow-

     er from tapping sources of credit other than the initial lenders.

     The likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the initial loan amount

     is consequently enhanced. What is not clear in the analysis is why

     a long-term loan agreement could not attain the same objective by

     prohibiting the borrower from borrowing from other sources during

     the term of the loan.

13   With complete contracting, repayments would be a function of the

     state, just as they are with incomplete contracting, but the

     dependence would be specified ex ante. The following discussion

     notes some of the differences that arise in the nature of the

     relationship between debtors and creditors with incomplete

     contracting.
