                                          ABSTRACT

Although the gender wage gap in the U.S. has narrowed, women’s career trajectories diverge
from men’s after the birth of children, suggesting a potential role for family-friendly policies. We
provide new evidence on employer provision of these policies. Using the American Time Use
Survey, we find that women are less likely than men to have access to any employer-provided
paid leave and this differential is entirely explained by part-time status. Using the NLSY97, we
find that young women are more likely to have access to specifically designated paid parental
leave, even in part-time jobs. Both datasets show insignificant gender differentials in access to
employer-subsidized child care and access to scheduling flexibility. We conclude with a
discussion of policy implications

        Fifty-five years after the passage of the Equal Pay Act, gender differences in the labor

market remain. The gender gap in pay has narrowed but not closed, and female participation

rates seem to have plateaued. Indeed, the U.S. now lags behind many other advanced industrial

countries on measures of gender equality in the workplace. In particular, substantial gender gaps

in labor force participation and wages exist, especially for mothers. The larger gender gaps faced

by mothers suggest that family-friendly employer policies, such as paid leave, childcare, and

work scheduling flexibility, could play a potentially consequential role.

        We fill an important gap in the literature by considering whether there are gender

differentials in access to employer-provided paid leave, childcare, and work scheduling

flexibility. We focus on employer-provided benefits for two main reasons: first, in the U.S.,

employers are the major source of these types of benefits; and second, relatively little

information exists in the literature on gender differences in access to such benefits. We also

discuss current public policy provisions and the role that new or expanded public policies might

play.

        Using two nationally representative datasets, we find that women are less likely than men

to have access to employer-provided paid leave and this differential is entirely explained by the

fact that women are more likely to work part-time. Young women are found to be more likely to

have access to specifically designated paid parental leave even in part-time jobs. Women and

men are equally unlikely to have access to childcare and scheduling flexibility. We find

substantial heterogeneity by educational level: while women at all levels of education are more

likely to have access to paid parental leave than similar men, highly educated women are less

likely to have access to employer-provided childcare or scheduling flexibility than comparable




                                                                                                    1
men. These results have important implications for policymakers, which we discuss in the

concluding section.


Recent trends and developments
Equal employment opportunity policies

        U.S. equal employment opportunity (EEO) policies were established with the Equal Pay

Act of 1963 and Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (“EEOC Notice 915.002” 1997). The

Equal Pay Act prohibits unequal pay on the basis of sex for equal work. Title VII makes it illegal

for employers to discriminate against employees or job applicants on the basis of gender, sexual

orientation, race, religion, age, nationality, disability, and other characteristics.

        Since the 1960s, when EEO became law, the participation rate of women in the labor

market increased steadily, until peaking in 2000 at 60.7 percent (Goldin 2014; Black,

Schanzenbach, and Breitwieser 2017). Labor force participation particularly increased among

women under age 35 (Goldin and Mitchell 2017). This may be partly attributable to the

affirmative action policies that came about after EEO: reviewing the literature, Harry Holzer and

David Neumark (2000; 2006) present descriptive evidence suggesting that firms using

affirmative action practices have more women apply and be hired for open positions.

        In addition, the gender wage gap steadily decreased in the latter part of the twentieth

century. Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn (2017) show that, while female wages have

dramatically increased since the 1960s, they have not reached parity with men’s, as progress

largely stagnated since 2000. Blau and Kahn’s (2017) decomposition analysis finds that both

individual- and firm-level characteristics account for gender wage differences. In 2010,

occupation and industry accounted for the majority of the explained gender wage gap; the

worker’s race, experience, and region also contributed. The authors conclude that it is plausible

                                                                                                    2
that EEO policies were responsible for the decline in the gap, but the evidence does not

definitively indicate a causal effect.

        One important factor in the narrowing of the gender wage gap is the new lifecycle of

women’s employment. The average age at first birth has increased with recent cohorts, resulting

in decreases in labor force participation later in the lifecycle as women leave the labor force to

care for children, a trend that Claudia Goldin and Joshua Mitchell (2017) call the “sagging

middle.” This mid-life retreat from work has two important implications. First, as the age of first

birth has shifted later, employment has increased for younger women (Goldin and Mitchell

2017). As is discussed below, younger women and men experience greater parity in the labor

market prior to childbirth, indicating that EEO policies have the desired effect before women

have children but are potentially less effective once workers become parents.1 Second, because

women are giving birth later, they have greater attachment to the labor force, take less leave time

after birth, and reenter the workforce faster (Dey 2014; Goldin and Mitchell 2017). And yet,

though women in their twenties and thirties are out of the labor force for fewer years and work

more steadily throughout their lives (Blau and Winkler 2017; Goldin and Mitchell 2017), they do

not experience parity in labor force participation or wages later in life (Black, Schanzenbach, and

Breitwieser 2017; Chung et al. 2017).

  Marianne Bertrand, Claudia Goldin, and Lawrence Katz (2010) find that recent male and
female MBA graduates from the University of Chicago begin their careers with almost identical
earnings. Five years after graduation, men earn 30 log points more than women; 10-16 years
after graduation, this gap increases to nearly 60 log points. One of the primary reasons for this
divergence is that women experience more career interruptions. Goldin and Katz (2016) show
that this pattern is not inevitable. They explore the narrowing gender gap among pharmacists,
finding that technological and retail changes have increased substitutability among pharmacists,
which, in turn, reduced the wage penalty for part-time work and the gender wage gap.
                                                                                                     3
         This new lifecycle of women’s employment and the narrowing of the gap in labor force

participation are linked to a closing of the education gap (Dey 2014; Goldin 2014; Blau and

Kahn 2017). The average woman today has a higher level of education than the average man,

and a greater share of women hold advanced degrees (Blau and Kahn 2017). This increase in

women’s attainment has ushered in greater labor force participation and experience (Goldin

2014).

         There is substantial heterogeneity in labor force participation rates among subgroups of

women, particularly for mothers. For men and women without children, labor force participation

has nearly reached parity; but for mothers and fathers, a wide gap still exists (Weeden, Cha, and

Bucca 2016). This gap among parents is exacerbated by gender differences in labor force exits

after the birth of a child. In the year following childbirth, women’s likelihood of employment

decreases by 30 to 40 percent (Kuziemko et al. 2018). Women also stay out of the labor force for

longer than men; this differential is narrowing, due to women taking shorter leaves (Dey 2014).

         Progress on narrowing the gender gap in pay has also been uneven, particularly for

workers with children. The motherhood wage penalty, whereby having children is linked to

lower wages for women, is well documented in survey data (Waldfogel 1997; Budig and

England 2001; Pal and Waldfogel, 2016; Blau and Kahn 2017) and in experiments (Correll,

Benard, and Paik 2007). Recent estimates indicate that, on average, childless women earn 87

percent of the wages of similar childless men, while mothers earn 75 percent of the wages of

similar fathers (Chung et al. 2017). The motherhood wage penalty may explain wage divergence

across the lifecycle: while men and women begin their careers with roughly equivalent wages,

the gender wage gap widens as cohorts age (Goldin 2014; Chung et al. 2017).




                                                                                                    4
       The motherhood wage penalty varies greatly across subgroups of women. Mothers in

low-skill and low-income jobs bear the bulk of the wage penalty (Blau and Winkler 2017; Budig

and Hodges 2014; Budig 2014). Non-married mothers and African American mothers also face a

greater wage gap than do married, white, or Hispanic mothers (Pal and Waldfogel 2016).

       It is difficult to determine whether the relationship between motherhood and lower wages

is causal, or whether it results from the selection of women with lower wages into motherhood.

The timing of the emergence of a prominent gender wage gap—after age thirty-five, when many

workers are married and begin to have children—indicates a plausible causal story (Budig 2014).

Blau and Kahn (2017) posit several reasons to expect the motherhood wage penalty to be causal.

First, without paid parental leave, women may be more likely to leave their employers upon the

birth of a child; they may exit the labor force or join an employer with more family-friendly

policies. Second, if firms expect women to leave upon childbirth, they may refrain from hiring or

investing in women. Finally, having children may change worker behavior in ways difficult to

measure, such as decreased productivity or work scheduling restrictions. It is likely, therefore,

that the motherhood penalty occurs due to issues that arise after childbirth (Goldin 2014; Blau

and Kahn 2017), indicating that EEO policies are not sufficient to close the gap.

       In summary, while EEO policies have likely played a role in narrowing gender gaps,

progress in recent years has stalled. Though men and women begin their careers on similar

ground, their trajectories diverge after having children. This may be due in large part to the fact

that the time demands associated with having children are largely borne by women, which can

decrease labor force participation and wages (Blau and Kahn 2017).




                                                                                                      5
Family-friendly policies

       As compared to EEO policies, where the U.S. has been a leader, in the domain of family-

friendly policies the U.S. lags behind its peers. While EEO policies have likely helped narrow

overall gender wage and employment gaps, these policies do not address gaps for women with

children, which are now the major drivers of overall gender gaps. Family-friendly policies—

which would help women maintain labor force attachment after having children—are needed to

continue the foundation set by EEO policies.

       Evidence from peer countries indicates that family-friendly policies may help reduce

gender gaps. Blau and Kahn (2013) find that while the gender gap in labor force participation in

the U.S. fell from 19.4 percentage points in 1990 to 14.1 percentage points in 2010, it fell much

more substantially—on average, from 26.9 percentage points to 13.0 percentage points—in

twenty-one other countries over the same period. Applying average family-friendly policies in

other countries to the U.S., they estimate that family-friendly policies would have increased U.S.

women’s labor force participation rate from 75.2 percent to 82 percent during this time period.

Further, while other nations have experienced similar economic and technological challenges as

the U.S., our peer countries have not experienced stalled female labor force participation (Black,

Schanzenbach, and Breitwieser 2017). Taken together, this evidence suggests that strengthening

family-friendly policies may help close gender gaps for mothers that EEO policies have not yet

touched. Michelle Budig, Joya Misra, and Irene Boeckmann (2015), using data from twenty-two




                                                                                                    6
nations, find that the most effective policies to keep mothers in the labor force after childbirth are

mid-length leaves and childcare, and that both policies reduce the motherhood wage penalty.2

       Given the potentially important role that family-friendly policies might play in reducing

the gender gaps in the U.S., we focus on three key family-friendly policies: paid family leave,

childcare, and work scheduling flexibility.


        Paid family leave

       The U.S. is the only industrialized country that does not provide paid and job-protected

leave for new parents. Qualified employees may take up to twelve weeks of job-protected leave

under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), though only approximately 60 percent of

workers are eligible (Klerman, Daley, and Pozniak 2012). Paid family leave (PFL) has garnered

increased attention in recent years, as California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and, most recently,

New York, have implemented these policies; Washington, D.C., Massachusetts, and Washington

state will be implementing these policies in the coming years. These policies augment

longstanding Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) programs through which mothers in 5 states

(California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island) can take some paid leave during

pregnancy and post-childbirth. The effects of PFL are theoretically ambiguous, as they depend

on how mothers and employers react to leave availability and leave-taking (Rossin-Slater 2017).

       California’s PFL is the most extensively studied U.S. program, as it dates back the

furthest, to 2004. Research generally finds positive outcomes for children and parents (Milkman

and Appelbaum 2013; Bartel et al. 2014; Stearns 2015; Bedard and Rossin-Slater 2016; Boushey




2
  It is important to note that such policies may not fully eliminate gaps, if gendered roles and
attitudes persist (Kleven, Landais, and Søgaard 2018).
                                                                                                    7
2016; Rossin-Slater 2017). Specifically, with regard to labor market outcomes, the evidence

from California suggests that PFL increases the likelihood that mothers return to work in the nine

to twelve months following a birth by 18 percentage points, increases weeks and hours worked

by mothers when children are one and two years old (Baum and Ruhm 2016), and increases

weekly work hours for mothers of children under the age of three by 10 to 17 percent (Rossin-

Slater, Ruhm, and Waldfogel 2013). One potential mechanism is that PFL may keep women in

the workforce who otherwise would have dropped out after having a child (Rossin-Slater 2017).

PFL is therefore a promising strategy to boost the U.S.’s sagging labor force participation for

mid-career women, potentially decreasing the gender gaps in labor force participation and wages.


       Childcare

       Childcare is a critical component of family-friendly policy, especially for mothers of

young children. As compared to parental leave, childcare may be particularly relevant in

reducing gender gaps because it allows mothers to continue in employment without taking time

off and/or reducing work hours, and because it affects a longer portion of their working life

(Olivetti and Petrongolo 2017).. However, childcare is largely seen as a private responsibility in

the U.S. (Craig and Mullan 2010; Chaudry et al. 2017). While subsidies are available for low-

income families, only about 15 percent of eligible families receive such assistance (Chaudry et

al. 2017). Tax credits are available to low- and middle-income families but are not widely used

due to cumbersome program rules (Chaudry et al. 2017). Publicly funded childcare centers,

preschools, and pre-kindergartens serve a small share of preschool age children.

       Access to high-quality and affordable childcare has the potential to improve a variety of

parent and child outcomes, including parental attachment to the labor market and wages

(Usdansky and Wolf 2008; Ha and Miller 2015; Chaudry et al. 2017). International evidence
                                                                                                     8
indicates that greater spending on childcare is associated with increased female employment and

decreased gender wage gaps (Olivetti and Petrongolo 2017). Recent evidence from Washington,

D.C. shows that providing free preschool for three- and four-year-olds increases maternal labor

force participation by 10 percentage points (Malik 2018). Affordability is particularly crucial.

Considerable evidence indicates that childcare costs affect women’s wages and labor force

participation (Herbst 2010; Ahn 2012; Ha and Miller 2015), especially for low-income families.

In 2011, families who used childcare spent an average of 7 percent of income on care; low-

income families spent 30 percent or more (Laughlin 2013). Yet current U.S. spending on

childcare is low. The U.S. spends approximately 2 percent of GDP on childcare, and less than

0.2 percent of GDP on programs for young children (Chaudry et al. 2017).

       Because public provision is limited, employer-provided childcare could potentially be a

promising solution. While employer-supported childcare would have direct costs, it could also

promote worker productivity and commitment (Hipp, Morrissey, and Warner 2017) and reduce

absences and interruptions (Usdansky and Wolf 2008). Yet most American employers do not

provide any support for childcare: the National Compensation Survey indicates that only 11

percent of workers have access to employer-provided childcare, a proportion that has held

roughly constant for the past two decades (U.S. Department of Labor 2017). Little is known

about whether women are less likely to have access to this benefit than their male peers.


       Work scheduling

       Finally, policies that affect work hours and schedules, such as the right to request part

time or flexible hours and advance work schedules, can help women stay in the labor force after

having children by providing an avenue by which to reconcile responsibilities to an employer

and the family. These policies may be beneficial to women across the income distribution. For
                                                                                                   9
salaried workers, scheduling flexibility policies are associated both with an increase in female

labor force participation after childbirth (Herr and Wolfram 2012) and an increase in female

wages (Weeden 2005). These policies may be particularly beneficial for women in low-wage

jobs, as they tend to have the least flexibility and may be penalized by being assigned fewer

hours if they request it (Goldin 2014; Boushey 2016).

       Although there is less research to date on these policies than other types of family-

friendly policies, recent studies have brought work scheduling practices to the forefront of public

attention and have identified three primary types of unpredictable scheduling: lack of advance

notice, last-minute scheduling changes, and changes in weekly work schedules (Henly and

Lambert 2014). Recent results from the first randomized controlled trial of an intervention

targeting unpredictable scheduling are promising (Williams et al. 2018). The intervention,

conducted at Gap, Inc. stores in San Francisco and Chicago from November 2015 to August

2016, addressed unpredictable work scheduling by requiring stores to provide two-weeks

advance notice of schedules, end the use of “just-in-time” scheduling, allow swapping of shifts

among employees through an app, improve consistency of schedules from week to week, and

guarantee some workers a minimum number of hours per week, among other practices. Results

show that these practices increased median sales by 7 percent, increased worker productivity by

5 percent, and were generally welcomed both by employees and managers.

       National surveys suggest that 6 percent of the workforce has flexibility in location of

work and 49 percent has flexibility in hours or days worked (U.S. Department of Labor 2017).

But the specific types of flexibility measured vary considerably, and little evidence exists as to

gender differences in access to flexible work arrangements.




                                                                                                     10
Access to Family-Friendly Benefits
Data and methods
       We use national survey data from two datasets to provide new evidence on access to

employer-provided paid leave, childcare, and work scheduling flexibility in the U.S. and

consider whether there are gender differentials in such access. The first dataset, the American

Time Use Survey (ATUS) 2011 Leave Module, is a nationally representative sample of the

working-age population aged fifteen to eighty-five years. Critical for our purposes, the Leave

Module contains detailed measures of whether the respondent receives paid leave from his or her

employer, including whether he/she is able to take paid leave for vacation, errands or personal

reasons, own illness or medical care, a family member’s illness or medical care, childcare,

eldercare, or the birth or adoption of a child. While the ATUS provides important details about

whether and how workers can use paid leave, it does not measure whether workers have access

to paid parental leave specifically set aside for new mothers and fathers.

       We therefore turn to the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97), which

has measures of paid leave specifically to be used by new parents. The NLSY97 is a nationally

representative sample of persons who were ages twelve to sixteen in 1997; we use data from

2011, 2013, and 2015, when the respondents are ages twenty-six to thirty-six. Thus, the NLSY97

not only provides measures not captured in the ATUS, but it also provides a large sample of

working adults in prime childbearing years. We also use the NLSY97 to examine access to

employer-provided or subsidized childcare; the ATUS does not measure childcare benefits.

       Finally, we return to the ATUS to study access to work scheduling flexibility. The Leave

Module asks respondents whether they can vary their work schedules in lieu of using leave time.

Respondents indicate whether they can vary work scheduling by the day of the week, hours

worked in a day, or work location. This measure captures flexibility that workers may utilize
                                                                                                  11
when they would otherwise have to use paid or unpaid leave, but it does not capture whether they

have access to more regular flexibility. We therefore use the NLSY97 to examine whether

workers report a regularly accessible flexible work schedule. Last, we use the ATUS to study

working from home, which is another method for achieving flexibility. To do this, we examine

the number of minutes that respondents report working while at home in a given day.

       For ease of interpretation, ordinary least squares (OLS) linear probability models are

estimated to predict access to family-friendly policies (results from probit models are similar).

We restrict our analysis of the ATUS sample to prime-age workers ages twenty-five to fifty-four

old; as noted earlier, the NLSY97 sample contains only respondents ages twenty-six to thirty-six.

Our primary variable of interest is gender. We also include a set of individual and employer

control variables. Individual covariates include race and ethnicity (white non-Hispanic, black

non-Hispanic, Hispanic, or other non-Hispanic), age, age-squared, education (high school degree

or less, some college, or college degree or more), relationship status (married, cohabiting, or

single), household composition (no children, youngest child ages zero to five, or youngest child

ages six to seventeen), and citizenship status (native-born citizen, foreign-born citizen, or

foreign-born noncitizen). Employer covariates include industry (thirteen dummies using the 2007

Census Industry Classification system), occupation (six dummies using the 2010 Census

Occupation Classification system), sector (government, private non-profit, or private for-profit),

and union status. We also include controls for geographic area (state fixed effects in the ATUS;

region fixed effects in the NLSY97). As the NLSY97 includes observations from multiple years,

we include year fixed effects in these models.

       We estimate three sets of models. The first includes only controls for individual

characteristics (plus the relevant geographic fixed effects and, in the NLSY97, year effects). The

control for part-time status, which is also potentially endogenous. As such, we estimate the

Primary results

       Table 1 presents unadjusted means for access to family-friendly policies by gender in the

ATUS and NLSY97. While the majority of respondents of both genders report access to some

type of paid leave, a significantly smaller share of female respondents (4.3 percentage points

fewer than men) have paid leave (panel A). In the ATUS, there are no significant gender

differentials in access to paid leave for infant bonding but in the NLSY97 (panel B), we find that

significantly more women have access to paid parental leave. Turning to employer-

provided/subsidized childcare, results from the NLSY97 indicate that fewer than one in ten

workers receive this benefit with no gender differential in access (panel B). Finally, ATUS

results in panel A shows no significant gender difference in access to scheduling flexibility in

lieu of using leave, and no significant gender difference in daily minutes spent working from

home. However, results for the NLSY97 measure of regular access to scheduling flexibility

(panel B) indicate a significantly greater share of women have access to this benefit.

                                          [Insert table 1]

       The gender differences observed in Table 1 could be explained by a sorting model in

which workers sort into firms based on characteristics such as wages, family-friendly policies,

and the availability of part-time hours. Male and female workers may value these characteristics

differently, both because of personal preferences and because of the constraints they face, such

as requiring time for caregiving. Women with children, or women who anticipate having

children, may be more likely to sort into firms that accommodate their preferences and

constraints, even if doing so requires a trade-off of pay and other benefits. For example, a mother

with young children may prefer a job in which she can work part-time, though this may mean she

does not have access to paid time off.

                                                                                                   14
       Tables 2 and 3 provide evidence consistent with this type of sorting. Table 2 shows that

women, especially those with children, are significantly more likely to work part time than men.

Table 3 considers whether part-time jobs provide fewer family-friendly benefits than full-time

jobs. With the exception of scheduling flexibility for the NLSY97 sample, all the part-time/full-

time differentials in family friendly policies are significant. Taken together, Tables 2 and 3

demonstrate that women are more likely to engage in part-time work and, in so doing, they

forego access to family friendly benefits. With regard to wages, we find no significant hourly

wage differential for part-time vs. full-time workers in the NLSY97; as expected, there is a

significant difference in annual hours worked.

                                           [Insert tables 2 and 3]

       The results in tables 2 and 3 suggest that part-time status may explain why table 1 shows

gender differentials in access to some family-friendly benefits. To more fully explore whether

part-time status alone, or other control variables, explain the gender differentials, we next turn to

the OLS regression results. Table 4 reports results using ATUS data, with panel A showing

results for access to any paid leave by prime-age workers, panel B showing access to scheduling

flexibility in lieu of leave, and panel C showing time spent working from home on a given day3.

When specified only with individual controls and state fixed effects (column 1), and when

adding employer controls (column 2), women are around 5 percentage points less likely to have

access to any paid leave than men. Column 3 adds a control for part-time status, which

essentially brings the gender differential to zero. This result indicates that, while women have

less access to paid leave, this differential is driven by part-time workers, who are 37.7 percentage

points less likely to have access to paid leave than full-time workers (see appendix table A1).

       Table 5 uses the ATUS to study gender differentials by allowed type of paid leave use.4

Specifications 1 and 2 (panels A and B) indicate that women are significantly less likely (5 to 7

percentage points) to have access to leave that can be used for vacation, personal time, their own

illness, or someone else’s illness. Once we account for part-time status (panel C), these

differences are no longer significant. Nor do we see significant gender differences in being able

to use paid leave for infant bonding. To explicitly examine paid parental leave more closely, we

turn to the primary regression results for the NLSY97, as shown in panel A of table 6 (full results

shown in appendix table A2). Across all three specifications, these results indicate that, among

workers of prime childbearing age, women are up to 7.5 percentage points more likely to have

access to paid parental leave than similar men even when we control for part-time status.

                                     [Insert tables 4, 5, and 6]

       Using the NLSY97, access to employer-provided childcare for workers of prime

childbearing age is studied in Panel B of table 6. Specification 1 shows no significant gender

differential, specification 2 indicates that women are significantly less likely (1.6 percentage

points) to have access to childcare than similar men, and, as in table 4, the addition of a control

for part-time status in specification 3 yields an insignificant gender difference (part-time workers

are 4 to 5 percentage points less likely to have access to employer-provided childcare than full-

time workers; table A3).

 Due to missing data, our sample varies according to the outcome measure used. When
conducting the same analysis with a consistent sample (n=2,403), our results are similar in
magnitude, direction, and significance.
                                                                                                   16
        Gender differentials in access to scheduling flexibility in lieu of taking leave are studied

using both datasets. Using the ATUS, Panel B of table 4 indicates no significant gender

differences in access to any flexibility in lieu of leave nor in access to particular types of

flexibility (see appendix table A4 for full estimates of table 2, panel B; see appendix table A5 for

estimates by type of leave). Using the NLSY97, estimates in panel C of table 6 examine gender

differentials in regular access to scheduling flexibility (see appendix table A6 for full estimates).

While specification 1 suggests that women are 3.6 percentage points more likely to have access

to such flexibility than men with similar personal characteristics, specifications 2 and 3 indicate

no significant gender differential. Taken together, these results show there are no gender

difference in access to scheduling flexibility, whether it is in lieu of leave or more regularly

available. Finally, using the ATUS in panel C of Table 4, we find no significant gender

differences in minutes spent working from home on a given day, suggesting that women are not

disproportionately likely to work from home instead of using other forms of scheduling

flexibility.


Education-stratified results

        Educational attainment influences the types of firms and jobs into which workers sort. As

such, in supplemental models we examined results stratified by level of educational attainment

(high school degree or less, some college but no degree, and a college degree or more). These

regressions (shown in table 7) include state fixed effects, individual controls, employer controls

and part-time status. In no case are women significantly less likely to have access to any leave

than their male counterparts, and in the NLSY97 women in all education groups are significantly

more likely to have access to paid parental leave. When considering childcare, the most highly-

educated women are 5 percentage points less likely to have access to employer-provided or

                                                                                                   17
subsidized childcare than comparable men. Finally, our results indicate that women with a

college degree or more are less likely to have access to regular flexibility than similar men,

though women with less educational attainment do not appear to face these differentials.


Policy Implications

       Our analysis shows that while women have less access to any employer-provided paid

leave than men, this is entirely explained by part-time status. It seems that women are sorting

into part-time jobs to have more time for caregiving and in so doing are foregoing income and

access to paid time off. However, we also found that young women, even those in part-time

jobs, are more likely than men to have access to specifically designated paid parental leave.

Furthermore, we found insignificant gender differentials in access to employer-provided or

subsidized childcare, and access to scheduling flexibility. Thus, the problem with access to

family-friendly policies is not gender differences but rather overall low levels of access to such

policies for both women and men.

         There are two main mechanisms by which public policy could expand coverage. One is

to mandate that employers provide such coverage. Employer mandates are ill-suited to many

types of family-friendly policies, as they can lead to discrimination against workers with children

(Gruber 1994), particularly women, and they can impose high costs on employers, particularly

on small businesses (Mathur et al. 2017). Employer mandates however may be the only

alternative when the policies involve workplace practices such as scheduling.

       The second mechanism—to provide such coverage through public provision—is more

appropriate than employer mandates in situations with both high costs and the potential for

discrimination. Family-friendly policies often can be funded through a small payroll tax on all

workers and/or employers, thereby distributing the cost of coverage across workers rather than

                                                                                                  18
burdening the specific employers whose employees take leave. In addition, universal provision

mitigates the potential for worker selection into jobs with family-friendly benefits and employer

discrimination against these workers, although discrimination could still occur if employers face

other costs and believe that particular groups of workers will be more likely to use the benefits.

       With these considerations in mind, we now turn to a discussion of whether and how

family friendly policies might be expanded to address the shortfalls in coverage that we found.


Access to paid family leave

       We found that young women are significantly more likely to have access to paid parental

leave than comparable men. Yet overall levels of access to paid parental leave are low, with

estimates indicating that slightly less than half (NLSY97) to slightly more than half (ATUS) of

all workers have access to this benefit. While mandating employers to provide paid family leave

receives strong public support (Horowitz et al. 2017), this may not be the appropriate mechanism

by which to provide paid family leave, as it would likely be costly for employers and result in

discrimination against women of childbearing age.5 With regard to public provision, several

states have enacted paid family leave policies that are in effect (California, New Jersey, New

York, and Rhode Island) or soon to be implemented (Massachusetts, Washington, and also

Washington D.C.). While these policies vary widely in terms of length of leave, wage

replacement rate, and eligibility requirements, they are generally funded through increased




5
 A related option would be an employer incentive, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017,
which offers a 12.5 to 25 percent tax credit incentive for employers to provide paid family leave
to lower-income workers, but the incentive does not offset the cost of providing this benefit and
may not see a high take-up rate among employers who did not previously offer paid family leave
(Mathur et al. 2017).
                                                                                                19
payroll taxes either solely on employees or on both employees and employers (National

Partnership for Women & Families 2018). For example, California’s program, which is funded

through employee payroll taxes, costs the average worker $2 per month in additional payroll

taxes (Milkman and Appelbaum 2013).

       While public provision has relatively low costs for workers, the costs to employers are

potentially greater. Firms in California argued that the indirect costs of the law, such as paying

current workers overtime or hiring and training temporary workers to complete the work of the

employee on leave, would be detrimental, although post-law surveys found that a majority of

employers indicated they were either unaffected or positively affected by the law (Milkman and

Appelbaum 2013). Some employers even report being helped by the law, as the policy has

replaced the costs of providing employees with paid family leave. Employer surveys in Rhode

Island, New Jersey, and New York also indicate widespread support, with roughly two-thirds of

employers supporting the law in their state and an additional 10 to 15 percent having neutral

views (Bartel et al. 2017). On the federal level, several Congressional representatives from both

parties have proposed paid family leave policies (see Mathur et al. 2017 for a discussion of these

proposals).


Access to childcare

       Employer mandates are probably ill-suited to expand access to childcare. Not only would

the cost of such a benefit be burdensome for employers, it also may result in discrimination

against workers with children. Evidence indicates that mothers who opt out of employment to

care for children are seen as less committed, less capable, and less deserving of employment by

firms (Weisshaar 2018) and receive fewer callbacks for interviews (Correll, Benard, and Paik



                                                                                                     20
2007; Weisshaar 2018).6 A childcare mandate might exacerbate these gender differences if

women are seen as more costly to employ.

       Also, as a practical matter, the share of employers offering paid family leave is extremely

low (only about one in ten). Thus, expanding public childcare programs may be the most feasible

way to increase access. Though some states and cities have enacted universal pre-kindergarten

programs, these programs typically provide only one (or two) years of care and currently serve

less than a third of four-year-old children. Expanding childcare subsidies for low-income

families, while streamlining the application and renewal process and lengthening eligibility

periods, could greatly benefit households at the bottom of the income distribution. Other

measures such as expanded tax credits or more public funding through sliding scale fees will be

needed to reach middle-income families who also face high costs but typically receive little

employer or public support.

       These public policies have low potential to impose costs on employers, as they are

generally funded through taxes on earners; employers even may benefit from a reduction in work

absences and interruptions. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, childcare access is believed to be

particularly beneficial in reducing gender gaps because it allows women to avoid work

interruptions and/or reductions in work hours.




6
  Family-friendly policies may also lead to employer discrimination: if firms believe women will
require a change in hours or decrease productivity after childbirth, they may not hire or invest in
women (Blau and Kahn 2013; Thomas 2018). Mallika Thomas (2018) exploits variation from the
introduction of the FMLA to examine the effect of increased access to job-protected leave on
firm behavior. She finds that since the enactment of FMLA, women under the age of 40 are 5
percent more likely to stay employed but 8 percent less likely to be promoted, as compared to
women hired pre-FMLA.
                                                                                                  21
Access to work scheduling flexibility

       Employer mandates are likely the most appropriate mechanism by which to promote

scheduling flexibility, as scheduling involves workplace practices that cannot be provided

through public provision. Policies to promote scheduling flexibility would need to address the

different issues faced by hourly workers and salaried workers. For hourly workers, scheduling

flexibility means protections against unpredictable schedules. This can be accomplished by

equipping the worker with input into both the number of hours per week and the time of day the

hours are worked. For salaried workers, scheduling flexibility often means providing the worker

with the ability to adjust when (and potentially where) their work is done, as well as the right to

request part-time or flexible work. However, scheduling flexibility policies have been found to

be associated with both hiring and wage penalties against women (Goldin 2014) and thus may

have unintended consequences.

       Several cities, including Emeryville, San Francisco, Seattle, New York, as well as the

states of New York and Oregon, have enacted scheduling control policies focused on low-wage

workers (Williams et al. 2018). While provisions vary, they generally mandate employers to

adhere to a minimum amount of advance scheduling notice and to pay workers for any last-

minute changes to schedules (Williams et al. 2018). Further, all workers (hourly and salaried) in

the cities of Berkeley, San Francisco, and New York, and in the states of New Hampshire and

Vermont, have the right to request flexibility in work arrangements (1 Million for Worker

Flexibility n.d.). On the federal level congressional representatives from both parties have

proposed policies focused both on scheduling flexibility and on scheduling control (1 Million for

Worker Flexibility n.d.)




                                                                                                  22
       Employers may worry that an inability to change workers’ schedules at the last-minute

will harm their bottom lines, as many employers—particularly in retail and service—have long

relied on “just-in-time” scheduling to match the number of employees to in-store traffic.

Experimental evidence indicates that this concern does not bear out: employers who give

workers more scheduling control see an increase in sales that is far greater than the additional

cost associated with giving workers greater scheduling control, and workers who control their

own schedules are significantly more productive on the job (Williams et al. 2018). Scheduling

flexibility holds other potential benefits for employers. First, flexibility may boost retention,

which could lower recruiting and training costs. On average, replacing a worker costs an

employer about 20 percent of the worker’s salary (or about 16 percent for workers earning less

than $30,000 per year) (Boushey 2016).


Conclusion


       EEO policies, in combination with other factors such as changing gender norms and

roles, have contributed to substantial progress toward closing gender gaps in the workplace.

However, after the birth of children, women’s career trajectories diverge significantly from

men’s, In this paper, we considered whether family-friendly policies are a potentially promising

solution to promoting workplace gender equality among parents. Using data from the American

Time Use Survey and the NLSY97, we provide new evidence on employer provision of these

policies, finding that the gender differential in access to paid leave through employers is entirely

explained by the greater likelihood of women being in part-time jobs. In order to accommodate

caregiving responsibilities, women sort into part-time jobs and thereby forego income and

various types of paid leave. Offsetting this is the fact that young women are more likely to have


                                                                                                    23
access to paid parental leave There are no significant gender differentials in access to childcare

through an employer or access to scheduling flexibility.

       Although there are no gender differentials in access to family friendly policies, access to

such policies remains rather low in the U.S. Public policies—such as a federal provision for paid

family leave, expanded public and/or subsidized childcare, and employer mandates for

scheduling control and flexibility—could play an important role in helping all families,

particularly those who are low-income, navigate the tension between work and home, and have

the potential to continue progress made by EEO toward a more gender equitable workforce.
