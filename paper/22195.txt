                                         ABSTRACT

Does an intensification of competition among banks increase or decrease liquidity creation? By
integrating the dynamic process of interstate bank deregulation that lowered barriers to
competition across U.S. states over the 1980s and 1990s with the gravity model of the geographic
expansion of banks, we construct time-varying measures of the competitive pressures facing each
individual bank. We find that regulatory-induced competition reduced liquidity creation.
Consistent with some theories, we also find that the liquidity-destroying effects of competition
are mitigated among more profitable banks and heightened among smaller banks.

1. INTRODUCTION
     Liquidity creation is a vital service that banks provide to the economy. They create

liquidity by using relatively liquid liabilities, such as demand deposits, to fund relatively

illiquid assets, such as business loans. This simultaneously satisfies the demand for liquidity

by savers and the demand for longer-term financing commitments by firms (Bryant, 1980;

Diamond and Dybvig, 1983; Gatev and Strahan, 2006). Banks also create liquidity off the

balance sheet by providing loan commitments and standby letters of credit that allow firms to

develop and modify long-run investment strategies efficiently (Boot, Greenbaum, and Thakor

1993; Holmstrom and Tirole, 1998; Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein, 2002). By creating liquidity,

theory suggests that banks improve the allocation of capital and accelerate economic growth

(Bencivenga and Smith, 1991; Levine, 1991). Empirically, Berger and Sedunov (2016) find

that the positive impact of liquidity creation on economic growth is larger than the growth

effects of other services provided by banks.

     Given the importance of liquidity creation, there is surprisingly little empirical work on

the factors shaping liquidity creation. Indeed, it is only recently that Berger and Bouwman

(2009) created the first comprehensive measures of liquidity creation, which include data on

all asset-side, liability-side, and off-balance sheet activities for U.S. banks over the period

from 1993 to 2003. With these data, they examine the connection between capital regulations

and liquidity creation. Cornett, et al (2011), Berger, Makaew, and Turk-Ariss (2015), and

Peydro, Polo, and Sette (2016) examine how liquidity creation changes when banks are under

financial duress.

     In this paper, we evaluate whether U.S. bank regulatory reforms that intensified
competition among banks increased, decreased, or had no effect on liquidity creation. While

researchers have actively studied the impact of regulatory-induced competition on bank

risk-taking, efficiency, and valuations (e.g., Jayaratne and Strahan, 1998; Hellmann et al.,

2000; Boyd and De Nicolo, 2005; Goetz, Laeven, and Levine, 2013, 2016; and Houston et al.,

2010), we are unaware of any previous research on how competition shapes liquidity creation.

     Theory offers differing perspectives on the impact of competition on bank liquidity

creation. One strand of research suggests that competition reduces liquidity creation by
                                                                                               2



lowering the risk absorption capacity of banks. There are two building blocks to this view.

First, by squeezing profit margins and depleting buffers against losses (Jayaratne and Strahan,

1998), competition can induce banks to reduce risk-taking (Boyd and De Nicolo, 2005;

Peydro, Polo, and Sette 2016). Second, liquidity creation is risky, i.e., banks tend to suffer

losses if they must quickly dispose of illiquid assets to meet the demands of those holding

liquid liabilities (Allen and Santomero 1998; Allen and Gale 2004). Thus, competition can

induce banks to lower their risks by reducing liquidity creation. A second strand of research

suggests that competition will reduce liquidity creation by impeding relationship lending. This

view begins by noting that competition can make it easier for firms to change banks, making

it harder for banks to recoup the costs of building long-run relationships with firms (Petersen

and Rajan, 1995; Black and Strahan, 2002; Cetorelli and Strahan, 2006). Furthermore,

research finds that long-run bank-firms relationships can facilitate banks’ acquisition of “soft”

information about firms, including the liquidation value of firm assets (Berger et al., 2005;

Berger and Udell, 1995; Diamond and Rajan, 2001). As a result, “relationship lenders” are in

a position to create liquidity more effectively than other lenders. Under these conditions,

competition can impede effective liquidity creation by reducing relationship lending.

     Theory also suggests mechanisms through which competition can boost liquidity

creation. First, competition tends to spur financial innovation and improve efficiency (Boot

and Thakor, 2000; Black and Strahan, 2002; Laeven, Levine, and Michalopoulos, 2015). One

dimension along which the bank might innovate is liquidity creation. Second, competition

tends to make banks more transparent (Jiang, Levine and Lin, 2016), which can spur bank

managers to devote more effort to screening potential borrowers and monitoring firms. In turn,

improvements in credit allocation can encourage more bank lending and more liquidity

creation. Thus theory provides differing views on the effect of competition on liquidity

creation.

     To assess the impact of competition on liquidity creation, we follow a two-step method

for constructing time-varying measures of the competitive pressures facing each bank. First,

as in Goetz, Laeven, and Levine (2013), we exploit the process of interstate bank deregulation

that lowered barriers to competition between banks in different states. From the late-1970s
                                                                                                 3



through 1995, states removed regulatory barriers to banks from other states entering their

borders. States removed restrictions in a dynamic, state-specific process either by unilaterally

opening their state borders and allowing out-of-state banks to enter or by signing reciprocal

bilateral and multilateral agreements with other states. States started interstate bank

deregulation in different years and followed different paths of deregulation as they signed

agreements with different states in different years. The process ended with the passage of the

Riegle-Neal Act of 1994, which effectively eliminated restrictions on interstate banking.

    Second, we integrate this dynamic process of interstate bank deregulation with the

“gravity model” of investment, as in Jiang, Levine, and Lin (2016). For any state j, the

process of interstate bank deregulation provides time-varying information on the ability of

banks from other states to enter and compete in state j. The gravity model differentiates

among banks within state j. It predicts that the costs to banks in state k of establishing a

subsidiary somewhere in state j are positively related to geographic distance. Thus, the

integration of interstate bank deregulation and the gravity model predicts that when state j

allows banks from state k to enter, this will intensify competition more among banks in state j

that are closer to state k than among banks in state j that are farther away from k.

Operationally, for each bank i in each period, we (1) identify those states whose banks can

enter bank i’s state, and (2) weight each of those states by the inverse of its distance to bank i.

This yields an inverse-distance measure of the regulatory-induced competitive environment

facing each bank i in each period. We create two additional competition measures by further

weighting by either the economic size of or the number of banks in each “foreign” state. Thus,

by integrating the dynamic process of interstate bank deregulation with the predictions of the

gravity model, we construct three time-varying, bank-specific measures of competition.

     To measure liquidity creation, we use the four Berger and Bouwman (2009) measures of

liquidity creations and extend them to cover our sample period. For the two category-based

measures, each on- and off-balance sheet bank item was categorized as either liquid,

semiliquid, or illiquid. For example, liquid items include short-term deposits, trading assets,

securitizable loans, and commercial paper, while illiquid items include business loans, loan

commitments, and letters of credit. Then, a weight of 0.5 was assigned to illiquid assets,
                                                                                                 4



liquid liabilities, and illiquid off-balance sheet items and a weight of -0.5 was assigned to

liquid assets, illiquid liabilities, and liquid off-balance sheet items. A weight of 0 was assigned

to all semiliquid items. A bank’s category-based liquidity creation measure was constructed as

the value-weighted sum of those items. Following Berger and Bouwman (2009), we also use a

category-based measure that excludes off-balance sheet items. For the two maturity-based

measures of liquidity creation, the on- and off-balance sheets items were categorized as liquid

or illiquid based on whether they mature in less than or more than one year and then follow

the same weighting schedule for the category-based measures. Given data availability, we

conduct the analyses over the period from 1984 through 2006 using annual data.

       We use a difference-in-differences estimation strategy to identify the impact of

competition on liquidity creation. The dependent variable is one of the liquidity creation

measures, which is measured at the bank-year level. The key independent variable is a

measure of the deregulation-induced competition pressures facing each bank in each year. We

include state-year fixed effects to control for all time-varying state characteristics. We include

bank fixed effects to control for all time invariant bank traits. Furthermore, we show that the

results are robust to controlling for various time-varying bank-specific characteristics. In

addition, a large body of existing research, as well as validity tests reported below, supports

our estimation strategy. For example, research finds that interstate bank deregulation does not

reflect bank performance (Jayaratne and Strahan, 1998; Goetz, Laeven, and Levine, 2013) or

state economic performance (Jayaratne and Strahan, 1996; Beck, Levine, and Levkov, 2010).

Moreover, we find that liquidity creation by banks in a state does not predict the timing of

interstate bank deregulation and discover no evidence that differential pre-trends in liquidity

creation across different states or banks account for the results.

     We find that an intensification of competition in the banking industry materially reduces

liquidity creation. This holds for each of the four measures of liquidity creation and for each

of the three different measures of the deregulation-induced competitive pressures facing

individual banks. The estimates indicate that the impact is economically large. For example,

we find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the competitive pressures facing a bank is

associated with a 3.5 percentage point reduction in liquidity creation, which is large
                                                                                               5



considering that the sample average level of liquidity creation is 20 percent of total assets.

When applying this estimate to the average (median) bank in our sample, which has gross

total assets of $104 million ($627 million), the 3.5 percentage point reduction in the ratio of

liquidity creation to assets implies a loss of $3.6 million ($21.9 million) in liquidity creation

by the average (median) bank. Although existing work advertises the beneficial effects of

interstate bank deregulation and the corresponding intensification of competition, our research

indicates that this process of deregulation reduced liquidity creation. We also explore the

relation between the regulatory reform measures and the three components of the

category-based liquidity creation measure: asset-side, liability-side, and off-balance sheet

liquidity creation. We find that a drop in asset-side liquidity creation accounts for a large

proportion of the negative effect of competition on liquidity creation.

     We next push the analyses beyond our core question of assessing the net effect of

competition on liquidity creation and explore two potential mechanisms through which

competition can reduce liquidity creation. Specifically, one view is that by squeezing profit

margins, competition reduces the willingness of banks to absorb more risk through liquidity

creation and hence reduces liquidity creation. If competition affects liquidity creation through

this profitability channel, then the negative impact of competition on liquidity creation should

be smaller among more profitable banks that have a large risk-absorbing buffer that can better

hedge liquidity risk. To test whether the data are consistent with this profitability channel, we

examine whether the negative impact of competition on liquidity provision is smaller among

more profitable banks. A second view is that by reducing the incentives of banks to establish

long-term relationship with their customers, an intensification of competition impedes

liquidity creation. If competition reduces liquidity creation through this relationship-lending

channel, the negative effect of competition on liquidity creation should be stronger among

banks that engage more intensively in relationship lending. To test this conjecture, we use

small sized banks to proxy for relationship lenders.

     We find evidence consistent with the view that a regulatory-induced intensification of

competition reduces bank liquidity creation both by squeezing profit margins and by

impeding relationship lending. Specifically, we find that more profitable banks, as measured
                                                                                              6



by net interest margins, experience a smaller reduction in liquidity creation in response to

interstate bank deregulation. Similarly, we find that an intensification of competition reduces

liquidity creation more among small banks. Taken together, this evidence on profitability and

size are consistent with two views on how competition affects liquidity creation.

     Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains data and econometric methodology.

Section 3 presents and discusses the empirical results. Section 4 concludes.



2. DATA AND METHODOLOGY
This section first discusses the data sources and sample of banks that we use to evaluate the

impact of an intensification of competition on liquidity creation by banks. Second, we

describe the construction of the key variables. Finally, we discuss our econometric strategy

and provide tests of the validity of this strategy.



2.1 Data sources and sample of banks
     We start with the population of commercial banks in the United States from 1984

through 2006. For each bank, the annual call report data are obtained from the Federal

Reserve Bank of Chicago, which provides Condition and Income statements for all

commercial banks regulated by the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance

Corporation, and the Comptroller of Currency. We exclude a bank if it has no deposits, has

zero or negative equity capital in the current or lagged year, has no commercial real estate or

commercial and industrial loans outstanding, or has unused commitments exceeding four

times its gross total assets. We also exclude banks that resemble thrifts, are classified by the

Federal Reserve as credit card banks, or have consumer loans over 50% of gross total assets.

We further exclude banks with average gross total assets below $25 million. Finally, we

follow the literature and drop Delaware and South Dakota because they have special laws to

encourage credit card banking. Our final sample contains 192,564 bank-year observations,

from 15,081 banks during the period from 1984 to 2006.



2.2 Liquidity creation
                                                                                                    7



     We use the four Berger and Bouwman (2009) measures of liquidity creation. To

construct their two category-based measures, they first classify each on- and off-balance sheet

bank item as either liquid, semiliquid, or illiquid. Appendix Table 1 details how Berger and

Bouwman (2009) define each on and off balance sheet item as liquid, semiliquid, and illiquid.

Second, they assign a weight to each category. Specifically, a weight of 0.5 is assigned to

illiquid assets, liquid liabilities, and illiquid off-balance sheet items; a weight of -0.5 is

assigned to liquid assets, illiquid liabilities, and liquid off-balance sheet items; and a weight of

0 is assigned to all semiliquid items. These weights assume that $1 of liquidity is created

(destroyed) when banks transform $1 of illiquid (liquid) assets or off-balance sheet items into

$1 of liquid (illiquid) liabilities. Finally, they compute a bank’s category-based liquidity

creation measure, Liquidity Creation (Category Based), as the weighted sum of the following

items:


Liquidity Creation (Category Based) = Asset-side Liquidity Creation +                         (1)
                                      Liability-side Liquidity Creation +
                                      Off-balance Sheet Liquidity Creation,

  where
          Asset-side Liquidity Creation = [0.5*Illiquid Assets + 0*Semiliquid Assets
                                         – 0.5*Liquid Assets]/Gross Total Assets,

          Liability-side Liquidity Creation=[0.5*Liquid Liabilities + 0*Semiliquid Liabilities
                                          – 0.5 * Illiquid Liabilities]/Gross Total Assets,

          Off-balance Sheet Liquidity Creation=[0.5*Illiquid off-balance Sheet Items +
                                       0*Semiliquid Off-balance Sheet Items –
                                       0.5*Liquid Off-balance Sheet Items]/Gross Total
                                       Assets,

where the bank-specific measures of on- and off-balance sheet subcomponents, such as

illiquid assets, semiliquid assets, liquid liabilities, etc., are computed as dollar values.

Furthermore, to make the measures comparable across banks, we normalize by the bank’s

gross total assets, which equals the sum of total assets, allowances for loan and lease losses,

and the allocated transfer risk reserve (a reserve for certain foreign loans).

     Besides Liquidity Creation (Category Based), we use three additional liquidity creation

measures from Berger and Bouwman (2009). First, we include only on-balance sheet items
                                                                                                  8



and call this measure, Liquidity Creation (Category Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet).

Second, we use two maturity-based measures of liquidity creation. The maturity-based

measures classify on- and off-balance sheet items as illiquid or liquid by whether they mature

in more or less than one year. Then, based on these maturity categories, we use the same

process as above. That is, we (1) assign a weight of 0.5 to illiquid assets, liquid liabilities, and

illiquid off-balance sheet items and a weight of -0.5 to liquid assets, illiquid liabilities, and

liquid off-balance sheet items and (2) compute the two value weighted maturity-based

measures:    Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based) and Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based,

excluding Off-balance Sheet). We winsorize the four liquidity creation ratios at the 1% and 99%

levels. Appendix Table 1 provides more details on these liquidity creation measures.

     We follow Berger and Bouwman (2009) and focus on the Liquidity Creation (Category

Based) for two main reasons. First, the liquidity of loans depends more on how easily and

inexpensively they can be securitized or sold rather than how soon the loans mature. Second,

off-balance sheet activities contribute materially to overall liquidity creation. As shown in

Table 1, roughly 20 percent of the total liquidity creation in our sample comes from

off-balance sheet items. As shown below, the results hold across the four liquidity creation

measures.



2.3 Measuring competition using interstate deregulation
     To measure exogenous changes in the competitive pressures facing each individual bank,

we exploit the removal of regulatory impediments to interstate banking during the last quarter

of the 20th century. By lowering regulatory barriers to banks headquartered in one state
establishing subsidiaries in another state, interstate bank deregulation increased the

contestability of banking markets, intensifying competition among banks. As a result of this

competition, interstate bank deregulation reduced interest rates on loans and increased interest

rates on deposits (Jayaratne and Strahan, 1998).

     From the late-1970s through 1995, states engaged in a process of interstate bank

deregulation, in which a state allowed banks from other states to acquire or establish

subsidiary banks within its borders. States removed restrictions in a dynamic, state-specific
                                                                                                                  9



process either by unilaterally opening their state borders and allowing out-of-state banks to

enter or by signing reciprocal bilateral and multilateral agreements with other states. States

both started interstate bank deregulation in different years and followed different paths of

deregulation as they signed agreements with different states in different years. The process of

interstate bank deregulation ended with the passage of the Riegle-Neal Act of 1994, which

effectively eliminated restrictions on interstate banking across the United States.

        Following Jiang, Levine, and Lin (2016), we integrate the dynamic, state-specific process

of interstate bank deregulation with the “gravity model” of investment to construct a

time-varying measure of the competitive pressures facing each bank. In particular, for any

state j, the interstate bank deregulation provides a state-time indicator of the ability of banks

from other states to enter and compete in state j. The gravity model differentiates among

banks with state j. It predicts that the costs to a bank in state k of establishing a subsidiary in

state j are positively related to the distance between states j and k. Thus, the integration of

interstate bank deregulation and the gravity model predicts that when state j allows banks

from state k to enter, this will intensify competition more among banks in state j that are

closer to state k than among banks in state j that are farther away from k. By integrating the

dynamic process of interstate bank deregulation with the predictions of the gravity model, we

construct time-varying, bank-specific measures of competition.

        More specifically, we measure a bank’s time-varying exposure to interstate deregulation

in two steps. First, for each bank i located in home state j in year t, we identify all of the states

(k’s) whose banks are allowed to enter bank i’s home state j in that year and compute the

inverse of the distance between bank i and state k’s capital city (i. e. , 1/𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ). 1 Second,
for each bank i in each year t, we calculate the summation of the inverse distance to states

whose banks are allowed to enter bank i’s home state j, and then take the natural logarithm of

this summation. This yields a measure of the competitive pressures facing each bank in each

year. To put it formally, we calculate the following:

1
     Specifically, we measure distance from bank i’s county to the county of state k’s capital city. The county
    distance database is provided at: http://www.nber.org/data/ county-distance-database.html. As a robustness
    check, we examine the distance from bank i to the city in state k with the largest number of banks. As shown in
    Appendix Table 4, the results hold.
                                                                                                         10


                                                                                     𝑂𝑗𝑗𝑗
            𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡)𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝐿𝐿 �                                              (2)
                                                                                𝑖 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖


where 𝑂𝑗𝑗𝑗 equals one if banks from state k are allowed to enter state j in period t and zero

otherwise. 2

       Furthermore, besides this basic measure (Bank Competition (Distance Weighted)), we

create and examine two additional time-varying, bank-specific measures of competition. One

measure weights the summation of inverse of distance by the number of banks in state k

(Bank Competition (Distance and # of Banks Weighted)), while the other weights by the

economic size of state k (Bank Competition (Distance and GSP Weighted)). More specifically,

we compute the following:

                                                                                         𝑖 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖


and
                                                                                     𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑘𝑘 ∗ 𝑂𝑗𝑗𝑗
      𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡)𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝐿𝐿 �                                            (4)
                                                                                    𝑖 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖


where 𝐾𝑘𝑘 represents the total number of banks in state k in period t, and 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑘𝑘 represents

gross state product of state k in period t.



2.4 Other control variables
       To control for other factors that might be related to bank competition and liquidity

creation, our regressions include a set of time-varying bank characteristics including the

logarithm of bank size (logSIZE), Capital Asset Ratio measured as the book value of equity

over total assets, and a dummy variable indicating whether a bank belongs to a multibank

holding company (Multibank Holding Company). Table 1 provides summary statistics of the

variables used in our analyses. The definitions of variables are presented in Appendix Table 1.

The median commercial bank in our sample has gross total assets of $104 million (in 2014

dollars), while the average bank has assets of $627 million. Given the skewness in bank size,

                                                               𝑂𝑗𝑗𝑗
2
    We set a value of 0.000001 to those cases where 𝐿𝐿 ∑𝑖
                                                            𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖
                                                                         = 0.
                                                                                             11



we use the natural logarithm of bank size. The average Capital Asset Ratio is 0.09, and about

30% of the commercial banks belong to multi-bank holding companies.



2.5 Econometric Strategy
     To evaluate the impact of bank competition on liquidity creation, we use a

difference-in-differences (DID) methodology. Since the unit of analysis is at the

bank-state-year level, we control for both state-time and bank fixed effects. The state-time

fixed effects capture all time-varying state influences. Bank fixed effects capture all

time-invariant bank characteristics.

     We use the following ordinary least squares (OLS) regression specification:

𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽 ∙ 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾 ′ 𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝑖 + 𝛿𝑗𝑗 + 𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,        (5)

where 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖 is one of the measures of liquidity creation for bank i in state j

in year t, 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖 is one of the measures of the competitive pressures facing

bank i in state j in year t, 𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of time-varying bank-specific characteristics

(logSIZE, Capital Asset Ratio, and Multibank Holding Company), and 𝛿𝑖 and 𝛿𝑗𝑗 are bank

and state-year fixed effects respectively. In seeking to assess the impact of an intensification

of competition on liquidity creation, we focus on estimating β. Since including endogenous
bank-specific characteristics could interfere with drawing sharp inferences about β, we
provide estimates both with and without the 𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖 control variables. We discuss and present a

series of robustness tests below. Throughout the analyses, we report standard errors that are

heteroskedasticity-consistent and two-way clustered at the state and year level. The results are

robust to clustering at either the state or state-year levels.
                                                                                                12



2.6 Validation test
     One concern with our identification strategy is that liquidity creation influences a state’s

decisions on interstate bank deregulation. For example, the lack of bank lending within a state

may induce state officials to liberalize restrictions on interstate banking to boost lending. This

would confound our ability to identify the impact of competition on liquidity creation.

     To assess this concern, we follow Kroszner and Strahan (1999). To their empirical model

of the timing of interstate bank deregulation, we include a measure of liquidity creation and

examine whether lagged values of liquidity creation predict the timing of interstate banking

reforms. Specifically, we calculate an aggregate index of liquidity created by banks within a

state by weighting each bank’s liquidity creation by its assets and test whether this index

predicts when a state first started to liberalize its interstate banking restrictions. We

experimented with different lags and report the results with lags of one to three years in Table

2. The dependent variable is the average across banks in a state-year of one of the three

competition measures (i.e. Bank Competition (Distance Weighted), Bank Competition

(Distance and # of Banks Weighted), and Bank Competition (Distance and GSP Weighted)).

Furthermore, we control for a set of state characteristics used in Kroszner and Strahan’s (1999)

exploration of the determinants of interstate bank deregulation. These controls include gross

state product per capita, state unemployment rate, the small firm share in the state, small bank

share in the state, capital ratio of small banks relative to large ones, relative size of insurance

in states where banks can sell insurance, relative size of insurance in states where banks

cannot sell insurance, an indicator for unit banking law, an indicator for one party control in

the state, and share of state government controlled by Democrats. In this way, we test whether
liquidity creation predicts regulatory induced changes in the competitive pressures facing

banks.

     Table 2 shows that liquidity creation does not predict the timing of regulatory reforms.

Table 2 provides only the results for the main liquidity measure (Liquidity Creation (Category

Based)), while Appendix Table 2 shows that these results hold when examining the other three

liquidity creation measures. Consistent with our identification strategy, there is no indication

that liquidity creation predicts the timing of interstate deregulation.
                                                                                            13




3. EMPIRICAL RESULTS
This section presents results on the impact of a regulatory-induced intensification of

competition on liquidity creation. We first provide the baseline results using measures of

liquidity creation (the Category Based and Category Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet) and

show that all of these results hold when using the maturity-based measures of liquidity

creation. We then decompose and analyze the individual components of these

measures—asset-side on-balance sheet liquidity creation, liability-side on-balance sheet

liquidity creation, and off-balance sheet liquidity creation. We finish this section by

conducting an exploratory examination of the theoretical mechanisms underlying the link

between competition and liquidity creation.



3.1 The effect of bank competition on liquidity creation
     Table 3 presents regression results based on equation (5), where the dependent variable is

one of the category-based measures of liquidity creation and the main explanatory variable is

one of the three time-varying, bank-specific measures of the competitive pressures facing

each bank. In Panel A, we only control for state-year and bank fixed effects. In Panel B, we

also control for bank-level controls (logSIZE, Capital Asset Ratio, and Multibank Holding

Company). In columns (1) –(3) of Panels A and B, the dependent variable is Liquidity

Creation (Category Based) and in columns (4) – (6) of both panels the dependent variable is

Liquidity Creation (Category Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet). Thus, Table 3 reports the

results of twelve regressions.

     The results presented in Table 3 indicate that interstate bank deregulation reduced

liquidity creation by banks. Each of the three measures of regulatory-induced

competition—Bank Competition (Distance Weighted), Bank Competition (Distance Weighted

and # of Banks Weighted), and Bank Competition (Distance Weighted and GSP Weighted)

enters negatively and significantly at the one percent significance level. This holds across

both category-based measures of liquidity creation and when including or excluding the

bank-level controls.
                                                                                              14



     The estimated coefficients indicate that the impact of bank deregulation on liquidity

creation is economically large. For example, consider the estimate from the regression in

which the dependent variable is Liquidity Creation (Category Based), the regulatory-induced

competition measure is Bank Competition (Distance Weighted), and the regression includes

bank-level controls (column 1 of Panel B of Table 3). The coefficient estimate on competition

(-0.0067) suggests that a one-standard-deviation increase (5.22) in Bank Competition

(Distance Weighted) is associated with a reduction in Liquidity Creation (Category Based) of

about 3.5 percentage points. This is a meaningful reduction, as the sample mean is 20 percent.

When applying this estimate to the average (median) bank in our sample, which has gross

total assets of $104 million ($627 million), the 3.5 percentage point reduction in the ratio of

liquidity creation to assets implies a loss of $3.6 million ($21.9 million) in liquidity creation

by the average (median) bank.

     With respect to the bank-level control variables, the results in Panel B of Table 3 indicate

that banks with a higher Capital Asset Ratio tend to create less liquidity. This is in accordance

with the “financial fragility” view that additional bank capital makes the bank’s capital

structure less fragile so that banks are reluctant to commit to monitoring, which in turns

impedes the bank’s ability to create liquidity (Diamond and Rajan 2000, 2001). It is also

consistent with the prediction of the capital “crowd out” theory that a higher capital ratio may

reduce liquidity creation through crowding out deposits, since deposits are liquid and bank

equity is illiquid (Gorton and Winton 2014). We also find that liquidity creation is positively

related to Multibank Holding Company, suggesting that banks belonging to multiple BHCs

create more liquidity. This finding is consistent with the argument that banks within the same

BHC serve as an internal capital market to cross-provide liquidity in times of financial

distress (Berger and Bouwman 2009), including distress triggered by competition.

     We confirm the finding that interstate bank deregulation reduced liquidity creation when

using the maturity-based measures of liquidity creation. As shown in Table 4, we confirm

all of the result in Table 3 using Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based) and Liquidity Creation

(Maturity Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet). The results in Table 4 are remarkably similar

to those reported in Table 3, both statistically and economically.
                                                                                                15



     We next explore the relation between the regulatory reform measures and the three

components of Liquidity Creation (Category Based): asset-side, liability-side, and off-balance

sheet liquidity creation. Table 1 shows that the majority of bank liquidity creation (per unit of

asset) occurs through liability-side items. The means (standard deviations) of asset-side,

liability-side, and off-balance sheet liquidity creation ratio are -0.02 (0.14), 0.18 (0.06), and

0.04 (0.04), respectively. Table 5 reports the results of using the asset-side, liability-side, and

off-balance sheet liquidity creation measures as dependent variables in equation (5). For each

of the three dependent variables, we separately examine the three regulatory-induced

measures of competition. We report the results while including the bank-specific controls, but

the results are robust to excluding them.

     Overall, the findings in Table 5 indicate that the negative effect of regulatory-induced

competition on liquidity creation is largely accounted for by the negative effect of competition

on asset-side liquidity creation. As shown, the interstate deregulation indicators induced a

large drop in asset-side liquidity creation, a small drop in off-balance sheet liquidity creation,

and an increase in liability-side liquidity creation. In terms of magnitudes, a

one-standard-deviation increase (5.22) in Bank Competition (Distance Weighted) (the first

row) induces a reduction in asset-side liquidity creation of 3.7 (=0.0070*5.22) percentage

points, an increase in liability-side liquid creation of 0.9 (=0.0018*5.22) percentage points,

and a decline in off-balance sheet liquidity creation of 0.7 (=0.0014 *5.22) percentage points.

Relative to their sample means, the effect of deregulation on asset-side liquidity creation is

larger than the other components, and the effect on liability-side liquidity creation is nearly

negligible.

     We conclude this subsection by describing several additional robustness tests. First, since

many corporate policies might be determined at the BHC level, we redo the regressions using

data on BHCs, not on individual banks. The information on BHCs is obtained from the

consolidated balance sheets and income statements for holding companies that are provided

by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago since the 3rd quarter of 1986. We define a banking

institution as an ultimate BHC if it owns, but is not owned by, other banking institutions, with

at least 50% ownership of the subsidiaries’ equity stake (Goetz, Laeven, and Levine 2013;
                                                                                             16



Jiang, Levine, and Lin 2016). We are able to identify 834 BHCs headquartered in the U.S.

(excluding South Dakota and Delaware) between 1986 and 2006.

     To construct BHC-level measures of liquidity creation, we aggregate the bank-level

liquidity creation measures to the BHC level by weighting each bank’s liquidity creation by

its proportion of assets within the BHC. Specifically, we take each bank i located in state j

within each BHC c headquartered in state w during period t and aggregate as follows:


              𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐𝑐 = � 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,                      (6)
                                         𝑖∈𝑐

where 𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the proportion of assets of each bank i within BHC c in period t relative to the

total assets of BHC c, and state w and state j may or may not be the same.

     We also compute the regulatory-induced competition measures at the BHC-level. We do

this by aggregating the bank-level competition measures to the BHC level. Specifically, we

first identify each bank i in state j that belongs to BHC c headquartered in state w in period t

and we then calculate BHC c’s distance weighted regulatory-induced competition measure as

follows:



                 𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡)𝑐𝑐𝑐                                     (7)
                = � 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡)𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,
                      𝑖∈𝑐




We use the same method described in equation (7) to construct the other two BHC-specific

competition measures: BHC Competition (Distance and # of Banks Weighted) and BHC

Competition (Distance and GSP Weighted). Appendix Table 3 presents the BHC-level analysis

for both the category-based and maturity-based measures of liquidity creations. Consistent

with the bank-level results, BHC-level competition enters negatively and significantly across

all specifications.

     The second sensitivity check examines an alternative measure of bank-specific

competition. Our previous measure of bank competition is based on the distance from a bank

to the county of a non-home state’s capital city. As a robustness check, use the distance from
                                                                                                                     17



the bank to the county of the city with the greatest number of banks in the non-home state.

Appendix Table 4 shows that all of the results hold.

      Third, there might be concerns that the results are driven only by banks expanding

through mergers and acquisitions or by being purchased by other banks. Thus, we redid the

analyses while restricting the sample to only banks that are not part of any mergers or

acquisitions. They are still subject to changes in competitive pressures, as their markets

become more contestable due to bank deregulation. We find that all of the results hold, and

hold with similar parameters estimates, when restricting the sample to these banks.



3.2 An exploration of two possible mechanisms
      So far we have found that bank competition—as measured by interstate bank

deregulation—reduces liquidity creation, but we have not explored the channels through

which competition shapes liquidity creation. Although the primary objective of this research is

simply to evaluate whether, on net, an intensification of competition among banks increases,

decreases, or has no effect on liquidity creation, we now provide an exploratory examination

of two potential channels: profitability and relationship lending.

      One view is that by squeezing profit margins, competition reduces the willingness of

banks to absorb more risk through liquidity creation and hence reduces liquidity creation. If

competition affects liquidity creation through this channel, then the negative impact of

competition on liquidity creation should be smaller among more profitable banks that can

better absorb liquidity risk. Thus, we test this prediction.

      To assess the profitability channel, we expand our baseline regression specification and

include the interaction between High Profit and the regulatory-induced competition measures.

To construct High Profit, we begin by calculating Profitability, which equals the net interest

margin, i.e., the ratio of net interest income to total assets. We then set High Profit equal to

one if in the initial sample period (1984-1986) Profitability is greater than the sample

median. 3 The profitability view predicts a positive relation between liquidity creation and the

3
  All of the results hold if we instead set High Profit equal to one if a bank’s profitability is greater than the
sample median over the entire sample period and zero otherwise.
                                                                                               18



interaction between competition and profitability.

     As shown in Table 6, the estimates are consistent with the profitability view, as the

estimated coefficients on the interaction between competition and profitability enter positively

and significantly in all specifications. We continue to find that the bank competition measures

enter negatively and significantly. If one interprets High Profit as positively associated with

the risk absorption capacity of banks, then our findings imply that competition reduces

liquidity creation less when banks have a greater capacity to absorb risk.

     A second view is that competition reduces liquidity creation by impeding relationship

lending. This implies that the negative impact of competition on liquidity creation should be

stronger among banks that rely more heavily on relationship lending. Based on Petersen and

Rajan (1994), we use bank size to proxy for the bank’s reliance on relationship lending given

the absence of data tracking banks’ lending records with customers. Petersen and Rajan (1994)

document that relationship lending is more valuable to small firms. Thus, to proxy for

relationship lenders, we use Small Size, which equals one if a bank’s gross total assets are

smaller than the sample median during the entire sample period, and zero otherwise. We

include this proxy along with its interaction with the regulatory-induced competition measures.

If this interaction term enters with a negative coefficient, it would suggest that in response to

an intensification of competition, liquidity creation falls more among relationship lenders.

     The estimates reported in Table 7 are consistent with the relationship lending effect. First,

consistent with the earlier results, the regulatory-induced measures of competition enter

negatively and significantly, confirming that interstate bank deregulation reduces liquidity

creation. Second, the interaction term of interstate bank deregulation and Small Size enters

negatively and significantly (except for columns 4-6). This implies that regulatory-induced

competition exerts a more pronounced negative effect on liquidity creation in small banks that

are major relationship lenders.
                                                                                            19



4. CONCLUSION
     Although it is widely recognized that liquidity creation is one of the major services

provided by bank to the economy, there are only a few studies of the factors shaping bank

liquidity creation and no previous studies of the impact of competition on liquidity creation.

In this paper, we evaluate the impact of an intensification of competition among banks on

liquidity creation. To do this, we employ a novel approach to measuring the time-varying

competitive pressures facing each commercial bank in the United States over the period from

1984 through 2006.

     The results are consistent with the view that an intensification of competition reduces

liquidity creation. This finding of a “liquidity-destroying” effect of competition is robust to

using different measures of liquidity creation, different measures of bank competition, the

inclusion or exclusion of time-varying bank characteristics, and controlling for state-year and

bank fixed effects. While research has identified many positive effects from competition, this

paper suggests some trade-offs with respect to liquidity creation.

           Table 2. Validity Test - Banking Deregulations and Lagged Liquidity Creations
This table presents OLS regressions of bank regulatory reforms on lagged values of category based liquidity
creation and other potential predictors of regulatory reforms. The sample consists of state-year observations
from 1984 to 2006 and excludes states that deregulated in or before 1984. Definitions for the dependent
variable bank competition measures are presented in Appendix Table 1. The variable State Weighted Liquidity
Creation (Category Based) is calculated by the bank level liquidity creation measure Liquidity Creation
(Category Based) aggregated to the state level and weighted by the proportion of the commercial bank’s total
assets held by its subsidiaries and branches in that state. Detained definition and classification of liquidity
creation measures can be found in Appendix Table 1. Following Kroszner and Strahan (1999), the following
control variables are included: GSP per capita, state level unemployment rate, small bank share of all banking
assets, and capital ratio of small banks relative to large ones, relative size of insurance in states where banks
may sell insurance (zero otherwise), relative size of insurance in states where banks may not sell insurance
(zero otherwise), an indicator variable that equal to one if banks may sell insurance (zero otherwise), small
firm (fewer than 20 employees) share of the number of firms in the state, unit banking law, share of state
government controlled by Democrats, and an indicator that takes a value of one if the state is controlled by one
party. We also include state dummy variables. Standard errors are adjusted for state-level clustering and appear
in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significant at 1%, 5%, and 10%.

This table presents results of the effects of banking deregulations on category based liquidity creation of
commercial banks. The sample consists of bank-year observations from 1984 through 2006. The dependent
variables in columns 1-3 and 4-6 are Liquidity Creation (Category Based) and Liquidity Creation (Category
Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet), respectively. Detailed definition and classification for the liquidity creation
measures can be found in Appendix Table 1. The control variable logSIZE is defined as the natural logarithm of
gross total assets in thousand real 2014 U.S. dollars. Capital Asset Ratio is the ratio of book value of equity over
total assets. Both logSIZE and Capital Asset Ratio are lagged one year prior to the observation of the
dependent variable. Multibank Holding Company is an indicator variable that equals one if a bank has been part
of a multibank holding company in the past three years, and zero if otherwise. Standard errors are
heteroskedasticity-consistent, two-way clustered at the state and year level, and reported in parentheses. *, **, and
*** indicate significant at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

                             Panel A. Without Any Bank Level Controls
This table presents results of the effects of banking deregulations on maturity-based liquidity creation of
commercial banks, without including any bank level control variables in the regressions. The sample consists
of bank-year observations from 1984 through 2006. The dependent variables in columns 1-3 and 4-6 are
Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based) and Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet),
respectively. Detailed definition and classification for the liquidity creation measures can be found in
Appendix Table 1. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity-consistent, two-way clustered at the state and year
level, and reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significant at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

  This table presents results of the effects of banking deregulations on maturity based liquidity creation of
  commercial banks. The sample consists of bank-quarter observations from 1984 through 2006. The dependent
  variables in columns 1-3 and 4-6 are Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based) and Liquidity Creation (Maturity
  Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet), respectively. Detailed definition and classification for the liquidity
  creation measures can be found in Appendix Table 1. The control variable logSIZE is defined as the natural
  logarithm of gross total assets in thousand real 2014 U.S. dollars. Capital Asset Ratio is the ratio of book value
  of equity over total assets. Both logSIZE and Capital Asset Ratio are lagged one year prior to the
  observation of the dependent variable. Multibank Holding Company is an indicator variable that equals one
  if a bank has been part of a multibank holding company in the past three years, and zero if otherwise. Standard
  errors are heteroskedasticity-consistent, two-way clustered at the state and year level, and reported in
  parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significant at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

  This table presents results of the effects of banking deregulations on asset-side, liability-side, and off-balance sheet category based liquidity creation of commercial banks.
  The sample consists of bank-year observations from 1984 through 2006. The dependent variables in columns 1-3, 4-6, and 7-9 are Asset-side Liquidity Creation,
  Liability-side Liquidity Creation, and Off-balance Sheet Liquidity Creation, respectively, where Asset-side Liquidity Creation + Liability-side Liquidity Creation +
  Off-balance Sheet Liquidity Creation= Liquidity Creation (Category Based). Detailed definition and classification for the liquidity creation measures can be found in
  Appendix Table 1. The control variable logSIZE is defined as the natural logarithm of gross total assets in thousand real 2014 U.S. dollars. Capital Asset Ratio is the ratio
  of book value of equity over total assets. Both logSIZE and Capital Asset Ratio are lagged one year prior to the observation of the dependent variable. Multibank
  Holding Company is an indicator variable that equals one if a bank has been part of a multibank holding company in the past three years, and zero if otherwise. Standard

This table presents results of profitability effects of banking deregulations on liquidity creation. The sample consists of bank-year observations from 1984 through 2006. The
dependent variables in columns 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12 are Liquidity Creation (Category Based), Liquidity Creation (Category Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet), Liquidity
Creation (Maturity Based), and Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet), respectively. Profitability is defined as net interest income over total assets, and
lagged one year prior to the observation of the dependent variable. High Profit is defined as a dummy that equal to one if in the initial period (1984-1986) a bank’s
median profitability is greater than the sample median profitability and zero otherwise. Other firm controls include logSIZE, Capital Asset Ratio, and Multibank
Holding Company. Detailed definition for all the variables are presented in Appendix Table 1. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity-consistent, two-way clustered at the state and
year level, and reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significant at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

This table presents results of banking size effects associated with banking deregulations on liquidity creation. The sample consists of bank-year observations from 1984 through
2006. The dependent variables in columns 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12 are Liquidity Creation (Category Based), Liquidity Creation (Category Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet),
Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based), and Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet), respectively. Small Size is an indicator that equal to one if a bank’s
gross total assets are smaller than the sample median over the entire period and zero otherwise. Other firm controls include Capital Asset Ratio and Multibank Holding
Company. Detailed definition for all the variables are presented in Appendix Table 1. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity-consistent, two-way clustered at the state and year
level, and reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significant at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

                            total assets equals total assets plus the allowance for loan and lease losses and
                            the allocated transfer risk reserve (a reserve for certain foreign loans). Amounts
                            are adjusted in real 2014 dollars using the implicit GDP price deflator.
Capital Asset Ratio         Ratio of book value of equity over total assets in year t-1.
Multibank Holding Company   Dummy =1 if a bank has been part of a multibank holding company in the any
                            of the past three years, =0 if otherwise.
Profitability               Ratio of net interest income over total assets in year t-1.
High Profit                 An indicator that equal to one if in the initial period (1984-1986) a
                            bank’s median profitability is greater than the sample median
                            profitability and zero otherwise.
Small Size                  An indicator that equals one if a bank’s gross total assets are smaller than the
                            sample median value over the entire sample period and zero otherwise.

    Appendix Table 2. Validity Test - Banking Deregulations and Lagged Liquidity Creations:
                           Using Other Liquidity Creation Measures
This table presents OLS regressions of bank regulatory reforms on lagged values of category based (excluding
off-balance sheet) or maturity based liquidity creations and other potential predictors of regulatory reforms. The
sample consists of state-year observations from 1984 to 2006 and excludes states that deregulated in or before
1984. Definitions for the dependent variable bank competition measures are presented in Appendix Table 1. The
key explanatory variables in Panel A, B, and C, are State Weighted Liquidity Creation (Category Based,
excluding Off-balance Sheet), State Weighted Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based), and State Weighted Liquidity
Creation (Maturity Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet), respectively. The State Weighted Liquidity Creation
variables are calculated by the corresponding bank level liquidity creation measures aggregated to the state level
and weighted by the proportion of the commercial bank’s total assets held by its subsidiaries and branches in
that state. Detained definition and classification of liquidity creation measures can be found in Appendix Table 1.
Following Kroszner and Strahan (1999), the following control variables are included: GSP per capita, state level
unemployment rate, small bank share of all banking assets, and capital ratio of small banks relative to large ones,
relative size of insurance in states where banks may sell insurance (zero otherwise), relative size of insurance in
states where banks may not sell insurance (zero otherwise), an indicator variable that equal to one if banks may
sell insurance (zero otherwise), small firm (fewer than 20 employees) share of the number of firms in the state,
unit banking law, share of state government controlled by Democrats, and an indicator that takes a value of one
if the state is controlled by one party. We also include state dummy variables. Standard errors are adjusted for
state-level clustering and appear in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significant at 1%, 5%, and 10%.

                 Panel A. Dependent Variables: Category Based Liquidity Creations
 This table presents results of the effects of banking deregulations on category based liquidity creation of bank
 holding companies (BHCs). The sample consists of BHC-year observations from the 3rd quarter of 1986 through
 2006. The sample consists of bank-year observations from 1986 through 2006. The dependent variables in
 columns 1-3 and 4-6 are Liquidity Creation (Category Based) and Liquidity Creation (Category Based, excluding
 Off-balance Sheet), respectively. These measures are calculated based on asset-weighted liquidity creation of
 commercial banks that belong to the BHC. Detailed definition and classification for the liquidity creation
 measures can be found in Appendix Table 1. BHC Competition (Distance Weighted), BHC Competition (Distance
 and # of Banks Weighted), and BHC Competition (Distance and GSP Weighted) are asset-weighted regulatory
 environment (Bank Competition (Distance Weighted), Bank Competition (Distance and # of Banks Weighted),
 Bank Competition (Distance and GSP Weighted)) facing each subsidiary (including the subsidiaries in the state of
 the BHC’s headquarters) across all subsidiaries owned by the BHC. Other bank controls include logSIZE,
 Capital Asset Ratio, and Multibank Holding Company, where Multibank Holding Company is a dummy variable
 that equals one if a BHC is a multibank holding company, and zero otherwise. Definitions for all the other
 variables can be found in Appendix Table 1. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity-consistent, two-way clustered
 at the state and year level, and reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significant at 10%, 5%, and 1%,
