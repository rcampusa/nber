                                             ABSTRACT

Productivity has rebounded in the last decade while manufacturing employment has declined sharply.

The present study uses data on industrial output and employment to examine the sources of these

trends. It finds that the productivity rebound since 1995 has been widespread, with approximately

two-fifths of the productivity rebound occurring in New Economy industries. Moreover, after

suffering a slowdown in the 1970s, productivity growth since 1995 has been at the rapid pace of the

earlier 1948-73 period. Finally, the study investigates the relationship between employment and

productivity growth. If finds that the relevant elasticities indicate that more rapid productivity growth

leads to increased rather than decreased employment in manufacturing. The results here suggest that

productivity is not to be feared   at least not in manufacturing, where the largest recent employment

declines have occurred. This shows up most sharply for the most recent period, since 1998. Overall,

higher productivity has led to lower prices, expanding demand, and to higher employment, but the

partial effects of rapid domestic productivity growth have been more than offset by more rapid

productivity growth and price declines from foreign competitors.

    After two decades of dismal performance in the 1970s and 1980s,
productivity growth rebounded in the late 1990s. It continued to perform at
extraordinarily high rates in the early 2000s through a stock market bust, a
recession, an investment decline, rising fiscal deficits, skyrocketing oil prices,
and interminable small wars.


    The sources of the productivity rebound have been widely studied, and
most analysts attribute the turnaround to the New Economy – computers,
semiconductors, software, and telecommunications. What has been the most
recent experience? Has that fantastic sector continued to be the source of rapid
growth in the last four years? What has been the impact of rising productivity
growth on employment? Those are the issue addressed by the present paper.


I. Background and Data


    I first lay out the analytical measures employed in this study along with
the data used to decompose productivity growth by sector.


    A. Analytical Measures of Productivity Growth


    I begin with a summary of alternative approaches to measuring
productivity growth. The customary approach to measuring productivity
growth is (a) the difference of growth rates approach. This defines productivity
growth as the difference between the growth rate of output and the growth
rate of inputs. In an earlier paper, I showed that this is not an appropriate
welfare-theoretic measure of productivity growth.1 I proposed two alternative

Economic Activity, 2001: 2, pp. 211-265.

                                                                                       2
measures: (b) a welfare-theoretic measure, which is defined as the current-
weighted average of productivity growth where the weights are the shares of
nominal output and (c) a fixed-weight measure, which has the same basic
construction as the welfare-theoretic measure except that it uses nominal
output weights of a given period.


       We can summarize these points in terms of a decomposition equation for
the growth in productivity:


                       n            n                               n
(1)     a t = ∑ ai , t σ i , 0 +   ∑ ai ,t (σ i ,t − σ i , 0 ) +   ∑s           (σ i ,t − µi ,t )
           T
                                                                          i,t
                      i =1         i =1                            i =1




where at is the aggregate or total growth of output per unit input, ai , t is the
        T



growth of output per unit input in industry i, σ i,t is the share of industry

output in total nominal output in period t, µi,t is the share of inputs used in

industry i of total inputs, and year t = 0 is a base year for calculations. The
term (σ i ,t − σ i ,0 ) is the difference between the current share and the base-period

share of nominal output of industry i, while (σ i ,t − µi ,t ) is the difference

between the share of nominal output and of inputs in industry i. The first term
on the right-hand-side of equation (1) is the fixed-weight measure of
                                            n
productivity growth, at F = ∑ ai , t σ i , 0 ; while the sum of the first two terms of
                                           i =1


equation (1) is the welfare-theoretic measure of productivity, which is defined
                n
as at W = ∑ ai , t σ i , t .
               i =1




                                                                                                    3
     B. Industrial Output Data


     The present study relies on data on the aggregate and by detailed and
broad industry group. The variables are primarily real and nominal value
added, and labor inputs measured as hours worked and persons engaged. The
published data available to decompose productivity by industry has major
comparability problems. There are four different data sets for industrial output
available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis:


    A. Industrial output (real value added, nominal value added, and prices) by 1972
       SIC industrial classification using fixed-price weights, available for the 1948-87
       period.
    B. Industrial output by 1972 SIC code for the period 1977-1987 using chain-
       weighted indexes.
    C. Industrial output by 1987 SIC code for the period 1987-2001 using chain-
       weighted indexes.
    D. An entirely different data set using chain-weighted indexes available starting
       in 1998 using the NAICS industrial classification. These data include indexes
       of real value added, prices, along with hours and persons engaged in
       employment.


     Together with Alexandra Miltner, the present author developed an
integrated data set for all industries for 1948-2001 that integrates the first three
data sets. This data set was used to analyze the productivity slowdown in a
companion paper.2


     Unfortunately, there is virtually no overlap among sectors in the old and

Slowdown,” NBER Working Paper No. W10950, December 2004.


                                                                                            4
new classification systems. Moreover, while BEA has shifted from the earlier
SIC industrial classification to the NAICS system, the industrial data using the
earlier industrial classification have been discontinued, the NAICS data go
back only to 1998, and it is virtually impossible for private scholars to map the
SIC into the NAICS system.


     In order to examine the sources of the labor-productivity rebound, the
present study uses the methods described in the last section on the Nordhaus-
Miltner data set as well as the new NAICS data set. Even though the data sets
use different industrial classifications, under ideal conditions they will
aggregate up to the same aggregate estimate of total productivity growth.3


     A brief word on the use of labor productivity rather than total factor
productivity. The introduction of capital inputs raises several issues,
particularly for short periods of time. My earlier productivity paper reviewed
many of the issues, and these are summarized in the accompanying footnote.4


3The “ideal conditions” require that price and output indexes are consistent and that there be
no Fisher aggregation bias. In this study, we rely instead on Törnqvist aggregation, which has
no aggregation bias.

4Among the problems which arise, particularly for the 1998-2003 period, are the following: (1)
Multifactor productivity depends upon estimating rather than measuring the inputs of capital
services. Estimates of capital services depend upon several critical and questionable
assumptions (including such things as the existence of perfect rental markets for capital, no
difference between ex ante and ex post substitutability, no break-in, adjustment, or learning
costs, perfect competition, and factor rewards proportional to marginal products). These
assumptions are likely to be stretched particularly then in periods, such as the 1998-2003 period,
when new technologies with very high rates of depreciation dominate the data on the growth of
capital services. (2) Measures of capital services generally use a cost of capital formula based on
interest rates and therefore do not reflect the extraordinary equity valuations in the late 1990s;
the effect of this is to overestimate the user cost and implicit marginal cost of capital,
particularly in high-tech industries. (3) Multifactor production functions generally include only
the return to fixed capital as a non-labor market inputs and exclude the return to other assets
such as land, inventories, intangible assets such as patents and trademarks, brand value and
marketing, and subsoil assets such as oil and gas reserves. (4) Inclusion of capital inputs gives
productivity a pro-cyclical character. For a further discussion, see William D. Nordhaus,

                                                                                                 5
II. Extent and Sources of the Productivity Rebound


     A. General Trends


     It will be useful to begin with a description of the general trends. Figure 1
shows data on productivity growth for the total economy for the period 1948-
2004. For this calculation, I have used BEA’s estimate of hours worked by full-
time and part-time employees as the input. There are three different output
concepts, two built up from the industry accounts and one using aggregate
real GDP from the NIPA accounts. I have taken the three-year moving average
of the logarithmic growth rate of output per hour to smooth the data. Table 1
shows the same data grouped by different periods.


     Figure 2 shows the same results using a more restricted output concept,
“Business output,” which is a BEA-BLS concept used for BLS productivity
measures. Business excludes government, non-farm housing, as well as not-for
profit sectors. It is not possible to map the expenditure BEA-BLS concept of
business output directly into industry measures, but I have made as close an
approximation as is possible with existing data sources. Table 2 shows the
same data grouped by periods.


     Finally, it will be useful to provide estimates of the extent of the rebound
of productivity since the mid-1990s. Figure 3 shows both NIPA and industry
data for the two concepts grouped into four subperiods.5 For both the total

pp. 211-265.

5For Figure 3, I have created a merged business productivity series that splices the SIC and
NAICS data.

                                                                                               6
economy and the business sector, productivity growth has returned to their
trends during the 1948-73 period.


    Three points about these results can be seen from the tables and figures.
First, the different sources are very consistent for GDP, but somewhat less
consistent for business output. The difficulties in estimating business
productivity are likely to reside in attempting to match the BEA-BLS
(expenditure) concept of business output with income-side data from the
industry accounts. Business output under the NAICS concept is substantially
lower that for the BLS concept: 2.82 percent per year in the former as compared
to 3.37 percent per year for the latter during the 1998-2003 period. It should be
emphasized, however, that the productivity data are not necessarily
inaccurate, because the output and hours data are matched by industry.


     Second, business output productivity is between one-quarter and one-
half percentage points higher than GDP productivity depending upon the time
period and concept.


    Third, as can be best seen in the graphs, for both total GDP and for
business output, productivity growth since 1995 has rebounded very sharply.
For the last two years, productivity has returned to the peak years in the 1948-
73 period. Moreover, while the detailed industry classification system changed
greatly from the SIC to the NAICS system, the two systems appear to
aggregate to similar numbers for total GDP.




                                                                                    7
     B. Rebound by Industry


               1. Results for broad industry groups, 1998-2003


     We next examine the sources of the rebound by industry. For broad
industry groups (non-durable manufacturing, construction, information, etc.),
BEA publishes both hours worked as well as real and nominal value added
and prices by industry. In addition, we have separated out Computers and
electronic products from Durable manufacturing because of the importance of
computers in the overall productivity numbers.6 Using these data, we can use
equation (1) above to determine the sources of the productivity rebound over
this period.


     Table 3 shows productivity growth by major industry group, while Table
4 shows the contribution of each major industry to the overall productivity
growth. For this period, Computers and electronic products continued to show
very rapid productivity growth, averaging a torrid 26 percent per year.
Information industries and Retail trade also showed very rapid growth.


     In estimating the contribution of each of the industries to the total shown

in Table 4, we use the fixed-weight productivity growth ( at ), using average
                                                            F



shares for the period 1998-2003. Over this period, weighted productivity
growth for the entire economy was 2.49 percent per year, which was, not


6Computers were separated out by constructing a Törnqvist index of output growth of durable
manufacturing output and computer output growth for 1998-2003. It was assumed that hours
worked per person engaged in the computer subsector is equal to that for all of durable
manufacturing. While the Törnqvist index gives slightly different results from Fisher
aggregation, the difference is extremely small.

                                                                                          8
surprisingly, entirely driven by private industries. However, the source of the
rapid growth is a surprise. The largest source was Finance, insurance, real
estate, and related industries, contributing 0.72 percentage points or 29 percent
of the total weighted productivity growth. Computers and electronic products
contributed 0.43 percentage points, or 17 percent of the total. Other important
major industries were Retail trade, Information, and Professional services.
Other services, Government, and Construction continued to show essentially
no productivity growth and contributed nothing, at least as measured in the
national accounts.


1.   Results for detailed industries, 1998-2003


     We next drill a little deeper to determine which detailed industry showed
the major contribution to the productivity rebound. The data for detailed
industries cover only persons engaged rather than hours worked. Productivity
per person rises more slowly than productivity per hour, but the major trends
are likely to be accurately captured in these estimates.7
     Table A-1 in the appendix shows the growth in productivity per person
engaged for all industries, while Table 5 shows the results for the top 15
industries. There is no major surprise in the rapid growth in Computers.
However, the performance of Securities, commodity, and investments;
Information and data processing services; and Apparel and leather and allied
products may be more of a surprise. We return below to further tests of these
data.

7An additional complication is that hours worked exclude the hours of self-employed workers. Table A-3
in the Appendix shows a calculation of the potential bias from excluding self-employed hours, using BEA
data. The bias in the overall productivity numbers are in the order of plus or minus 0.05 percentage point
per year. Agricultural productivity is likely to have a downward bias of abound 1 percentage point per
year. There may also be a small upward bias in the estimated hours worked in Information, Professional
services, and Other services, but the bias is unlikely to be larger than 0.2 percentage points per year in
any non-agricultural sector.

                                                                                                        9
     The next question is how much each industry contributed to the overall
productivity growth in the 1998-2003 period. Table A-2 in the appendix shows
the contribution of individual industries to the aggregate fixed-weighted
productivity growth in productivity per person engaged, while Table 6 shows
the results for the top 15 industries. Of the 208 basis point per year average
productivity growth, 40 basis points came from Computers and electronic
products and 46 basis points came from Retail and Wholesale Trade.


     3. The New Economy


     We next examine the extent to which the New Economy sectors were
responsible for the rapid productivity growth in the 1998-2003 period using
the output per person measure. The measure of contribution here includes
only the direct measure from production of new-economy goods; it excludes
any contribution of new-economy capital services in using industries. Table 7
shows the major new economy sectors (which is an overly generous bundle
but is at the most disaggregated level available).8 These sectors enjoyed a rapid
rate of productivity growth: 10.1 percent per year over the 1998-2003 period.
All six new economy sectors were responsible for 76 basis points of the 208
basis point growth rate in employment productivity, or 36 percent of the total.
This estimate compares with an estimate in my earlier study, using the same
methodology but different industrial definitions, in which the New Economy
contributed 64 basis points of the 224 basis point growth in hourly
productivity, representing 29 percent of productivity growth in the 1995-2000



8Inclusion of extraneous industries will inflate the nominal share in GDP of New Economy
industries but will inflate their contribution to total productivity only slightly.


                                                                                           10
period.9 The difference is not large but probably lies mainly in the aggregate
productivity rather than the impact of the New Economy industries because
overall employment productivity grew at 40 basis points more slowly over the
1998-2003 period than hours productivity.


       4. Test of the Coherence of the Data


       The industrial productivity data are a black box to outside researchers,
and it is not easy to validate them with alternative data. One way of testing
their plausibility is to examine the productivity identity to see whether the
productivity growth is associated with price changes, employment changes,
compensation, or share changes. Begin with the definition of labor’s share of
value added:


    Zi,t = Wi,t E i,t / X i,t P i,t

where Z is the share of labor in value added, W is real compensation per
person engaged, E is persons engaged, X is real output, and P is the value-
added price index relative to the GDP price index. Taking logarithmic changes
over the 1998-2003 period and designating the lower case letters as the annual
average logarithmic change yields productivity growth per person (ai,t) as:


(2) ai,t = x i,t - e i,t = wi,t - pi,t - zi,t


       We would normally expect that the shares of labor would be relatively
stable and that wage-rate growth would not differ greatly by industry, in
which case the productivity growth would be reflected in a price decline. A

Economic Activity, 2001: 2, pp. 211-265.

                                                                                       11
cross-sectional regression of price change on productivity change indicates
that the coefficient is -1.002 with a standard error of the coefficient of 0.086.
Table 8 shows the decomposition for the industries with the five highest and
five lowest productivity growth over the 1998-2003 period. Computers and
Securities show price changes that are parallel to the productivity increase.
Given that the price decline in computers is well established, we can take these
results as plausible.


    The next industry on the list is “Securities, commodity contracts, related.”
The price decline here is extremely rapid: the relative price index for value
added in this industry (NAICS 523) declined 15 percent per year over the 1998-
2003 period. Discussions with BEA staff indicate that output for this industry
through 2000 was based on a quantity index measuring public orders for
equities traded on registered exchanges and over-the-counter markets; after
2000, the quantity index was created by deflating nominal output with a new
producer price index for financial services.


    Are the underlying price indexes for Securities plausible? Have they been
extrapolated appropriately to the entire industry? Some skepticism seems
warranted. BEA has only recently attempted to measure real output in the
financial-service industries. The price and quantity indexes just discussed do
not seem representative of the entire industry, and the rapid measured
productivity growth may be largely an artifact of rapidly falling commission
rates during this period. However, the calculations are largely a mystery to
this outsider. Hence, a question mark remains over this result; given that the
Securities industry contributed 26 basis points to the overall productivity
growth during the rebound period, validation of this number would seem to
be a high priority.


                                                                                    12
    The rest of the top and bottom industries in Table 8 are puzzling because
prices do not generally move with productivity. Many are poorly measured,
particularly in the bottom five. For example, Oil and Petroleum industry value
added real output has proved to be highly unreliable in the industry data.
Overall, the data are reasonably coherent in most well-measured industries.


III. Is Productivity Growth Good for Employment?


    One of the major debates in recent years has been the role of productivity
in employment. Some have argued that the rapid growth of productivity,
particularly in manufacturing, has hurt workers in those industries by leading
producers to shed jobs. Critics of this point of view generally argue that, while
this might be true for a particular firm or industry, or might hold in the short
run, in the longer run the level of jobs and unemployment will be determined
by macroeconomic policies rather than by productivity growth.


    While technological change is unlikely to have a major impact on
aggregate unemployment or employment in the long run, this point most
definitely does not apply to individual industries. The employment of workers
in the typewriter industry was most definitely affected by technological trends
there and in computers. At the microeconomic level, the impact of
productivity growth on employment is ambiguous and depends upon the bias
of technological change, on prices of competing goods and services, and on the
price-elasticity of demand.


    To explore this relationship, I sketch a simplified model. Assume demand
is given by:


                                                                                    13
                                                         µi
(3)           X i,t = Bi (Pi,t /Pi,t )- λ i Yt
                                           C




where Xi,t is output, Pi,t is own price, Pi,t C is the price of competing goods, Yt is

real income, and -λ i and µ i are price and income elasticities. Further, assume
that production is given by


                                  α              1−α i
(4)          X i,t = Ai,t K i,t       i
                                          Li,t



where Ai,t is total factor productivity, Ki,t is capital inputs, Li,t is labor inputs,

and α i is the Cobb-Douglas elasticity. For this discussion, we further assume

either that production is Cobb-Douglas or that technological change is Hicks-
neutral.


      The basic argument is straightforward. The average and marginal costs of
production are Ai,t −1 Ri,t −α Wi,t − (1−α ) where Wi,t is the wage rate, Ri,t is the cost of

capital, and we have normalized for any inessential constants. If each firm
behaves competitively, profit-maximizing price is Pi,t = Ai,t −1 Ri,t −α Wi,t − (1−α ) . This
                                                                                      i          i




implies that price declines proportionally with productivity. Let ∆ai,t be the

logarithmic increase in Ai,t ; then, with other variables unchanged, the increase

in output is λi ∆ai,t , and inputs increase by ( λi − 1)∆ai,t . With Hicks-neutral

technological change, both employment and capital inputs increase
by ( λi − 1)∆ai,t .10


10 The story would be different if technological change is not neutral and production is not Cobb-
Douglas, but in either of these cases employment (or more generally labor inputs) will be positively
related to technological change if the demand for output is price-elastic (λ > 1). If the market structure is
non-competitive or if there are non-constant-returns to scale, then foreign prices and output effects will
enter as well.

                                                                                                            14
     Note that the trend levels of production and employment will depend not
only on domestic productivity but also on competing prices, incomes, and
elasticities. Since ∆pi,t = − ∆ai,t , the growth in production and employment will

be given by:


   (5)         ∆x i,t = bi + λi ∆ai,t + λi ∆pi,t + µ i ∆y t
                                               C




   (6)         ∆ei,t = bi + ( λi − 1) ∆ai,t + λi ∆pi,t + µ i ∆y t
                                                     C




where again the lower case letters in (5) and (6) are logarithms of the upper
case letters in (3) and (4), and ∆ represents time differences.


     The partial relationship of changes in employment with changes in
productivity is seen to be ∂∆ei,t / ∂∆ai,t = λi − 1 , as described above. However, the

trend or total effect would need to include income effects and the prices of
competing goods. In industries like agriculture, with rapid technological
change and inelastic price and income effects, both employment and the
industry share of nominal output are likely to decline over time. In
manufacturing, with price-elastic demand, the positive effect of technological
change may be offset for employment if the prices of competing goods are
falling rapidly. The paradoxical case, with rapid productivity growth and
falling employment, appears to hold for the United States, while the opposite
case, with manufacturing employment growing because domestic costs and
prices are falling rapidly, would hold most notably for China.


     There are many potential empirical approaches to determining the
historical effect of productivity growth on employment, but for this purpose,


                                                                                         15
we will use the BEA industry data discussed above. The estimated relationship
between employment growth ( ∆ei,t ) and productivity growth

( ∆ai,t = ∆xi,t − ∆ei,t ) is:


(7)           ∆ei,t = β i + γ ι ∆ai,t + ε i,t



where β i and γ ι are parameters, and ε i,t is a residual. The residual includes

not only random effects and measurement errors but also the impact of
omitted variables, such as income effects and the prices of competing goods
(such as imports or competing exports). An important assumption is that
movements in these omitted variables are independent of short-run
movements in productivity. The main concern about this specification is that
errors in measuring output will lead to biased estimates of γ ι ; indeed, they are

likely to lead to a downward bias in the estimates of γ ι .


      Table 9 shows estimates for eight different specifications. These differ first
by time period (one being 1955-2001 for the earlier BEA data set and the other
being 1998-2003 for the new BEA data set); a second alternative is with current
or current and lagged productivity growth; and a third is with least squares or
two-stage least squares, with instruments being the current and lagged rate of
change of prices as an instrument for productivity growth (because prices and
productivity are independently measured for most manufacturing industries).
In each case, the industries are the 21 or 19 manufacturing industries in the old
and new data set, respectively.


      The results for manufacturing are relatively sharp in both data sets. In the
old data set, the impact of productivity growth on employment is uniformly


                                                                                       16
positive, and significantly so in two of the four estimates. The coefficients
(partial elasticities) are between 0.05 and 0.10, indicating that a 10 percent
increase in productivity growth above trend would lead to a ½ to 1 percent
increase in employment.


    For the new and shorter data set, all current coefficients are significant,
and three are significant at the 1 percent level. In addition, there is a
suggestion of a significant lagged effect. In the new data set, the TSLS
estimates provide higher coefficients, indicating that there may be a
downward bias in the OLS results due to measurement error in output.
Overall, the estimates in the more recent data indicate that the elasticity of
employment with respect to productivity is at least ¼ and might be as high as
½. Finally, the coefficients are much larger in the new data set, which suggests
that demand is more elastic in the later period because the U.S. economy is
more open to international trade.


    The empirical results presented here sharply reject the view that higher
growth in manufacturing productivity leads to a decline in employment. How
are these findings consistent with the rapid growth in manufacturing
productivity and the decline in manufacturing employment? The answer lies
in the determinants of trend output and employment shown in equations (5)
and (6). It is likely that productivity and costs in other countries, such as
China, have been declining even more rapidly than in the United States. This is
obvious in some industries, such as consumer electronics or apparel, where
China simply did not compete two decades ago and Chinese prices were from
an economic point of view essentially infinite.




                                                                                   17
    The tentative conclusion here is suggestive of the views of the labor leader
John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers. His philosophy was that
productivity advances in that industry should lead to increased production
and employment and that the union should not resist modern techniques.
Given the elasticities, Lewis may have been wrong about coal, but he was
probably right about manufacturing.


IV. Conclusion


    The late 1990s and early 2000s have seen a rapid growth in productivity in
the American economy. A close examination of the rebound finds that rapid
growth is centered in the New Economy but is much more widespread than
simply computers and semiconductors.


    This study also asks whether workers should be fearful of rapid
productivity growth in light of the decline in non-farm employment. The
results here suggest that productivity is not to be feared – at least not in
manufacturing, where the largest employment declines have occurred. On the
whole, higher productivity has led to lower prices, expanding demand, and
quickly to higher employment, but the partial effects of rapid domestic
productivity growth have been more than offset by more rapid productivity
growth and price declines from foreign competitors.
