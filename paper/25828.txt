                                           ABSTRACT

We use linked birth and education records for all children born in Florida between 1992 and 2002
to assess the effects of neonatal health on the identification of childhood disabilities. We find that
several measures of neonatal health are associated with disability incidence, although birthweight
plays the most empirically relevant role. Using large samples of siblings and twins, we find that
infant health influences multiple measures of disability and grade repetition in school. The
association between birthweight and disability holds throughout the distribution of birthweight
and across a range of socioeconomic characteristics, including maternal education and race.

I. Introduction

           As described by the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) of 1990, the

overarching goal of special education services is to provide disabled children with the same

educational opportunities as those children who do not have disabilities. Roughly 6.4 million

public school students receive special education services in the United States, at an estimated

annual cost of nearly $40 billion (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015).

            In light of the prevalence and associated costs of childhood disability, numerous

researchers have attempted to assess its underlying causes. For example, low birthweight has

been linked to autism (Hultman et al, 2002; Larsson et al, 2005), intellectual disability (Hack,

Klein and Taylor, 1996), and specific learning disabilities such as ADHD and dyslexia (Almond

and Mazumder, 2011; Avchen, Scott and Mason, 2001; Bhutta et al, 2002; Grunau, Whitfield

and Davis, 2002). In addition, congenital anomalies have been linked to several categories of

childhood disabilities (Galaburda et al, 2006; Hultman et al, 2002; Larsson, 2005; Nelson, 2000).

Although these findings ostensibly suggest that many childhood disabilities are functions of a

child’s health endowments, the intertwined relationship between health and family

socioeconomic status (SES) has made it difficult to separately identify the roles of these two

factors. 1 Moreover, the data sources used in previous studies have lacked sufficient sample sizes

to study relatively rare health conditions and disability classifications.

           Several studies have also linked birthweight to long-run human capital outcomes,

including test scores (Figlio, Guryan, Karbownik and Roth, 2014; Chatterji, Kim and Lahiri,

2014, Lin and Liu, 2009), educational attainment (Behrman and Rosenzweig, 2004; Black,

Devereux and Salvanes, 2007; Oreopoulos, Stabile, Walld and Roos, 2008; Royer, 2009),

earnings and wealth in adulthood (Almond and Mazumder, 2010; Black, Devereux and Salvanes,

2007), and intelligence test scores (Lawlor et al, 2006). However, the mechanisms through which

birthweight affects these long run outcomes remain unclear.

         In this paper, we use data from the State of Florida that links K-12 education records to

birth certificate records in order to assess the effects of neonatal health on childhood disabilities,

as measured by special education identification in elementary school. These data are uniquely

well suited to studying the relationship between neonatal health and childhood disability because

they provide detailed information about both SES and children’s health conditions at birth.

Moreover, the birth records include maternal identifiers, allowing us to abstract from the

confounding effects of economic factors that vary across families.

         In addition to disentangling the effects of neonatal health and SES, we conduct three

novel analyses. First, we consider the roles of a number of measures of maternal and infant

health at birth that are potentially important predictors of disability, whereas most previous

studies considered birthweight or gestational age alone. Second, because our data include large

samples of students, we are able to investigate the effects of health on individual disability

categories, including arguably objective physical disabilities (which include vision, hearing, and

orthopedic disabilities) and potentially more malleable disability classifications, such as the

“specific learning disability” category that includes dyslexia and dyscalculia. 2 Finally, we

investigate whether the gradient of disability with respect to neonatal health varies by a host of

child and family characteristics, with a specific focus on whether these effects are strongest

among economically disadvantaged populations.




2
  Dyslexia is a condition that involves difficulty in learning to read despite normal intelligence, while dyscalculia
involves difficulty in learning or comprehending arithmetical calculations.

                                                                                                                        3
         We find that neonatal health, as measured by a number of characteristics available on

birth records, is strongly associated with the incidence of disability. 3 For example, a congenital

anomaly is associated with an 11.5 percentage-point increase in disability incidence in

Kindergarten, a large estimate relative to the baseline incidence of 10.0 percent. This implies that

one important channel through which birthweight affects human capital outcomes is through

disability in childhood. Still, among those characteristics associated with disability identification,

we find that birthweight plays by far the most empirically relevant role.

         Across all of the individual disability categories that we consider, we find large and

statistically significant estimated effects of birthweight. For example, in our preferred

specifications that include sibling fixed effects, the estimates imply an elasticity of identification

with respect to birthweight of -4.8 and -6.4 for fourth grade intellectual and physical disabilities,

respectively. The analogous elasticity for the aggregated “any disability” classification is -0.8. In

every category, the point estimates and elasticities are larger in models that include sibling fixed

effects than in those that do not. Moreover, in a novel finding, we show that the association

between birthweight and disability is strong even among infants in the “normal” birthweight

range of over 2500 grams.

         We also find that the powerful gradient of disability with respect to birthweight holds

across a wide range of socioeconomic categories, including those defined by maternal education,

marital status, and race. Mean disability rates vary widely across the subgroups that we consider

(from 8.8 percent to 22.2 percent in fourth grade), but the estimated effect of a 10 percent


3
 We use “special education identification” and “disability” synonymously throughout, following studies such as
Avchen, Scott, and Mason (2001). Florida’s special education classifications capture the conventional definitions of
disability used in epidemiological and medical literatures, with one exception: asthma and other breathing conditions
are sometimes defined as disabilities but do not typically lead to special education identification (see, e.g., Houtrow
et al., 2014). Nonetheless, Stingone and Claudio (2006) argue that although asthma does not constitute a special
education category itself, children with asthma are 60 percent more likely to enroll in special education than are
children without asthma.

                                                                                                                     4
increase in birthweight on those rates varies considerably less, from -1.0 to -1.4 percentage

points. Similarly, the estimates are roughly constant with respect to SES for most of the

disability categories we consider, although there is some evidence that the effects of birthweight

on intellectual disabilities and speech and language impairments combined with autism spectrum

disorder (SLI / ASD) are largest in the lowest socio-economic groups. Importantly, we find that

poor neonatal health substantially increases the likelihood of later disability regardless of

socioeconomic status, suggesting that parental inputs may not fully offset the effects of early

health shocks.

        Our central goal is to use the unique Florida data to improve upon existing analyses of the

impacts of infant health on later life disability. Although our primary identification strategy

based on within-sibling comparisons arguably achieves this goal, remaining unobservable time-

varying factors may influence both neonatal health and childhood disability. We have conducted

several auxiliary analyses that suggest that we are capturing the causal effects of birthweight, in

particular, on disability. First, we re-estimate our central specifications using a subsample of

twins. Although the twins estimates suffer from a lack of precision, are based on only modest

variation in intrauterine environment (and are thus missing potentially important variation in

infant health), and may not be generalizable to a broader population, they allow us to sidestep

concerns stemming from time-varying unobservable factors. The twins-based estimates are

initially smaller than the sibling-based estimates, but the two sets of estimates become nearly

identical when we adjust for attrition due to participation in the McKay Scholarship Program, a

voucher program for disabled students to attend private schools. Even without such an

adjustment, the twins-based estimates indicate that the relationship between birthweight and

disability is large.



                                                                                                      5
       Second, we estimate models in which we allow the estimated birthweight gradients to

vary by the age difference between siblings. If unobserved changes in family circumstances or

parental behaviors drive the within-family association between birthweight and disability, we

would expect the estimated gradients to grow as the sibling age gap widens. Instead, our

estimates are remarkably constant across sibling age gaps. Third, we consider whether the

estimated gradients in the full sample vary by whether siblings have the same father, i.e., by

whether they are half- or full-siblings. We find that the estimates are nearly identical across the

two groups, despite the fact that a change in father represents a significant change in family

circumstances. In sum, our estimates are invariant to observable measures of the degree of

similarity in siblings’ family circumstances. While we cannot rule out biases stemming from

time-varying unobservables in the full sample, these findings suggest that such biases are likely

to be small.



II. Background

       The medical literature has linked low birthweight to several types of disabilities. For

example, low birthweight is associated with autism (Hultman et al, 2002; Larsson et al, 2005),

intellectual disability (Hack, Klein and Taylor, 1996) and specific learning disabilities such as

ADHD and dyslexia (Almond and Mazumder, 2011; Avchen, Scott and Mason, 2001; Bhutta et

al, 2002; Grunau, Whitfield and Davis, 2002; Linnet et al, 2006). In addition, congenital

anomalies are associated with several categories of childhood disabilities, such as dyslexia,

autism and intellectual disability (Galaburda et al, 2006; Hultman et al, 2002; Larsson et al.,

2005; Nelson, 2000). However, these associational studies often rely on relatively small clinical

samples and are unable to account for the confounding influences of socioeconomic status and



                                                                                                      6
other unobserved determinants of disability. Typically, studies in the medical literature also are

limited to investigating the role of birthweight, while ignoring other measures of infant health –

including maternal health conditions, birth complications, and fetal abnormalities – that could

confound the relationship between birthweight and disability status. In addition, these studies

typically only examine a single disability type.

          A number of studies relate birthweight to human capital outcomes but are unable to shed

light on the underlying mechanisms, one of which could be disability. Black, Devereux and

Salvanes (2007) compare twins and find that lower birthweight translates into lower earnings,

educational attainment and IQ. Similarly, Behrman and Rosenzweig (2003) compare

monozygotic twins and find that birthweight has a strong relationship with educational

attainment, earnings, BMI and height. Royer (2009) also compares twins from California and

finds an association between birthweight and both educational attainment and the birthweight of

the next generation. Oreopoulos, Stabile, Walld and Roos (2008) compare twins and siblings in

Canada and find that birthweight predicts high school completion, labor force outcomes, and

mortality through age 17, even for higher birthweight categories. Figlio, Guryan, Karbownik and

Roth (2014) compare twins from Florida to identify the effects of birthweight on test scores. Lin

and Liu (2009) also compare twins from Taiwan and find that low birthweight predicts lower

grades. Finally, Chatterji, Kim and Lahiri (2014) use an instrumental variables approach that

makes use of multilevel panel data and finds that lower birthweight also predicts lower test

scores.

          Less is known about how childhood disability causally influences human capital

attainment. A key study in this literature is Almond and Mazumder (2010), who find that

prenatal exposure to Ramadan among Arab mothers in Iraq and Uganda results in lower



                                                                                                     7
birthweight babies who are more likely to have cognitive disabilities and a lower likelihood of

home ownership. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether maternal fasting during pregnancy might

produce disability in children through a different mechanism than low birthweight due to preterm

labor, which is more common in the U.S.



III. Data and Descriptive Statistics

         Our data include a unique merger of information from the Florida Education Data

Warehouse, maintained by the Florida Department of Education, and birth records from Florida’s

Bureau of Vital Statistics. The linked records include all children born in the state of Florida

from 1992 to 2002 who were enrolled at any time from the 1995-96 through 2012-13 school

years. These data were merged based on last name, first name, date of birth, and Social Security

Number, and all records were de-identified before being provided to the research team.

Ultimately, 80.7% of birth records were later matched to a record in the education data. Figlio et

al. (2014) and Autor et al. (2015) provide further details on the match quality and matching

algorithm. Both of these studies compare the matched data to information in the American

Community Survey and the Census of Population from 2000 to 2009 and find that the match

rates are close to the proportion of students born in Florida who subsequently enroll in public

schools in Florida (80.9%). 4

         In total, the data includes 1.6 million individual students. However, we restrict our

analysis samples to include only those students who are in the data when they are enrolled in

both Kindergarten and 4th grade in order to be able to track patterns of identification and de-


4
 Note that the denominator in the Census / ACS analysis does not include children who were born in Florida but
subsequently left the country, while the denominator in the Florida analysis necessarily does, as we do not know
where Florida-born children live if they are not enrolled in public schools in Florida. As a result, the two groups are
not identical.

                                                                                                                      8
identification as students advance through elementary school. This restriction reduces our sample

to just under 870,000 students, including about 366,000 children with siblings and 21,804 twins.

Our data do not allow us to determine zygosity; based on population estimates indicating that

roughly 1 in 11 twin pairs are monozygotic in the U.S., our twins sample likely contains roughly

2,000 monozygotic twins.

         Using these rich data, we focus on characteristics of children at birth, including both

health and economic variables, along with detailed data on the identification of students for

special education services under various categorizations. 5 The birth certificate data include a

wealth of information about both child and maternal health status at birth and during the

pregnancy. This information includes birthweight, gestational age, APGAR scores (a test of a

newborn’s responsiveness at one and five minutes after birth), whether the child was part of a

plural birth, the mother’s prior births, and diagnosis codes for congenital anomalies, abnormal

conditions, complications during delivery, and the mother’s pregnancy-related health diagnoses.

Previous studies have shown that these variables are associated with increased incidence and

severity of disability (Eaton et al, 2001; Glasson et al, 2004; Hultman, Sparen and Cnattingius,

2002; Larsson et al, 2005). We include analyses of both twins and singleton births with siblings.

         The birth records also include demographic and economic characteristics of both the

child and the mother, which we use to control for endowments. These characteristics include

child gender, month and year of birth, mother’s marital status, mother’s educational attainment,

mother’s race, mother’s immigration status, language spoken at home, presence of the father at

birth, and the mother’s zip code of residence when the child was born. 6


5
  We define a student as being in special education if he or she has an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) under the
Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act.
6
  All of these variables come from the birth records except for home language, which comes from school records.
We drop zip code indicators and time-invariant maternal variables from sibling and twin fixed-effects models.

                                                                                                                    9
         We utilize information on the child’s special education identification in each year from

Kindergarten to fourth grade. Figure 1 shows a listing of the disability categories used by the

Florida Department of Education during our sample period. Because many of these conditions

are relatively rare, we aggregate them into six larger categories. Intellectual disabilities include

codes A (“educable mentally handicapped”), B (“trainable mentally handicapped”), and N

(“profoundly mentally handicapped”), all of which were reorganized into a single “intellectual

disability” code in 2009. 7 Physical disabilities include codes C (“orthopedically impaired”), H

(“deaf or hard of hearing”), and I (“visually impaired”). Speech and language impairments

combined with autism spectrum disorder (SLI / ASD) include codes F (“speech impaired”), G

(“language impaired”), and P (“autistic”). Specific learning disabilities (SLD), which include

disorders such as dyslexia, correspond to code K. Developmental delays correspond to code T.

Finally, we aggregate all remaining classifications apart from “gifted” status (which we do not

study) into a single “other” category, which includes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

         Table 1 presents summary statistics for all of the variables used in the analyses below. As

noted above, the data include the population of children born in the state of Florida from 1992 to

2002 who were enrolled in public schools at any time from the 1995-96 through 2012-13 school

years; because the 2002 birth cohort has not reached fifth grade by the 2012-2013 school year,

we limit our analysis samples to grades K-4. 8 We further limit to students observed in both

Kindergarten and fourth grade to ensure our sample is balanced across these focus grades. If


7
  In addition to changes in category definitions, diagnoses of disorders themselves have changed over time (King
and Bearman, 2009). For example, a child who may have once been diagnosed with a speech or language
impairment might more recently have received a diagnosis of autism. We combine categories in order to account for
these changing diagnostic trends and criteria over time (such as combining speech and language impairments with
autism).
8
  Florida law specifies that children must be five years of age on or before September 1 to be eligible to enter
Kindergarten in that school year. As a result, children born after September 1, 2002 were not legally eligible to enter
Kindergarten until the 2008-2009 school year, and the majority of these children were in fourth grade in the 2012-
2013 school year.

                                                                                                                    10
students show up multiple times in a grade (due to retention, for example) we only use their first

time in that grade. The top panel of the table shows means of the disability measures in

Kindergarten and fourth grade. Across all years, 10.0 percent of Kindergarteners and 15.0

percent of fourth graders received special education services for a disability or impairment. By

far the most common classification in Kindergarten was SLI / ASD, with 7.8 percent of all

students placed in this category. Less than 1 percent of students were placed in each of the other

classifications. In nearly all cases, the data provide information only on the student’s “primary”

disability, implying that students receive at most one exceptionality code. 9

         By fourth grade, SLD was the most common disability category. Apart from SLI / ASD

and developmental delay, all of the categories are more prevalent in fourth grade than in

Kindergarten. Many students diagnosed with speech and language impairments in Kindergarten

transition out of special education by fourth grade, typically due to a resolution of the

impairment. Following the IDEA amendments of 1997, the developmental delay category is

defined only for children ages 3-9, but in practice, virtually no students in Florida maintain this

designation beyond first grade. Hence, we do not analyze developmental delays beyond first

grade. 10

         The next panel in the table shows the incidence of grade retention. Approximately 7

percent of students repeated kindergarten, while 21.6 percent of students repeated at least one

grade by the time they reached fourth grade. The remaining rows of the table show summary

statistics of health and SES characteristics measured at birth. The birth records include detailed

measures of abnormal conditions such as the need for assisted ventilation – separated into a

  Students can be listed as having a “secondary” disability, but this field is only valid when the student has vision or
hearing disabilities. Given the rareness of these conditions, we restrict to primary disabilities.

“short-term” category of less than 30 minutes and a more severe long-term category – as well as

delivery complications such as the presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid, premature

membrane rupture, and breech presentation. The data also include detailed information about the

mother, including health complications during pregnancy such as anemia, hypertension, and

diabetes. We turn next to assessing how these health measures affect the likelihood of later

disability diagnoses.



IV. Empirical Specifications

        To measure the effects of neonatal and SES characteristics on disability incidence, we

start with simple linear probability models that relate child-level special education indicators to

the characteristics described above. Consider the following model:

(1)     𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑿𝑿𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 𝜝𝜝𝒈𝒈 + 𝑯𝑯𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 𝜞𝜞𝒈𝒈 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator for whether student i in school j is classified as disabled when enrolled

in grade g. The vector 𝑿𝑿 denotes the socioeconomic characteristics of the student derived from

birth certificate and schooling data, the vector 𝑯𝑯 denotes health characteristics at birth of both

the mother and infant, and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 represents unobservable determinants of disability identification.

        Given that socioeconomic factors might lead to delayed diagnoses in some categories, we

begin with the results for fourth grade. Table 2 reports linear probability estimates of the

coefficients 𝜞𝜞𝒈𝒈 from model (1). In the first column, we include only a parsimonious set of

controls in the vector 𝑿𝑿𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊 : month and year of birth, gender, parity, a quadratic in the mother’s

age at birth, and an indicator for missing APGAR scores. Column (2) adds controls for mother’s

immigration status, education level, marital status, and the child’s race and indicators for zip

code of residence at birth, which are potentially informative measures of SES.


                                                                                                         12
         The estimates in column (1) of Table 2 show that a number of factors are significantly

associated with identification in fourth grade, including birthweight, APGAR scores, assisted

ventilation, maternal health issues, labor and delivery complications, and congenital anomalies.

All of the estimated coefficients are of the expected sign, indicating that worse health conditions

at birth are correlated with higher disability rates. For example, a 0.1 log-point increase in

birthweight is associated with a 0.81 percentage-point reduction in identification. Maternal

health conditions are also important; diabetes is associated with a 2.7 percentage-point increase

in identification while hypertension and other pregnancy complications (excluding anemia) are

both associated with 1.3 percentage-point increases. These conditions are relatively common,

occurring in over 25 percent of pregnancies in our data. Breech births, which occur in 3 percent

of all births, are associated with a 1.0 percentage-point increase in disability. On the other hand,

the other statistically significant factors occur in relatively few births. An infant with a five-

minute APGAR score below 7 (the excluded category) is 4.9 percentage points more likely to be

identified than an infant with a score of 9 or 10, but only 1 percent of children have five-minute

APGAR scores below 7. Congenital anomalies and assisted ventilation for more than 30 minutes

are associated with 10.9 and 3.2 percentage-point increases in disability rates, respectively, but

fewer than 0.1% of children have either of these characteristics. 11 Throughout, we cluster

standard errors at the level of the first district in which students enroll.

         All of the estimates are insensitive to the inclusion of socioeconomic controls and zip

code fixed effects, as shown in column (2). Further, Table 3 shows that this stability holds in




11
  Online Appendix Table A1 presents analogous results for Kindergarteners. The point estimates in columns (1)-(3)
are smaller in magnitude than those in Table 2, which is expected because disability rates are lower in Kindergarten
than in fourth grade, but the specific conditions that are significant and the patterns across columns are similar in
both grades. Again, the effect of birthweight increases markedly with the inclusion of maternal fixed effects, from
0.050 to 0.086, while the coefficients for maternal health conditions attenuate markedly.

                                                                                                                  13
each of the disability categories, further suggesting that basic economic factors have little

confounding effect on the relationships between neonatal health and disability identification.

         Column (3) shows estimates from specifications that include sibling fixed effects for the

full sample, along with the baseline controls. These are our preferred specifications, as they

eliminate a substantial portion (though likely not all) of the unobserved SES differences between

children. While the estimates for congenital anomalies, labor and delivery complications,

assisted ventilation, and five-minute APGAR scores are similar in columns (2) and (3), estimates

for all of the mother’s health measures attenuate substantially or even switch signs. At the same

time, the role of birthweight becomes more important, with the point estimate increasing by 44

percent in absolute value, from -0.078 to -0.112.

         A comparison of the estimates including and excluding maternal fixed effects implies that

the within-family association between birthweight and development of disabilities later in life is

stronger than the corresponding between-family association. While it is unclear why this is the

case, one possible explanation is that while birthweight is a powerful measure of infant health,

the mapping from birthweight to health varies across families. For example, some of the

between-family variation in birthweight likely captures variation in family stature: relatively

small parents have relatively small children, on average. Indeed, there is considerable evidence

that stature is itself a large driver of birthweight (e.g., Morrison et al, 1991; Griffiths, et al,

2007). Such variation is essentially noise if it is unrelated to underlying child health, and the

estimates in column (3) (and in column (4)) of Tables 2 and A1 eliminate this source of

variation. 12



12
  If some of the between-family variation in birthweight represents genetic differences in stature, then variation
across children born to the same mothers but different fathers would also capture some of this variation. We have
estimated specifications with sibling fixed effects in which the effects of birthweight are allowed to differ by

                                                                                                                     14
         Finally, column (4) presents the results based on the twins sample. The resulting point

estimate on birthweight is -0.055, roughly half as large as the analogous point estimate in the

sibling fixed-effect model. There are several reasons why the estimates for twins might differ

from those of siblings. First, as we discuss below in the context of Table 3, the twins estimate

becomes much closer to the siblings estimate when we include in the sample students who attend

private school via a voucher program for disabled students. Second, because twins share nearly

identical prenatal environments, most of the between-twin differences in birthweight stem from

genetic factors (for dizygotic twins), slight differences in the location of the placenta that affect

nutrient uptake, or external shocks that differentially affect one child and not the other, e.g.,

physical impacts that transmit more to one child than the other. As a result, estimates for twins

capture only a portion of the potential for the intrauterine environment to influence development

in ways that affect disability identification – such as through maternal health or birth

complications. By examining both within-sibling and within-twin variation, we are able to

investigate the potential roles of these factors. Third, as noted by Oreopoulos, Stabile, Walld and

Roos (2008), the use of a broader sibling-based approach helps to alleviate concerns that twins

represent a non-representative sample of the population.

          Because the estimates in Tables 2 and A1 imply that birthweight is the most practically

and statistically significant determinant of disability, we focus primarily on birthweight

hereafter. However, we view birthweight as a summary statistic that proxies for infant health

more generally. Figure 2 plots semi-parametric estimates of the relationship between birthweight

and identification with any disability in fourth grade, showing estimates from models that

include 21 dummy variables corresponding to 200-gram birthweight bins (with 2500-2699g as


whether the children had the same father. We find small and statistically insignificant differences in the estimates for
siblings with the same fathers versus those with different fathers.

                                                                                                                     15
the reference bin). We present estimates from two models: one including the baseline and SES

controls, and one including baseline controls and sibling fixed effects (our preferred

specification, for which we include 95 percent confidence interval bands). The figure is

consistent with the linear-in-log birthweight specifications used above, as there is a concave

relationship between birthweight and identification. The rate of disability increases precipitously

in the smallest birthweight categories, but the negative relationship remains even into

birthweight ranges beyond 2500g. There is some separation between the lines at both low and

high birthweights, although those differences are not statistically distinguishable. 13

         Figure 3 shows the relationship between birthweight and disability in fourth grade for

those children born above the “low birthweight” threshold of 2500g. The association between

birthweight and disability is strong even in this range: infants weighing more than 3700g have

between 3 and 5 percentage-point lower likelihoods of disability than those in the 2500-2699g

bin. Estimates that include sibling fixed effects imply a stronger gradient than in models that do

not, though the difference is not statistically significant.

         We turn next to analyzing the effects of birthweight on the identification of each of the

disaggregated disability categories. Table 3 shows estimates for fourth grade for the full sample

in Panel A and for the twins sample in Panel B, with column (1) including estimates for the

aggregated “any disability” measure, as in Tables 2 and A1. The estimates in each row refer to

separate linear probability regressions, with specification “A” corresponding to models that

include the baseline control set, specification “B” adding zip code fixed effects and the SES

controls, and specification “C” replacing the controls and zip code fixed effects in “B” with


13
   When we estimate models like those shown in Table 3 restricting to births of less than 2500 grams, adding sibling
fixed effects reduces the estimate from -0.172 (0.005) to -0.201 (0.029); similarly, when we restrict to births greater
than or equal to 2500 grams, the inclusion of sibling fixed effects reduces the estimate from -0.056 (0.007) to -0.073
(0.008).

                                                                                                                   16
sibling / twin indicators. These three specifications are similar to those in columns (1)-(3) of

Table 2, except here log birthweight is the only neonatal health variable included. For example,

the estimate in column (1) in specification C of Panel A, -0.120, is comparable to the estimate

of -0.112 in column (3) of Table 2; this difference is solely due to the exclusion of the neonatal

health characteristics. 14

         Before focusing on the impacts on different categories of disabilities, we consider

specification D, in which we show estimates for “any disability” by including McKay Scholars

in our estimation sample. The McKay Scholarship Program for Students with Disabilities began

in 1999, roughly in the middle of our sample period, and provides students with disabilities the

opportunity to attend a participating private school or a different public school than the student’s

default option. In our main sample, we drop students who take up the scholarship to attend a

private school, as we do not directly observe data on them when enrolled in the private school.

Nonetheless, we can observe whether a student is a recipient, and it is reasonable to infer that

those on a scholarship have some identified disability given the program rules. Hence, in

specification D we present the results of an analysis in which we include in the estimation

sample all children who are on the McKay scholarship, assigning them a disability. Because we

cannot observe the child’s relevant disability category, we only show estimates in Column (1) for

this specification.




14
   As Angrist and Pischke (2008) note, linear probability models produce consistent estimates of average partial
effects in binary outcome models with a large number of incidental parameters. Nonetheless, we have assessed the
sensitivity of our results to functional form assumptions by estimating logit models analogous to the specifications
in Table 3. For example, the marginal effect from a logit model corresponding to column (1) of Specification C for
grade 4 is -0.117 (0.006), compared to the OLS estimate of -0.120 (0.006). It is computationally infeasible to
estimate conditional logit models with a very large number of fixed effects. Thus, for the maternal fixed effects
specifications we instead first demean all of our control variables by subtracting from each variable its mean value
across all children born to that mother, and then estimate logit models using these demeaned values as control
variables. In all cases, our conclusions are unchanged regardless of estimation method.

                                                                                                                   17
         While the estimated effect of log birthweight is unchanged by the inclusion of the McKay

scholars in the sibling sample, for the twins sample the resulting point estimate becomes much

larger than the baseline estimate – and comparable in magnitude for that in the sibling sample.

Hence, this particular type of attrition for disabled twins could explain the considerably smaller

estimates we find in twin samples.

         Turning next to the analyses of specific disability categories, columns (2)-(6) show the

effects of log birthweight on the likelihood of identification in in each of the six disability

categories. In the top panel, the estimates from the models that include sibling fixed effects

(specification C) are larger in absolute value than the corresponding estimates without sibling

fixed effects (specifications A and B). Focusing on specification C, a 10 percent increase in

birthweight is estimated to decrease the probability of placement into SLI / ASD in fourth grade

by 0.19 percentage points, which is roughly 3.6 percent of the corresponding sample mean of 5.3

percent (shown in brackets at the bottom of the panel), implying an elasticity of -0.36. Column

(7) shows the effects of birthweight on the likelihood of repeating a grade at some point between

Kindergarten and fourth grade. The estimate implies that a 10 percent increase in birthweight

decreases the probability of repeating a grade by 1.16 percentage points. Online Appendix Table

A2 presents analogous results for Kindergarten.

         For all of the categories listed in Panel A of the table, the effects of birthweight on

disability incidence are both practically and statistically significant. 15 The largest point estimate


15
  Table 3 and several of the tables discussed below include outcomes that are mechanically correlated because the
“any disability” indicator is the sum of the indicators across the specific disability categories. This introduces the
possibility of incorrectly rejecting true null hypotheses at higher rates than nominal significance levels would imply.
One method of incorporating family-wise error rate controlling procedures is to use Bonferroni corrections, which
amount to performing hypothesis tests using a significance level of α / m, where α is the chosen nominal
significance level and m is the total number of hypotheses tested. If the five disability category-specific estimates
across columns are viewed as a family, the Bonferroni correction would imply that a researcher who wishes to use a
nominal significance level of, say, 0.05 should reject individual null hypotheses only if individual p-values are less
than 0.01 (=0.05 / 5).

                                                                                                                    18
corresponds to specific learning disabilities, in which a 10 percent increase in birthweight is

estimated to decrease the likelihood of disability by 0.42 percentage points. The point estimates

for the less common classifications of intellectual and physical disabilities are smaller in absolute

magnitude but are large relative to the underlying incidence of these disabilities. For intellectual

disabilities, the point estimate of -0.027 implies an elasticity with respect to birthweight of -3.9.

The implied elasticity for physical disabilities is -5.6. In sum, identification in the rarer – and

arguably more severe – categories is particularly sensitive to birthweight.

       Panel B shows the results for the twins sample. Focusing again on the specifications that

include twin fixed effects, the category-specific estimates are typically slightly smaller than

those in Panel A. However, the estimates are relatively imprecise due to smaller sample sizes,

and as a result are typically statistically insignificant. The largest discrepancy between the

sibling- and twins-fixed-effect estimates is for intellectual and physical disabilities; these are the

only categories in which in which the two sets of estimates are statistically distinguishable.

       Thus far, we have argued that birthweight is the most relevant measure of neonatal health

for predicting disability because for every disability category, the estimated effects of

birthweight are both large and insensitive to the inclusion of additional measures of neonatal

health. Table 4 provides further evidence of this phenomenon by showing the estimated effects

on fourth grade disabilities of birthweight and gestational age in three different models. The first

includes birthweight as the sole measure of neonatal health (shown in the top row), the second

includes gestational age, and the third includes both of these measures. All models include the

baseline controls and sibling fixed effects, using the full sample.




                                                                                                      19
        The table shows striking evidence that it is not prematurity per se, but birthweight that

influences disability. 16 The estimated effect of birthweight in the “any disability” column barely

changes, from -0.120 to -0.121, when gestational age is included. In contrast, the estimated effect

of gestational age declines from -0.066 to 0.001 when birthweight is included; a similar decline

occurs in each of the disaggregated disability categories (the estimate becomes marginally

significantly positive in the case of specific learning disabilities). For each disability category,

the estimated effects of birthweight are robust to the inclusion of gestational age. Appendix

Table A3 shows analogous results for Kindergarteners. The findings match those shown in Table

4: the effects of birthweight are insensitive to the inclusion of gestational age for every category,

while the inclusion of birthweight dramatically reduces the implied effects of gestational age.

        Table 4 also sheds light on what might drive the differences between the siblings and

twins estimates. The siblings estimates capture variation in birthweight due to both sibling

differences in gestational age and intrauterine growth rates (IUGR), while the twins estimates

necessarily capture only IUGR differences. As Table 4 shows, variation in gestational age does

not account for the differences between the siblings and twins estimates, suggesting that the

differences stem from other factors. Hereafter, we focus on the siblings estimates for the reasons

described above, namely that they are substantially more precise, potentially more generalizable,

and likely capture a broader measure of variation in the intrauterine environment than do twins

estimates.

        We have only focused on fourth grade and Kindergarten to this point. However, in Table

5 we show estimates for each grade from K-4, using our preferred specification with sibling



16
  This finding is consistent with the results of Garfield et al. (2017), who show that while extremely premature
children are disproportionately low-performers in school, a large fraction of extremely premature children perform
within the typical range found among full-term infants.

                                                                                                                 20
fixed effects. We use a balanced sample of all students observed in all grades, which reduces our

sample size to 746,623. The estimated effect of birthweight on any disability grows steadily as

children progress through elementary school, although when normed by the grade-specific

disability rates shown in brackets, the point estimates are roughly constant from first grade to

fourth grade. For example, the implied elasticities are -0.80 (= -0.097 / 0.122) and -0.82

(= -0.124 / 0.152) in first and fourth grade, respectively.

         Table 5 also shows that there is substantial heterogeneity in the temporal patterns across

categories. The estimated effects of birthweight on SLI / ASD decline from Kindergarten to

fourth grade (although not monotonically), along with the underlying incidence of these

categories. Speech disabilities are typically treated in early grades, and children often exit the

special education system once their speech improves. The estimated effects on specific learning

disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and “other” disabilities grow over time, while the effects on

physical disabilities are essentially constant. The most dramatic growth – for both the underlying

incidence and the estimated effects of birthweight – is for specific learning disabilities, which

becomes the most prevalent disability category by fourth grade. These disabilities often go

undiagnosed until mid/late elementary grades, but still manifest themselves through classroom

behaviors at early ages. 17

         The broad patterns in Table 5 suggest that, among those disabilities that become more

common as children progress through school, the effects of birthweight grow in absolute terms.




17
   Previous evidence suggests that a child’s likelihood of being diagnosed with a specific learning disability is
related to their performance relative to their classmates in school. For example, Elder and Lubotsky (2009) find that
learning disabilities are more commonly diagnosed in students who are relatively young in the within-classroom age
distribution. Elder (2010) and Evans and Morrill (2010) find that the age-disability relationship is particularly strong
for ADHD – which is sometimes categorized as a specific learning disability (though typically not in Florida) –
resulting in systematic long-term differences between the youngest and oldest children in a classroom in the use of
stimulants prescribed to treat ADHD.

                                                                                                                     21
In contrast, the effects of birthweight either shrink or remain constant for those disabilities that

are commonly identified in Kindergarten or earlier, such as SLI / ASD and physical disabilities.

       We have primarily focused on models that impose homogenous effects of birthweight,

but there could be interactions between birthweight and other neonatal health and maternal

health outcomes. In Table A4 in the Online Appendix, we present the results of an analysis that

interacts the log of birthweight with a set of bins for gestational age in weeks. The omitted

category is 39-40 weeks of gestation, corresponding to a “full term” infant. The estimates show

that the effects of birthweight on the identification of any disability grow monotonically as

gestational age declines, although the only significant interaction estimate is for children born at

less than 31 weeks.

       Next, in Table A5 we present estimates from models that interact log birthweight with the

following characteristics of the child, mother, and labor/delivery in separate models: anemia,

Apgar scores, assisted ventilation (both less than and greater than 30 minutes), breech birth,

congenital anomalies, maternal drinking during pregnancy, maternal diabetes, maternal

hypertension, meconium, premature membrane rupture, other abnormalities, other labor/delivery

complications, other mother’s health conditions, and maternal smoking during pregnancy. In

most cases, the interaction effects are small and statistically insignificant, with a few exceptions.

First, the birthweight effects are smaller for children with Apgar scores of 9 or 10 (the highest

scores). This interaction effect is driven by impacts on intellectual disabilities and physical

disabilities (not shown), suggesting that low birthweight is less of a problem for these severe

types of disabilities if the child has good vital signs at birth. The birthweight effects are also

larger if the birth is breech and in the presence of a congenital anomaly. Finally, birthweight

effects are larger if there is a premature membrane rupture. In sum, the effects of birthweight



                                                                                                       22
vary by the presence of other health conditions at birth or maternal health / behavior, but the

association between birthweight and disability is large regardless of the presence of these factors.



V. Heterogeneity in the Effects of Birthweight by Child and Family Characteristics

       Because our data include large samples of students in a racially and economically diverse

state – for example, in 2013, 40 percent of Florida students were non-Hispanic white, 23 percent

were non-Hispanic black, and 32 percent were Hispanic – we are able to investigate whether the

effects of birthweight on disability vary by a host of child and family characteristics. We are

particularly interested in assessing whether the effects of birthweight are strongest among

economically disadvantaged populations, which might be the case if disadvantaged groups are

those most at risk for developing disabilities.

       Table 6 presents the estimated effects of birthweight on fourth grade disability categories

for several subgroups. All estimates come from our preferred specification with sibling fixed

effects using the full sample. The top panel of the table shows estimates by gender; specifically,

we interact a “female” indicator with birthweight and report both the main effect of birthweight

and the interaction effect. We estimate a separate regression for each panel, i.e., we include

separate regressions for gender, race / ethnicity, maternal education, and so on.

       The top panel shows that boys have slightly larger effects of birthweight on the

identification of “any disability” (-0.136 versus -0.104), but the gender differential varies across

disability categories. Specifically, the estimated effects of birthweight are larger for boys than for

girls in all categories except for SLI / ASD, with the difference most pronounced for the specific

learning disability category.




                                                                                                   23
        The next panel shows results separately by race / ethnicity. For non-Hispanic whites,

non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics, there are large effects of birthweight on all disability

categories. Moreover, we find that that the effects of birthweight are not obviously related to the

underlying incidence across groups: among the five disability categories, the group with the

largest underlying incidence has the largest point estimate in two cases (for brevity, we do not

report the incidence rates in the table).

        The next two panels show results by four categories of maternal education and by two

categories of maternal marital status, respectively. The results exhibit the same general patterns

as in the top two panels, in that birthweight strongly impacts disability for all groups, and the

variation in the point estimates across groups is small. For SLI / ASD and intellectual

disabilities, the relationship between birthweight and disability is somewhat stronger for children

whose mothers did not attend college, or whose mothers are not married. In the case of physical

disabilities, the relationship between birthweight and disability is strongest for children whose

mothers have a college degree.

        In the last two panels of the table, we limit our estimation samples to sibling pairs in

order to consider variation in the birthweight gradient by the degree of similarity in siblings’

family circumstances. The panel labeled “Siblings with Different Fathers” presents estimates by

whether the siblings shared the same father, i.e., by whether they were half- or full-siblings. The

“any disability” point estimates are nearly identical for the two groups, and the point estimates

for half-siblings are larger in absolute value for two of the disaggregated categories, smaller in

three categories, and roughly identical for the “other” category. There is also only a small,

statistically insignificant difference for the grade repetition measure.




                                                                                                     24
        The final panel presents estimates from models in which the natural log of birthweight is

interacted with the age gap between sibling pairs; these models also include the age gap itself as

a control. In all cases, the coefficient on the interaction term is small relative to the main effect of

birthweight; for example, the estimated birthweight gradient for “any disability” is -0.111

(= -0.115 + 0.004) for siblings born one year apart and -0.103 for siblings born three years apart.

        Importantly, the estimates in the bottom two panels of Table 6 are potentially informative

about whether any of our within-sibling estimates have a causal interpretation. Specifically, if

unobserved changes over time in family circumstances or parental behaviors influence both

neonatal health and disability, then the estimates from models that include maternal fixed effects

would fail to capture the causal effects of birthweight. In this scenario, we would expect the

estimated gradients to grow as the sibling age gap widens, under the assumption that the impacts

of time-varying factors are more salient as more time elapses between sibling births. However,

five of the six estimates on the “ln(birthweight) × age gap” interaction terms are positive,

implying that the gradient weakens as the age gap increases.

        To illustrate these patterns further, Figure 4 plots the estimated birthweight gradient by

nine sibling age-difference bins. The estimated effect of log birthweight on the identification of

any disability is roughly -0.055 for twins but grows to between -0.148 and -0.165 for age gaps of

9-12 and 12-18 months, respectively, which are both much larger than the full-sample estimate

of -0.120 shown in Table 3. While we are wary of drawing strong inferences from the figure

given the imprecision of the estimates, overall we find that the estimated birthweight gradients

do not appear to be systematically related to the degree to which siblings share similar family

circumstances.




                                                                                                     25
        A related issue is that neonatal health in one sibling could influence the disability status

of other siblings through spillovers, possibly through parental responses. Black et al. (2017)

estimate the impacts of disability status on siblings’ educational achievement and find significant

spillover effects. In estimates available by request, we follow the strategy used in that study by

restricting to three-child families and estimating the impacts on the oldest two children’s

disability status as a function of “exposure time” to the youngest sibling (the time between when

the youngest child is born and an older child reaches fourth grade) and the interaction between

that exposure time and the birthweight of the youngest sibling. We find small and statistically

insignificant effects of the exposure time × birthweight interaction on the disability status of the

older sibling, suggesting that sibling spillover effects are unlikely to be contaminating our

disability estimates. However, consistent with the findings of Black et al. (2017), we find

significant negative effects of the interaction variable on grade retention.

        Taken as a whole, our findings show that the powerful association between birthweight

and disability holds across a wide range of socioeconomic categories – including those defined

by maternal education, marital status, and race – and across disability categories. We find mixed

evidence for the existence of heterogeneity in birthweight’s effects: while the point estimates are

typically largest for groups with the highest incidence of underlying disability, the implied

elasticities are smallest in those groups. Moreover, these patterns are not consistent across

disability categories. For intellectual disability, a relatively rare classification, the birthweight

gradient is positively related to the underlying group-specific incidence regardless of how we cut

the data. For the more common classifications of SLI / ASD and specific learning disabilities,

there are no clear patterns across the panels of Table 6, although the relationship between




                                                                                                        26
birthweight and SLI / ASD is strongest for children whose mothers have less than a high school

education or who are unmarried.

         The heterogeneous effects of birthweight with respect to intellectual disabilities are

particularly interesting, given that Figlio et al. (2014) find that the effects of birthweight on

student outcomes are, if anything, slightly stronger for high-SES families than for low-SES

families. One possible source of this apparent discrepancy could stem from variation across SES

in baseline levels of measured cognitive skills. For example, if the effects of birthweight on

measured IQ are constant in the population, and if identification of intellectual disabilities is

primarily driven by a binary measure of whether a child’s IQ is lower than a given threshold, the

effects of birthweight on intellectual disabilities will be larger among those groups that have IQ

distributions with relatively more mass near that threshold among “normal weight” babies. While

this is a simplification of the disability identification process, it is arguably a reasonable

approximation to reality in the U.S. before 2009, when intellectual disabilities were defined

primarily by whether a child scored below 75 on standardized IQ tests. 18 Thus, our findings for

intellectual disability are not necessarily inconsistent with those of Figlio et al. (2014), who

concluded that neonatal health and parental inputs are modestly complementary.



VI. Endogenous Mobility

         We argued above that the linked birth-education data are representative of the population

of children born in Florida who attend public schools in Florida. However, students with

disabilities might nonrandomly attend private schools or move out of the state. To investigate


18
  The 2009 revision of IDEA fundamentally changed the identification process for intellectual disabilities, requiring
as a necessary condition for identification that a child exhibits “significant deficits in the ability to function
independently.” Thus, measured IQ scores are no longer necessary nor sufficient conditions for the identification of
intellectual disabilities.

                                                                                                                  27
this issue, we estimated models that examine whether birthweight has an impact on being

included in our main estimation samples. We find that there is no association between log

birthweight and attendance at a public Florida Kindergarten in either the within-sibling or the

within-twin models: the coefficients are less than 0.002 and t–statistics are less than 0.5 in both

cases. Nonetheless, we do find evidence of selective attrition when we restrict to those enrolled

in both Kindergarten and fourth grade. Specifically, we estimate that a 1 log-point increase in

birthweight is correlated with a 3.1 percentage-point increase (standard error of 0.003) in the

likelihood of being observed in fourth grade in the within-sibling models, and a 2.5 percentage-

point (0.009) increase in the within-twins models. Thus, it does appear that low birthweight

children are disproportionately less likely to be observed in our estimation samples, and we

cannot observe the extent to which this attrition involves out-of-state moves versus enrollment

into private schools.

       To gauge the extent of bias caused by nonrandom attrition, in Online Appendix Table A6

we present the results of a bounding analysis that assigns disability status based on birthweight

for students not observed in the education data. Specifically, in column (2), we assign a disability

to all children of low birthweight (< 2500g) who are not observed in both Kindergarten and

fourth grade. This exercise would plausibly serve as an upper bound on the relationship between

birthweight and disability. Column (3) repeats this exercise, except it limits the imputation to

those of very low birthweight (< 1500g). These results suggest that, in the absence of attrition,

the impact of birthweight on disability could be considerably larger – nearly double those of our

main estimates, though these bounds are conservative by design.

       Column (4) represents a lower bound, as it instead assumes that no low-birthweight

children missing in either Kindergarten or fourth grade are disabled. The resulting estimates here



                                                                                                    28
are, by design, smaller in absolute value than the baseline estimates for both siblings and twins;

importantly, they are still large and significantly different from zero. We view the assumptions

underlying column (4) as unusually conservative – it is highly unlikely that none of the missing

low-birthweight infants are identified with a disability – so these results provide further support

for a strong association between infant health and later disability.



VII. Discussion and Conclusions

       Using a unique merger of birth and education records from Florida, we present estimates

of the effects of neonatal health on special education identification. We find that childhood

disability is strongly associated with several measures of neonatal health – including lengthy

assisted ventilation, APGAR scores, breech presentation, congenital anomalies, and meconium in

amniotic fluid – but that birthweight plays an especially large role. This implies ex post that

studies that only have access to birthweight data are likely to have a solid first approximation of

neonatal health, at least when studying determinants of disability.

       Children with lower birthweights are disproportionately likely to be diagnosed with

disabilities throughout elementary school, and this relationship holds across socioeconomic

categories. The estimated effects grow monotonically from Kindergarten to fourth grade,

whereas the associated elasticities decline because the underlying incidence of identified

disabilities increases as children age. Our central specifications include sibling fixed effects,

allowing us to separate the effects of neonatal health from confounding factors due to family-

level socioeconomic endowments. We consistently find that the implied effects of birthweight

are larger in these models than in those without maternal fixed effects, and we argue that this

phenomenon may stem from between-family variation in birthweight that is unrelated to

underlying neonatal health. Overall, we find that a 10 percent increase in birthweight reduces
                                                                                                    29
disability rates in fourth grade by 1.2 percentage points, implying an elasticity of -0.8. We find

somewhat smaller and imprecisely estimated effects in specifications using twins, but we argue

that this is likely due to the different nature of intrauterine effects on disability between twins

and siblings and attrition of disabled twins into private schooling via vouchers. Adjusting for the

latter issue provides estimates similar to those from the sibling models, which are themselves

unaffected by the exclusion of voucher students.

        Because our estimation samples are much larger than those used in previous analyses of

the determinants of special education identification, we are able to assess the effects of

birthweight on individual disability categories, including relatively rare conditions such as

intellectual disabilities. Across all of the categories that we consider, we find large and

statistically significant effects of birthweight. The sensitivity of identification to birthweight is

especially pronounced for relatively rare categories. These categories (including physical and

intellectual disabilities) are also arguably more objectively defined than other classifications,

such as specific learning disabilities or speech and language disorders.

        Our data also allow us to shed light on the extent of heterogeneity in the effects of

birthweight across a variety of child and family characteristics. These analyses reveal two

important findings. First, the estimated effects of birthweight are large across a wide range of

socioeconomic groups, even though disability incidence varies substantially across those groups.

The estimated effects of a 10 percent increase in birthweight on overall fourth grade disability

rates fall in a relatively tight window across groups: from -0.98 to -1.36 percentage points.

        Finally, our estimates suggest that poor neonatal health affects children regardless of their

economic endowments. We find no evidence that the birthweight / disability gradient is strongest

among the most economically disadvantaged populations.



                                                                                                        30
       Our findings that neonatal health strongly influences disability even among families with

substantial economic endowments suggests that in many cases, parental inputs are only partially

effective in offsetting the effects of early health shocks. Although this finding is disheartening, it

provides clear directions for future research. Priorities include investigating whether

interventions aimed at improving neonatal health – such as improvements in maternal nutrition –

will result in reductions in childhood disability. Additionally, because we know little about the

impact of special education identification on later outcomes, there is a need for studies of the

effects of such interventions to assess whether they are effective tools for ameliorating the effects

of poor neonatal health on adult outcomes.

Notes: the y-axis represents the probability of diagnosis in birthweight bins relative to the 2500-2699g
bin. All models include controls for birth order, gender, year of birth, and month of birth. Economic
controls include mother’s education, immigration status, a quadratic in mother’s age, and race of child.
95% confidence intervals (based on standard errors clustered by first district attended) for estimates from
the model that includes maternal indicators are shown with dotted lines.

Notes: All estimates are from linear probability models of a binary measure of disability. Column (1) uses a
sample of 869,179 children, including 366,064 with siblings. Due to missing data, sample sizes for columns (2)
and (3) drop slightly to 866,708. Column (4) is restricted to multiple births and includes 20,542 child
observations. Standard errors, clustered by first district attended, are listed in parentheses. *, **, and ***
denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively. "Baseline controls" include month of
birth, year of birth, gender, parity, controls for missing APGAR scores, and a quadratic in mother's age. For twins
fixed effects models, only missing APGAR scores, gender, and parity are included in these controls.
"Socioeconomic controls" include mother's immigration status, mother's education level, mother's marital
status, and child's race.

Notes: The entries in each column and panel represent estimates from a regression of a binary measure of disability on ln(birthweight) interacted with the
characteristics listed in that panel. The main effects for the variables interacted with birthweight are also included (but not shown). Standard errors
clustered by first district attended in parentheses. All specifications include baseline controls and sibling fixed effects. *, **, and *** denote statistical
significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively. † The model for “age gap for younger siblings” includes main effects and interaction effects with an
indicator for being an older sibling (not shown).

Notes: All estimates are from linear probability models of a binary measure of disability. Columns (1) and (4)
have sample sizes of 869,179 children, including 366,064 with siblings. Due to missing data, sample sizes for
columns (2) and (3) drop slightly to 866,708. Column (5) is restricted to multiple births and includes 20,542 child
observations. Standard errors clustered by first district attended are listed in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote
statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively. "Baseline controls" include month of birth,
year of birth, gender, parity, controls for missing APGAR scores, and a quadratic in mother's age. For the twin
fixed effect models, only missing APGAR scores, gender, and parity are included in these controls.
"Socioeconomic controls" include mother's immigration status, mother's education level, mother's marital
status, and child's race.

Notes: The entries in each column represent estimates from a regression of a binary measure of having any disability by grade 4 on ln(birthweight)
interacted with the characteristics listed in that panel. Standard errors clustered by first district attended in parentheses. Controls include month of birth,
year of birth, gender, parity, and a quadratic in mother's age. All specifications include baseline controls and sibling fixed effects. *, **, and *** denote
statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively.
