                      TARGET ZONES AND INTEREST RATE VARIABILITY


                                          ABSTRACT

    The trade-off between interest rate variability and the width of an exchange rate

target zone is examined, using the regulated Brownian motion model of target zones. It is

shown that for narrow exchange rate bands, and for reasonable parameter values, the

interest rate differential's asymptotic variability is increasing in the width of the exchange

rate band; whereas for wide exchange rate bands it is slowly decreasing in the exchange

rate band. The interest rate differential's instantaneous variability is decreasing in the

width of the exchange rate band.

    A narrow target zone differs from a completely fixed exchange rate regime in that the

interest rate differential's instantaneous standard deviation is high and even increases

when the zone narrows.

    The model is extended to include a realignment/devaluation risk, as well as an

endogenous exchange rate risk premium.         The risk premium is small for reasonable

parameter values and does not matter much.
