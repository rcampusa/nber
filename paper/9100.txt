        This paper reviews the literature on the effects of capital account liberalization and stock market
liberalization on economic growth. The various empirical measures used to gauge the presence of controls
on capital account transactions as well as indicators of stock market liberalization are discussed. We
compare detailed measures of capital account controls that attempt to capture the intensity of enforcement
with others that simply capture whether or not controls are present. Our review of the literature shows the
contrasting results that have been obtained. These differences may reflect differences in country coverage,
sample periods and indicators of liberalization. In order to reconcile these differences, we present new
estimates of the effects on growth of capital account liberalization and stock market liberalization. We
find some support for a positive effect of capital account liberalization on growth, especially for
developing countries.

                                        INTRODUCTION

       Economic theory suggests that unfettered international capital flows can foster a more

efficient allocation of resources, provide opportunities for risk diversification, and help

promote financial development. In recognition of these potential benefits, governments of

industrial countries have undertaken widespread capital account liberalization over the past

quarter-century. Many attribute efficiency gains, increased diversification opportunities, and

financial development in these countries to opening up capital markets.

       A natural policy prescription, therefore, is to extend this process of international

financial integration to other, economically less developed, countries.1 But this view has been

quite controversial. Some argue that, while capital account liberalization is desirable, it is

important to proceed slowly.2 Others question the desirability of unfettered capital flows

regardless of the liberalization process since, on the grounds that unregulated capital flows

could facilitate the occurrence and spreading of currency crises.3

1
  The benefits of open capital markets were stressed by Lawrence Summers in his 2000
Richard T. Ely Lecture to the American Economic Association when he said “…to the extent
that international financial integration represents an improvement in financial
intermediation,... [perhaps] because institutions involved in the transfer of capital across
jurisdictions improve efficiency with which capital is allocated, it offers a potentially
significant increase in economic efficiency.” (p. 3)
2
 For example in the Report of the Managing Director to the International Monetary and
Financial Committee on Progress in Strengthening the Architecture of the International
Financial System and Reform of the IMF it is written “In a number of discussions in recent
years on issues related to capital account issues, the Executive Board has emphasized the
substantial benefits of capital account liberalization, but stressed the need to carefully
manage and sequence liberalization in order to minimize risks.”
3
  In an influential article in Foreign Affairs, Bhagwati (1998) argued that “substantial gains
[from capital controls] have been asserted, not demonstrated …” (p. 7).




                                                1
       Given the potential importance of countries’ policies on capital account liberalization

and the different lessons one might draw based upon which articles one reads in this

expanding literature, it seems an opportune time to review the evidence. In this paper we

survey the literature on the links between capital account liberalization and economic

performance with a focus on the empirical cross-country studies of the effects of capital

account liberalization on growth.

       One source of the debate on the role of capital account liberalization is the mixed set

of empirical results derived in the literature. A possible reason for this ambiguity arises from

the difficulty in identifying and quantifying capital account liberalization in a consistent

manner across a wide set of countries. Consequently, different studies have applied different

empirical measures. Another reason for differences in empirical results is that, while most

studies start with essentially the same benchmark cross-country growth model, there is

divergence with respect to the set of countries included in the analysis, the sample period that

is investigated, the dataset employed, and the estimation technique applied. In order to

provide an informative comparison of the various contributions made in the literature, we

undertake an empirical analysis to investigate the sensitivity of results to the measure of

capital account openness, country coverage, and econometric methods.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes and presents

different measures of capital account openness. The presentation of these indicators shows

the extent of capital account liberalization across the world over the past quarter century.

The description of these indicators is also an important precursor to our summary of the

empirical literature on capital account liberalization and economic growth in Section III.

Section III compares and contrasts contributions to this literature. We note how these studies


                                                2
differ with respect to data, methods and results. These differences hamper comparison across

studies. Therefore, in Section IV, we attempt to reconcile some of the differences by

presenting results using different indicators of capital account openness in a common data

set. In that section, we investigate the sensitivity of the estimated effect of capital account

liberalization on economic growth to the use of different indicators of liberalization, to the

set of countries used in the analysis, and to the econometric methods employed. The new

estimates presented in Section IV provide evidence that capital account liberalization

promotes growth, but the significance of this effect varies across regions. Section V offers

some concluding remarks.



                    I. MEASURES OF CAPITAL ACCOUNT RESTRICTIONS

       A natural starting point for any data-based discussion of the consequences of capital

account liberalization is a review of different empirical measures of capital liberalization that

have been employed to gauge whether a country allows the free flow of capital across its

borders. In practice, there are few indicators of capital account restrictions available across a

wide cross-section of countries. Most measures are qualitative and rules-based, though there

has been some attempt to go beyond an on/off categorization by reflecting the intensity with

which controls are imposed.

       Two of the most widely used capital account restriction measures draw on data

assembled by the IMF and published annually since 1950 in its Annual Report on Exchange

Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER). We begin by discussing these rules

based indicators. We then present some alternative methods of dating stock market

liberalization. Following this, we consider recent quantitative measures. We conclude this


                                                3
section with a short discussion of the efficacy of efforts to limit capital flows, a topic that is

important when considering the relationship between de jure measures of capital account

controls and the de facto effects of these controls.

        Table 1 provides a summary of the measures of capital account controls and capital

account liberalization. This summary table will facilitate comparing and contrasting the

indicators discussed in this section. Each row of this table corresponds to one of the

indicators. The first column presents the name of the indicator that we will use in our

discussion of the determinants of growth below. The second column provides the source of

the indicator, referring either to an article where the indicator is first presented or to a

publication whose issues can be used to construct the indicator. Columns 3 through 6 of the

table present a brief description of the indicator, the range of values the indicator takes, the

years covered and the countries covered by the indicator.



                                   A. Rules-Based Measures

IMF Measures

        Every issue of the International Monetary Fund’s Annual Report on Exchange

Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions published between 1967 (which refers to

conditions in 1966) and 1996 (which refers to conditions in 1995) includes a summary table

in which a single row directly addresses the presence of capital controls; line E.2, labeled

“Restrictions on payments for capital transactions.”4 The information in this row has been the


4
  The set of categories that reflect the presence of capital controls expanded with the 1997
issue of Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions with the
specification of 13 categories including, for the first time, a distinction between restrictions
                                                                                    (continued…)


                                                 4
basis for generating an indicator of the existence of rules or restrictions that inhibit cross-

border capital flows or discriminate on the basis of citizenship or residence of transacting

agents. (Table 1, Row 1)



Share Measure

        A standard way to use the information from line E.2 of the International Monetary

Fund’s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions is to construct,

for each country, a variable reflecting the proportion of years in which countries had

liberalized capital accounts. We call this variable Share (Table 1, Row 2).5 For example, if

the AREAER judged capital markets open for five years out of a 10-year period, then the

openness measure Share would be 0.5. A potential problem with this approach is that a value

of Share equal to 0.5 is consistent with a situation where a country had open capital markets

for the first five years of a decade, for the last five years of a decade, for every other year of a

decade, or for many other on-again, off-again patterns. In practice, however, as shown in

Panel A of Table 2 (from Klein and Olivei, 2000), there are very few instances of on-again,

off-again capital account controls, at least for the 10-year period that ends in 1995, the last


on inflows and restrictions on outflows. Unfortunately, this modification of the classification
system introduces a structural break in the measure since the two classification
methodologies (one entry versus 13 entries) cannot easily be mapped onto each other. We do
not discuss the expanded categorization in the post-1996 AREAER since we know of no
research on capital account liberalization that has used data spanning these two classification
systems.
5
 The first work to employ such dataset—and generate a publicly available electronic
version—was Grilli and Milesi-Ferretti 1995. Other research using such measure includes
Rodrik 1998, and Klein and Olivei 2000.

year in which capital account liberalization reflects the entry in a single line of the AREAER.

Thus, over the period 1986 to 1995, a country with a value of Share equal to 0.1 had an open

capital account in 1995 only, a country with a value of Share equal to 0.2 had an open capital

account in 1994 and 1995, and so on. This pattern holds for all industrial countries and for

10 of the 12 developing countries that had some experience with open capital accounts

during this period. Panel B of this table shows that this correspondence between the value of

Share and the number of continuous years of open capital accounts continues to hold for

industrial countries as the sample period is extended back to 1976. But, in this longer sample

period, there are many more cases of on-again, off-again capital account liberalization among

developing countries. In fact, among the developing countries that had any experience with

open capital accounts over the period 1976–1995, the only countries where capital accounts

were not closed after having been opened were Indonesia and Malaysia, both of which had

open capital accounts throughout the entire 1976–1995 period.6



An Intensity Measure

       The on/off indicator of capital controls presented in the summary table of the Annual

Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions described above does not

distinguish between strongly administered capital controls and those that are somewhat more

porous. Quinn (1997) attempts to capture the intensity of enforcement of controls on both the

capital account and the current account through a careful reading of the narrative descriptions


6
 However, during the 1997/1998 Asian financial crisis Malaysia placed restrictions on its
capital account transactions.




                                               6
in the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (Table 1,

Row 3).7

        We limit our discussion to Quinn’s measures of capital account liberalization.8 He

scores separately the intensity of controls for capital account receipts and capital account

payments. For each of these two categories the scoring method is as follows: a score of 0

indicates payments are forbidden, 0.5 indicates that there are quantitative or other regulatory

restrictions, 1 indicates that transactions are subject to heavy taxes, 1.5 indicates that there

are less severe taxes, and 2 indicates that transactions are free of restrictions or taxes. The

sum of the values for the two categories is an indicator of overall capital account openness

that ranges between 0 and 4. These indicators are available annually from 1950–1997 for 21

OECD countries, and for the years 1958, 1973, 1982, and 1988 for 43 non-OECD countries.

        A glance at Quinn’s dataset indicates that the overall trend towards liberalization is

mostly driven by the OECD countries. Table 3 presents a tabulation of Quinn’s measure of

capital account liberalization for 1973, 1982, and 1988, years for which these indicators are

available for all countries. The top panel of this table presents the data for the full set of 63

countries while the lower panel presents the data for the 42 non-OECD countries only. The

data in the first set of columns of these tables show that, in 1973, 37 of 63 countries,

including 26 of the 42 developing countries, had capital account indicators equal to the mid-

range (2) or lower. The overall trend towards greater capital account liberalization is

7
 Two people separately assigned scores based on their readings of the narrative descriptions
and then these scores were checked for discrepancies.
8
  Quinn also scores the intensity of controls for four categories related to current account
restrictions and a category he calls international legal agreements.



                                                 7
reflected in the fact that, from 1973 to 1988, the total number of countries with capital

account indicators equal to 2 or lower decreased to 33. But this overall trend hides significant

heterogeneity: over the same period the number of developing countries with a score of 2 or

lower actually increased to 32.

       As discussed in more detail below, Quinn (1997) uses the change in the value of the

indicator of capital account restrictions rather than its level in his growth regressions

(Table 1, row 4). The last three columns of each of the two panels in Table 3 uncover

interesting patterns in the churning of the capital account liberalization experience. While

most OECD countries (18 out of 21) increased their degree of liberalization between 1973

and 1988, the developing countries were almost equally split between those that increased it

(15 countries), reduced it (12), or kept it unchanged (15). Note also that by the end of the

1980s, developing countries had converged towards an intermediate level of liberalization;

developing countries that had a relatively low level of liberalization in 1973 tended toward an

increase in this measure while the opposite held for those developing countries with a

relatively high degree of liberalization in 1973.

       Quinn’s capital account restriction indicators are meant to be used as cardinal

numbers and, therefore, there is the implication that a country in category 2 is literally twice

as unfettered as one in category 1, or a change in the value of the indicator of 1 is exactly

twice the amount of liberalization as a change in the indicator of 0.5. A less structured

approach for using Quinn’s indicators in regressions would involve the creation of dummy

variables representing each of the values of the indicators. Alternatively, one might decide to

generate fewer dummy variables, say a single dummy variable that takes the value 1 when

Quinn’s indicator takes the value 0.5, 1, or 1.5. In the extreme, one may wonder how to


                                                8
convert Quinn’s measure into a (0,1) dummy, i.e. how to identify which value of Quinn’s

scale would correspond to a threshold for classifying countries as open or closed.

       Table 4 suggests that the correspondence between Quinn’s multiple-measures and the

0/1 AREAER measures is approximately achieved if one chooses a threshold of 2 in Quinn’s

scale. Each of the six panels in this Table offers a tabulation of the number of countries that

have capital accounts classified as 0 (closed) or 1 (open) by the AREAER and are given

values of capital account restrictions of 0–2 (more closed) or 3–4 (more open) by Quinn.

There are three panels for the full sample and three for developing countries, with one pair

for each of the more recent years for which Quinn has data for all countries, 1973, 1982, and

1988. A high correspondence between the AREAER and Quinn measures would be reflected

in relatively large diagonal elements of the 2 x 2 matrix and relatively small off-diagonal

elements. In fact, over 80 percent of the countries in the full sample and over 90 percent of

the countries for the developing countries sample fall into one of the diagonal cells for each

of the three years. For the full sample, there are few cases where the AREAER indicates open

capital accounts while Quinn indicates closed capital accounts (that is, it is rare to find a

relatively large number in the upper right cell of the 2 x 2 matrix). Most of the discrepancies

between the two indicators are cases where the AREAER indicates closed capital accounts

and Quinn gives a value of 2.5, 3, 3.5, or 4. A more detailed presentation would show that

almost all the cases of non-zero entries in the lower-left cell represent a value of 2.5 or 3

assigned by Quinn. Thus, there seems to be quite a high correspondence between Quinn’s

measures and those of the AREAER, when one chooses a threshold of 2 in Quinn’s scale in

order to classify a country’s capital account as closed or open. The relevant question is




                                                9
whether the gradations presented by Quinn offer significant information, a point we return to

below.



Other On/Off Measures

OECD Code of Liberalization of Capital Movements

         An alternative measure of capital account liberalization, albeit one available only for

OECD member countries is provided in various issues of the Code of Liberalization of

Capital Movements published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and

Development (OECD) about every other year (Table 1, row 5).9 Each volume of the Code of

Liberalization of Capital Movements offers data on the extent to which restrictions

contemporaneously apply on a range of types of international transactions including direct

investment, liquidation of direct investment, admission of securities to capital markets,

buying and selling of securities, buying and selling of collective investment securities,

operations in real estate, financial credits and loans, personal capital movements. The OECD

also specifies whether the restrictions apply to commercial banks and other credit

institutions, and to institutional investors.

         In all, the Code of Liberalization of Capital Movements reports on whether or not

there are restrictions on eleven categories of capital account transactions. Klein and Olivei

(2001) construct a variable that represents the proportion of these eleven categories that are

free of restrictions, averaged over time. Thus, this variable (like the Share variable described

 Between 1986 and 1985, these volumes were published in March 1986, March 1988,
November 1990, June 1993, and 1995.




                                                10
above) potentially ranges from 0 to 1 over the sample period but (unlike Share) its value for

any one country in any year can take a value between 0 and 1 in increments of 1/11. For the

period 1986 to 1995, the four largest values for this variable are 0.89 (Germany), 0.92

(United States), 0.921 (Netherlands) and 0.93 (United Kingdom) while two countries have

values below one-half, Greece (0.49) and Portugal (0.43). The correlation between this

measure and the IMF Share measure using the single annual 0/1 measures drawn from

AREAER is 0.86.



Montiel-Reinhart Intensity Measure

         Montiel and Reinhart in a series of paper develop and use an alternative measure of

intensity of controls on international transactions based on annual information for 15

countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Egypt,

Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Uganda) for the

period 1990–1996.10 This indicator ranges from 0 to 2 and, unlike the measures previously

discussed, a higher number represents a stronger capital account restrictions. In particular, a

value of 0 for a particular country in a particular year represents a situation where “no

restrictions or taxes were imposed on capital inflows and no restrictions on the domestic

indebtedness of domestic financial institutions were in place that appeared to be in excess of

commonly used prudential measure.”11 A value of 1 represents restrictions that take the form


10
     See for example, Montiel, 1996; Reinhart and Reinhart 1998; Montiel and Reinhart, 1999.

                                               11
of “overzealous prudential regulations (such as strict limits on the foreign exchange exposure

of banks)” while a value of 2 indicates “the existence of explicit measures, such as

prohibitions, deposit requirements, or financial transaction taxes, designed to limit capital

flows.” (Table 1, row 6) The choice of assigning a value of 0, 1, or 2 for a particular country

in a particular year is based upon information provided in the annual report of that country’s

central bank.

       Each of the 15 countries in their sample begins with a value of 0 for the capital

control proxy in 1990. Ten countries retain a value of 0 throughout the 1990–1996 period and

five countries end the period with a value of 2. More to the point for this discussion, the only

instance of an intermediate value of 1 is for Colombia in 1991 and 1992, after which it

switches to 2 for 1993–1996. Thus, their effort to distinguish between the intensity of capital

controls does not really yield many cases where “mild” capital controls are in place. In

particular, were these data used to construct “shares” over the 1990–1996, there would be

little difference between using the range of values 0, 1, and 2 or using only 0 and 1.12



Stock Market Liberalization Indicators

       Several papers have focused on the liberalization of controls on the international sale

or purchase of equities. Research in this area has typically focused on dating the opening of

equity markets to foreign investors. Levine and Zervos (1998) and Henry (2000a, 2000b),

who extended this work, have compiled dates from a variety of sources including The Wilson


12
 Montiel and Reinhart also provide a “sterilization index” which is scored 0, 1, or 2 and
which has many more cases of intermediate values than does the capital control proxy.




                                               12
Directory of Emerging Market Funds, IFC Investable Indexes, various issues of The

Economist Intelligence Unit and the IMF’s AREAER. For instance, for each of the 11

countries in his sample, Henry uses the dates reflecting official policy decrees as the first date

in which a country fund is available, or a 10-percentage point jump in the IFC Investable

Index (Table 1, row 7).13

       Bekaert (1995) and Bekaert and Harvey (1995) also determine dates when equity

markets in emerging economies opened to foreign investors based upon a variety of

indicators including Official Liberalization Dates, the date of introduction of American

Depository Receipts (ADR), the date of the introduction of country funds, and a date

estimated through a regime-switching model based on the time series of net U.S. capital

flows (see Table 1 in Bekaert and Harvey, 2000). The number of countries covered is

extended in a paper by these two authors and Lundblad (2001) to 95 countries, 16 of which

had liberalized stock markets over the full period 1980 to 1997 and 27 of which had some

experience with stock market liberalizations over this period. (See their Appendix Table A1;

these dates are referred to in our Table 1, row 8).

       Table 5 presents the dates of “Official International Financial Liberalization” for the

30 countries classified as either emerging markets or frontier markets by the International

Finance Corporation, as reported by Bekaert, Harvey, and Lundblad (2001). Note that, in

comparing the entries in this table with the entries in Table 2, only Indonesia and Malaysia

had both equity market liberalization and capital account liberalization (as reported by the

IMF in the AREAER) and, equity market liberalization followed capital account liberalization

for both of these countries.

       A recent study by Edison and Warnock (2001) provides a new measure of restrictions

on foreign ownership of domestic equities, which shows the intensity of controls at a point in

time as well as their evolution over time. The measure, discussed in full details in their article

and used in cross-sectional work of Ahearne, Griever, and Warnock (2000), builds on the

work of the International Finance Corporation. In particular, for emerging market countries,

the IFC publishes two indexes of equity prices, the Global (IFCG) and Investable (IFCI)

indexes. Since the IFCI index is comprised of IFCG stocks minus the portion not available to

foreigners, the ratio of the market capitalizations of the IFCI to IFCG indexes is a measure of

the availability of a country’s stocks to foreigners, and one minus the ratio is a measure of

foreign ownership restrictions (Table 1, Row 9). This measure can be seen as an extension of

the liberalization analysis of Bekaert and Harvey (2000) and Henry (2000a). Indeed, the

initial relaxation of controls shown by the Edison-Warnock measure corresponds quite well

with the Bekaert-Harvey liberalization date.14 This new measure provides additional

information, giving an indication of the extent of the liberalization and its evolution over

time. It shows that international financial liberalizations can be gradual—a point also made in

  The liberalization dates in Henry (2000a) are somewhat earlier for some emerging markets,
primarily those for which country funds existed in the mid-1980s.

Bekaert and Harvey (1995)—which would argue against the use of an event study approach

or structural break analysis.



                                  B. Quantitative Measures

       An alternative to the practice discussed above, of constructing indicators from

published regulations, is to derive quantitative measures of the limits placed on capital

account transactions from the values of economic variables. There are three different sets of

variables that researchers have considered in this vein: national savings rates paired with

national investment rates, interest rate differentials, and international capital flows. While, at

first blush, it may seem preferable to use actual performance rather than published

regulations in order to gauge the restrictiveness of capital controls, we will see that, as with

rules-based measures, there are conceptual and practical challenges associated with the use of

these quantitative measures.

       To the best of our knowledge, neither a comparison of national savings rates with

national investment rates nor interest rate differentials has been used in studying the effects

of capital account liberalization on long-run economic growth. There have been some recent

efforts to use actual capital flows to estimate the effects of capital account restrictiveness on

growth. Despite the limited use of these measures in analyzing the links between capital

account liberalization and growth, we discuss each of these three sets of measures since they

have been used to gauge the extent of capital account restrictions across countries and across

time periods.




                                                15
        Feldstein and Horioka (1980) published a study that was quite influential due, in part,

to the fact that it was one of the first efforts to quantitatively measure the extent of capital

mobility across a broad range of countries. They analyzed the behavior of savings and

investment in a number of countries to measure the “true” degree of capital mobility, arguing

that the degree of correlation between the two series was a good indicator of impediments to

capital movements. In any particular year, savings matches investment in a country with

stringent capital account restrictions while there need not be a link between savings and

investment in a country with free capital mobility. Feldstein and Horioka found that, over the

period 1960–1974, as well as over the three five-year sub-periods making up this 15-year

period, average savings rates and average investment rates were highly positively correlated.

Based on this finding, they concluded that there were significant impediments to capital

movements.15

        But this conclusion has been criticized since the savings and investment rates of a

country may be highly correlated, even if that country has no restrictions on international

capital flows. For example, Obstfeld (1986) shows that, even with perfect capital mobility,

savings and investment may be highly correlated just because of the types of shocks hitting

an economy. Obstfeld also demonstrated that the savings–investment correlations were

higher for large countries than for small countries, a result one would expect to find if there

was free capital mobility and outcomes in large countries influenced worldwide economic

conditions. Furthermore, Obstfeld documents a reduction in savings-investment correlations

15
  Montiel (1996) used the Feldstein-Horioka method to assess capital mobility by using
results of the industrial countries as a benchmark to assess the degree of capital mobility for
emerging markets.



                                                16
in the post-1973 period. A different criticism of Feldstein and Horioka’s conclusions

concerning the extent of capital mobility based on savings–investment correlations comes

from Bayoumi (1990) who shows that this correlation may just reflect efforts by

governments to target the current account.

       Another set of quantitative measures of capital mobility includes onshore-offshore

interest rate differentials and deviations from covered interest rate parity. Unlike stock

market returns or other quantitative measures, short-term interest rates can be analyzed

without first transforming them in model-specific ways. However, data availability restricts

this method to a limited number of countries.

       Recently, efforts have been made to gauge the extent of capital mobility through the

use of actual capital inflows and outflows, either as a percentage of GDP (Kraay 1998) or, as

in Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (forthcoming), by using an annual measure of portfolio and direct

investment assets and liabilities as a percent of GDP as a long-run indicator of financial

openness (see IMF, 2001, Chanda, 2001, and O’Donnell, 2001). These measures are

analogous to measures of trade openness, and can be thought of in a similar manner. For

example, like the level of trade openness, which is typically calculated as the sum of imports

and exports over GDP, the Lane and Milesi-Ferretti measure is a good indicator of openness

at a point in time. But both the Lane and Milesi-Ferretti measure, and that of Kraay, may

fluctuate from year-to-year since capital flows are endogenous and there can be large

valuation adjustments due to, say, a large swing in equity values (Eichengreen 2001).

However, changes in these measures over longer periods are likely to be indicative of

changes in openness. In the subsequent section, this stock measure will be referred to as the

openness measure.

      C. Comparisons of Rules-Based and Quantitative Measures of Capital Account

                                         Liberalization16

          We would hope to find that a measure of capital account restrictiveness based on

published regulations and rules is correlated with one that reflects the actual behavior of

capital flows. Figure 1 offers some evidence that enables us to judge the correspondence

between these two types of measures. This figure includes the time series of a rule-based

measure, related to the restrictions on capital flows as reported to the IMF by national

authorities, as well as a measure of capital account openness based on the estimated stocks of

gross foreign assets and liabilities as a ratio of GDP.

          Figure 1 shows that both the rules-based and the quantitative measures indicate that

capital accounts in industrial countries have become considerably less restricted over time. A

particularly rapid decline in controls occurred during the 1980s, when the members of the

European Community (now called the European Union) liberalized capital controls.

Following this, there was a dramatic rise in cross-border capital flows. Among industrial

countries, Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom appear to have the

most unfettered international capital flows, based on the estimated stocks of gross foreign

assets and liabilities as a percent of national income.

          In developing countries, the story is more complex. In general, both measures suggest

a less dramatic shift toward liberalization and openness than in industrial countries. For the

developing countries as a whole, the rules-based restriction measure suggests that, after a

period of liberalization in the 1970s, the trend toward openness reversed in the 1980s.

16
     Parts of this section are adapted from the World Economic Outlook, October 2001.



                                                18
Liberalization resumed in the early 1990s, but the pace has been relatively slow; the rules-

based measure indicates that the current level of the indicator on average is only at the same

level as it was in the late 1970s. By comparison, the capital account openness measure based

on the estimated stocks of gross foreign assets and liabilities as a ratio of GDP shows a

modest decline in openness to capital flows during the early 1970s, followed by a moderate

increase in the 1980s, which accelerated sharply in the early 1990s.



                          D. Efficacy of Capital Account Controls

       Some of the rules-based indicators discussed above attempt to distinguish between

the intensity with which capital account restrictions are imposed. But rules-based measures

focus on de jure restrictions rather than the de facto efficacy of controls. Obviously, it is

easier to determine whether laws controlling capital flows are on the books than whether

these laws are enforced or, if they are enforced, whether they effectively stem the flow of

capital that would otherwise be moving into or out of a country.

       Various episodes suggest that capital controls have, at best, a temporary effect on

stemming capital inflows or outflows. For example, Spain attempted to use capital controls to

shield itself from the disruptions in the European Monetary System in September 1992 but

the peseta was devalued in November anyway. Capital controls on inflows in Colombia

(1993–1998) and Brazil (1993–1997) did not prevent the continued appreciation of their

currencies. In Brazil, the presence of sophisticated financial institutions enabled people to get

around controls. Likewise, the much-heralded controls on capital inflows to Chile, which

took the form of unremunerated reserve requirements (URR), lost their effectiveness as

people found loopholes that enabled them to avoid these regulations. Capital controls in


                                                19
Thailand and Malaysia may have altered the maturity structure of capital inflows, though

capital controls did not insulate the Thai baht from the consequences of speculative pressures

in 1997.17

       If, in fact, capital controls are generally ridden with holes and are not efficacious,

then we would not expect to find a strong link between capital account liberalization and any

measures of economic performance, all else equal. We next turn to a review of empirical

analyses of whether or not capital account liberalization is significantly associated with

economic growth.



     II. REVIEW OF LITERATURE ON CAPITAL ACCOUNT LIBERALIZATION AND GROWTH

       Economic theory suggests a number of benefits that may accompany capital account

liberalization. Open capital accounts can foster a more efficient allocation of resources,

provide opportunities for risk diversification and help promote financial development. But

there is also a good deal of skepticism concerning the benefits of capital mobility.

       While analysis of the costs of capital account liberalization have been limited, there is

a large and growing literature that tests the potential benefits of capital account liberalization

through its influence on long-run growth and development, by directly investigating the

empirical relationship between capital account liberalization and economic growth. Almost


17
  Efforts to quantify the effects of capital controls include Giavazzi and Giovannini (1989)
who looked at EMS members in the 1980s, and Edwards (1999) and De Gregorio, Edwards,
and Valdes (2000) who considered the effects of Chile’s unremunerated reserve
requirements. More recently Edison and Reinhart (2001) and Kaplan and Rodrik (2001) have
examined the effectiveness of Malaysian capital controls, which were applied during the
Asian financial crisis.




                                                20
all of these studies augment a basic growth model that includes variables such as the level of

schooling, investment, population growth, and the level of GDP in the initial year with a

measure of capital account liberalization.

       Table 6 presents an overview of these studies of the effects of capital account

liberalization on growth. Each row of this table presents information on one study. The

columns of the table offer information on the country coverage, the indicator of

liberalization, the estimation techniques and the general result of the studies.

       The information presented in Table 6 indicates that there is a wide divergence in

results across studies. This may reflect a number of differences in these studies. First, the

country coverage is different across studies, with some authors analyzing industrial countries,

others developing countries, and others a mixture of the two. Second, there are differences in

the sample period, which may be particularly important for developing countries given the

recent nature of many capital account liberalizations. Third, the applied methodology (cross-

sectional, time series, or panel) and the estimation technique (ordinary least squares,

instrumental variables, or generalized method of moments) differ across studies.

       In addition to particular differences across studies, there are some general drawbacks

with the literature that analyzes the relationship between liberalization and growth. As noted

in the previous section, rules-based measures of capital account controls and liberalization

used in the bulk of these studies are relatively crude. However, it should be noted that the

previous section has also shown that various measures offer a broadly consistent picture of

the time series and cross sectional behavior of capital account liberalization. On a more

conceptual note, while capital account liberalization is often treated as exogenous to the

growth process, in practice countries with particular growth experiences or at particular


                                               21
levels of development may be more prone to liberalize their capital accounts, implying the

potential for reverse causality.18 But the authors of many of these studies recognize this

potential shortcoming and attempt to address it through the use of instrumental variable

estimation.

       We next survey these studies in more detail, beginning with work that offers support

for the hypothesis that capital account liberalization promotes economic growth, and then

turning to studies that cast some doubt on this relationship.



         A. Supporting Evidence of Capital Account Liberalization on Growth

       Quinn (1997) is one of the first studies to identify a positive result between capital

account liberalization and growth. Quinn augments the set of variables included in a standard

growth regression with either a variable representing his indicator of the change in financial

openness (described above) or the change in a broader measure of openness.19 The change in

the financial openness variable and the change in the broader openness variable are

calculated by subtracting the 1958 value of the index from its 1988 value. Quinn’s empirical

estimates suggest that the change in capital account liberalization has a strongly significant

effect on the growth in real GDP per capita in his cross section of 58 countries over the

period 1960 to 1989. It is hard to disentangle the separate effects of financial openness and a


18
  For example, a country with weak economic performance might choose to adopt capital
controls and there is a danger in such a case to interpret incorrectly that the country’s low
growth depends on those controls.
19
  The base regression includes also initial GDP per capita, investment as a share of GDP,
population growth and secondary-school enrollment rates.




                                               22
broader measure of openness in Quinn’s results because he does not include a regression with

both of these indicators and, therefore, to the extent that the change in financial openness is

correlated with the change in the openness of trade in goods and services, the finding of a

significant effect of the change in capital account liberalization on growth may reflect the

correlation of changes in restrictions on the capital account and the current account.

       Klein and Olivei (2000) find a positive effect of capital account liberalization on

growth among industrial countries, but they do not find evidence that capital account

liberalization promotes growth in non-industrial countries. This study follows a slightly

different strategy from other research in this area by first focusing on the role of capital

account liberalization on financial development and then considering the effect of financial

development on growth. Klein and Olivei regress the capital account liberalization indicator

Share described above (along with other standard regressors) on the change in financial

depth over the period 1986 to 1995. They find a significant effect of capital account

liberalization on the change in financial depth in the cross section of 82 developed and

developing nations. This significant result seems to be due to the presence of the OECD

countries in the sample. Klein and Olivei show that capital account liberalization

significantly affects the change in financial depth in a sample consisting of the 20 OECD

countries, but not in a sample of the non-OECD countries, nor in a narrower non-OECD

sample of 18 Latin American countries, a group that had a relatively high incidence of capital

account liberalizations. They also estimate a growth model that includes the change in

financial depth as regressor and find that financial development is significant determinant of

growth per capita. Klein and Olivei conclude that the beneficial effects of capital account

liberalization, at least with respect to promoting financial depth, are achieved only in an


                                                23
environment in which there is a constellation of other institutions that can usefully support

the changes brought about by the free flow of capital. Bailliu (2000) also finds that capital

account liberalization spurs growth by promoting financial development.

       This conjecture, that the growth effects of capital account liberalization depend upon

the level of development of an economy, is supported by the results presented in Edwards

(2001). Edwards finds that both the Quinn level and the ∆Quinn variables are significantly

associated with growth in per capita income in the 1980s for a sample of about 60 countries,

though his results are not robust when he instead uses Share. Edwards estimates regressions

using weighted least squares, with the weights representing national income in 1985. He

includes both the capital account liberalization variables and an interactive term representing

the product of the variables and the logarithm of income per capita in 1980. His estimates

show a negative coefficient on capital account openness and a positive coefficient on the

openness-income interactive term. This suggests that capital account openness detracts from

growth for countries at lower levels of income but promotes growth in industrial countries

and in the richer emerging market countries.

       Edwards’ methodology is scrutinized in Arteta, Eichengreen, and Wyplosz (2001).

They question why Edwards obtains such strong results while other studies (cited below) fail

to find any significant effect of capital account liberalization on growth. They point to a

number of potential reasons for this discrepancy. They question whether Quinn’s measures,

representing capital account openness in 1973 and 1988 only, is appropriate for the period

Edwards studies. They also note that weighting observations by 1985 per capita GDP means

that rich countries have much more influence in the regressions than do poor countries. There

are also questions raised concerning the exogeneity of instruments used for capital account


                                               24
liberalization and the exclusion of other potentially relevant measures of openness, such as

the openness of the current account, which may be correlated with capital account openness.

Estimates by Arteta, Eichengreen, and Wyplosz suggest that Edwards’ results may be

sensitive to a variety of factors and, therefore, they conclude that there is little evidence that

capital account liberalization has more favorable effects in high-income and middle-income

countries than in poorer developing countries.

        But Arteta, Eichengreen, and Wyplosz do find some support for differences in the

effect of capital account liberalization across countries, depending upon the degree of

macroeconomic stability. They introduce two capital account interaction terms, multiplying

the Quinn openness measure by both the Sachs-Warner (1995) openness measure and the

black-market premium. They find that the interaction term representing the product of capital

account openness and the black market premium is significant but the other interaction term,

representing the product of the Sachs-Warner openness measure and capital account

openness, is not significant. They interpret this to mean that countries that open their capital

accounts grow faster, but only if they first eliminate the black market premium.

        Bekaert, Harvey, and Lundblad (2001) (henceforth BHL) examine the impact of stock

market liberalization on economic growth. As previous researchers have done, they begin

their analysis by augmenting the standard set of growth model variables with their variable

indicating stock market liberalization. To maximize the time-series content in their

regression, they use a moving average panel data method. This means that they create

overlapping data and therefore have to deal with the resulting moving average error

component by adjusting their standard errors. In general, BHL find that financial

liberalization leads to a 1 percent increase in annual per capital GDP growth over a five-year


                                                25
period and that this effect is statistically significant. BHL investigate the robustness of this

result with respect to alternative sets of liberalization dates, different country groupings, and

different time horizons for measuring economic growth. These results, along with those of

Quinn, appear to be the strongest evidence supporting the hypothesis that capital account

liberalization promotes growth among developing countries.

       Following a slightly different tact, O’Donnell (2001) examines the impact of capital

account liberalization using both IMF rules-based measure and a quantitative based measure

of financial openness. Using a rather standard setup, he finds that the rules-based measure

tends to be too coarse an indicator of the degree of capital account liberalization as it does

not take account the nature of different types of controls. However, using the quantitative

measure, he finds that capital account liberalization does seem to speed up economic growth.

However, like other researchers he finds that the benefits to all countries are not equal. This

difference in impact was also echoed in Chanda (2001). He suggests that the impact may

vary with the level of ethnic and linguistic heterogeneity in the society, a proxy for the

number of interest groups. In particular, he finds that capital controls lead to greater

inefficiencies and lower growth among countries with a high degree of ethnic and linguistic

heterogeneity.



    B. Studies Not Supporting the Hypothesis that Liberalization Promotes Growth

       Several studies have found no correlation between openness and growth. In fact, one

of the first efforts to determine whether capital account liberalization promotes growth using

a cross-section of countries was Grilli and Milesi-Ferretti (1995), although this was not the

main focus of their paper. This study considers average growth of per capita income for five


                                                26
nonoverlapping five-year periods between 1966 and 1989. Their sample includes 61

countries although, with 181 observations in one set of regressions and 238 in another, not

every country appears in each of the five sub-periods. They regress five-year growth rates on

Share and comparable measures that capture the presence of current account controls

(CurrAcct) and a multiple exchange rate system (MultEx) from Exchange Arrangements and

Exchange Restrictions. In addition they include variables such as initial income, political

variables and the level of schooling. The three variables Share, CurrAcct, and MultEx enter

as predicted values from instrumental variable regressions using lagged values as the

instruments. Their results do not support the hypothesis that capital account liberalization

promotes growth. In some cases, capital account controls enter with a positive sign (that is,

Share enters negatively) while the indicator of current account controls sometime enters with

a negative sign (CurrAcct is positive).20

          Rodrik (1998), in a widely cited paper, also casts doubt on the effect of capital

account liberalization on growth. In a sample that includes almost 100 countries, developing

as well as developed, he finds no significant effect of capital account liberalization, as

measured by Share, on the percentage change in real income per capita over the period 1975

to 1989 in growth regressions that also include initial per capita income, initial secondary-

school enrollment rate, an index of the quality of governmental institutions and regional

dummy variables. Likewise, he finds no relationship between capital account liberalization

and investment-to-income, nor between capital account liberalization and inflation.

Eichengreen (2001) offers several possible reasons for the differences in the results between

20
     See their Table 4, p. 537.



                                                 27
the Quinn and Rodrik papers, including the fact that Quinn’s sample includes fewer

developing countries than Rodrik, the smaller proportion of years in Quinn’s study

representing the “lost decade” of the 1980s and differences in the capital account indicator.

The regressions presented in the next section allow us to explore the role of these potential

sources of the differences in the two studies.

       Kraay (1998) also finds no significant relationship, using a variety of measures of

capital account openness, including Share, Quinn’s capital account openness indicator (in

levels, with values from 0 to 4), and a measure based on actual net capital flows. Each of

these measures is associated with a different sample size. His regressions take the form of

cross sections, with one observation per country, where the dependent variable is the growth

in output between 1985 and 1997. He uses both OLS and an approach in which the capital

account liberalization variables are instrumented by their own past values. He fails to find a

significant effect of Share or the Quinn indicator on growth, but, when these indicators are

interacted with the average balance of the financial account (from the balance of payments

statistics), he does find some significant effects.




                               III. EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION

       The literature reviewed in the previous section offers a diverse set of results

concerning the effect of capital account liberalization on growth. In this section, in an effort

to reconcile some of the differences in the literature, we estimate the effects of a variety of

measures of capital account liberalization on economic growth. We present estimates of




                                                 28
growth regressions that augment a standard economic growth model21 with different

indicators of capital account openness or stock market liberalization, but otherwise use a

common set of regressors, a common regressand, and draw observations from the same time

period.22 For comparability, we use a single dataset, the Klein and Olivei (2000).



A. The Basic Growth Model and the Impact of Capital Account Liberalizaton

         The regressand in all of the estimates presented in this section is the growth in real

per capita income over the period 1976 to 1995 (∆lnY76 – 95). The control variables used in

the growth model include the logarithm of real per capita income in 1976 (ln (Y1976)), the

logarithm of secondary school enrollment rate in 1976 (ln(Educ.)), the average investment to

GDP ratio for the years 1974 to 1978 (Invest.74 – 78), the population growth rate from 1976 to

1995 (∆Pop.76 – 95) and a dummy variable for countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Africa).

Column 1 of Table 7 shows the results of a growth regression using these regressors for a

sample of 89 countries. Each of the coefficients in the regression are significant at the 95

percent level of confidence or better, but for the coefficient on the average investment to

GDP ratio.

         We use three different indicators of capital account liberalization. First, as discussed

in Section II, Share76 – 95 represents the proportion of years in the period 1976 to 1995 that a

country had open capital accounts, based on information from line E.2 of the IMF’s Annual

21
     See for example Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1995) and Levine and Renelt (1992).
22
  There remain, however, differences in the samples across regressions due to differences in
the set of countries covered by each indicator of capital market openness. Below we discuss
the sensitivity of results to the use of different samples of countries.



                                                29
Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions. Second, we use the 0 to 4

measure of capital account openness in 1982 from Quinn (1997), which we denote as

Quinn82. As discussed above, Quinn used the change in the value of his indicator and,

therefore, we also present a regression in which we use the difference in the value of the 0 to

4 measure of capital account openness between 1973 and 1988, ∆Quinn73 – 88.23 Third, we

use the dates of stock market liberalization from Bekaert, Harvey and Lundblad (2001) to

calculate the proportion of years between 1980 (when the data are first available) and 1995

that a country had a liberalized stock market. This variable, BHL80–95, is therefore analogous

in its construction to Share76-95.

        Columns 2 through 5 of Table 7 present growth regressions in which the standard

growth model presented in Column 1 is augmented with, in turn, each of these indicators of

capital account liberalization. The results in this column generally support the hypothesis

that liberalization of the capital account or of the equity market promotes growth, ceteris

paribus. The coefficients on Share76 – 95, Quinn82, and BHL80 – 95 each have a p-value of less

than 0.01. The coefficient on ∆Quinn73 – 88 is positive but insignificant (the p-value is 0.50), a

result at odds with those presented in Quinn (1997) in which the estimated coefficient on the

change in the capital account openness measure is positive and significant.24



23
  Recall that Quinn’s measure of capital account openness is available only for the years
1973, 1982 and 1988 for non-OECD countries.
24
  In a regression that differs from the one presented in Column 3 only by the use of the Quinn
indicator of capital account openness in 1973 rather than its value in 1982, the coefficient on
the Quinn 0 – 4 indicator of capital account openness has a value of 0.09 with an associated
p-value of 0.08. We have also run regressions similar to the one presented in Column 4 but
with the difference in the Quinn indicator of capital account openness between 1982 and
                                                                                  (continued…)

                                               30
         A question that arises when considering the results in Columns 2 through 5 of Table

7 is whether there is an upward bias on the coefficients on liberalization because of reverse

causality; perhaps the countries that are most likely to have liberalized their capital accounts

are the ones that grew most quickly during the relevant period. To address this question, we

present, in Columns 6 through 8 of Table 7, two-stage regressions that instrument for the

values of the liberalization measures. The instruments that we use include government

consumption as proportion of GDP in 1976, imports as proportion of GDP in 1976, a dummy

variable for Latin American countries and another dummy variable for East Asian countries.

In addition, for Share76 – 95 and for BHL 80– 95 we use, as an instrument, the 0 or 1 value of the

capital account openness measure for 1973 from the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange

Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions while for the Quinn 0 to 4 measure of capital

account openness in 1982 we use, as an instrument, the 1973 value of Quinn’s openness

measure.

       The results presented in Columns 6 through 8 of Table 7 indicate that, in all three

cases, there is not an upward bias on the liberalization measures coefficients when we use

OLS estimation since, in each case, the coefficient is larger using instrumental variables than

when using OLS. Each of the liberalization coefficients presented in Columns 6 through 8 is

significant at the 99 percent level of confidence or better. The adjusted R2 for the first stage

regression (which is not reported in the table) is 0.61 for Share76 – 95, 0.69 for Quinn82, and

0.59 for BHL80 – 95.


1988, as well as between 1973 and 1982. The coefficients on the change in the capital
account indicator in these regressions are not significant at standard levels.




                                                31
       The results of a formal test concerning the possible endogeneity of the capital account

openness variables are presented in Table 7 in the row labeled “DM p-value.” The statistics

in this row are obtained using the artificial regression technique discussed in Davidson and

MacKinnon (1989).25 As shown in this row, the p-values on the coefficients on the

instrumented regressors are 0.13 in the regression using Share76 – 95, 0.52 in the regression

using Quinn82, and 0.01 in the regression using BHL80 – 95. Therefore, estimates using OLS

are not plagued by a significant (at the 10 percent level) problem with respect to consistency

because of the endogeneity of the capital account openness variables in the regressions using

either Share76 – 95, or Quinn82. There is evidence, however, that supports the use of

instrumental variables in the regression using BHL80 – 95. In the remainder of this section, we

present results of the Davidson and MacKinnon test for all regressions and, where

appropriate as indicated by this test, we estimate the regressions using instrumental variables

rather than OLS.26




25
   The “artificial regression” is one in which the OLS regression is augmented with the
instrumented values of the potentially endogenous variable. Under the null hypothesis that
the OLS estimates of the coefficients of the regression are consistent (and assuming that the
instrumental variable estimates are consistent), the coefficient on the instrumented regressor
is asymptotically equal to zero. Therefore, if the coefficient on the instrumented variable in
the augmented artificial regression is insignificant, we cannot reject the hypothesis that OLS
provides us with consistent estimators. We employ this test and report the p-value of the
coefficient on the instrumented regressor in the row labeled “DM p-value” in Table 7.
26
  In the regressions reported in Tables 8 and 9 there are several capital account openness
variables in each regression since we allow for different coefficients across regions. In these
cases, the DM test is an F-test of the joint significance of all the capital account openness
variables used in the regression.



                                               32
B. The Robustness of the Results

       An issue that arises in the literature surveyed above is whether the effect of capital

account liberalization differs between industrial counties and developing countries. We

investigate this in Columns 1 through 3 of Table 8 by reporting separate slope coefficients

for industrial and developing countries (countries are classified as industrial if they were

members of the O.E.C.D. in 1986).27 These results show that the estimated effect on

economic growth of capital account openness or stock market liberalization is larger in

developing countries than in industrial countries.28 For developing countries, coefficients on

both measures of capital account openness, Share76 – 95, and Quinn82, are significant at better

than the 99 percent level. In addition, the coefficient on Quinn82 for industrial countries is

also significant at better than the 99 percent level. The results for stock market liberalization,

estimated using instrumental variables, also indicate strongly significant effects for both

developing countries and industrial countries.

       All three regressions reported in Columns 1 through 3 of Table 8 show a significant

effect of capital account liberalization on growth among non–O.E.C.D. countries but differ in

the reported effect among O.E.C.D. countries. One possible source of this difference is the


27
   These results are obtained by including in the regressions both the measures of
liberalization and the product of the respective measure and a dummy variable that takes the
value of 1 for the 20 countries in the sample that were members of the O.E.C.D. in 1986.
These countries include Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,
Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
28
  There is a statistically significant difference (at the 92 percent level) between the estimated
coefficients for developing and industrial countries for BHL80 – 95, but not at the 90 percent
level for Share76 – 95, nor for Quinn82.




                                                 33
samples used in each regression. We ran regressions using Share76 – 95, allowing for different

effects across industrial and developing countries, using the subsamples employed when

using either Quinn82 or BHL80 – 95 as a regressor. The Quinn82 sample of 52 countries yields

estimates of the effect of capital account liberalization on growth of 0.17 for industrial

countries and 0.34 for developing countries, with associated p-values of 0.20 and 0.06,

respectively. These point estimates are both a bit smaller and somewhat less significant than

those obtained with the full sample of 89 countries. With the sample of 82 countries used in

the estimation of the effects of BHL80 – 95 on growth, the estimated effect of Share76 – 95 on

growth for industrial countries is 0.20 (with a p-value of 0.07) and for developing countries it

is 0.32 (with a p-value of 0.07). This suggests that differences across indicators due to

differences in samples necessitated by data availability are not pronounced.

       The discussion in Section II shows that the majority of cases of capital account

liberalization and stock market liberalization outside of the OECD occurred among countries

in Latin America and East Asia. Columns 4 through 6 of Table 8 continue our investigation

of differential effects of liberalization across sets of countries by allowing for separate slopes

across countries in Latin America, countries in East Asia, OECD member countries, and all

other countries. These estimates suggest that the largest and most significant effect of capital

account liberalization on growth occurred among East Asian countries. For each of the three

variables, the effect of liberalization on growth in East Asia is significant at greater than the

99 percent level of confidence. In other regions, there is less evidence of a significant effect

of capital account liberalization on growth. This effect is significant for the OECD countries

in this set of regressions only when using the Quinn82 indicator of capital account openness.




                                                34
Capital account liberalization is estimated to have a negative effect on growth among Latin

American countries when using the Share76 – 95 indicator.

       Differences in the effect of capital account liberalization on growth across the set of

industrial and developing countries are present in some of the research discussed in the

literature review above. But, in those papers, (such as Klein and Olivei (2000) and Edwards

(2001)), capital account liberalization is usually found to have a more significant effect in

promoting growth in industrial countries. The results of this paper, however, suggest that

open capital accounts and liberalized stock markets have a significant effect on growth

among East Asian countries, but there is less consistent evidence of these effects elsewhere,

even among industrial countries.

       One concern with the results presented in Tables 7 and 8 is that it is possible that

capital account liberalization is really just a proxy for some other characteristic of the

countries in the sample. Rodrik (1998) argues that capital account liberalization measures

serve as a proxy for the quality of government. We investigate this possibility in Table 9.

This specifications used in the regressions reported in this table differ from those used in

Table 8 only by the inclusion of a measure of government reputation. This measure, from

Knack and Keefer (1995), draws on information from various volumes of the International

Country Risk Guide. The variable potentially ranges from 1 to 10, with larger values

indicating that a government is less likely to repudiate contracts. For most countries, the

variable reflects reputation in 1982.

       The results in Table 9 support the importance of government reputation as a

determinant of growth but do not support the claim that capital account liberalization merely

serves as a proxy for government reputation. In each of the six regressions, the coefficient on


                                                35
government reputation is significant at better than the 99 percent level of confidence. While

it is true that the neither the coefficient on Quinn82 for industrial nor for developing countries

is significant in Column 2 (in contrast to the results presented in Table 8), and that the

coefficient on Share76 – 95 for developing countries has a p-value of 0.07 as compared to 0.01

when government reputation is not included as a regressor (Column 1 in each table), the

coefficient on BHL80 – 95 for developing countries reported in Column 3 as well as each of the

coefficients on the capital account openness or stock market liberalization variables for East

Asia in Columns 4 through 6 continue to be significant at better than the 99 percent level of

confidence.

       A careful comparison of Tables 8 and 9 shows that the introduction of the

government reputation variable reduces the number of observations in the regressions using

Share86 – 95 by about one-fifth, from 89 to 71. This is part of the reason for the differences in

the results concerning the coefficients on capital account liberalization in Columns 1 and 4

across these two tables. A regression with a specification like that in Column 1 of Table 8

that uses the sample of 71 countries that have non-missing values of the government

repudiation variable (i.e. the sample used in Columns 1 and 4 of Table 9) has estimated

coefficients of 0.17 (with a p-value of 0.09) for industrial countries and 0.34 (with a p-value

of 0.06) for developing countries. These point estimates are lower than those reported in

Column 1 of Table 8 and these coefficients are less significant in the more restricted sample.

When allowing for different estimates across regions of non–O.E.C.D. countries, the main

difference in the value and pattern of significance between the samples of 71 and 89

countries is that the former yields a significant effect of capital account liberalization on

growth for non–O.E.C.D. countries outside of Latin America and East Asia; the estimated


                                                36
coefficient on Share86 – 95 for this group of countries is 1.13, with a standard error of 0.47

(and therefore a p-value of 0.02). The pattern of significance of the effects of stock market

liberalization on growth presented in Column 6 of Table 8 do not change very much if we

restrict the sample to the 68 countries that have non-missing observations for both the

government reputation variable and BHL80 – 95. Therefore, the loss of significance of the

coefficient on BHL80 – 95 for non-O.E.C.D. countries outside of East Asia and Latin America

is likely due to the correlation of government reputation with BHL80 – 95 for these countries.

But note that the coefficient on the BHL80 – 95 for East Asian countries retains its significance

in the results presented in Column 6 of Table 9.



                                       IV.   CONCLUSION

       The consequences and desirability of capital account liberalization among developing

countries is likely to remain a topic of debate for the foreseeable future. People on one side

of this debate will maintain those countries that open up to financial flows will set the stage

for more rapid development. Those on the other side will question the advantages actually

conferred by capital account liberalization and, furthermore, will argue that countries become

more vulnerable to financial disruptions not of their own making when their governments

relinquish control over the inflow and outflow of capital.

       In this paper we have surveyed what current research is able to tell us about the

consequences of capital account liberalization. We point out that, while industrial countries

have largely liberalized their capital accounts, and there has been some movement towards

more widespread capital account liberalization among developing countries, the majority of

developing countries retain controls over capital flows. The evidence on the effects of this


                                                37
are somewhat mixed. We have shown that empirical evidence presented in existing research

does not strongly point towards a general result concerning the consequences of capital

account liberalization. There is mixed evidence that capital account liberalization promotes

long-run economic growth. Our own regression results suggest that these effects are most

pronounced among countries in East Asia. Other research surveyed in this paper, however,

suggests a more pronounced effect of capital account liberalization among industrial

countries than among a more broadly defined set of developing countries.

       Given the importance of this topic, the lack of a clear consensus in the literature, and,

perhaps most importantly, the fact that undertaking capital account liberalization is more

easily achieved than many other policies advocated to governments of developing countries,

it is very likely literature on the topic surveyed in this paper will continue to expand. The

concern that this research is hampered by a strong set of variables reflecting capital account

openness should be somewhat allayed by the statistics presented in this paper showing a

common cross-country picture of capital account openness regardless of the (admittedly

imperfect) indicators that are employed. But, as better indicators are developed, and as we

obtain a longer time series that encompasses a wider range of experiences, we would expect

that our understanding of this important topic will be refined.

         in 1976; ln(Educ.) = ln(secondary school enrollment rate); Invest.74 – 78 = Average Investment,
         1974 to 1978; ∆Pop.76 – 95 = Population growth, 1976 to 1995; Africa = Dummy variable for
         African countries; Share76 – 95 = Proportion of years with open capital accounts, 1976 to 1995,
         from IMF’s AREAER; Quinn82 = 0 to 4 measure of capital account openness in 1982 and
         ∆Quinn73 – 88 = Difference in 0 to 4 measure of capital account openness between 1973 and 1988,
         both from Quinn (1997); BHL80 – 95 = Proportion of years between 1980 and 1995 with liberalized
         stock market, using dates of stock market liberalization from Bekaert, Harvey and Lundblad
         (2001).
Instruments for Capital Account Liberalization Measures:
         Government consumption as proportion of GDP in 1976; Imports as proportion of GDP in 1976;
         Dummy variables for Latin American countries and East Asian countries; Quinn’s 0 to 4 measure
         of capital account openness in 1973 (for Quinn82) or IMF’s AREAER 0/1 value in 1973 (for
         Share76 – 95 and for BHL80 – 95).

Bold denotes p-value of coefficient 0.05 or less.
Italic denotes p-value of coefficient 0.05 to 0.10.

    The restriction measure is calculated as the "average" value of the on/off
measure for the country group. The openness measure is calculated as the
average
