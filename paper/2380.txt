   This paper analyzes ex—ante returns to forward speculation and asks
if these returns can be explained by models of a foreign exchange risk
premiumi After presenting evidence that both nominal and real epected
speculative profits are non—zero, the paper examines if real returns to
forward speculation are consistent with consumption—based models of risk
premia. Estimates of the conditional covariance between real speculative
returns and real consumption growth are presented and, like ex—ante
returns to forward speculation, they exhibit statistically significant
fluctuations over time and often change sign.

   It is by now widely accepted that forward exchange rates are not

unbiased predictors of future spot exchange rates and that therefore

there are predictable nonzero returns to forward speculation. Several

authors have pointed out that if forward speculation involves systematic

risk,   speculative   returns should be nonzero. This observation is consis-

tent with numerous theoretical models of a foreign exchange risk premium

that have appeared in the literature. However, implementing empirical

models of time—varying risk premia has proven to be very difficult in

general and previous attempts have not been successful in explaining

returns to forward speculation.1

   This paper analyzes ex—ante returns to forward speculation and seeks

to determine if these returns can be explained by models of a foreign

exchange risk premium. Mter providing measures of ex—ante returns to

forward speculation, the paper considers whether the returns are consis-

tent with risk neutrality of investors and arise only due to a

covariance between nominal speculative returns and the future purchasing




   Examples of unsuccessful attempts to model these ex—ante returns as
   a risk premium include Frankel (1982), who finds that in a portfolio
   balance model based on mean—variance optimization, the hypothesis of
   risk neutrality cannot be rejected, and Frankel and Engel (1984) who
   find that the data are inconsistent with the constraints implied by
   period—by—period   mean—variance   optimization. While Hansen and
   Hodrick (1983) are successful in modeling the risk premium in a
   CAPM—type model with an unobserved benchmark portfolio, Hodrick and
   Srivastava (1984) find that when more data are added, the con-
   straints implied by the model are rejected. Domowitz and Hakkio
   (1985) find that the data are not consistent with a risk premium
   that depends on the conditional variance of exchange rate forecast
   errors. Korajczyk (1985) meets with some success in modeling forward
   forecast errors as time—varying risk premia, but his tests assume
   that real exchange rate changes are unpredictable. This assumption
   is rejected by Cumby and Obstfeld (1984).

power of money.2 If this is the case, ex—ante real profits will be zero

even though ex—ante nominal profits are nonzero. Since the evidence is

found to be clearly inconsistent with the hypothesis of zero expected

real profits, the paper then examines if real returns to forward

speculation are consistent with consumption—based models of risk premia.

Tests such as those suggested by Hansen and Hodrick (1983) and Gibbons

and Ferson (1985) are considered first. These tests require that we

assume that the conditional covariances of real returns to forward

speculation and the rate of change of real consumption move together

over time for all currencies. The restrictions implied           by     the

consumption—based model and the proportionality of the conditional

covariances are rejected by the data. Next, estimates of these condi-

tional covariances are presented and the evidence shows that, like the

ex—ante returns to forward speculation, they exhibit statistically

significant fluctuations over time and often change sign. The comove—

cents of the estimated ex—ante returns to forward speculation and the

conditional covariances suggest that, on a qualitative level, ex—ante

returns behave in a way that is consistent with consumption—based models

of the foreign exchange risk premium. Importantly, a large decrease in

speculative returns in all currencies that is found in 1981 is accom-

panied by a similar change in the conditional covariances. The assump-

tion of proportional conditional covariances is also tested. A final set

of tests is carried out in which conditional covariances are allowed to

change over time and the results indicate that observed real speculative

returns cannot be explained fully by consumption—based models.

      Frenkel and Razin (1980) and Engel (1984) suggest that this may    be
      the case.

           II. Measuring Ex—Ante Returns to Forward Speculation

   In this section we discuss measuring ex—ante returns to forward

foreign exchange speculation and examine the behavior of these ex—ante

returns over time. Let S be the spot exchange rate for currency j at

time t and let Fk be the k—period forward exchange rate for currency .j

at time t. Both S and F,k are expressed as units of domestic currency

(dollars) per unit of foreign currency. An investor taking a long for-

ward position in the foreign currency at time t will buy the foreign

currency forward, agreeing to pay Fk dollars at time t+k for each unit

of currency i purchased. When the forward contract matures at t+k, the

investor sells the foreign currency in the spot market, receiving +k

dollars for each unit of foreign currency sold. It will prove useful in

the empirical work that follows to define a normalized return by divid-

ing the dollar return to a long forward position in currency j by S."

                  (S+k       Fk)/S
   The uncovered interest parity hypothesis states that expected profits

to forward speculation are zero. That is Et(rk) = 0, where Et(.)

denotes a conditional expectation given information available at time t.

Tests of uncovered interest parity can be carried out by noting that if

expected profits are zero, in a large sample realized profits should be

unforecastable. Suppose that the econometrician observes some data

that is included in the information set of agents at time t. These

observable data should not help predict realized profits if the un-

covered interest parity hypothesis is true, so that a test of interest

parity may be carried out by regressing realized profits on          and

testing if the coefficients are jointly zero.



   Meese and Singleton (1982) find that normalization is needed to
   induce stationarity.

Several studies using a framework like (2) have found strong evidence
that the coefficients are not jointly zero and have concluded that the

nonzero ex—ante returns to forward speculation are consistent with a

time—varying risk premium in the foreign exchange market.4 The (nominal

normalized) risk premium may be defined as the expected return to for-

ward speculation,          =
                               Et(1t,k).5
      Perhaps as a result of the failure to present an empirically trac—

table model of the risk premium that is consistent with the data, the

risk premium is widely considered to be small. Recently, this conven-

tional wisdom has been challenged by Fama (1984) and Hodrick and Srivas—

tava (1986) who find that, while the risk premium may be small relative

to exchange rate forecast errors, the variance of the risk premium has

been approximately as large as the variance of expected exchange rate

changes. Although the evidence presented in these papers shows that time

variation in the risk premium has been important in explaining movements

in the forward premium, it does not provide information about the mag-

nitude of the risk premium or how it moves over time.

      Fortunately, other techniques are available that allow us to examine

the movements of ex—ante speculative returns over time. Since the

econometriciari observes a set of variables X, a reasonable choice of an



      A review of the literature can be found i. Hodrick (1987).

       If the price level is uncertain, nonzero expected nominal returns to
       Forwrd speculation may be due to a covariance between the future
       purchasing power of money and the nominal return to forward specula-
       tion even if individuals are risk neutral, so that equating the
       nominal return to forward speculation with a risk premium is not
       strictly correct. See Frenkel and Razin (1980), Engel 11984), and
       section III below. However, since it has become standard practice in
       the literature to do so, and since the evidence in section III shows
       that such a covariance is not the explanation for nonzero expected
       nominal speculative returns, we will go ahead with this definition.

The projection error,                          is orthogonal to X by construction.

      Since ex—ante profits are unobservable, we work with observable

realized profits, which can be decomposed into expected profits and a

forecast error.

The key assumption behind the econometric methodology that will allow us

to make inferences about the behavior of ex—ante returns based on the

observed behavior of realized returns is the assumption that expecta-

tions are rational. That is we assume that forecast errors are un—

forecastable qiven information available at the time the forecast is

made, so that                   is orthogonal to X. Combining (3) and (4) we obtain

the regression equation,

we can use                the fitted values from (5), as our estimates of ex—ante

returns for each currency.6 It is clear from examining (5) that the

regression used to examine the behavior of ex—ante returns is the same

as (2), the regression used to test uncovered interest parity.

      methods used here are the one proposed in tlishkin (1981) to examine
      the behavior of ex—ante real interest rates.
                                      —6--




observations on quarterly returns (k=3) are used in the empirical work

carried out below. As a result, t,k will follow a second—order moving—

average process. In addition, the projection error need not be serially

uncorrelated. The second feature is also important since the assumption

of conditional homoscedasticity of returns to forward speculation has

beer rejected by Cumby and Obstfeld (1984), Hodrick and Srivastava

(1984) ,   Domowitz and Hakkio (1985), and Giovannini and Jorion (1987).

   There is an important difference between using equation (2) or (5) as

a test of interest parity or as a model to examine the movement over

time in ex—ante returns. Interest parity will be rejected if         infor—

mation uEeful in predicting speculative returns is included in X. To

construct a precise measure of ex—ante speculative returns using the

methodology described here, however, most of the relevant information

for predicting speculative returns must be included in X, so that u

is small. When this is the case, y will have essentially the time

series properties of the forecast error,           Thus a diagnostic check

of the adequacy of the specification of               is to see whether the

residuals from (5) have the properties of an MA(2). Since the projection

error need not be serially uncorrelated, and may even resemble an IIA(2),

finding that the residuals exhibit the properties of an tlA(2)      is not

conclusive evidence that the projection error is unimportant. However,

finding that the residuals do not have the properties of an flA(2)         is

evidence that the projection error is important.

   We now turn to the results from estimating the ex—ante returns to

forward speculation. We consider the U.S. dollar relative to five cur-

rencies, the U.K. pound sterling, Deutsche mark, Canadian dollar, Swiss

franc, and French franc, over the period January 1974 to December 1986.

In all cases we adopt a three—month holding period so as hopefully to

minimize the problems arising from the inexact timing of monthly price
        7
data.

     In estimating the ex—ante nominal return to a long forward position

in the ith currency, the     variables are chosen following Hodrick and

Sriv0va (1984) to be a constant, the forward premia, and the squared

forward premia for each of the 5 currencies.8 Before looking at the

estimated ex—ante returns, we should first examine the autocorrelation

of residuals, reported in Table 1A, in order to see if they behave like

an MA(2). Under the null hypothesis that the residuals are serially

uncorrelated, the autocorrelations have asymptotic standard errors of

approximately 1/JT, or 0.08. In all cases but the second autocorrelation

for the Canadian dollar, the first two autocorrelations are sig-

nificantly different from zero and of the expected magnitude. The other

autocorrelations are small, indicating that the residuals reasonably
                                                                       2
approximate a second—order moving average. Table 18 contains the

statistics to test the hypothesis that all coefficients but the constant

are zero. As can be seen, there is strong evidence against uncovered

interest parity in all five of the currencies as well as against the

hypothesis that expected profits are constant. Table 1 also reports the

results of tests of uncovered interest parity in which the U.K. pound

and the Deutsche mark are used as the base currency in place of the U.S.

dollar. These tests also strongly reject uncovered interest parity.

position in the DN and the U.K. pound respectively. The solid lines in

return to speculation in the other three currencies are not presented to

conserve space. The other three plots are very similar to those

presented here, except that the magnitude of Canadian dollar returns is

smaller than the others. The ex—ante returns move considerably over time

and frequently change sign. While the estimates of the returns are

somewhat imprecise as is evidenced by the sometimes wide confidence

intervals, periods when the ex—ante returns are significantly negative

can be identified in all currencies and periods in which they are sig-

nificantly positive can be identified in most of the currencies. The

estimated magnitude of the ex—ante return is frequently quite large, and

perhaps disconcertingly so. It is interesting to note, however, that the

magnitudes estimated by Doinowitz and Hakkio (1985) using very different

methods are similarly large. In addition, the large magnitudes are

generally accompanied by large standard errors, making the large mag-

nitudes less bothersome.

   An interesting feature of all of the speculative returns is the sharp

decline in the expected profits in all of the currencies that occurs in

mid—1981. Among the explanations of the dollar's rise in this period is

a portfolio shift in favor of dollar—denominated assets. If this ex-

planation is correct, we would expect to see a decrease in the expected

return to dollar—denominated assets during this period. Instead, the

expected return to dollar—denominated investments rises..   The evidence



    The standard errors are calculated according to the formula in
    Mishkin (1981), assuming that the variances of the forecast errors
    are large relative to the variances of the projection errors. As was
    noted earlier, this assumption on the relative importance of the two
    components of the composite error term in equation (5) is not con-
    tradicted by the correlogram of the residuals in Table 1.
                                      —9—


presented here is inconsistent with the claim that a portfolio shift was

behind the strong dollar in 1981.10

      Figure 3 presents the ex—ante return to a forward position that is

long in French francs relative to the DM. As is the case with the other

figures, periods of significantly positive and significantly negative

returns can be discerned. Along with the results in Table 18, this

indicates that finding significant speculative returns is not specific

to the choice of the U.S. dollar as a base currency.



III. Modeling Ex—Ante Returns as a Risk Premium

      This section uses models of utility—maximizing representative agents

to explain the returns observed in section II. The first explanation

investigated is that agents are risk neutral and that nominal profits

arise only due to a covariance of nominal profits with the future price

level. After rejecting this explanation, consumption—beta models of a

risk premium are considered and   tests   such as those suggested by Hansen

and Hodrick (1983) and Gibbons and Ferson (1985) are implemented.

      Models of intertemporal asset pricing assume that consumer—investors

maximize the utility of consumption over their lifetime subject to a

sequence of budget constraints. The optimality condition of a repre-

sentative domestic consumer—investor has been used to examine the pric-

ing of forward foreign exchange contracts by Stockman (1978), Frenkel

and Razin (1980), Hansen and Hodrick (1983), and Mark (1985), among

others. Their work shows that if a representative consumer—investor is

at an interior optimum,

(6)     EtC(U(ct+k)/U(ct))k/(pk/p)] = 0.

 10
      Obstfeld (1985) also presents evidence that a portfolio shift is not
      behind the rise of the dollar during this period.
                                                  —10—


where c is real consumption and Pt is the price level.

      Frenkel and Razin (1980) and Engel (1984) use this condition to point

out that even if investors are risk neutral                        (so that the marginal

utility of consumption is constant), expected nominal profits to forward

speculation may be nonzero but expected real profits should be zero.

Thus rejection of uncovered interest parity does not provide evidence of

a risk premium in the forward foreign exchange market. However, finding

ex—ante real profits would provide such evidence. Define the real return

to forward speculation in currency i, rtk, as

(7)      rtk =                     - F,k)/S)/(Pt+kIPt)       =
                                                                 t,k't+k't'
The hypothesis that expected real returns are zero may then                   be tested in

a     manner analogous              to    the tests of interest parity described    above.


Again,    we assume the econometrician observes some data                        that are
included      in the time—t information set of agents, and consider the

projection       of expected real profits onto X.

                               tj    t,k
Next, decomposing realized real profits, r,k into their conditional

expectation and a forecast error, ', we have,

(8')
          r,k
                 =
                      Xa       +
                                    Utk   +   t,k =      +


If     expected real profits are zero, then in a large sample, they should

be unforecastable given information available when the speculative

position is taken. The hypothesis of no expected real profits can be

tested by testing that the coefficients in (8') are zero.

      In testing for nonzero expected real profits we need to consider what

X variables to use in the regressions. In principle any variables in

the information set are reasonable candidates.                         In the first tests

carried out, we use the forward premia and the squared forward premia as

was    done above in order to determine if the same data that prove useful
                                      —11—


for predicting nominal profits are also useful for predicting real

profits. Next, several "real' variables are considered. The               used in

the second set of tests are the forward premia in each of the five

currencies, U.S. inflation 1t+3"t — 1) lagged 3 and 12 months, the

rate of change of consumption (c3/c —             1)    lagged 3 months, U.S. in-

dustrial production growth (IPt÷3/IPt — 1) lagged three months, and the

U.S. terms of trade               These data are chosen since forward premia

have    proven useful in predicting nominal returns. Consumption and in-
dustrial production       growth and the terms of trade are employed since
various models suggest that these should affect savings and investment
decisions and     therefore affect equilibrium expected real returns.

      Table   2 contains the results from regressions of realized real
speculative     profits on both sets of      variables along with the
statistics      testing the hypothesis that expected real profits are con-
stant. Table 2% contains the results obtained when the forward premia
and squared forward premia are used, while Table 2B contains the results
obtained from the second set of           variables. s can be seen from the
tables, the hypotheses that expected real profits are constant is
rejected at standard significance     levels in   all cases. Thus the evidence
clearly shows that, contrary to the suggestions             of   Frenkel and Razin
(1980) and Engel (1984), the finding of nonzero nominal profits cannot
be attributed solely to a covariance between nominal returns and an
uncertain     future price level. The evidence is      clearly inconsistent with
the   hypothesis that investors are risk neutral.

discrete—time conditional consumption—based asset pricing model for a

representative domestic consumer—investor can be obtained using the

results in Hansen and Richard (1987), where a ugenericu conditional

asset pricing model is examined.12 While restrictions on equilibrium

returns may be obtained in this way, the means by which Stulz's results

on aggregation across countries can be obtained in a conditional

discrete—time framework remain unknown. All that we require here,

however, is that a consumption—based capital asset pricing model exist

for a representative domestic consumer—investor. In Stulz's model,

expected real returns to a long forward position in currency        .1    will

satisfy,

         E(r,k) =P,Etr,k r,kl,
where r,k is the real return on the benchmark portfolio, rk is the

real rate of return on a portfolio whose real return is conditionally

uncorrelated with domestic real consumption, and          is   the "consump-

tion beta" of forward speculation in the jth currency from the point of

view of a domestic investor.

                   Ct÷k       ct.
      Since (10) must hold for all assets, we can divide E(rk) by the

expected return on forward speculation in an arbitrarily                 chosen



       Grossman and Shiller (1982) show how a consumption—beta model can be
       derived   from   the first—order conditions of a representative
       consumer—investor such as (6), by taking the limit as the trading
       interval goes to zero. They point out that distributional assump—
       tions or assumptions about the functional form of the utility func-
       tion are alternatives to the use of continuous—time analysis.

       As Hansen and Richard (1987) point out, the consumption—based capi-
       tal asset pricing model implies that the benchmark return in their
       analysis is the return on the aggregate consumption portfolio.

                      ,
ratio of the consumption betas is constant over time (or, equivalently,

the conditional covariances between asset returns and the rate of change

of real consumption are proportional across currencies), a test of the

asset pricing model         (10) can be carried out by estimating a system of

projection equations and testing the hypothesis that the coefficients in

each equation are proportional to the coefficients in the first equa-

tion)4 If there are N assets and k regressors in each of the projection

equations, there will be Nh regressors in the system but only k + (N—i)

parameters when the proportionality restrictions are imposed. There are

thus Nh —       (hi-N—i)   parameter restrictions that can be tested. If the

model is correct and if the auxiliary assumptions concerning the con-

stancy of the relative consumption betas and the rationality of expecta-

tions are correct, these parameter restrictions should be satisfied by

the data.

      Estimation of the restricted system of equations and testing of the

parameter restrictions can be carried out using Hansens (1982) general-

ized method of moments (GMM) procedure. Hansen and Hodrick (1983> show

how tests to proportionality restrictions can be carried out using the



       Gibbons and Ferson (1985) propose the tests currently described as a
       means of testing the Sharpe—Lintner version of the CAPM. The tests
       may be thought of as tests of any single beta asset pricing model.

       The assumption that the conditional covariances are proportional

value of the criterion function, which is distributed as (2    with   degrees

freedom equal to the number of restrictions.

   Hansen and Hodrick (1983) test the restrictions implied by a single—

beta model of the foreign exchange risk premium. The test they carry out

is equivalent to the Sibbons—Ferson test. Perhaps this is not surprising

since both are tests of single—beta asset pricing models. The fact that

the two tests are identical is obscured somewhat by differences in

interpretation and motivation of the tests. Hansen and Hodrick assume

that the betas are constant and treat the expected return on the

benchmark portfolio as an unobserved latent variable assumed to be

linearly related to some data X. Gibbons and Fersan, on the other hand

substitute out the expected benchmark return by using an arbitrarily

chosen reference asset and derive a set of proportionality restrictions

that are identical to those obtained by Hansen and Hodrick.

   Table 3 contains the results of the tests of the consumption—based

models of the risk premium using the "real"     variables. Estimation of

the full system of five equations each of which contains 11 regressors

proved to be computationally infeasible. We therefore carry out the
                                                     15
tests in reduced systems of three currencies each.        In each of these

reduced systems there are 33 orthogonality conditions and 13 parameters

to be estimated. There are thus 20 parameter restrictions in each sys-

tem. The values of the criterion functions, which are X4 random vari-

ables with 20 degrees freedom, are 54.06 for the first set of currencies

(Deutsche mark, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc), 83.38 for the second set



    Estimation requires the inversion of a matrix that is Nk x Nk, which
    is in this case 55 x 55. Attempts to compute this inversion proved
    unsuccessful. If the restrictions are rejected by the data, the use
    of the three smaller systems does not present any problems in inter-
    preting the test results since the full system test would simply
    provide stronger rejections.

of currencies (Deutsche mark, U.K. pound, Swiss franc), and 88.01 for

the third set of currencies (Deutsche mark, U.K. pound, French franc).

The restrictions implied by the single—beta model are then rejected at

any reasonable significance level in all three cases.16



IV. Modeling Conditional Covariances

     The behavior of the conditional covariance of speculative returns and

the rate of change of consumption plays a central role in consumption—

based models of the risk premium. In this section we discuss modeling

this conditional covariance with several goals in mind. First, if we are

to    explain ex—ante speculative profits as a risk premium using

consumption—based models, the conditional covariance between consumption
                                                    17
and real speculative returns must move over time.        In addition, the

results discussed in section II suggest that ex—ante profits change sign

over time. Since the expected excess return on rk cannot be negative,

the conditional covariance must change sign over time as the risk

premium changes sign. Second, it may be that the rejection of the

restrictions implied by the consumption—beta model is due to time—

varying relative consumption betas. If the conditional covariances can

be modeled, the constancy of the relative consumption betas can be

tested. Finally, if we find that the relative consumption betas change

over time, we want to determine if the movement they exhibit can account

     Similar tests carried out using the DM and the U.K. pound as base
     currencies in place of the U.S. dollar as well as tests using the
     forward premia and squared forward premia as the relevant X. In all
     cases the proportionality restrictions are rejected at standard
     significance levels.
17
     Hodrick and Srivastava (1984) find that ex-ante profits cannot be
     explained solely by variation in the expected excess return on a
     benchmark portfolio.

for ex—ante speculative profits.

  The estimation of the conditional covariance may be carried out by

extending the results of Amemiya (1977) and Hasbrouck (1985).18 We are

interested in estimating the conditional covariance between the rate of

change of consumption and the real return to forward speculation,

              =                                        =
                  cov(r,k,Lct+k/ct)                        EtCErk_Et(r,k)][ct+k/ct_Et(ct+k/ct)]}
The econometrician, who is assumed to observe a set of variables, X,

can use as an estimate of the conditional covariance the projection of

        onto

              =    Xe.
                    t3
                                 +
                                        t
       J,t.
It will prove convenient to rewrite the projection as,

                        =               +       + t,k't,k —                       =          +
      '1t,kt,k               X8J                                                      Xt83
where                  and                  are the disturbances from projections of r,k and

Ct+k/Ct onto X, respectively. Since '1k and '1,k unobservable, we

need to work with the residuals,                                      =           — X(a—a)         and      =


— Xt( —a

In the appendix we show that the OLS estimate of                                                 is consistent and

asymptotically normal with a covariance matrix that can be consistently

estimated using the techniques described in Hansen (1982) and Cumby,




 18
       Hasbrouck (1985) extends the results in Ameiniya (1977) in several
       important directions. Most importantly, he allows the regressors to
       be stochastic, does not require that the regression disturbance be
       normal, and allows the addition of a stochastic disturbance to the
       linear variance function.
 19
       It should be pointed out that since we are examining the conditional
       covariances of the 'i and not the conditional covariances of the ,
       the covariances we estimate are the sum of the covariances of the
       projection errors and the covariances real returns and real consump-
       tion. Therefore any inference about the movement of the conditional
                                         —17—


                                   19
Huizinga, and Obstfeld (198..).

   Once consistent estimates of 8. and its asymptotic covariance matrix

are obtained, we can test hypotheses about the conditional covariance of

real    consumption and the real return to forward speculation. The first

of these hypotheses is the constancy of this conditional covariance,

which implies that all elements of 8. are zero except for the constant

term. Next,     if     the hypothesis of a constant conditional covariance is

rejected, we need to determine if the comovements of the conditional

covariance and the returns to forward speculation are consistent with

the consumption—based model of the risk premium. We can do this in three

steps. Firsts we use the fitted values from the projections (12)            to

estimate the conditional covariances and to examine their movements over

time.    Next, we can test the assumption of constant relative consumption

betas required for the Gibbons—Ferson test by using the projection

equations (12).        If relative consumption betas are constant over time,

the conditional covariances must all move together over time. The

hypothesis that the conditional covariances move together can be tested

by determining if the coefficients in the projection equations (12) are

proportional across currencies.

   In     estimating     and   testing     hypotheses about the conditional

covariances, the choice of the data to include in        must again be made.

It seems natural to use the same information to estimate the behavior of

conditional first moments and conditional second moments, so the      utrealli




   covariance of real returns and real consumption over time based on
   the evidence presented here is conditional on assumptions we make
   concerning the movements of covariance of the projection errors. .If
   the data    do a good job of describing the movements of the
                                                                   rt k
   over time, we may reasonably assume that the covariance of proie—
   tion errors is small. The estimates will then be dominated by move-
   ments in the conditional covarjances of real returns and real con—
   sumption.
                                  —18—


  variables are again assumed to make up the relevant information set.

Prior to proceeding with estimation, a problem with consumption data

should be confronted. Published data measure consumption over an inter-

val rather than at a point in time. Using the results in Breeden, Gib-

bons, and Litzenberger (1986), it can be shown that if monthly data

sampled quarterly are used and if the covariance between real returns

and real consumption growth is constant, the estimate of the covariance

obtained using interval consumption data will understate the true "spot"

covariance by twenty percent. The dependent variables in the projections

(12) are multiplied by 1.2 prior to estimation to correct for this bias.

This will, of course, leave the test statistics unchanged but it will

change the estimated magnitudes of the conditional covariances.

   Table 4 contains the 2 statistics for testing the the constancy of

conditional covariances. Recall that the the conditional covariances

must vary over time if a time—varying risk premium is to be explained by

the consumption—based models. In three cases the hypothesis of constant

conditional covariances can be rejected at standard significance levels.

Given that the covariances change over time, do they do so in a way that

explains the behavior of ex—ante returns? First1 we can examine plots of

the conditional covariaaces over time, an example of which is Figure 4.

The conditional covariance of real returns to a long forward position in

DPI and the rate of change of real consumption exhibits substantial

fluctuations and frequently changes sign. As was the case with the ex—

ante returns, the standard errors are generally large but periods of

significantly    positive   and   significantly   negative   conditional

covariances can be discerned. Plots of the other four conditional

covariances exhibit similarly large fluctuations and wide confidence

intervals. Period in which the estimated conditional covariance is
                                         —19—


 significantly different from zero can be discerned in all cases. The

 strong rejections of the constancy of the conditional covariances

 reported in Table 3, along with the fairly wide confidence intervals

 indicate that, while the data do not contain enough information to allow

 us to determine with great confidence the value of the conditional

 covariance at any point in time, they do contain enough information to

allow us to determine that the conditional covariances are not constant

over time. The relatively large standard errors suggest that part of the

volatility        exhibited     by the point estimates of the conditional
covariances is due to sampling variation.

      Inspection of Figure 4 suggests that the comovements of the condi-

tional covariance and the ex—ante speculative return are at least

qualitatively consistent with the predictions of the consumption—based

models        of the risk   premium. Importantly, the sharp drop in the ex—ante
returns in all currencies relative to the dollar in 1981 coincides with
a decrease in the conditional covariance in Figure 4. Similar results
are found for each of the the other four currencies except the U.K.
pound. While several other movements of the estimated expected returns
coincide with similar movements of the estimated conditional covariance,
not all significant sign changes of the estimated ex—ante return coin-
cide with      sign changes of the estimated conditional covariance.

      Table    48 contains the results of the tests of
                                                         proportionality of the
conditional      covariances for the three sets of currencies examined above.

The tests are carried out using the 6MM procedure used in carrying out

the   Gibbons—Ferson tests. Again there are 33     orthogonality conditions in

the    each system and 13 parameters to be estimated in each so that each
system has 20 restrictions to be tested. The table reports the 2(20)
statistics for the hypothesis that the             conditional covariances are
                                  —20—


proportional. The proportionality constraints are not rejected at stand-

ard significance levels for any of the combinations. Thus a violation of

the assumption of proportional conditional covariances cannot account

for all of the strong rejections found when the Gibbons—Ferson and

Hansen—Hodrick tests are carried out.

   As a final check of the ability of the consumption—beta model to

explain observed returns to forward speculation, a series of regressions

(not reported) in run to determine if these returns are consistent with

the equilibrium condition, (11), when the relative consumption betas are

allowed to change over time. In each regression, realized returns to

forward speculation in one currency relative to realized returns to

forward speculation in a reference currency (DM) are regressed on a

constant and the ratio of the fitted value for the conditional

covariance for speculation in that currency relative to the conditional

covariance for DM speculation. If relative returns depend linearly on

relative consumption betas as the model predicts, we expect to find a

slope coefficient of one. Instead, the estimated slope coefficients are

close to zero in all four cases, and are in fact positive in only two

cases. Even when conditional covariances are allowed to change over

time, the consumption—based model of the risk premium does not appear to

be able to explain observed real returns to forward speculation.



                         IV. Concluding remarks



   This paper presents evidence of statistically significant ex—ante

returns to forward speculation in five currencies relative to the dollar

as well as for four currencies relative to the DM and the U.K. pound,

and finds that these ex—ante returns exhibit considerable fluctuations
                                   —21—


over time and are positive in some periods and negative in others. The

paper then goes on the determine whether these returns are     consistent
with models of risk premia that have been proposed in the literature.

While the comovements of the estimated ex—ante returns to forward

speculation and the estimated conditional covariances between these

returns and consumption growth are broadly consistent with the predic-

tions of the consumption—based model, on the whole the evidence suggests

that the consumption—based model does not provide an adequate descrip-

tion of returns to forward speculation.

     At least three possible explanation for the falure          of   the

consumption—based model fully to explain observed ratirns to forward

speculation apart from any weakness in the model come o mind. First,

the failure may be due to data problems such as those encountered in

measuring consumption or prices. A second explanation may lie in the

possibility that agents may have rationally assigned finite probabil-

ities to events such as policy changes that were not realized in the

sample.   If this is the case,      in small samples we may find that the

apparent ex—post bias in forward rates exceeds the true bias.0 Finally,

nonseparability over time of the utility function may account for the

failure of the model to explain speculative returns.

      Il. Now we need to establish the asymptotic normality of the least




       We can see here that since we only measure expected returns and the
       expected rate of change of consumption with error, any of our in-
       ference about the comovements of the two are only valid if the
       projection error covariance is negligable. If, instead of A4, we
       were to assume that the conditional projection error covariance was
       constant but nonzero, the constant term in 8. would be inconsistent
       but the slope coefficients would be unaffectd.

As above, we will consider each part of this expression in turn.

    (a) (1/.fT)EXt6

Under the assumptions set out above, this term is distributed asymptoti-

cally as N(O,Q) where Q is as defined in A6. See Hansen (1982).'

(b) (1/.(T)EXt7?,kXt(aC_aC) =
                                      (1iT)EEXt,kXt]4T(C_aC)
The arguments set out above can be used to show that the first part of

this expression converges in probability to zero. The second                                   converges

in distribution to a normal random variable. The product thus converges

in probability to zero.
                         A
(c)
         (l/IT)EXtfltkXt(a._a.)
This term can also be shown to converge in probability to zero using an

arqument identical to that in (b).

(d) (1/,tT)EX X ( —a )X
                tt C     C   t    3   3

A       typical element of this can be written as, 1T(. .—a.                           .)            —a         )
                                                                              31      J1       c,k        c,k
(l/T)EXtX.tXkt. The first part of this product converges in distribution

to a normal random variable. The second converges in probability to

zero, while the third converges in probability to a vector. Thus the

product converges in probability to zero.

        We then have ,(T(8.      —    8.)         is            distributed       asymptotically           as

N(O,M1QM1.

        An alternative to assuming joint stationarity is to allow     and
        to be drawn from different distributions over time and to assume
        that high order moments exist and use the mixing process theorems of
        White (1985).
