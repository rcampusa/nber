Level versus Equivalent Intensity Carbon Mitigation Commitments

NBER Working Paper No. 15370

JEL No. F02,F18

                                             ABSTRACT

Large population / rapidly growing economies such as China and India have argued that in the upcoming
UNFCCC negotiations in Copenhagen, any emission reduction targets they take on should be based
on their intensity of emissions (emissions/$GDP) on a target date not the level of emissions. They
argue that this will allow room for their continued high growth, and level commitments in the presence
of sharply differential growth between OECD and non-OECD economies represent asymmetric and
unacceptable arrangements. Much of the policy literature agrees with this position, also arguing that
while there is equivalence between commitments if growth rates are certain, where growth rates are
uncertain equivalence breaks down. However, no explicit models or experimental design are used
to support this claim. Here we use a modeling framework in which countries face a business as usual
(BAU) growth profile under no mitigation, and can mitigate (reduce consumption) and lower temperature
change but with a utility loss. International trade enters through trade in country differentiated goods,
and the impact of mitigation on country welfare depends critically on the assumed severity of climate
related damage. We then consider cases where country growth rates are uncertain, and compare the
impacts of levels versus intensity commitments, with the latter made equivalent in the sense that expected
emissions are the same. There are different senses of this equivalence; global equivalence with differing
country impacts, or strict country by country equivalence. Under intensity commitments there is more
variation in both consumption and emissions than is the case with level commitments, and we show
cases where level commitments are preferred to intensity commitments by all countries. Whether this
is the case also depends upon how growth rate uncertainty is specified. We are also able to consider
packages of mixed level and intensity commitments by country which might be the outcome of UNFCCC
negotiations. Outcomes can thus be opposite to prevailing opinion, but it depends on how the equivalent
targets are specified.

1. Introduction
     A central difference in the form of commitment which has been debated for
upcoming global negotiations on climate change in Copenhagen in December 2007 is
between absolute commitments to reduced annual levels of emissions (on a flow basis
such as per year) as measured on an agreed commitment date, and relative
commitments to reduced levels of emissions per unit of GDP, again as measured on
an agreed commitment date. Developing countries argue that such forms of
commitment are necessary for them given their high growth, and also commitments of
this form will encourage them to become more energy and emission efficient more
quickly.
     In this paper, we take up the issue of level versus intensity commitments in a
formal analytical structure. It is widely agreed that in the certainty case there is an
equivalence between the two commitment forms. For any level target an intensity
target exists whose impacts will be identical. The critical differences arise with
uncertainty over growth rates, autonomous reductions in energy conversion efficiency,
technical progress, and other considerations.
     While much of the policy based literature (see Pizer (2005)) argues in favor of
intensity commitments on the grounds it leaves more emission room for high growth
countries, little of it explicitly compares the two commitment forms in well specified
experiments. In the presence of uncertainty as to growth performance, intensity
commitments will typically generate more variance in both output and emissions for
equivalent level commitments with the same expected emissions reduction across the
two commitment forms, but at the same time there are differing senses of equivalence.
For instance, equivalence may hold only globally so that expected global emissions
are the same, while country emissions on an expectations basis vary, or equivalence
may hold more strictly on a country by country basis.
     We use a general equilibrium model applied to a multi decade business as usual
(BAU) scenario in which global output determines emission levels, and countries
trade country specific goods with both goods and temperature change entering
preferences. Countries can forgo use of their own good to meet targets, reducing
                                                                                      2
emissions with a welfare gain from temperature change and welfare loss from reduced
consumption. We use an eight region structure (China, India, Russia, Brazil, US, EU,
Japan, Rest of the World) which we calibrate to a Business as Usual (BAU) scenario
over 50 years. We are able to compare intensity to level targets being used by all
countries, being used by a subset of countries (China, India, Russia, Brazil) while
others use level targets, or only by individual countries (China, for instance). The
higher variance of output and emissions can make intensity commitments unattractive
for countries compared to levels commitments when strict country equivalence holds,
although individual country impacts also reflect terms of trade effects. Significant
differences across countries apply when looser global equivalence is used. What
stands out is the difference in perspective relative to the policy based discussion in
that details of equivalence assumed in the experiment and how growth rate
uncertainty is specified matter for country impacts. Numerical results are also
sensitive to the assumed damage from climate change and model parameters used.

2. Level versus intensity commitments
     In December 1997, more than 150 countries concluded negotiations on the Kyoto
Protocol, a landmark agreement on global climate change. Signed by 84 countries,
including the United States, the treaty committed industrialized countries to legally
binding limits on their emissions of greenhouse gases that are linked to global climate
change. These limits were expressed as reductions (or, in a few cases, increases) in
absolute emissions levels relative to a 1990 baseline.
     Developing countries took on no commitments under Kyoto and countries were
divided into two groups; Annex A with commitments and Annex B with no
commitments. This was seen at the time as an interpretation of the principle of
“Common but Differentiated Responsibilities” applying to developing countries and
adopted as part of the earlier 1994 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
     Kyoto commitments terminate in 2012 and with the end of the Kyoto
implementation period, the focus has now shifted to arrangements for a post Kyoto
world and further negotiations under UNFCCC which are to conclude in Copenhagen
in December 2009. In these negotiations the participation of large population rapidly
growing developing countries (China, India, Brazil, Russia) is seen as key as their
emissions will progressively come to dominate global emissions if their (pre crisis)
high growth rates continue. These countries, in turn, cite not only common but
differentiated responsibilities, but also their need for growth and development as the
basis for them taking on different forms of commitment compared to developed
countries.
     Level (or absolute) emissions targets typically specify a percentage reduction in
the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (Kg of carbon Dioxide
equivalent) to be released on a flow basis on a specified date. Intensity (or relative)
emissions target reductions involve a percentage reduction in the amount of emissions
relative to some measure of output (such as GDP) usually stated in dollar or local
currency terms, on a specified date. The commitment in both cases is to percentage
reduction by some specified date relative to an earlier base date.
     Level commitments were the mechanism used in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and
                                                                                      4
are also widely used in other treaty arrangements (such as the Montreal Protocol on
CFC’s). Intensity commitments have attracted growing attention in global
negotiations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to arguments from rapidly
growing large population economies (China, India, Russia, Brazil) that they need
room to accommodate high growth and that this points to emissions intensity targets.
Intensity-based limits which restrict emissions to some pre-specified ratio relative to
input or output are much more widely used in domestic environmental regulation.
     Intensity targets can be interpreted as performance standards. For a company, the
standard maybe relative to company total sales or relative to units of a good produced.
For a country, the standard is typically specified as tons of carbon dioxide equivalent
relative to country GDP. If emissions intensities are used the choice of exchange rate
in calculating US$ dominated GDP becomes a critical issue. This is especially
important for China and India due to large differences in the dollar measure of GDP
depending upon whether or not purchasing power parity or market exchange rates are
used.
     Both the form of commitment and the target date for any commitments in the
second round of global emissions reduction negotiations to conclude in Copenhagen
in December 2009 are at this point unresolved. The Bali 2007 UNFCCC documents
contained language suggesting indicative targets of a 25-40% reduction by 2030.
Developing countries have raised the issue of the form of commitment not only in
terms of levels versus intensity but also as it relates to other issues such as the
treatment of emissions embedded in exports. In the G8, there has been discussion of
50% cuts by 2050. Chancellor Merkel has also been associated with proposals for
targets for maximum temperature change (2 ) by 2050. 2050 targets might also be
accompanied by intermediate targets, say a 30% cut by 2030, and a 20% cut by 2020.
     Available literature on the intensity / level issue stresses that in the presence of
certainty the two commitment forms are equivalent, in the sense that for any level
commitment, an equivalent intensity commitment can be found with the same impacts.
It is where growth and any autonomous reductions in energy conversion efficiency are
uncertain that differences rise.
                                                                                        5
     Pizer (2005) argues that absolute emissions targets are too constraining in face of
unexpectedly high growth and too lax in face of unexpectedly low growth, and that
intensity targets better accommodate unexpected growth and favor developing
countries. His arguments reflect four key claims: that greenhouse gas emissions will
continue to rise over the near term, that absolute targets emphasize zero or declining
emissions growth while intensity targets do not, that developing countries’ economic
development is integrally tied to emissions growth for the foreseeable future, and that
intensity targets are not any more complicated to administer than levels targets.
     Ellerman and Wing (2003) also discuss the differences between these two forms
of emission targets, arguing like others that the two forms have identical effects in a
world where future emissions and economic output (i.e. GDP) are known with
certainty. They show that outcomes for emissions and welfare only diverge when the
variance of GDP diverges from its forecast expectation. They then argue that intensity
targets reduce the importance of what is the most important unknown for any country
considering the cost of meeting emission targets; future economic performance. Their
conclusion is that if uncertainty about the effects of absolute targets impedes
agreement or causes existing agreements to unravel, then some form of indexation of
targets to economic growth seems both desirable and necessary to enable agreements
to be made.
     Jacoby et al. (1998) also argue that intensity targets are more compatible with the
overall architecture of environmental agreements. They argue that an absolute cap is
only a limiting form of emission targets in which the degree of indexation to GDP
growth is a choice variable. They suggest that the widespread use of intensity targets
in environmental regulation, including some use as an instrument to reach Kyoto
targets by parties adhering to the Protocol, suggests that more attention should be paid
to this than in the past.
     Our point of departure relative to this literature is to argue that in any comparison
of the economy wide performance of level versus intensity targets, a basis for the
comparison is needed in clearer analytical terms. Precedents for such comparisons lie
in the tax literature where the efficiency and distributional impacts of alternative tax
                                                                                         6
structures are compared on an equal yield basis. Here, the natural experiment would
seem to be to consider uncertainty in, say, the growth rate of countries comparing a
business as usual scenario (with uncertainty in emissions levels) to outcomes under
emissions targets in level (absolute) and equivalent intensity form, calibrated such that
expected emissions levels are the same across the two forms of limitation. We also
argue that there are differing forms of equivalence. One might be where the expected
global emissions intensity reduction is the same but with the same absolute reduction
in intensity country differences apply in proportional reductions, and another might be
where equivalence of expected proportional emissions intensity applies on a country
by country basis.
      While emission intensity targets may be argued as inconsistent with
arrangements under the Kyoto Protocol, there is no reason why the form that targets
take cannot change from one environmental negotiation to another.2 For more than a
decade, international climate negotiations have focused on absolute emissions targets
and timetables. The result has been a system that is biased toward halting and
reversing emissions growth, even as evidence suggests that emissions will continue to
grow for decades in industrialized countries and much longer in the developing world.
This bias arises because progress viewed in terms of emissions inevitably means
emissions reductions—not slowing growth of emissions. Shifting the focus of the
negotiation towards intensity targets can thus be defended as opening the door to more

inclusive negotiations where a range of approaches—including slowing, stopping, or even

reversing emissions growth—can be discussed. Intensity targets can then be interpreted as

performance standards for the whole economy.

      The question remains whether intensity-based emissions targets offer a preferable

alternative to level emissions targets both globally and for individual countries. Do

intensity targets better accommodate growth and make targets for developing countries

more likely to be acceptable than absolute emissions limits? Or do intensity targets

instead increase the expected variance of both emissions and output and increase

2
  Some would even abandon entirely the targets-and timetables architecture of the Kyoto Protocol and replace it
with agreements on R&D expenditures and technology transfer (Barrett, 2001) or with a global carbon tax (Cooper,
1998).

                                                                                                              7
uncertainty relative to level targets? What is needed is experimental analysis to

investigate, with the same expected reduction in emissions whether the expected

utility under intensity limits will be higher or lower than that in the certainty case.

3. Model Structure and Experiment Specification
    We use an extended version of a multi country modeling framework recently
developed by Tian, Whalley & Cai (2009) in which the effects of alternative climate
change policies relative to a BAU scenario can be assessed over many years
considered as a single period. Into this, we introduce uncertainty of country growth
rates and compare the expected welfare differences involved using comparable level
and intensity targets as counterfactual model experiments. We specify the intensity
equivalent experiments in different ways, with varying forms of uncertainty of
country growth rates as well as expected global equivalence in terms of expected
emission. In one case there are equal absolute reductions in intensity with country
differences in expected proportional reductions, and in the other equal proportional
intensity reductions and country by country equivalence in proportional expected
reductions. We are also able to compute the distributional implications of using one
form of intensity target over another.
     The model considers multiple regions (China, India, Brazil, Russia, US, EU,
Japan, Rest of the World). Each region is endowed with a single good and goods are
heterogeneous across countries (the Armington (1969) assumption). Countries export
their own good, and import the other country goods. Country utility is defined over
consumption of goods and temperature change. In the model countries can reduce
global emissions by forgoing consumption since emissions are linked to the total
value of consumption world wide. In this way, countries can induce lowered world
temperature change which benefits all, but at a cost to themselves in terms of foregone
consumption.
     We use data on consumption and trade for the eight economies, along with
country growth rate data for 2000-2006. We forward project BAU scenarios
alternatively to 2036 and 2056, using various damage and temperature change
assumptions as our BAU case. This base data is thus for a single 30 or 50 year period
2006-2056 with assumed yearly growth rates over the period. We calibrate the model
to a temperature change function for prospective changes in temperature under the
three growth scenarios out to 2056. In these we use varying estimates of associated
damage reported by Stern (2006) and Mendelsohn (2006).
     In the model, we introduce uncertainty in the form of three different growth
scenarios: BAU growth and a higher and lower growth scenario for each region. Our
BAU growth rates reflect average annual country growth rates over the period

                                                                                      9
2000-2006 projected forward. We consider one case where high and low growth rates
reflect the same percentage deviation in country growth rates across all countries. We
consider an alternative case where growth rates for high and low growth scenarios
reflect averages of above and below mean growth rates for the period 2000-2006.
     For simplicity, we assume that the high and low growth scenarios occur in each
case with equal probabilities. We then use these to assess the impacts of different
emission reduction targets: comparing the BAU outcome without any emissions
reduction to a 20% level target reduction in country emissions; and to alternative
intensity targets that are equivalent to the absolute target in terms of expected impacts
on emission levels specified both globally and by country. We compute the welfare
level under the BAU scenario and under the high and low growth scenarios in each
case for both absolute and intensity targets. This allows us to assess whether the
expected welfare of the two weighted average cases in the level target case is higher
or lower than in the intensity target case.


3.1 Temperature change and top level country utility functions
    We analyze a single period of a number of years during which each of the
economies we analyze grows at a compounding constant rate. Each country is
assumed to have one heterogeneous good whose availability also grows at this rate in
the base case (BAU). We assume that consumption of the good by the country directly
generates emissions of carbon which, in turn, raises global temperature. Countries
generate positive utility from consumption of goods, but negative utility from
temperature change. Countries have an upper bound on their own use of their good
(consumption plus export) reflecting the BAU scenario. If they use less than the upper
bound they experience less temperature change, as do all other countries. If they are
small, their own actions have little or no effect on temperature change.
    We analyze the impacts of emissions reductions over a given period of time
which we consider as a single period which covers either 30 or 50 years. There are no
explicit dynamics. For this period, we focus on changes in consumption (of both own
and foreign goods via international trade) and utility, and measure changes in these
variables relative to the outcome of zero growth over the period. The utility function
is thus defined over 30 or 50 year changes in consumption and temperature change.
The potential use of the own good by an economy can thus be thought to reflect
changes in potential output from the economy over 30 or 50 years. We first analyze a

                                                                                       10
business as usual (BAU) scenario which reflects current observed growth rates
remaining unchanged over 30 or 50 years, and with no global or single country
emissions limitation initiatives in place, and then consider alternative high and low
growth cases. We then compute model solutions under alternative emissions
reductions for each scenario.
     The utility of each country in all cases is reflected in a utility change function
with arguments given by the country’s own change in composite consumption as well
as the temperature change of the world. We assume the utility change function for
each country has a Cobb-Douglas form given by (1).
                                         H − ∆T β
      ∆U i = ∆U (∆RCi , ∆T ) = ∆RCi *(         )                       (1)
                                           H
     In this specification, ∆RCi represents the change in consumption for each

country i (i=1,…,N). ∆RCi is, in turn, a composite of their own good and other
country’s goods which they acquire by exporting their own good and importing other
country’s goods. This structure can thus be used to also analyze links between trade
penalties (tariffs) and financial transfers and participation in emission reduction
initiatives.
     H can be thought of the global temperature change at which all economic activity
ceases (say 20 ). As ∆T approaches C utility goes to zero, and as ∆T goes to zero
there is no welfare impact from temperature change. Utility change over the model
period (2006-2036 or 2005-2036) increases as temperature change falls. The share
parameter β reflects the severity of damage (in utility terms) from any given
temperature change. We calibrate the model to various damage estimates from
business as usual global temperature change reported by Stern (2006) and
Mendelsohn (2006), and this procedure determines β .
     Global temperature change, in turn, is determined by the change in carbon
emissions over the period across all countries in the model. We adopt a simple
temperature change function and assume that emissions by each country equal the
change in consumption times country emissions intensity (emissions/GDP) so as to
allow for differing emissions intensities by country. Defining the emissions intensity
of region i as ei , we use a simple power function (2) for global temperature change
due to changes in emissions by all countries over the model period.


                                                                                     11
     ΔT = g (∑ ei ΔRSi ) = a(∑ ei ΔRSi )b + c                                   (2)
                 i                  i

where ΔRSi represents the change in the use ( consumption plus export) of the own

good for each country i. We treat the ei as exogenous and constant over the period, but
the structure can be extended to also incorporate an exogenous improvement in
emissions intensity overtime reflecting increased efficiency of energy conversion.
Consumption across all regions of each country own good is less than ΔRSi because

of international trade. ΔRSi in turn is less than or equal to the upper bound ΔRSi

associated with the base case scenario as countries lower use of their own good to
meet emissions targets.


3.2 Composite consumption goods by country
     In this structure, a carbon reduction commitment by a single country implies a
reduction in consumption, and this has both negative and positive effects on utility
change for countries over the model period. On the one hand, a reduction in
consumption lowers utility for the country, but on the other hand, country
consumption reductions lower global emissions and hence world temperature change,
and increases the utility both of the country reducing the emissions and all other
countries.
     The composite consumption good RCi is a CES function of domestic and

imported consumption goods, similar to the nested CES Armington functions in trade
models (see Whalley (1985)). The model effectively becomes an Armington N good N
country pure trade economy in which the endowment of each region is variable and
temperature change enters utility.
     The demands for consumption goods reflect the outcome of sub utility
maximization.

3.3 Composites of Imported Goods and Trade Equilibrium
     The CES imported composite commodities are in turn composites of imported
goods from each supplying country. Given that each country has one good it can sell,

3.4 High, Low and BAU growth scenarios and Model Experiments
     The model captures uncertainty in a simple way by analyzing three alternative
growth scenarios: high growth, low growth and BAU growth. For each scenario we
compute utility and consumption of goods by region. We consider two different
specifications of high and low growth rates. In one there is equal percentage variation
in growth rates across high and low growth states by country. In the other, we
consider high growth rates as average growth rates above mean growth rates for
2000-2006, and low growth as average growth rates below the mean. For the high and
low growth scenarios we consider each will occur with probability one half, and we
compute expected utility and expected emissions.
     We then introduce different emission targets for the various growth scenarios by
using alternative forms of level and intensity target equivalence. In one case we use
equivalence in expected emissions by country, in the other the target is loser in the
form of equal expected emissions globally. In the first case, the global target implies
an equi proportional reduction in intensities by country. In the second case, the
emission level target as a common reduction in emissions intensity subject to a lower
bound on emissions intensity. We then compute the impacts of equivalent emission
intensity reductions which give the same expected emission reduction to be achieved
as under emission level targets given the BAU output of the region. We thus compute
the model utility change under high, low and BAU growth scenarios respectively for
each of the emissions targets, and then compare expected utility for high and low
growth scenarios across the two targets. We measure the impacts of use of one target
relative to another using a Hicksian money metric equivalent variation of the utility
difference expressed in $ trillion. These amounts can then be compared to the value of
GDP (discounted where discounting earlier) over the model period (30 or 50 years)




                                                                                     14
4 Model Calibrations


     We calibrate our model to a base case business as usual (BAU) scenarios for two
different model periods 2006-2036 and 2006-2056. We use an 8 country grouping, of
Brazil, Russia, India, China, US, EU, Japan, and the Rest of the World (ROW). We
construct a BAU growth profile using forward projections of 2006 data, and model
calibration to this profile determines key model parameters.
4.1 Data Description
     We use GDP growth as the measure of potential change in consumption by each
country over the period. We use averaged data between 2006 and 2000 to calculated
growth rates. We first assume that under the different (BAU, high, low) growth
scenarios, country growth rates in the period 2000-2056 remain unchanged over the
whole period of 50 years between 2006 and 2056. All the data for each time period are
forward projected based on the data for 2006. We have three components in our data
for each growth scenarios: base case data in 2006, cumulative data for 2056 given
high, BAU and low growth, and cumulative data over the period relative to the base
year for the same three growth scenarios.
     Base year output, emissions and growth rates are reported in Table 1. China,
India, Russia, Brazil, USA, EU, Japan and the Rest of the World (Row) have BAU
growth rates of 0.09, 0.07, 0.07, 0.032 0.026, 0.020, 0.17, and 0.30 respectively, given
by average growth rates of 2000 to 2006 (data from World Bank website). We use two
different specifications of high and low growth rate scenarios since these serve to
illustrate how the specification of growth scenario affects the comparison between
level and intensity targets. For the first specification, high growth scenarios use
averages of country growth rates for years between 2000 and 2006 with above mean
growth, while low growth scenarios use averages of growth rates for years between
2000 and 2006 with below mean growth. This yields high growth rates for China,
India, Russia, Brazil, USA, EU, Japan and Row of: 0.105, 0.089, 0.080, 0.042, 0.033,
0.030, 0.025, 0.037 respectively and low growth rates of 0.086, 0.043, 0.054, 0.017,
0.016, 0.013, 0.006 and 0.020 respectively. In the second specification, we use high
and low growth rate data in which we assume that high growth rates are a 50% higher
than in the relevant BAU rate in all countries, and low growth rates a 50% lower than
in the relevant BAU rate in all countries. This gives high growth rates for China, India,
Russia, Brazil, USA, EU, Japan and Row of 0.135, 0.105, 0.105, 0.048, 0.039, 0.030,

                                                                                      15
 0.025 and 0.045, and low growth rates of 0.05, 0.04, 0.04, 0.02, 0.013, 0.01, 0.008
 and 0.015 respectively. The larger the variance of BAU growth rates, then typically
 the larger the difference between high and low growth rates for eight countries. In the
 second specification of high and low growth rates, China, India, Russia and Brazil
 have more variation in growth rates than the developed countries.
       We use BAU growth rates to calibrate the temperature change function using
 BAU temperature change over the two periods drawing on key literature sources,
 including Stern (2006) and Mendelsohn (2007). This implies that in high growth
 scenarios emissions are larger and also temperature change is higher. Preferences
 towards goods and temperature change are determined for each country using
 alternative damage estimates from the same sources.

 country growth rates for 2000-2006.



 4.2 Calibration of preference parameters

     We first turn to the calibration of preference parameters. According to the Stern
 Review (2006), Mendelsohn (2006) and other literature, the damage cost of emissions
 with BAU paths ranges from 1 to 20% of GDP out to 2050. We treat damage from
 climate change in the model as a utility change of the same proportion over the same
 time and use it to calibrate the preference parameters in the model. Without
 temperature change, the utility function is:

                                                                                                            16
              U i* = RCi                                            (12)

     And with damage we have :

                              H − ∆T β
             U i* / U i = (         )                               (13)
                                H

    With temperature change, there will be a loss from damage. We can thus calibrate
β using equation (13) above for given different values of H. A time period of 50
years as the base case yields the β values reported in Table 2. In our simulation
analysis, we use H=10 as the base case, and perform sensitivity analysis with H=20
and H=30.
   We next turn to the temperature change function. The temperature change function
is written as a function of emission changes. We treat it as a power function of total
emission (not output) change for the world:
                ∆T = a(           ∆Ei )b                     (14)
                              i


   Based on the results from Stern Review (2006), the BAU path of emissions will
lead to about 3 degree temperature increases around the year 2035, and near 5 degree
C by around 2050. For simplicity, we assume that zero growth in the global economy
will lead to no temperature change.
     With the data on growth rates and emission intensities for each country under the
BAU growth scenarios, we can calibrate the parameters a and b. We have data for
year 2006 and projections emission and output data for 2036 and 2056. For simplicity,
we choose 2006 as the base year, and assume that 30 years later, that is by 2036, the
global average temperature will increase by 3 degrees, and 5 degrees by 2056. We
assume that the BAU path implies output growth for each country comparable to that
of 2000-2006, while emission intensities are unchanged from 2006. We are able to
relax this assumption to allow for autonomous (exogenous) improvements in energy
efficiency (intensity) overtime. Table 2 also reports the calibrated values of a and b.




                                                                                          17

5. Results of Model Experiments

      Using the 2 alternative specifications of high and low country growth rates, and
the two different specifications of equivalence between level and intensity targets, we
can make 4 calculations of country welfare under alternative emission reduction
targets. We can then compute expected utility under level and intensity targets for
each country for each of 4 specifications (with differences in the sense of equivalence
of the intensity target, and the setting of high and low growth rates). We can also
compare the distributional implications across countries in the sense of intensity
equivalence (absolute or proportional). We can also compare how other model
features, such as timeframe, commitment level, and assumed BAU damage from
climate change impact the choice of emission target both by country and globally.
      Table 3 reports the reductions in emission intensity over the model period
implied by alternative level equivalent experiments. This intensity reduction is an equi
proportional reduction of 20% in emissions intensity implemented over the whole of
the model period of either 30 or 50 years, equivalent in expectations form to a 20%
level reduction. The second reduction is an equal absolute reduction in emissions
intensity calculated to give the same expected global reduction as both the level
commitment and the other intensity commitment. We use a lower bound of an 80%
absolute emission intensity reduction to preclude country cases (EU & Japan) where
emission intensity reductions would otherwise be negative.

  The reductions in intensity by country in each case are calculated so as to generate equal expected reductions in
emissions.

       In Table 4 we report welfare impacts by country of emission reductions in the
certainty case for two alternative reductions of 20% and 30% as this provides a basis
for comparison of the alternative intensity commitments in the growth uncertainty
cases. It has been acknowledged in literature for some time that only with large BAU
damage costs from climate change countries individually benefit in narrow self
interest terms from climate change reduction. Here we assume a 10% damage
estimate in calibrating the model and in both 20% and 30% reduction cases all
countries lose. Proportional to size China loses the most reflecting both its size and
high emission intensity. The issue with levels versus intensity targets in this case is
thus under which instrument are expected losses larger or smaller, and for which
country.

measures are in Hicksian money metric form over the whole model period of 50 years.
We use the two different specifications of equivalence (equal proportional, equal
absolute) discussed earlier. We also use the two different growth rates scenarios set
out above.
     These results indicate how both for individual countries and globally these
comparisons can produce either level or intensity preference. Globally, under
high/low growth specification (1) proportional intensity targets are preferred to level
targets but this result is reversed under high/low growth specification (2). Under
growth specification (2) all countries gain from the use of a level target relative to an
equivalent intensity target, reflecting the added uncertainty created by intensity targets.
All countries except China gain from intensity targets with the alternative
specification of high and low growth rates.
     Results for the comparison of proportional and absolute intensity commitment by
country show significant distributional variation by country. Countries with high BAU
intensities (China, India) are considerably worse off with proportional intensity targets
and the US and the EU are much better off.

  Growth rate specification (1) uses average growth rates above and below mean for 2000-2006. Growth rate specification (2) uses growth rates 50% higher and 50% lower than BAU growth
rates.

   Table 6 reports results for the same comparison as in Table 5, but where the
timeframe is varied to run from 2006-2036 instead of 2006-2056. These welfare
comparisons report lower numbers in $ trillion for the shorter timeframe since the
economy is smaller in size, but under growth rate specification (2) the gains from
using proportional intensity targets while still all positive, are proportional to GDP
lower. For growth rate specification (1), these are 4 results of change in sign in the
comparison, and 4 cases where loses increase in size. Under absolute equivalence a
similar picture of change emerges, emphasizing the sensitivity of these comparisons
to specification.

       In Table 7 we report results for variations in the depth of commitment in
comparisons between level and level equivalent intensity targets for the same 2
growth rate specifications and the two cases of absolute and proportional equivalence.
In these cases, for growth rate specification (2), the welfare gain accruing to countries
in level equivalent intensity target specification from using proportional intensity
equivalence increases sharply for all countries with deeper commitments, except the
US. For growth rate specification (1) for 7 of 8 losses become gains; China is the
exception. Similar changes occur for absolute rather than proportional senses of
equivalence, and for the US relative loses from absolute equivalent targets increase.

       In Table 8, we report results where we instead compare the welfare impacts of
mixed packages of level and intensity commitments to the outcome under common
20% level reduction commitments. As this is a potential outcome from the
Copenhagen negotiations, these results are of special interest.
       For proportional equivalence under both growth scenarios (1) & (2) we show
loses to the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) and gains to the large
OECD (EU, US, Japan). Under growth scenario (2) these effects are large. Under
absolute equivalence, the losses to BRIC are smaller and under growth scenario (1)
for absolute equivalence gains occur.
       If intensity targets are restricted in their use to China, under growth scenario (1)
gains accrue to China and losses to all others for both absolute and proportional
equivalence. Results reverse for growth scenario (2).

       In Table 9 we report results from cases in which the BAU damage cost
assumption used to calibrate preferences in the model is varied prior to
comparisons of level and level equivalent intensity commitments. These cases are
computed once again for the two different growth scenarios and under differing
senses of equivalence. For growth scenario (1), increasing the damage cost
increases gains and reduces losses for all countries for proportional equivalence.
For growth scenario (2) results go uniformly in the opposite direction for
proportional equivalence. Different results are obtained for absolute equivalence.

6   Concluding Remarks


     This paper reports numerical simulation results comparing the use of level and
level equivalent intensity commitments to carbon emissions reduction by large
countries in potential global treaty arrangements convening potential commitment
periods of 30 or 50 years. The current Copenhagen 2009 negotiation on a post Kyoto
world have seen low wage rapidly growing economies, such as China and India argue
that they should take on intensity targets rather than level targets as this will allow
them room to grow given their prospective high GDP growth rates. There has been
considerable policy discussion of this issue, but (to our knowledge) no work in an
analytical framework.
     Here we use a multi country trade model augmented by temperature change
intensity in preferences in which countries set aside part of their endowment to meet
emissions reductions and lower utility and reduce global temperature change and
raised utility (of all countries). This model is calibrated to two alternative BAU
growth profiles for 2006-2036 and 2006-2056.
     The main feature of our results is that country impacts can be either positive or
negative, and significant or insignificant depending on a range of factors. These
include the way in which uncertainty is specified in the model via differing country
high and low growth scenarios, the way in which level equivalence for intensity
targets is specified, the timeframe used, the depth of commitments, and (to a smaller
degree) elasticity values. Cases occur in which level targets significantly dominate
intensity target for all countries, opposite to current policy opinion. Also, mixed level
and intensity targets seem to favor rapidly growing low wage economies including
China and India. Proportional equivalence is preferable for OECD over non OECD
economies and vice versa for absolute equivalence. The conclusion offered is that in
this framework unambiguous claims for level or intensity seem unsupportable, but
insights on potential impacts can be obtained via numerical modeling once specific
proposals and circumstances.
