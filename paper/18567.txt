                                          ABSTRACT

Because consumer reviews leverage the wisdom of the crowd, the way in which they are
aggregated is a central decision faced by platforms. We explore this "rating aggregation problem"
and offer a structural approach to solving it, allowing for (1) reviewers to vary in stringency and
accuracy, (2) reviewers to be influenced by existing reviews, and (3) product quality to change
over time. Applying this to restaurant reviews from Yelp.com, we construct an adjusted average
rating and show that even a simple algorithm can lead to large information efficiency gains
relative to the arithmetic average.

1        Introduction

The digital age has transformed the way that consumers learn about product quality. Websites
ranging from Yelp and TripAdvisor to eBay and Amazon use crowdsourcing to generate product
ratings and reviews. This has dramatically increased the amount of information consumers
have when making a decision. Intuitively, the value of this information increases in the number
of reviews being left. However, the more reviews that are left, the more time-consuming and
difficult it becomes for a consumer to process the underlying information. This calls for the
platform to generate an easy-to-understand metric that summarizes existing reviews on a specific
subject. In this paper, we analyze ratings on a restaurant review website (Yelp.com) and develop
a method to systematically aggregate individual ratings into one adjusted average rating.
        Why focus on one single metric? In principle, the platform could simply present all reviews
and allow consumers to decide for themselves how to aggregate information. Yet a growing lit-
erature has demonstrated that the impact of information depends not only on the informational
content but also on the salience and simplicity of the information (Brown et al. 2010, Luca
and Smith 2013, Pope 2009). Many platforms, including Yelp, highlight the arithmetic mean of
consumer ratings as one aggregation of product quality. Both data analysis and online survey
suggest that Yelp consumers pay more attention to the aggregate rating.1 There is also evidence
that only a tiny fraction of consumers actively create content while the vast majority read re-
views without responding.2 Because most review users are inattentive, the method chosen to
aggregate ratings is of first-order importance.
        Using the simple average to aggregate ratings imposes restrictive assumptions on the infor-
mational content of ratings. If each rating is an unbiased, i.i.d. signal of the constant, true
quality, the simple average is statistically efficient. However, it is easy to imagine situations in
which this is not the case. For example, consider two hypothetical restaurants. The first one
receives 2-star ratings for 12 months and then 4-star ratings for the next 12 months. The second
restaurant has the same set of ratings but in the opposite order: receiving 4s early, and then
getting many 2s. Yelp would present the same average rating for these two restaurants after
24 months. However, a reader would likely favor a restaurant with an upward trend than a
downward trend.
    1
     Luca (2011) shows that Yelp consumers respond directly to the average rating even though it is coarser
than the underlying information. The importance of the average rating is also supported by an online survey
we conducted for this study. In this survey, we ask subjects to report their general use and understanding of
restaurant ratings, without mentioning Yelp. Out of the 239 respondents, 93.7% use the average rating to choose a
restaurant, but a much lower percentage of respondents said that they pay attention to other review information
such as the number of reviews, rating trends, or reviewer profile. More details of the survey are presented in
Section 6.
   2
     Yelp had 167 million unique visitors per month in the first quarter of 2016 (source:
http://www.yelp.com/factsheet), but according to a 2011 blog post of Yelp, journalist Susan Kuchinskas
estimated that “only 1 percent of users will actively create content. Another 9 percent, the editors, will
participate by commenting, rating, or sharing the content. The other 90 percent watch, look, and read without
responding.” (https://www.yelpblog.com/2011/06/yelp-and-the-1990-rule, accessed on June 5, 2016).



                                                       1
    The goal of this paper is to create a systematic aggregation of consumer ratings, as a proxy
of the concurrent vertical quality of a restaurant. To do so, we create an adjusted average
rating that satisfies two criteria: first, observable preferences and biases of different types of
reviewers must be separated from a reviewer’s signal of vertical quality; second, ratings must be
weighted to account for their informativeness, with more weight assigned to ratings containing
more information. Our hope is to shed light on the rating aggregation problem, and to move
toward optimal aggregation of consumer ratings – where the definition of optimal depends on
the objective of the platform.
    To derive an aggregation algorithm that meets the above two criteria, we develop a structural
model. The model focuses on a reviewer’s rating decision after she visits a restaurant, observes
a vertical quality signal of the restaurant, and decides to review it on Yelp. We allow reviewers
to vary in accuracy (some reviewers are more precise than others), stringency (some reviewers
leave systematically lower ratings)3 , and social incentives (some reviewers may prefer to conform
to or deviate from prior ratings), conditional on observed attributes of reviewers and the timing
of reviews. We also account for the fact that a restaurant’s quality can change over time. The
model is estimated using the entire Yelp rating history for 4,101 restaurants in Seattle, including
the reviewer identity of each rating.
    Our model is subject to an important caveat: because our data do not contain any in-
formation on the consumers who choose not to patronize a restaurant, or the consumers who
patronize the restaurant but do not leave a review, we cannot explicitly model reviewer selection
and identify it in the real data. That being said, we control for as many reviewer characteristics
as possible, including the elite status of the reviewer, the number and frequency of her reviews,
and the type of restaurants she has reviewed previoåusly. Our model also allows restaurant
ratings to follow a time trend since the first review on the same restaurant. Li and Hitt (2008)
have demonstrated a downward trend of ratings on Amazon book reviews, which they interpret
as a “chilling effect” driven by the fact that an enthusiastic consumer is likely to purchase and
review the book earlier than a general consumer. In our case, the trend could reflect reviewer
selection or a decline of real restaurant quality. We do not have enough data to tease out these
two, but if reviewer selection is one reason driving the chilling effect, it is implicitly controlled
for in the time trend.
    With that caveat in mind, we are able to estimate the model using rating variation across
reviewers, restaurants, and time. Assuming reviewers can observe all previous ratings and
unpack their information contents (in rational expectation), we back out consumers’ quality
signals and use the Bayesian method to construct the posterior belief of restaurant quality given
all the ratings available at any particular time. This posterior belief is defined as our “adjusted
   3
     We assume that horizontal preferences of reviewers affects reviewer stringency. Hence, when we present the
vertical quality to general readers of Yelp reviews, we should benchmark the adjusted average to the stringency
of one type of reviewers. We choose to benchmark it to a reviewer with average attributes. The construction of
reviewer horizontal preference is presented in Section 2.1.



                                                      2
average”.
       Empirical estimation sheds light on a few interesting findings. For instance, we find that elite
reviewers observe quality signal with a higher precision than non-elite reviewers, suggesting that
elite reviews should carry more weight in the aggregated rating.4 Elite and non-elite reviewers
also differ in their social incentives: assuming restaurant quality changes by quarter, we find that
elite reviewers put a small, positive weight on past ratings when they report their own signal, but
non-elite reviewers place a negative weight on past ratings. This implies that when a non-elite
reviewer draws a quality signal that is different from her belief based on past ratings, she tends
to overweight her own signal, as if to emphasize how her signal differs from previous ratings. In
contrast, elite reviewers tend to (slightly) herd with previous ratings, probably because they care
about their social status on Yelp and therefore have stronger social incentives. Moreover, we
find that reviewer stringency differs by number and frequency of restaurant reviews, the variety
of restaurants the reviewer has been to in the past, and whether the reviewer is reviewing a
restaurant similar in cuisine type to the ones she has often reviewed before. Above all, these
findings suggest that reviewer history and attributes should be accounted for when we aggregate
ratings into one adjusted average.
       The empirical estimates also highlight the importance of quality change and time trend.
We show that much of the adjusted-vs-simple-average difference is driven by the evolution of
restaurant quality. This is because the simple average weights every rating equally despite quality
changes but the adjusted average increases the weight assigned to more recent ratings and hence
adapts to changes in quality. More importantly, our results suggests that simple average deviates
more from true quality as the number of ratings grows over time. This is intuitive, as the most
recent rating should be the most informative about concurrent quality, but the simple average
tends to give less and less weight to the latest rating as ratings accumulate. Consistent with Li
and Hitt (2008), we find a significant downward trend of reviews within a restaurant. Depending
on how we interpret this trend, we find 19.1-41.38% of the simple average ratings are more than
0.15 stars away from our adjusted ratings, and 5.33-19.1% are more than 0.25 stars away at the
end of our sample period. The deviation grows significantly over time, suggesting that large
differences could be made by implementing our aggregated ratings, especially as Yelp grows.
       In addition to empirical estimation, we use simulations to demonstrate the advantage of our
algorithm. After simulating true quality and reviewer ratings, we compute the adjusted and
simple averages, and contrast them to the true quality at the time of aggregation. In theory,
based on our Bayesian model assumptions, the Kalman filter used by the adjusted average is
the best for linear models with Gaussian errors (in term of consistency and minimizing mean
square error) and thus should be better than the simple average (Ljungqvist and Sargent 2012;
Welch and Bishop 2001). Our simulation confirms this argument.
       In another validity check, we conducted an online survey and asked subjects directly how
   4
   The “Elite” status is a badge displayed next to the reviewer name, and is rewarded by Yelp to prolific reviewers
who write high quality reviews.


                                                        3
they use restaurant ratings (without mentioning Yelp). The key rationale behind our algorithm
– namely more weight should be given to more recent reviews and more precise reviews – are
consistent with the preference reported by the survey subjects. Because this survey is completely
independent of our model and data, its consistency extends support to our model.
       We contribute to the growing literatures on information aggregation and consumer reviews.
Like Li and Hitt (2008), we find a downward trend of ratings within the same product. Li
and Hitt attribute it to reviewer selection, but we are open to the idea that it may capture
reviewer selection or real quality decline. Our algorithm generates different adjusted averages,
depending on how we interpret the downward trend. Researchers have tried other ways to
improve aggregate ratings. For example, Glazer et al. (2008) have considered alternatives to
simple average ratings in the context of health plan report cards, but their work is largely
theoretical. Ghose, Ipeirotis and Li (2012) have aggregated ratings via demand estimation.5
Two other concurrent papers have independently studied bias in online reviews. First, Nosko
and Tadelis (2015) were concerned about bias in seller reputations on online platforms. Using
eBay transaction data, they construct a new quality measure that takes into account the non-
response from buyers. By running a controlled experiment that promotes the search ranking
of better quality sellers using the the adjusted quality measure, they find that the new ranking
algorithm increases retention of buyers. Second, Fradkin et al. (2017) studied how the design
of the feedback system of Airbnb affect the informativeness of ratings and reviews. These three
papers all rely on observing the transaction data in conjunction with the consumer reviews.
In comparison, we design the review aggregation algorithm without complementary data on
how consumers use such reviews when they choose a product. This form of data constraint is
faced by many opinion generation websites that offer consumer ratings but do not sell the rated
products.6 Finally, our model of social incentives is related to the vast literature on information
cascade and observational learning such as Banerjee (1992) and Bikhchandani et al. (1992), and
more recently, Alevy et al. (2007), and Eyster and Rabin (2010). The simple average presented
by the platform is similar to the naive individual in Eyster and Rabin (2010) who believes that
each previous person’s action reflects solely that person’s private information and ignores the
fact that each previous person’s action already embeds early movers’ signals. As a result, the
model predicts that the crowd will herd on incorrect actions with positive probability even in
rich-information settings. Our paper complements this literature by empirically estimating the
   5
     Based on hotel reservation data from Travelocity.com, which include consumer-generated reviews from Trav-
elocity.com and TripAdvisor.com, Ghose, Ipeirotis and Li (2012) estimate consumer demand for various product
attributes and then rank products according to estimated “expected utility gain.”
   6
     Readers interested in consumer usage of Yelp reviews can refer to Luca (2011), who combines the same Yelp
data as in this paper with restaurant revenue data from Seattle. More generally, there is strong evidence that
consumer reviews are an important source of information in a variety of settings. Chevalier and Mayzlin (2006)
find predictive power of consumer rating on book sales. Both Godes and Mayzlin (2004) and Duan, Gu, and
Whinston (2008) find the spread of word-of-mouth affects sales by bringing the consumer awareness of consumers;
the former measure the spread by the “the dispersion of conversations across communities” and the latter by the
volume of reviews. Duan et al. (2008) argue that after the endogenous correlation among ratings, online user
reviews have no significant impact on movies’ box office revenues.

degree of herding (or deviation) on a real consumer review website. Though our estimation finds
herding and deviation to be statistically significant, their magnitudes are small and their impact
on the aggregate ratings is less than that of quality change and time trend.


2        Model and Estimation
Consider a consumer review website that has already gathered many consumer ratings on many
products over a period of time. Our goal is to systematically summarize these ratings into a
single metric of concurrent quality for each product. In this section, we present a reviewer rating
model in which the reviewer chooses how to rate a restaurant in her review after she visits the
restaurant, observes a quality signal at the restaurant, and decides to review it on Yelp. As
detailed below, because our data consist of reviewer ratings only, we have to focus on the rating
stage and abstract away from reviewer selection that may occur before that stage.

2.1        Model Setup
Consider reviewer i who writes a review for restaurant r at calendar time tn .7 As the nth
reviewer of r, she observes her own signal srtn as well as all the n ≠ 1 reviews of r before her
{xr1 , xr2 , ..., xrn≠1 }. srtn is assumed to be an unbiased but noisy signal of the true quality
µrtn such that srtn = µrtn + ‘rn where ‘rn ≥ N (0, ‡i2 ). We assume the noise has the same
variance when reviewer i visits different restaurants. This way, we can denote the precision of
                                       1
reviewer i’s information as vi =      ‡i2
                                          .   Because r and n jointly identify a unique reviewer, we use
i interchangeably with the combination of r and n.
        We consider two incentives for reviewer i to determine what to write in the review. The first
incentive is to speak out her own emotion and obtain personal satisfaction from it. If satisfaction
comes from expressing the true feeling, this incentive motivates her to report her own signal. If i
obtains psychological gains from reporting the signal with certain deviation, which we denote as
stringency ◊rn ”= 0, then she will be motivated to report her signal plus her stringency measure.8
        The second incentive is the reviewer’s social incentive that may generate a positive or negative
correlation across ratings ((Muchnik et al., 2013). For example, a social-conscious reviewer
may want to write a review that echoes the experience of all potential users so that she can
receive favorable comments on her review, generate/satisfy followers, and maintain high status
on Yelp (Chen et al., 2010). Because most Yelp users read but do not write reviews, the above
social incentive goes beyond a typical reputation game where earlier movers may strategically
manipulate the behavior of later movers. Given the difficulty to model the mind of users who
read reviews only (we have no data on them), we assume this social incentive motivates a
    7
     We assume that a reviewer submits one review for a restaurant. Therefore, the order of the review indicates
the reviewer’s identity. On Yelp.com, reviewers are only allowed to display one review per restaurant.
   8
     Some reviewers are by nature generous and obtain psychological gains from submitting reviews that are more
favorable than what they actually feel. In this case, ◊rn > 0 represents leniency.


                                                        5
reviewer to be “right” about the true restaurant quality. Alternatively, we can also interpret
such motivation by a desire to contribute to a public good and with no strategic intention to
influence future reviewers. In this sense, the reviewer is seeking to express the truth. While the
above social incentive generates positive herding, there might also be incentives for a reviewer to
deviate from previous ratings. For example, if one reviewer expects a restaurant to be a 4-star
experience after reading others’ reviews, her actual 3-star experience may motivate her to give
the restaurant 2-stars, not only out of disappointment but also out of an intention to pull Yelp-
reported simple average closer to her own experience. Whether conforming or differentiating,
social incentives imply that reviewers put some weight on prior ratings. We identify such weight
from reviewers’ rating behavior, but do not attempt to distinguish the psychological factors
behind social incentives.
    In particular, if reviewer i is motivated to best guess the true restaurant quality, we can
model her choosing review xrtn in order to minimize a loss function:

         (1)
        Frn  = (1 ≠ ﬂi )(xrtn ≠ (srtn + ◊rn ))2 + ﬂi [xrtn ≠ E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , ...xrtn≠1 , srtn )]2   (1)

where E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , ...xrt{n≠1} , srtn ) is the posterior belief of true quality µrtn , ◊rn is the
subjective stringency of reviewer i, and 0 Æ ﬂi Æ 1 is the weight that i puts on the importance
                                                                                                   (1)
of being “right” about the true quality in her report. The rating that minimizes Frn is:

                     (1)
                 xrtn      = (1 ≠ ﬂi )(◊rn + srtn ) + ﬂi E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , ..xrtn≠1 , srtn )          (2)

where ⁄rn = (1 ≠ ﬂi )◊rn represents the stringency or bias of reviewer i for restaurant r. The
more reviewer i cares about being “right” about the true quality, the more positive is ﬂi . In
Appendix A, we show an alternative model to capture reviewer incentive to differentiate from
prior ratings. It gives rise to exactly the same equation except for ﬂi < 0. For this reason, our
empirical estimation does not impose a sign on ﬂi .
    It is worth noting that the above model assumes each reviewer is fully rational thus has
perfect information about the other reviewers’ observable attributes. This knowledge allows
her to first back out each reviewer’s signal before her, and then compute the posterior belief of
quality E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , ...xrt{n≠1} , srtn ). In the empirical section, we will present an alternative
model of limited attention and show that it does not fit the data as well as our Bayesian model.



Restaurant Quality Change If restaurant quality is constant over time and every reviewer
is unbiased, then aggregation of consumer reviews is straightforward: even a simple average of
reviews will generate an unbiased indicator of true quality, and adjusted aggregation can only
improve efficiency by giving more weight to more precise reviewers or reviewers with greater
social incentives.


                                                         6
       However, the assumption of constant restaurant quality is unrealistic. The restaurant indus-
try is known for high labor turnover as well as high entry and exit rates. A new chef or a new
manager could change a restaurant significantly; even a sloppy waiter could generate massive
consumer complaints in a short time. In reality, consumer reviews and restaurant quality may
move together because reviews reflect restaurant quality, or restaurant owners may adjust a
restaurant’s menu, management style, or labor force in response to consumer reviews. Without
any direct data on restaurant quality, it is difficult to separate the two. In light of the difficulty,
we impose an independent structure on restaurant quality change and shy away from an endoge-
nous generation of restaurant quality in response to consumer reviews. This way, we focus on
measures of restaurant quality rather than reasons underlying quality change.
       In particular, we assume quality evolution follows a martingale random walk process:µrt =
µr(t≠1) + ›t , where t denotes the units of calendar time since restaurant r has first been reviewed
and the t-specific evolution ›t conforms to ›t ≥ i.i.d N (0, ‡›2 ). This martingale process introduces
a positive correlation of restaurant quality over time, which increases with the timing of the
earlier date (t) but is independent of the time between t and tÕ .9 Recall that xrtn is the nth
review written at time tn since r was first reviewed. We can express the nth reviewer’s signal as
srtn = µrtn + ‘rn , where µrtn = µrtn≠1 + ›tn≠1 +1 + ›tn≠1 +2 + ... + ›tn . 10

Reviewer Heterogeneity and Reviewer-Restaurant Match                                In addition to random changes
in restaurant quality and random noise in reviewer signal, reviewers may differ in stringency,
social incentives, and signal precision. Systematic information aggregation should account for
these differences.
       One observable reviewer heterogeneity is elite status. We allow elite reviewers to have {ﬂe , ‡e2 }
                                           2 }. If elite reviewers are able to obtain more precise
while all non-elite reviewers have {ﬂne , ‡ne
signals of restaurant quality and care more about their social status on Yelp, we expect ﬂe > ﬂne
and ‡e2 < ‡ne
           2 . We also allow elite and non-elite reviewers to have different stringencies, ⁄ and
                                                                                            e
⁄ne .
       The second reviewer attribute we use is the number of reviews that reviewer i has submitted
for Seattle restaurants before writing a new review for restaurant r at time t. We denote it as
N umRevit . Another reviewer attribute is review frequency of i at t, defined as the number of
reviews i has submitted up to t divided by the number of calendar days from her first review
to t. Review frequency allows us to capture the possibility that a reviewer who has submitted
two reviews 10 months apart is fundamentally different from a reviewer who has submitted two
reviews within two days, even though both reviewers have the same number of reviews on Yelp.
We denote review frequency of i at t as F reqRevit .
   9
    The correlation structure is detailed in Appendix B.3.
  10
    Note that the martingale assumption entails two features in the stochastic process: first, conditional on µrtn≠1 ,
µrtn is independent of the past signals {srt1 , ..., srtn≠1 }; second, conditional on µrtn , srtn is independent of the
past signals {srt1 , ..., srtn≠1 }. These two features greatly facilitate reviewer n’s Bayesian estimate of restaurant
quality. This is also why we choose martingale over other statistical processes (such as AR(1)).


                                                          7
    We also attempt to capture the heterogeneity in reviewer taste by reviewer-restaurant match.
In reality, reviewers may have differentiated preference for cuisine type and sort themselves into
different restaurants at different times. Although we do not have enough information to model
the sorting explicitly, we can describe reviewer-restaurant match by comparing characteristics
of the restaurants with the average restaurants the reviewer has written reviews for in the
past. In particular, we use 14 cuisine type indicators and 5 price categories defined by Yelp11
and decompose them into 8 orthogonal factors Fr = [fr,1 , ..., fr,8 ].12 We use Fil to denote the
                                                                                              1    qm≠1
vector of factors of the lth restaurant that reviewer i visited, and f il,q =                m≠1     l=1   fil,q to
denote the mean in factor q among the m ≠ 1 restaurants that i has visited. We then collapse
                                                        1    qm≠1
a reviewer history into two metrics: Cit (=            m≠1     l=1   Fil ,) measures the average restaurant
               Ò has written reviews for before she writes her m review at time t; and
that this reviewer                                              th
                    q8     1    qm≠1
T asteV arit (=       q=1 m≠2      l=1   (fil,q ≠ f il,q )2 ) measures the variety of m ≠ 1 restaurants that
she has written reviews for before her mth review at time t.13 When reviewer i writes a review
for restaurant r, we have a pair of {Cit , Fr } to describe the reviewer taste and restaurant
characteristics. Assuming that reviewer i reviews restaurant r at time t, we define the reviewer-
restaurant matching distance as M atchDrit = (Cit ≠ Fr )Õ (Cit ≠ Fr ).The shorter the matching
distance, the better the match is between the restaurant and the reviewer’s review history.
    To summarize, we have five reviewer attributes: elite status (Elitei ), number of reviews
(N umRevit ), frequency of reviews (F reqRevit ), matching distance between reviewer and restau-
rant (M atchDrit ), and taste for variety (T asteV arit ). In the empirical model, we allow elite
status to affect ﬂ in equation (2) and allow all other characteristics to affect only ⁄.14

Time Trend In addition to all the above, we also record the number of calendar days since
restaurant r received its first review on Yelp until a reviewer is about to enter the review for
r at time t. This variable, denoted as Agert , attempts to capture any trend in consumer re-
views that is missed by the above-mentioned reviewer or restaurant variables. This is on top
of year fixed effects, (Y eart ), which already captures the overall stringency or taste change of
the Seattle population from one year to another.15 By definition, this trend – which turns out
to be negative and concave over time when we estimate it in quadratic terms – is subject to
  11
     The cuisine indicators describe whether a restaurant is traditional American, new American, European,
Mediterranean, Latin American, Asian, Japanese, seafood, fast food, lounge, bar, bakery/coffee, vegetarian, or
others. They are not mutually exclusive. The five price categories are (1,2,3,4) as defined by Yelp plus a missing
price category (which we code as 0).
  12
     By construction, the sample mean of each factor is normalized to 0 and sample variance normalized to 1.
  13
     If reviewer i has not reviewed any restaurant yet, we set her taste equal to the mean characteristics of
restaurants (Cit = 0).
  14
     We have tried to estimate the model that allows ﬂi to vary by reviewer attributes other than elite status, but
none of other attributes significantly affect ﬂ based on the likelihood ratio test.
  15
     Our model of time trend in addition to year fixed effects is consistent with Godes and Silva (2012), who
suggest that the negative temporal trend may be due to the fact that that reviewers are becoming more critical
and more negative in general, and they find that after conditioning on the year a review was written, ratings
increase over time. In our case, the time trend since the first review of a restaurant remains negative after we
control for year fixed effects.


                                                        8
multiple interpretations. It is possible that true restaurant quality declines over time for every
restaurant.16 It is also possible that later reviewers are always harsher than early reviewers.
Either interpretation can be a result of a chilling effect as described in Li and Hitt (2008) and
we are unable to distinguish the two. When we calculate the adjusted average, we use the two
extreme interpretations separately, in order to bound the true adjusted average.



Summary           Above all, we assume: {ﬂe , ﬂne } capture the social incentives of elite and non-elite
reviewers,     {‡e2 , ‡ne
                       2 }   capture the signal precision of elite and non-elite reviewers, {–age1 , –age2 }
capture the catch-all trend in restaurant quality or reviewer stringency change,17 {–f reqrev ,
–matchd , –tastevar } capture how restaurant and reviewer attributes change the stringency of non-
elite reviewers, and {⁄(e≠ne)0 , — age1 , —age2 , —numrev , —f reqrev , —matchd , —tastevar } capture how
restaurant and reviewer attributes change the stringency difference between elite and non-elite
reviewers. We also include year fixed effects {–yeart } in ⁄ri to capture the possibility that
reviewer stringency may vary by calendar year due to taste change in the general population.18
     Note that our model allows restaurant fixed effects, which capture the initial restaurant
quality at the time of the first review. This is why we do not include any time-invariant restaurant
attributes in ⁄ri . To incorporate the possibility that different types of restaurants may differ in
our key parameters regarding the precision of restaurant signals and the evolution of restaurant
quality, we also estimate a model that allows {‡e2 , ‡ne
                                                      2 ,–                2
                                                          age1 , –age2 , ‡› } to differ by ethnic and
non-ethnic restaurants, where a restaurant is defined as “ethnic” if it offers cuisine from a specific
country other than the US, according to Yelp classification.

2.2      Model Estimation and Identification
Maximum Likelihood Estimation                           According to the derivation of E(µrtn |srt1 , ...srtn ) illus-
trated in Appendix B.2, we can write out the probability distribution of all the Nr reviews
of restaurant r, namely L(xrt1 , xrt2 , ..xrtNr ), and then estimate parameters by maximizing the
                                                                                          qR                                  19
combined log likelihood of all reviews of all R restaurants logL =                           r=1 logL(xrt1 , xrt2 , ..xrtNr ).
     Consistent estimation of all other parameters depends on estimating restaurants’ initial qual-
          r=1 consistently, which requires that the number of reviews of each restaurant goes to
ity {µr0 }R
infinity. But in our data, the number of reviews per restaurant has a mean of 33 and a median of
   16
      Note that this decline is in addition to the random walk evolution of restaurant quality because the martingale
deviation is assumed to have a mean of zero.
   17
      We define the raw age by calendar days since a restaurant’s first review on Yelp and normalize the age
variable in our estimation by (raw age-548)/10. We choose to normalize age relative to the 548th day because the
downward trend of reviews is steeper in a restaurant’s early reviews and flattens at roughly 1.5 years after the
first review.
   18
      A summary of the statistical data generating process is available in Appendix B.1.
   19
      The parameters to be estimated are {µr0 }R         r=1 ,‡› , (‡e , ‡ne ), (ﬂe , ﬂne ), (–yeart , –numrev , –f reqrev , –matchd ,
–tastevar , ⁄(e≠ne)0 , — age1 , —age2 , —numrev , —f reqrev , —matchd , —tastevar ), and (–age1 , –age2 ). In an extended model,
we also allow {‡e , ‡ne , –age1 , –age2 , ‡› } to differ for ethnic and non-ethnic restaurants.


                                                                  9
14. When we use simulated data to test the MLE estimation of observed reviews, we find that the
                          r=1 affects the estimation of other key parameters of interest. To cir-
poor convergence of {µr0 }R
cumvent the problem, we estimate the joint likelihood of {xr2 ≠xr1 , xr3 ≠xr2 , ..., xrNr ≠xrNr ≠1 }R
                                                                                                    r=1
instead. This way, the initial restaurant qualities {µr0 }R
                                                          r=1 are cancelled out. The details to de-
rive f (xrt2 ≠ xrt1 , ..., xrtNr ≠ xrtNr ≠1 ) are shown in Appendix C.

Estimating Restaurant Quality                    Following the above model, if we interpret the quadratic
trend of ratings (Agert · –age1 + Age2rt · –age2 in ⁄rn ) as reviewer bias,20 the Bayesian estimate
of restaurant quality at time tn is defined as E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , .., xrtn ), which is equivalent to
E(µrtn |srt1 , srt2 , .., srtn ).21 If we interpret the quadratic trend of ratings as changes in true
quality, the Bayesian estimate of quality at tn is E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , .., xrtn ) + Agert · –age1 + Age2rt ·
–age2 . We will infer restaurant quality using both interpretations in Section 5.
       The Bayesian estimate of restaurant quality at tn is also our adjusted average rating. Because
we use the Kalman filter in our Bayesian calculation and the Kalman filter has been established
to be the best for linear models with Gaussian errors (in term of consistency and minimizing
mean square error), our adjusted rating should be better than the simple average (Ljungqvist
and Sargent 2012; Welch and Bishop 2001). We will later confirm this via simulation and online
survey.

Model Identification            Since our model includes restaurant fixed effects (denoted as time-0,
quality µr0 ), all our parameters are identified from within-restaurant variations. In particular,
reviewer social weight ﬂ and signal variance ‡ 2 are identified by the variance-covariance structure
of reviews within a restaurant. To see this, consider a simple case where restaurant quality is
stable (i.e. ‡›2 = 0). If everyone has the same signal variance ‡‘2 , for the nth review, we have
                            2
V ar(xrn ) = ﬂn (2≠ﬂn ) ‡n‘ +(1≠ﬂn )2 ‡‘2 . As we expect, it degenerates to ‡‘2 if the nth reviewer puts
zero weight on social incentives (ﬂn = 0). When ﬂn > 0, V ar(xrn ) declines with n. If the nth
                                                                                                                  ‡‘2
reviewer cares about social incentives only (ﬂn = 1), we have the familiar form of V ar(xrn ) =                   n .
In other words, the magnitude of a positive ﬂ determines the degree to which the variance of
reviews shrinks over time, while ‡‘2 determines the variance of the first review. When ﬂn < 0,
V ar(xrn ) increases with n. Thus the overtime variation of review variance can indicate the sign
of social incentives, if other factors are not present.
       There are overidentifications for ﬂ and ‡‘2 , because they affect not only the variance of reviews
but also the covariance between reviews. In the above simple case, the covariance of xrm and xrn
for m < n is: Cov(xrm , xrn ) = qnﬂn            vj
                                                     which declines with n, increases with ﬂn , and does not
                                          j=1
depend on the distance between m and n. This is because the covariance of reviews is generated
from reviewer n’s belief of restaurant quality, and reviewer n values the information content of
  20
      This is relative to the review submitted 1.5 years after the first review, because age is normalized by (raw age
- 548)/10.
   21
      The estimation of E(µrtn |srt1 , srt2 , .., srtn ) is detailed in Appendix B.2.


                                                           10
each review equally according to the Bayesian principle.
   Nevertheless, social incentive is not the only force that generates correlation between reviews
within a restaurant. The other force is restaurant quality evolution. How do we separate the
two? The above description has considered social incentive but no restaurant quality change
(‡›2 = 0 and ﬂ > 0). Now let us consider a model with ‡›2 > 0 and ﬂ = 0, which implies that
restaurant quality evolves over time but reviewers do not incorporate information from previous
reviews. In this case, the correlation between the nth and the (n ≠ k)th reviews only depends on
the common quality evolution before the (n ≠ k)th reviewer, not the order distance (k) or time
distance (tn ≠ tn≠k ) between the two reviews. In the third case of ‡›2 > 0 and ﬂ > 0, the nth
reviewer is aware of quality evolution and therefore puts more weight on recent reviews and less
weight on distant reviews. In particular, the correlation between the nth and the (n≠k)th reviews
depends on not only the order of review but also the time distance between the two reviews.
In short, the separate identification of the noise in quality evolution (‡›2 ) from reviewer social
incentive and signal precision {ﬂ, ‡‘2 } comes from the calendar time distance between reviews.
   As stated before, we allow both ﬂ and ‡‘2 to differ between elite and non-elite reviewers.
Because we observe who is elite and who is not, {ﬂe , ‡e2 , ﬂne , ‡ne
                                                                   2 } are identified by the variance-

covariance structure of reviews as well as the arrival order of elite and non-elite reviewers.
   The constant stringency difference between elite and non-elite reviewers ⁄(e≠ne)0 is identified
by the mean difference of elite and non-elite reviews on the same restaurant. The other pa-
rameters that capture the effect of reviewer attributes, restaurant characteristics, and reviewer-
restaurant match on reviewer stringency, namely {–yeart , –age1 , –age2 , –numrev , –f reqrev , –matchd ,
–tastevar }, {— day , —numrev , —f reqrev , —matchd , —tastevar }, are identified by how the observed rat-
ings vary by restaurant age, reviewer attributes at time t, reviewer-restaurant match, and their
interaction with elite status. It is important to note that we can only use observed variations
to identify relative differences in stringency. Moreover, because we assume stringency to be
additive to the true restaurant quality, we cannot separately identify the absolute magnitude
of stringency and true quality. This does not hamper our ability to compute the adjusted av-
erage ratings. Though each Yelp review user may have his own stringency, we benchmark the
stringency of the aggregated rating to the average stringency of all sampled reviewers.

2.3    Selection of Reviews
One limitation of our model is that we do not explicitly model the selection of consumers who
decide to leave a review. In practice, reviewers select to purchase a product and conditional on
purchase, select to leave a review. In principle, selection into a product tends to skew ratings
upward (you are more likely to eat at a restaurant that you like). The decision to review has an
ambiguous effect, depending on whether people are more likely to write a review after a good
experience or a bad one.
   A growing literature has attempted to measure the selection process by imposing struc-


                                                   11
tural assumptions. Moe and Trusov (2011) conjectured that consumer ratings reflect not only
consumers’ socially unbiased product evaluation but also the social dynamics in the product’s
ratings environment. They estimate the net effect of social influence on ratings and their subse-
quent effect on product sales. They find that social dynamics can have a direct impact on sales
through rating valence. Moe and Scheweidel (2012) presented a model in which reviewers choose
whether to rate and what rating to give jointly. They find that valence in the rating environ-
ment affects the likelihood of review, and active and inactive reviewers differ in their tendency
to review restaurants depending on whether the restaurant’s past ratings are in consensus or in
controversy with their own. Also, several other papers have discussed the importance of taking
into account the influence of selected purchase on ratings, for example, in Li and Hitt (2008),
Hu et al. (2009) and Godes and Silva (2012).22
       We do not model reviewer selection explicitly because our data do not tell us what type
of consumers choose not to patronize a restaurant, or what type of consumers patronize but
choose not to leave a review. Without such information, any structural assumption we put
on the selection process is not testable in the real data. These structural assumptions can be
arbitrary and may lead to spurious estimation results.
       That being said, we believe our model has at least partially controlled for review selection
based on observables. In particular, our model of rating heterogeneities is conditional on ob-
served reviewer attributes such as elite status, the number of reviews written, the frequency of
reviewing, and whether she visits a wide variety of restaurants. We have also conditioned on the
timing of her review relative to the restaurant rating history and the match distance between
a reviewer and the restaurant she is reviewing. If one type of reviewer is more stringent, and
they prefer to review the restaurant later rather than earlier, we control for this selection by
allowing reviewer stringency to vary by observed type and by incorporating time of review in
the Bayesian updating structure and time trend. If there is a chilling effect due to reviewer
selection (as Li and Hitt (2008) have argued), our time trend captures it in linear and quadratic
terms. We acknowledge that our controls do not absorb all sorts of reviewer selection or reviewer
heterogeneity. For example, if more stringent reviewers are only stringent when they review a
5-star restaurant but are not as stringent when they review a 3-star restaurant, that is not
captured in our model. If an individual reviewer changes her selection rule from 2004 to 2008
and this change is not the same as the population taste change, our model will miss it too.
       Our paper also complements two other concurrent papers investigating the selection process.
Wu et al. (2015) use a Bayesian learning model on data from a Chinese restaurant review website
similar to Yelp.com in order to measure the value of online reviews for consumers and firms.
They study how consumers learn from different reviewers based on the the perceived correlation
between their own tastes and the reviewers’ tastes, but they do not consider reviewers’ strategic
  22
    In Hu et al. (2009), ratings are found to follow bimodal distributions on Amazon (with many one and five
stars) and the paper attributed this to the tendency to review when opinions are extreme. We do not find the
bimodal distribution pattern on Yelp that Hu et al. (2009) provide as evidence of significant reviewer selection.


                                                       12
reporting behavior as well as quality change. Our objective is to systematically aggregate existing
ratings into one measure of restaurant quality, which is quite different from theirs. Wang et
al. (2012) examine the determinants of reviewer behavior in exploring new restaurant choices.
Although consumers’ variety seeking behavior is not the main theme of our study, we treat it
as a heterogeneous reviewer characteristic that may influence reviewer ratings. Indeed, we find
that reviewers with a wider variety of reviewing experience are relatively more stringent.


3     Yelp Data and Reduced Form Results
In this paper, we use the complete set of restaurant reviews that Yelp displayed for Seattle, WA
at our data download time in February 2010. In total, we observe 134,730 reviews for 4,101
Seattle restaurants in a 64-month period from October 15, 2004 to February 7, 2010.23 These
reviews come from 18,778 unique reviewers, of which 1,788 are elite reviewers and 16,990 are
non-elite as of the end of our data period. Yelp grants elite status to reviewers who review
often and write high quality reviews. We do not observe the change of elite status within each
reviewer; we observe only whether a reviewer has been granted elite status by the end of our
data. For our purposes, we take elite status as fixed.24 Another data limitation is that our data
contain only star ratings given in each review (one to five), but do not include the text; hence,
our analysis focuses on ratings. In our data set, 64.53% of reviewers have written at least two
reviews and 23.7% have written at least five reviews, which provides us with rich within-reviewer
variation.
    Table 1 summarizes the main variables. In the top panel of restaurant characteristics, we
note that on average each restaurant receives 33 reviews but the distribution is highly skewed
to the right, ranging from 1 to 698 with a standard deviation of 50 and median of 14. Between
the first and the last day a restaurant receives reviews, the restaurant receives on average 0.16
reviews per day. The review frequency is highly heterogeneous – it varies from 0.001 to as large
as 28 reviews per day. The arrival of reviews also varies over the lifetime of a restaurant: on
average, the second review arrives 155 days later than the first review, while the average lag is
34 days between the 11th and 12th reviews and 21 days between the 21st and 22nd reviews.
This is partly driven by the fact that most restaurants receive only two or three reviews far
apart in time, while a small fraction of restaurants are reviewed frequently.
    The bottom panel of Table 1 summarizes reviewer statistics. Although less than 10% of
reviewers are elite, an average elite reviewer writes five times more reviews than a non-elite
reviewer (i.e. 24 versus 5). As a result, elite reviewers writes about 32.5% of all reviews.
Comparing elite and non-elite reviewers, they are similar in average rating per review (both
  23
     Reviews identified by Yelp as fake reviews are removed from the Yelp pages. We do not observe these reviews
and do not consider them in our analysis.
  24
     We can potentially predict the elite status using past activities on Yelp of a reviewer, but since we do not
observe how many rating the sample reviewers have left outside Seattle, we cannot reliably predict elite status.



                                                       13
around 3.7 stars), but elite reviewers have higher review frequency, a closer match with the
restaurants they review, and slightly higher variety in taste.
       Variance decomposition in Appendix Table D.1 shows that restaurant fixed effects alone
account for 20.9% of the total variations in Yelp ratings, leaving 79.1% explained by within
restaurant variations. Furthermore, a regression that incorporates both reviewer and restaurant
fixed effects can explain almost 36% of total variations. This is less than adding the variations
accountable by reviewer or restaurant fixed effects separately, suggesting that there is some
degree of match between reviewers and restaurants.
       To check the difference between elite and non-elite reviewers, we first obtain residual ‘[
                                                                                                ri,yr
after regressing observed ratings on reviewer, restaurant, and year fixed effects (i.e. xri,year =
                                                                2
µr + –i + “year + ‘ri,year ), and then associate ‘[
                                                  ri,yr with whether the review is written by
                                                                            2
an elite reviewer and the order of a review (Nri ) (i.e. ‘[
                                                          ri,yr                 = —0 + —1 Dri,elite + —2 Nri +
—3 Nri ◊ Dri,elite + ’ri ). As shown in Appendix Table D.2, the coefficient of the elite dummy
is significantly negative, suggesting that elite reviews deviate less from the long-run average
rating of the restaurant, probably because elite reviewers have more precise signals (‡e2 < ‡ne
                                                                                             2 )

or have more social motives to conform to the crowd on Yelp (ﬂe > ﬂne ). We also examine
the kernel density of a rating’s deviation from the restaurant’s average rating beforehand and
afterward for elite and non-elite reviewers separately. We find that an elite reviewer tends to
give a rating closer to the restaurant’s average ratings before or after her, one phenomenon that
is to be expected if elite reviewers have either more precise signal or correlate their ratings more
positively to previous ratings.
       We now present reduce-form evidence for review dynamics. As detailed in Section 2, identi-
fication of our model relies on the extent to which the variance and covariance of reviews change
over time within a restaurant. If the true restaurant quality is constant and reviewers incorpo-
rate a restaurant’s previous reviews in a positive way (ﬂ > 0), we should observe reviews to vary
less over time around the restaurant’s fixed effect. This is confirmed by the negative coefficient
on the order of review in Appendix Table D.2.
       Positive social incentives also imply positive serial correlation of ratings within a restaurant
and such correlation should be stronger for close-by reviews. To check this, we regress the above-
                          ri,yr on its lags within the same restaurant. As shown in Appendix
obtained rating residual ‘[
Table D.3, the residuals are positively correlated over time, while the correlation dampens
gradually by the order distance between reviews. This is clear evidence that reviews cannot
be treated i.i.d. as the simple-average aggregation assumes. That being said, positive social
incentive is not the only explanation for this pattern: a martingale evolution of restaurant
quality could generate it as well.25 It is up to the structural model to separate the effect of
positive social incentives and quality evolution.
       Furthermore, our data show that ratings within a restaurant tend to decline over time.
  25
    Note that the martingale evolution of restaurant quality implies an increasing variance around the restaurant’s
fixed effect, while positive social incentives implies a decreasing variance.

Appendix Figure E.2 plots ‘[
                           ri,yr by the order of reviews within a restaurant in the fitted fractional
polynomial smooth and the corresponding 95% confidence interval. More than one factor could
contribute to this downward trend. Restaurant quality may decline over time, or it could be a
selection effect where a restaurant with a good rating tends to attract new customers who do
not like the restaurant as much as the old clientele, as suggested by Li and Hitt (2008).
   If selection were the primary driver of the result in our setting, we would expect later
reviewers to be a worse fit for the restaurant. To check this, we regress reviewer-restaurant
matching distance (M atchDrit ) and reviewer’s taste for variety (T asteV arrit ) on the order
of reviews within a restaurant. As shown in Appendix Table D.4, within a restaurant, later
reviewers tend to have less diverse tastes but are not significantly different from earlier reviewers
in matching distance. While this suggests that later reviewers may be better sorted with the
restaurant in terms of taste diversity, it does not explain why later reviewers tend to give
worse ratings, unless less diverse diners are more critical. The last two columns of this table
examine variations of M atchDrit and T asteV arrit within a reviewer, which turn out to be
quite different from variations within a restaurant. Within a reviewer, the later-visited (and
reviewed) restaurants are better matched with the reviewer’s taste and the reviewer has more
taste for variety when she visits and reviews the later restaurants. This suggests that an average
reviewer finds better matches over time, but is also more willing to seek variety. In other words,
M atchDrit and T asteV arrit capture at least part of the dynamic sorting between restaurants
and reviewers, although we do not model the sorting explicitly.
   One may wonder whether different types of restaurants are subject to different review dy-
namics. We explore this potential distinction between ethnic and non-ethnic restaurants. A
restaurant is defined as ethnic if its cuisine type is explicitly linked to a specific country or area
outside of the US. Out of 4,101 restaurants in our sample, 742 are classified as ethnic according
to Yelp classification of cuisine. Appendix Figure E.3 shows the polynomial smooth plot of
within restaurant rating trends by ethnic and non-ethnic restaurants separately, after we take
out restaurant fixed effects. It suggests faster decline and slower recovery in ratings for ethnic
restaurants than non-ethnic restaurants. In light of this, one version of our model allows the
within restaurant rating trend and the variance of new quality draws to differ for these two
restaurant types.
   Overall, reduce-form results yield six empirical observations related to review dynamics:
ratings are less variable over time, ratings trend downward within a restaurant, ratings are
serially correlated within a restaurant, restaurants tend to attract reviewers with less diverse
taste over time, reviewers tend to find restaurants better matched to them over time, and the
dynamics differ between ethnic and non-ethnic restaurants.

4     Results from Structural Estimation
4.1   Main Results
As described in Section 2, the parameters of interest pertain to (1) a reviewer’s stringency and
accuracy, (2) the extent to which a reviewer takes into account prior reviews, (3) the likelihood
that a restaurant has changed quality, and (4) the quality of match between the reviewer and
the restaurant. We allow these parameters to vary between elite and non-elite reviewers because
elite reviewers are a central part of the review system, as documented in Section 3.
    Table 2 presents the estimation results of our baseline structural model in four columns.
In Column (1), we estimate the model under the assumptions that restaurant quality is fixed
and reviewers have the same signal precision, social weight, and stringency. The social weight
estimate is statistically different from zero, suggesting that reviewers incorporate the content of
previous reviews. As shown in the simulation section, this will cause later reviews to receive
more weight than early reviews in the adjusted average.
    In Column (2), we allow signal precision, social weight, and stringency to differ by reviewer’s
elite status. The estimates, as well as a likelihood ratio test between Columns (1) and (2), clearly
suggest that elite and non-elite reviewers differ in both signal precision and social weight. Elite
reviewers put higher weight on past reviews and have better signal precision. That being said,
all reviewers put more than 75% weight on their own signals and the noise in their signal is
quite large considering the fact that the standard deviation of ratings in the whole sample is
of similar magnitude as the estimated ‡e and ‡ne . In terms of stringency, Column (2) suggests
insignificant differences between elite and non-elite reviewers.
    Column (3) allows restaurant quality to change in a martingale process every quarter. As
we expect, adding quality change absorbs part of the correlation across reviews, and has signif-
icantly reduced the estimate of ﬂ, but the magnitude of ﬂe ≠ ﬂne is stable at roughly 11-12%.
With quality change, ﬂne is significantly negative, suggesting that a non-elite reviewer tends to
deviate from the mean perspective of the crowd before her, after we allow positive autocorrela-
tion across reviews from restaurant quality change. One potential explanation is that non-elite
reviewers deliberately differentiate from previous reviews because they enjoy expressing a differ-
ent opinion or believe differentiation is the best way to contribute to the public good. Another
possibility is that non-elite diners are more likely to leave a review on Yelp if their own experi-
ence is significantly different from the expectation they have had from reading previous reviews.
Without further information, it is difficult to distinguish these possibilities. Compared to the
non-elite reviewers, elite reviewers are found to be more positively influenced by the past crowd.
Although the quarterly noise in restaurant quality (‡› = 0.1452) is estimated at much smaller
than the noise in reviewer signal (‡e = 0.9293 and ‡ne = 0.9850), this amounts to substantial
noise over the whole data period because a random draw of › adds up to restaurant quality
every quarter. A likelihood ratio test between Column (2) and Column (3) favors the inclusion


                                                16
of restaurant quality change.
   In addition to restaurant quality change, Column (4) allows reviewer stringency to vary by
Agert (in linear and quadratic terms), M atchDrit , T asteV arri , N umRevit , RevF reqit , and the
reviewer’s elite status. The set of coefficients that starts with µ + ⁄ne describes the stringency
of non-elite reviewers (which are not identifiable from the time-0 restaurant quality), while the
set of coefficients that starts with ⁄e ≠ ⁄ne describes the stringency difference between elite
and non-elite reviewers. According to these coefficients, reviewers are more stringent over time,
indicating a chilling effect. This chilling effect is less for elite reviewers. Moreover, reviewers who
have written more reviews on Yelp tend to match better with a restaurant and have more diverse
tastes. In comparison, an elite reviewer behaves similarly in matching distance and taste for
variety, but her stringency does not vary significantly by the number of reviews on Yelp. Again,
likelihood ratio tests favor Column (4) over Columns (1)-(3), suggesting that it is important to
incorporate restaurant quality change, reviewer heterogeneity, and signal noise all at once.
   A remaining question is, at what frequency does restaurant quality evolve? Given the lack
of hard evidence on this, we estimate models that allow restaurant quality to evolve by month,
quarter, and half-year. As shown in Appendix Table D.5, the main changes occur in the esti-
mates for ‡e , ‡ne , ‡› , ﬂe , and ﬂne . This is not surprising because they are all identified by the
variance-covariance structure of reviews within a restaurant. Nevertheless, we can identify qual-
ity evolution from reviewer signal and social preference because there are enormous variations in
how closely sequential reviews arrive. Clearly, the more frequently we allow restaurant quality
to vary, the smaller ‡› is (because it captures quality change in a smaller calendar window). By
doing this, more of the variation in ratings is attributed to quality change rather than simply
noise in a reviewer’s signal. While likelihood suggests that the raw data are better explained by
more frequent changes of restaurant quality, the difference between elite and non-elite reviewers
remains similar across the three columns in Appendix Table D.5.
   Table 3 follows the specification of Table 2 Column (4), but allows ethnic and non-ethnic
restaurants to differ in ‡e , ‡ne , ‡› , Agert , and Age2rt . As reported in Table 3, the estimates of ‡›
are statistically different from each other. Though the estimates of ‡e , ‡ne , and the coefficients
are not statistically different, the point estimates show that the downward rating trend on a
non-ethnic restaurant flattens out more quickly than on an ethnic restaurant. This is consistent
with the raw data. According to the Akaike information criterion (Akaike 1974), the model
with the ethnic-non-ethnic distinction fits the data better. In light of these results, all of our
real-data-based counterfactual simulations use estimates from Table 3.

4.2    Comparing to a Model of Limited Attention
One assumption underlying our structural model is reviewer rationality. One may argue that
the assumption of full rationality is unrealistic, given consumer preference for simple and easy-
to-understand metrics. To address the concern, we estimate an alternative model in which we


                                                   17
assume that reviewers have limited attention and use the simple average of a restaurant’s past
rating as the best guess of quality. Recall in the full model that the nth reviewer’s optimal
review should be

                     xrtn = (1 ≠ ﬂn )(◊rn + srtn ) + ﬂn E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , ..xrtn≠1 , srtn )

where E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , ...xrtn≠1 , srtn ) is the Bayesian posterior belief of true quality µrtn . If the
reviewer has limited attention, the optimal rating will change to:

                                                                          1 n≠1
                                                                              ÿ
                          xrtn = (1 ≠ ﬂn ) ◊ (◊rn + srtn ) + ﬂn ◊ (               xrti )
                                                                        n ≠ 1 i=1

                                                   1    qn≠1
where a simple average of past reviews            n≠1    i=1   xrti replaces the Bayesian posterior estimate
of quality E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , ..xrt{n≠1} , srtn ).
         In Appendix Table D.6, we compare the MLE result and log likelihood of the Bayesian
and limited attention models, while allowing restaurant quality to update by quarter. The
two models generate similar results: signals are less noisy for elite reviewers than for non-elite
reviewers, elite reviewers demonstrate more positive social incentives, there is a significant noise
in quality change per quarter, individual ratings trend downwards within a restaurant, and
reviewer heterogeneity has a significant influence on ratings. While the signs and statistical
significance of all coefficients are the same and the magnitudes of most coefficients are similar
across the two models, the social weight reviewers put on past ratingsdiffer in magnitudes. In
particular, the positive social weight of elite reviewers is higher in limited attension model (0.0721
vs. 0.0122) and the negative social weight of non-elite reviewers is much closer to zero (-0.0072
vs. -0.1221). This is not surprising because the limited attention model changes the way that
past ratings enter into a reviewer’s optimal choice of rating. The log likelihood is lower in the
limited attention model, suggesting that our Bayesian model fits the data better. According to
the Akaike information criterion (Akaike 1974), the Bayesian model is 46, 630 times as probable
as the limited attention model to minimize the information loss, if we assume quality updates
by quarter.26


5         Counterfactual Simulations
This section presents two sets of counterfactual simulations. The first set highlights the role of
each modeling element in the adjusted aggregation of simulated ratings. Using real (instead of
simulated) ratings, the second set compares the adjusted average ratings, as determined by our
algorithm, to the arithmetic average ratings currently presented on Yelp.
    26
    Specifically,    we have exp((AICBayesian           ≠ AICLimitedAttention ))      =     exp((logLBayesian   ≠
logLLimitedAttention )/2) = 46, 630.

5.1      Counterfactuals Across Model Variations Based on Simulated Ratings
The structural results presented in Section 4 stress the importance of incorporating many model-
ing elements in one single model. But how important is each element? We analyze this question
through a series of counterfactual simulations.
       Recall that the simple average is an unbiased and efficient summary of restaurant quality, if
reviewer signals are i.i.d., restaurant quality is stable, and there is no reviewer social weight or
bias. We take this condition as the benchmark, and then add each variation separately to the
benchmark. Our simulation compares the adjusted and simple averages against the simulated
true quality.
       The first model variation allows reviewers to put non-zero weight on previous reviews. When
social incentive is the only deviation from the i.i.d. assumption, the arithmetic average is
unbiased but inefficient. If later reviews have already put positive weight on past reviews, an
arithmetic average across all reviews assigns too much weight to early reviews. As a result, the
adjusted average should give more weight to later reviews. Appendix Figure E.4 presents two
cases, one with ﬂ = 1 and the other with ﬂ = 0.6, while restaurant quality is fixed at 3 and
reviewer’s signal noise is fixed at ‡‘ = 1.27 In both cases, adjusted average is more efficient
than simple average, and the efficiency improvement is greater if reviewers are more socially
concerned. However, efficiency gain over simple average is small even if the social weight is as
large as ﬂ = 0.6. Recall that our structural estimate of ﬂ never exceeds 0.25, which suggests that
the efficiency gain from accounting for ﬂ in the adjusted average is likely to be small in the real
data. Similar logic applies if later reviews put negative weight on past reviews. In that case,
adjusted weighting should give less weight to early reviews. The simulated figure that compares
adjusted average with simple average is very similar, with adjusted average being more efficient.


       The second model variation is to allow elite reviewers to have signals that are of different
precision than non-elite reviewers. Again, since we disallow reviewers to differ in stringency or
restaurants to change quality, an arithmetic average is going to be unbiased but inefficient. As
shown in Appendix Figure E.5, the more precise the elite reviewers’ signals are relative to other
reviewers, the larger the efficiency gain is for adjusted average versus simple average. This is
achieved by the adjusted aggregation assigning more weight to elite reviews.
       The third model variation adds restaurant quality evolution to the benchmark. Unlike the
first two deviations, failing to account for quality change does lead to bias in the arithmetic
average ratings, as the goal of average rating is to reflect the “current” quality of the restaurant
at the date of last review. We present three graphs in Appendix Figure E.6: the first two
allow different standard deviation in the noise of quarterly quality update, while the third one
allows restaurant quality to update monthly with the same ‡› as in the second graph. Review
  27
   We create these figures by simulating a large number of ratings according to the underlying model, and then
computing adjusted versus simple average of ratings at each time of review.



                                                     19
frequency is simulated as one review per month. Comparison across the three graphs suggests
that the adjusted average rating leads to significant reduction in mean square errors, especially
when quality update is noisy or frequent.
       Moreover, as a restaurant accumulates Yelp reviews over time, the mean absolute error of
the adjusted rating becomes stabilized at around 0.2 to 0.4, while the mean absolute error of
the simple average keeps increasing over time, and could be as high as 1 after 60 reviews, as
shown in the top-left graph of Appendix Figure E.6. This is because the average rating is meant
to the capture the “current” restaurant quality at the time of aggregation. The adjusted rating
does this well by giving more weights to recent reviews. In contrast, the simple average rating
gives the same weight to every review; when there are N reviews, the weight to the most recent
review (1/N ) actually decreases with N , which explains why the simple average is further away
from the true “current” quality as N increases.
       To illustrate the magnitude of bias of adjusted and simple average in one realized path of
quality, Figure 1 focuses on a hypothetical change of quality from 3 at the beginning, to 2.5 at
the 20th review, and to 3.25 at the 40th review. Reviewers believe that true quality is updated
by quarter. To focus on the effect of restaurant quality evolution, we fix review frequency at
4.5 days per review. As shown in the figure, adjusted average tracks the actual quality change
better than simple average.
       Appendix Figure E.7 highlights the importance of reviewer stringency (and its heterogene-
ity). Compared to the benchmark, we allow reviewer stringency (⁄) to vary by restaurant and
reviewer characteristics (including the time trend by restaurant age) according to the coefficients
presented in Appendix Figure E.7. Reviewer and restaurant characteristics are simulated using
their empirical distribution as observed in the raw data. The first graph of Appendix Figure
E.7 assumes that the reviewer bias changes with restaurant age, but the restaurant quality does
not. The second graph assumes that the reviewer bias does not change with restaurant age, and
only the restaurant quality does. Both graphs show that adjusted average has corrected the bias
in reviewer stringency and therefore reflects the true quality, but simple average is biased due
to the failure to correct reviewer bias.28

5.2      Adjusted Versus Simple Average for Real Yelp Data
We now compare adjusted and simple average based on real Yelp ratings as observed in our
data. According to Table 3, the noise of quality update (‡› ) has a standard deviation of 0.12 per
quarter for ethnic restaurants and 0.13 for non-ethnic restaurants, which amount to an average
deviation of 0.49-0.54 stars per year. This is a substantial variation over time as compared to
the standard deviation of 1.14 stars in the whole data set over six years. Noise in reviewer signal
  28
     In the simulation with full model specifications, the assumption for restaurant age affecting restaurant quality
or reviewer bias is nonessential for comparing the mean absolute errors of the two aggregating methods. Adjusted
average always corrects any bias in reviewer bias, and simple average always reflects the sum of the changes in
quality and reviewer bias.


                                                         20
is even larger, with a standard deviation estimated to be between 0.92 and 0.98.
   These two types of noise have different implications for the relative advantage of adjusted
average ratings: quality update implies that adjusted average needs to give more weight to
recent reviews. In comparison, simple average reduces the amount of signal noise by law of
large number and will do so efficiently unless different reviewers differ in signal precision. Our
estimates show a relatively small difference between ‡e and ‡ne (Æ0.06) for both ethnic and
non-ethnic restaurants, implying that adjusted weighting due to reviewer heterogeneity in signal
noise is unlikely to lead to large efficiency improvement. Another difference between elite and
non-elite reviewers is their weight on social incentives, but the absolute magnitudes of ﬂe and
ﬂne never exceed 0.25, suggesting that the efficiency gain from social incentives is likely to be
small as well.
   Including all these elements, we use the structural estimates to compute simple and adjusted
average ratings at the time of every observed rating. We then calculate the difference between
simple and adjusted average, µsimple
                              rn     ≠ µoptimal
                                        rn      for every observation and summarize it in the
first row of Table 4.
   If we interpret the coefficients on restaurant age as a change of reviewer stringency, the
stringency bias is important in magnitude. We know from Table 1 that, on average, the second
review is 155 days apart from the first review. According to the coefficients on Agert and Age2rt ,
the second reviewer (if non-elite) will give a rating 0.13 stars higher for a non-ethnic restaurant
and 0.14 stars higher for an ethnic restaurant, relative to the review coming 1.5 years after the
first review. In contrast, a review submitted six years from the first review of the restaurant
will be -0.38 lower for a non-ethnic restaurant and -0.48 lower for an ethnic restaurant. Overall,
we find that adjusted and simple averages differ by at least 0.15 stars in 33.63% of observations,
and differ by at least 0.25 stars in 13.38% of observations. If we round the two ratings before
comparison, their difference is at least 0.5 stars for 25.39% of the observations. Interestingly, the
deviation from simple average to adjusted average is asymmetric: simple average is more likely
to underreport than overreport, as compared to adjusted average. We believe this is because
adjusted average puts more weight on later reviews, and later reviews entail a greater correction
of bias than earlier reviews due to the chilling effect.
   Alternatively, if we interpret the coefficients on restaurant age as a change of true restaurant
quality, the two averages differ by at least 0.15 stars in 13.6% of observations, and by at least 0.25
stars in 2.91% of observations. If we round the two ratings before comparison, they are at least
0.5 stars apart for 14.44% of the observations. The asymmetry on the direction of deviation
between the two averages also changes: simple average tends to overreport, as compared to
adjusted average when we interpret the restaurant age effect as true quality declining over time.
In reality, we believe that the trends are a combination of chilling effect and true quality change,
so the simulations from our two model interpretations are likely to bound the comparisons.
   The remainder of Table 4 compares our adjusted rating to 6-month, 12-month, and 18-month



                                                 21
moving average of reviewer ratings. No matter how we interpret the downward trend, the moving
averages perform worse than our adjusted aggregating rating. This is probably because many
restaurants receive sparse reviews and the short window of moving averages excludes many
reviews that could be useful for the aggregation. This is mainly due to the fact that the median
restaurant in our sample receives only one review permonth, and the average time gap between
the first and second review is 154 days. For restaurants that are reviewed infrequently, the
moving average only averages the few most recent ratings but throws out information embodied
in all past ratings. This drastically reduces the information used, and hence is even further away
from our adjusted average than the simple average.
   Table 5 describes how the difference between simple and adjusted averages varies over time.
The first panel compares the two average ratings at each restaurant’s last review in our sample.
As before, the rating difference depends on our interpretation of the “chilling effect”. If it is
interpreted as reviewer bias only, we find that, by the end of the sample, Yelp’s simple average
ratings differ from our adjusted average by more than 0.15 stars for 41.38% of restaurants and
by more than 0.25 stars for 19.1% of restaurants. . If the above chilling effect is interpreted
as changes in true quality, the absolute difference between simple and adjusted average ratings
is still more than 0.15 stars for 18.95% of restaurants and more than 0.25 stars for 5.33% of
restaurants by the end of the data sample.
   Why are these numbers bigger than what we have presented in Table 4? This is because
Table 4 summarizes the rating difference for all reviews of a restaurant rather than the last
review in our sample. To see this more clearly, the next three panels of Table 4 calculate the
rating difference for reviews 0-2 years, 2-4 years, and more than 4 years from the first review
of a restaurant. No matter how we interpret the chilling effect, the difference between simple
and adjusted ratings grows rapidly as a restaurant accumulates more reviews over time. As
illustrated in Figure 1 and Appendix Figure E.6, when restaurant quality changes over time, it
is important to adjust weights towards recent reviews in order for an average rating to reflect
the “current” restaurant quality. This factor is incorporated in our adjusted rating but missing
in the simple average rating.
   The increasing divergence of simple versus adjusted ratings can be better shown graphically.
Based on the above-estimated difference between simple and adjusted average per observation,
Figure 2 plots the mean and the 10th and 90th percentile of this difference by the order of
reviews. Assuming the restaurant age effect as reviewers become more stringent over time (i.e.
the chilling effect), the upper-left graph shows that the the restaurant quality is overestimated
in the beginning. When we assume away chilling effect, the lower-left graph shows that the
simple average rating is on average close to adjusted average, but the absolute values of the
10th and 90th percentile differences grow gradually as more reviews accumulate. Within each
restaurant, we calculate the percent of observations in which simple average rating is more than
0.15 stars away from the adjusted average rating. The bar chart on the upper right plots the



                                               22
histogram of restaurants by this percent. For example, the second bar shows that roughly 200
restaurants (out of 3,345 restaurants that have more than two reviews) have 5-10% of the time
when its simple average ratings is more than 0.15 stars away from the adjusted ratings. Overall,
over 1,271 restaurants have over 30% of the time when the simple average ratings are more than
0.15 stars away from the adjusted average. This suggests that adjusted average rating is likely
to generate substantial improvement over simple average, especially as Yelp accumulates more
reviews for each restaurant. The bottom two graphs of Figure 2 lead to a similar conclusion,
but of smaller magnitude, when we interpret the restaurant age effect as true quality changes.
    In Appendix Table D.7, we examine what restaurant and reviewer attributes lead to a greater
difference between the adjusted and simple averages. In particular, we compare the mean
attributes of restaurants and reviewers by whether the simple-vs-adjusted difference is greater
or smaller than 0.15 stars. We find that restaurant review frequency, reviewer review frequency,
and matching distance matter the most.
    Overall, in the Yelp setting, the difference between adjusted and simple average is mostly
driven by restaurant quality updates (‡› ) and time trend (Agert · –age ), and less by social
incentives (ﬂ), reviewer’s signal noise (‡‘ ), or other terms in reviewer stringency (⁄rt ). Because
of the importance of restaurant quality updates (‡› ), the simple average is further away from
the adjusted average as each restaurant accumulates reviews over time.


6    Results from the Online Survey
The counterfactual simulation presented above is conditional on our structural model, thus one
may argue that simulation alone does not prove that the advantage of our adjusted average is
independent of model assumptions. To address this concern, we conducted an online survey using
Amazon Mturk (“Restaurant Reviews Beliefs Survey”) on February 1, 2016. In this survey, we
asked how respondents use and comprehend restaurant ratings online (without mentioning Yelp
in the survey). In total, 239 Mturk workers responded to our survey. The exact questionnaire
is presented in Appendix F and the survey answers are summarized in Table 6.
    Results show that the rationale of our adjusted aggregation is consistent with reported user
preferences. In particular, nearly 60% of respondents use restaurant reviews at least once a week
and 81.2% report that they rely on online reviews “frequently” or “sometimes” when choosing
restaurants. When they use restaurant reviews, 93.7% pay attention to the average rating,
but only 56.9% look at the number of reviews and 33.7% look at changes in the ratings. This
confirms our motivation to generate one informative aggregate rating. When asked whether to
take into account the fact that some reviews are older than others, 86.6% prefer more weights on
more recent reviews. In comparison, when asked about whether to account for the completeness
of the reviewer profile, 69.9% do not take reviewer profile into account, while 26.4% put more
weight on reviewers with a complete profile. As shown in the second column of Table 6, results



                                                23
are similar if we restrict the sample to only those that rely on restaurant reviews “frequently”
or “sometimes” when they choose restaurants.
    Overall, the survey results are consistent with the rationale that more weights should be
given to more recent reviews and reviews written by more seasoned reviewers. Since users tend
to pay much more attention to the average rating, it is important to construct the aggregated
rating in a way that systematically reflects the informativeness of various reviews. This is exactly
why our model incorporates a list of cross-sectional and dynamic factors, allowing Yelp review
data to identify the relative importance of each. The external-validity check of the survey is
completely independent of our structural model and our Yelp data, thus its consistency extends
support to our model.


7    Conclusion
As consumer reviews continue to proliferate, the way in which information is aggregated becomes
a central design question. To address this question, we offer a method to aggregate consumer
ratings into an adjusted weighted average for a given product, where the weights and adjustments
are based on the informational content of each review. The informational content, in turn, is
empirically determined based on variations in the reviewer characteristics (and review histories),
as well as the inferred likelihood that product quality has changed, with parameters set by a
model of reviewer behavior.
    We show that our adjusted average deviates significantly from arithmetic averages for a non-
trivial fraction of restaurants. By law of large numbers, one might hope that a greater number
of reviews will lessen the problems of simple averaging of ratings over time. Yet, this intuition
can be wrong especially when quality changes over time (e.g. a new chef, a different menu, etc.)
By moving toward more systematic aggregation, the market designer can detect such changes
and be wary of the deviation between true quality and the arithmetical average.
    As acknowledged before, one major caveat of our paper is its inability to model reviewer
selection explicitly, mostly due to data limits. That being said, Section 2 has elaborated on
how our model partially controls for the selection, so we will not repeat it here. Nor will we
repeat how robust our findings are to the assumption of reviewer rationality, which has been
addressed in Section 4.2. Besides these two points, we now discuss the remaining limitations of
our approach, the potential uses of our algorithm, and a few directions for future research.

Incentives to Write Reviews         Our paper has focused on taking an existing set of reviews
and adjusting the aggregating method to better reflect the quality of a product. An alternative
mechanism to achieve this goal is to use social image to encourage people to leave more rep-
resentative reviews. There is a large theoretical literature studying social image (Akerlof 1980,
Bénabou and Tirole 2006). Theoretically modeling a crowdsourced setting, Miller, Resnick and
Zeckhauser (2005) argue that an effective way to encourage high-quality reviews is rewarding

                                                24
reviewers if their ratings predict peer ratings. Consistent with this theory, Yelp allows members
to evaluate each other’s reviews, chat online, follow particular reviewers, and meet at offline
social events. It also awards elite status to some qualified reviewers who have written a large
number of reviews on Yelp. As shown in our estimation, elite reviewers are indeed more consis-
tent with peer ratings, have more precise signals, and place more weight on past reviews of the
same restaurant. Our finding is consistent with Wang (2010), who compares Yelp reviewers with
reviewers on completely anonymous websites such as CitySearch and Yahoo Local. He finds that
Yelp reviewers are more likely to write reviews, reviewers are less likely to give extreme ratings,
and more prolific Yelp reviewers have more friends, receive more anonymous review votes per
review, and display more compliment letters per review. Comparing the same restaurants listed
on both platforms, he finds that restaurants are less likely to receive extreme ratings on Yelp.
These findings motivate us to explicitly allow elite and non-elite reviewers to place different
weight on social incentives. That being said, social incentives in our model can have multiple
interpretations and we do not model one’s incentive to manipulate reviews for popularity.29
    Note that our model does not completely ignore strategic incentives in rating. For example,
elite reviewers may care more about their own reputation on the rating platform and therefore
have an incentive to submit a review that better reflects their prediction of readers’ taste rather
than their own taste. In contrast, non-elite reviewers may prefer to vent out their own experience
with little regard for how readers may react to their reviews. We have incorporated these
considerations in the model and let the data identify the extent to which elite and non-elite
reviewers incorporate their own experience. Similarly, reviewers that have reviewed different
restaurants may have different incentives or tastes to rate the current restaurant more or less
favorably. Although we cannot separate incentives from tastes, we attempt to control for the
influence of a reviewer’s review history on her rating behavior, which should in turn capture
part of the strategic incentives that may arise from differential review history.

Fake Reviews One potential problem for consumer review websites is fake or promotional
reviews. Mayzlin, Dover and Chevalier (2014) have documented evidence for review manipu-
lation on hotel booking platforms (i.e. Expedia.com and Tripadvisor.com). To minimize the
presence of potentially non-authentic reviews, Yelp imposes a filter on all submitted reviews
and only posts reviews that Yelp believes to be authentic or trustworthy. Accordingly, our data
do not include the reviews that Yelp has filtered out. For an analysis of filtered reviews, see
Luca and Zervas (2016). While review filters can help to eliminate gaming, there are surely still
erratic and fake reviews that get through the system. In Appendix Figure E.8, we simulate the
evolution of ratings in two situations where an extremely low rating (1.5) occurs as either the
first or the fifth review of a restaurant, while the true restaurant quality starts at 3 stars, jumps
   29
      There is a large literature on social image and social influence, with most evidence demonstrated in lab or
field experiments. For example, Ariely et al. (2009) show that social image is important for charity giving and
private monetary incentives partially crowd out the image motivation.



                                                       25
down to 2.5 stars at the time of the 20th review, and reverts back to 3.5 stars at the time of the
40th review. All the other reviews are simulated in a large number according to the underlying
model. We then plot true quality, simple average, and adjusted average by order of review. The
top graph shows that, if the outlier review is the first review, over time adjusted average has a
better ability to shed the influence of this outlier review, because it gives more weight to recent
reviews. The bottom graph suggests that adjusted average is not always the best; because it
gives more weight to recent reviews, so it gives more weight to the outlier review right after it
has been submitted (the dip of the adjusted average after the fifth review is greater than the
simple average). However, for the same reason, adjusted average also forgets about the outlier
review faster than simple average, and better reflects true quality afterward.

Transparency and Aggregation Decisions Part of the motivation for this paper is that on
almost every consumer review website, reviews are aggregated. In practice, the most common
way to aggregate reviews is using an arithmetic average, which is done by Yelp, TripAdvisor,
and many others. As we have highlighted in this paper, arithmetic average does not account
for reviewer biases, reviewer heterogeneity, or changing quality. After this paper became public,
some platforms switched to alternative approaches to aggregating ratings. For example, Amazon
now uses machine learning to aggregate ratings rather than relying on a simple arithmetic
average, in an attempt to capture more information from the ratings.
   There are reasons outside of our model that may prompt a review website to use an arithmetic
average. For example, arithmetic averages are transparent and uncontroversial. If, for example,
Yelp were to use adjusted information aggregation, they may be accused of trying to help certain
restaurants due to a conflict of interest (since Yelp also sells advertisements to restaurants).
Hence, a consumer review website’s strategy might balance the informational benefits of adjusted
aggregation against other incentives that may move them away from this standard.

Potential Uses of Our Approach The aggregation of ratings has implications beyond shap-
ing what metric is shown to consumers. For example, Yelp uses the average rating, among other
factors, to determine the order in which businesses are shown. Our adjusted average could help
to improve this ordering. The adjusted average can also be used to form personalized restaurant
recommendations to consumers. In addition, it can be presented to business owners and man-
agers to help them understand how much of the rating reflects vertical quality, and how much
is influenced by reviewer type and reviewer behavior.
   In principle, the method offered in our paper could be applied to a variety of review systems.
Implementing this could also be done in conjunction with the other considerations discussed
above. Moreover, when generalizing our method, the relative importance of various factors
in our model could vary by context. For example, quality change may not be an issue for
fixed products such as books, movies, etc., whereas reviewer heterogeneity may be much more
important. The flexibility of our model allows it to be robust to this type of variations, while

                                                26
also allowing for new insights by applying the model to different settings.

Notes: 1. The columns in this table show estimates from models that gradually add review heterogeneity. Model
in column (1) assumes that reviewers have common precision, social incentives, and biases in judging
restaurants’ quality. Model in column (2) allows reviewers’ precision, popularity concerns, and bias to differ by
elite status. “e” and “ne” in the subscripts indicate reviewer’s elite and non-elite status respectively. Model in
column (3) allows stochastic restaurant quality evolving in a random walk process. Column (4) further allows
reviewer bias to depend on reviewer characteristics and her match with the restaurant. We also add a common
year dummy in bias to capture time trend in ratings besides the trend relative to restaurant’s own history. 2.
The lower panel shows how reviewer characteristics and her match with restaurant affect her biases. 3. Since we
estimate the model based on first differences in reviews, we are not able to identify true quality of the
restaurants, but we can identify the effect of review characteristics on the change in review biases. We use
non-elite reviewers as baseline and the estimates are shown in the left column of panel B. The elite versus
non-elite relative differences in bias are shown in the right column. The subscripts are in turn age (Age), age
square (Age2 ) of the restaurant, the reviewer-restaurant match distance (M atchD), and reviewer taste for
variety (T asteV ar), number of reviews written by the reviewer per day (F reqRev), and total number of reviews
written by the reviewer (N umRev). 4. Variables that influence reviewer bias are scaled down by ten.

Notes: 1. Estimated model in this table adds to the baseline model shown in Table 2 Column(4) to allow quality
signal noise, quality shock, and restaurant rating time trends to differ by restaurant ethnic status. 2. The cuisine
type information is reported by Yelp. We classify a restaurant as ethnic if its Yelp cuisine category contains words
indicating Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Asian, Korean, Indian, Ethiopian, Mediterranean, Peruvian, Russian, or
Moroccan food.

Notes: 1. The above table shows the percentage of reviews with the differences between other averaging meth-
ods and adjusted average exceeding 0.15 and 0.25. The calculation of adjusted ratings is based on the model
differentiating ethnic and non-ethnic restaurants, and with quality change every quarter. 2. The adjusted rating
is calculated for every review written on restaurants with at least 3 reviews. This covers 3,345 restaurants and
133,668 ratings. 3. Panel B rounds the simple average and adjusted averages to every 0.5 points.

Notes: The above figure plots the simulated mean and 95% confidence interval for the average ratings for one
hypothetical restaurant quality path realized in a random walk process. The quality drops to 2.5 before restaurant
receives its 20th rating, and rises to 3.25 before it receives its 40th rating. Adjusted aggregation adapts to changes
in restaurant’s true quality, while simple average becomes more biased in representing restaurant’s true quality.
Since the adjusted aggregation algorithm only gives weights to recent ratings and simple average gives equal
weights to all past ratings, standard error of adjusted average shrinks slower than simple average.

Appendix A: Model of Reviewer Incentives to Deviate From Prior Reviews
In this appendix, we show an alternative model to capture reviewer incentive to differentiate from
prior ratings corresponding to our baseline model in Section 2.1. It gives rise to exactly the same
equation except for ﬂi < 0.
    If social incentives motivate reviewer i to deviate from prior reviews, we can model it as reviewer
i choosing to report xrtn to minimize a slightly different objective:

                   (2)
                  Frn  = (xrtn ≠ (srtn + ◊rn ))2 ≠ wi [xrtn ≠ E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , ...xrtn≠1 )]2

where E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , ...xrtn≠1 ) is the posterior belief of true quality given all the prior rat-
ings (not counting i’s own signal) and wi > 0 is the marginal utility that reviewer i will get
by reporting differently from prior ratings. By Bayes’ Rule, E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , ...xrt{n≠1} , srtn ) is
a weighted average of E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , ...xrtn≠1 ) and i’s own signal srtn , which we can write as,
E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , ...xrt{n≠1} , srtn ) = – · srtn + (1 ≠ –)· E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , ...xrtn≠1 ). Combining this
                                          (2)
with the first order condition of Frn , we have


     (2)          1              1 ≠ – + wi –                    wi
    xrtn   =   (1≠wi )   ◊rn +                  srtn ≠                        E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , ..xrtn≠1 , srtn )
                               (1 ≠ wi )(1 ≠ –)         (1 ≠ wi )(1 ≠ –)
               =         ⁄rn + (1 ≠ ﬂi )srtn + ﬂi E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , ..xrtn≠1 , srtn )

                           1
if we redefine ⁄rn =     1≠wi ◊rn   and ﬂi = ≠ (1≠ww  i
                                                   i )(1≠–)
                                                            . Note that the optimal ratings in the above two
scenarios are written in exactly the same expression except that ﬂi > 0 if one tries to be close to
the best guess of the true restaurant quality in her report and ﬂi < 0 if one is motivated to deviate
from prior ratings. The empirical estimate of ﬂi will inform us which scenario is more consistent
with the data. In short, weight ﬂi is an indicator of how a rating correlates with past ratings. As
long as later ratings contain information from past ratings, aggregation needs to weigh early and
late reviews differently.

Appendix B: Notes on the Data Generating Process
B.1 Data Generating Process

The model presented in section 2.1 includes random change in restaurant quality, random noise in
reviewer signal, reviewer heterogeneity in stringency, social incentives, and signal precision, and a
quadratic time trend, as well as the quality of the match between the reviewer and the restaurant.
Overall, one can consider the data generation process as the following three steps:

   1. Restaurant r starts with an initial quality µr0 when it is first reviewed on Yelp. Denote this
      time as time 0. Since time 0, restaurant quality µr evolves in a random walk process by
      calendar time, where an i.i.d. quality noise ›t ≥ N (0, ‡›2 ) is added on to restaurant quality
      at t so that µrt = µr(t≠1) + ›t .

   2. A reviewer arrives at restaurant r at time tn as r’s nth reviewer. She observes the attributes
      and ratings of all the previous n ≠ 1 reviewers of r. She also obtains a signal srtn = µrtn + ‘rn
      of the concurrent restaurant quality where the signal noise ‘rn ≥ N (0, ‡‘2 ).

   3. The reviewer chooses an optimal rating that gives weights to both her own experience and
      her social incentives. The optimal rating takes the form

                       xrtn = ⁄rn + ﬂn E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , .., xrt2 , ..., srtn ) + (1 ≠ ﬂn )srtn

      where E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , .., xrt2 , ..., srtn ) is the best guess of the restaurant quality at tn by
      Bayesian updating.

   4. The reviewer is assumed to know the attributes of all past reviewers so that she can de-bias
      the stringency of past reviewers. The reviewer also knows that the general population of
      reviewers may change taste from year to year (captured in year fixed effects {–yeart }), and
      there is a quadratic trend in ⁄ by restaurant age (captured in {–age1 , –age2 }). This trend
      could be driven by changes in reviewer stringency or restaurant quality and these two drivers
      are not distinguishable in the above expression for xrtn .

In the Bayesian estimate of E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , .., xrt2 , ..., srtn ), we assume the nth reviewer of r is
fully rational and has perfect information about the other reviewers’ observable attributes, which
according to our model determines the other reviewers’ stringency (⁄), social preference (ﬂ), and
signal noise (‡‘ ). With this knowledge, the nth reviewer of r can back out each reviewer’s sig-
nal before her; thus the Bayesian estimate of E(µrtn |xrt1 , xrt2 , .., xrt2 , ..., srtn ) can be rewritten as
E(µrtn |srt1 , ...srtn ). Typical Bayesian inference implies that a reviewer’s posterior about restaurant
quality is a weighted average of previous signals and her own signal, with the weight increasing with
signal precision. This is complicated by the fact that restaurant quality evolves by a martingale
process, and therefore current restaurant quality is better reflected in recent reviews. Accordingly,
the Bayesian estimate of E(µrtn |srt1 , ...srtn ) should give more weight to more recent reviews even


                                                        39
if all reviewers have the same stringency, social preference, and signal precision. The analytical
derivation of E(µrtn |srt1 , ...srtn ) is presented in Appendix B.2.

B.2 Deriving E(µrt |srt1 , ...srtn )

For restaurant r, denote the prior belief of µrtn right before the realization of the nth signal as

                                      ﬁn|n≠1 (µrtn ) = f (µrtn |srt1 , ...srtn≠1 )

   Denote the posterior belief of µrtn after observing srtn as

                                         hn|n (µrtn ) = f (µrtn |srt1 , ...srtn )

Hence

                                         =f (srtn |µrtn )ﬁn|n≠1 (µrtn )

where f (srtn |µrtn , srt1 , ...srtn≠1 ) = f (srtn |µrtn ) comes from the assumption that srtn is independent
of past signals conditional on µrtn .
   In the above formula, the prior belief of µrtn given the realization of {srt1 , ..., srtn≠1 }, or
ﬁn|n≠1 (µrtn ), depends on the posterior belief of µrtn≠1 , hn≠1|n≠1 (µrtn≠1 ) and the evolution pro-
cess from µrtn≠1 to µrtn , denoted as g(µn |µn≠1 ). Hence,

           ﬁn|n≠1 (µrtn ) = g(µn |µn≠1 )f (µrtn≠1 |srt1 , ...srtn≠1 ) = g(µn |µn≠1 )hn≠1|n≠1 (µrtn≠1 )



   Given the normality of ﬁn|n≠1 , f (srtn |µrtn ) and g(µn |µn≠1 ), hn|n (µrtn ) is distributed normal.

B.3 The Correlation of Ratings Induced by Quality Change

We assume quality evolution follows a martingale process: µrt = µr(t≠1) + ›t , where t denotes
the units of calendar time since restaurant r has first been reviewed and the t-specific evolution
›t conforms to ›t ≥ i.i.d N (0, ‡›2 ). This martingale process introduces a positive correlation of




                                                           41
restaurant quality over time,

                                                      t                                 t Õ
                                                      ÿ                                 ÿ
                     Cov(µrt , µrtÕ ) = E(µr0 +              ›· ≠ E(µrt ))(µr0 +               ›· ≠ E(µrtÕ ))
                                                      · =1                              · =1
                                           t          t Õ             t
                                           ÿ          ÿ               ÿ
                                    = E(         ›·          ›· ) =          E(›·2 ) if t < tÕ ,
                                          · =1        · =1            · =1

which increases with the timing of the earlier date (t) but is independent of the time between t and
tÕ .
       Recall that xrtn is the nth review written at time tn since r was first reviewed. We can express
the nth reviewer’s signal as:

                                     srtn = µrtn + ‘rn
                            where µrtn = µrtn≠1 + ›tn≠1 +1 + ›tn≠1 +2 + ... + ›tn .

Signal noise ‘rn is assumed to be i.i.d. with V ar(srtn |µrtn ) = ‡i2 where i is the identity of the nth
reviewer. The variance of restaurant quality at tn conditional on quality at tn≠1 is,

             V ar(µrtn |µrtn≠1 ) = V ar(›tn≠1 +1 + ›tn≠1 +2 + ... + ›tn ) = (tn ≠ tn≠1 )‡›2 =                   tn ‡›2 .

Note that the martingale assumption entails two features in the stochastic process: first, conditional
on µrtn≠1 , µrtn is independent of the past signals {srt1 , ..., srtn≠1 }; second, conditional on µrtn , srtn
is independent of the past signals {srt1 , ..., srtn≠1 }. These two features greatly facilitate reviewer
n’s Bayesian estimate of restaurant quality.

Appendix C: Deriving the Likelihood Function
C.1 Deriving the Likelihood Function f (xrt2 ≠ xrt1 , ..., xrtNr ≠ xrtNr ≠1 )

Because the covariance structure of {xrt2 ≠ xrt1 , xrt3 ≠ xrt2 , ..., xrtNr ≠ xrtNr ≠1 } is complicated, we
use the change of variable technique to express the likelihood f (xrt2 ≠ xrt1 , ..., xrtNr ≠ xrtNr ≠1 ) by
f (srt2 ≠ srt1 , ..., srtNr ≠ srtNr ≠1 ),

            f (xrt2 ≠ xrt1 , ..., xrtNr ≠ xrtNr ≠1 ) = |J              sæ x | f (srt2
                                                                             ≠1

The derivation of f (xrt2 ≠ xrt1 , ..., xrtNr ≠ xrtNr ≠1 ) is shown as the following,

    • Step 1: To derive f (srt2 ≠ srt1 , ..., srtNr ≠ srtNr ≠1 ), we note that srtn = µrtn + ‘n and thus, for
       any m > n, n Ø 2, the variance and covariance structure can be written as:

                      Cov(srtn ≠ srtn≠1 , srtm ≠ srtm≠1 )
                   =Cov(‘rn ≠ ‘rn≠1 + ›tn≠1 +1 + ... + ›tn , ‘rm ≠ ‘rm≠1 + ›tm≠1 +1 + ... + ›tm )

       and E(µrtn |srt , ...srtn ) as a function of {srt1 , ...srtn } (formula in Appendix B.2), we can solve
       {srt1 , ...srtn } from {xrt1 , ...xrtn } according to the recursive formula in Appendix C.2.

Notes: 1. This table presents R2 of the linear regression in which Yelp ratings is the dependent variable, and fixed
effects and matching variables indicated in each row are independent variables. 2. There are only a few observations
in 2004 and 2010, so we use fixed effect of 2005 for 2004, and fixed effect of 2009 for 2010.

Notes: The sample sizes of regressions specified in columns (2)-(4) are smaller since we dropped the first review
written by a reviewer. It is dropped in columns (2) and (4) since we do not have a measure of taste for variety when a
reviewer has only written one review. It is dropped in column (3) since we cannot calculate reviewer’s match distance
with the restaurant when a reviewer has no review history. In column (1), we assume that the match distance for a
reviewer when she writes the first review is the same as the mean distance in sample.
b
  The reviewer-restaurant matching distance variable measures the match quality between a reviewer and a restau-
rant. It is calculated as the Euclidean distance between characteristics of a particular restaurant and the mean
characteristics of all restaurants a reviewer has reviewed before.
c
  Reviewer taste for variety measures how much a reviewer enjoys restaurant variety. It is calculated as the variation
in characteristics among all restaurants a reviewer has reviewed before.

    Figure E1: Distribution of Ratings Relative to Restaurant Mean by Elite Status




                                                                            BF
Notes: 1. The figure on the left plots the distribution Ratingrn ≠ Rating rn , where Ratingrn is the nth rating on
                           BF
restaurant r, and Rating rn is the arithmetic mean of past n ≠ 1 ratings on restaurant r before n. Similarly, the
                                                                AF
figure on the right plots the distribution of Ratingrn ≠ Rating rn , where Ratingrn is the nth rating on restaurant r,
            AF
and Rating rn is the arithmetic mean of future ratings on restaurant r until the end of our sample. 2. These figures
show that ratings by elite reviewers are closer to a restaurant’s average rating.



                      Figure E2: Restaurants Experience a “Chilling Effect”




Notes: This figure shows the rating trend within a restaurant over time. Ratings are on average more favorable to
restaurants in the beginning and decline over time. We plot the fractional polynomial of the restaurant residual on
the sequence of reviews. Residuals ‘rn,year are obtained from regression Ratingrn,year = µr + “year + ‘rn,year .

Figure E3: Fractional-polynomial Fit of Within Restaurant Rating Trend (Ethnic Vs.
Non-ethnic Restaurants)




Notes: The above figures plot the simulated 95% confidence interval for the average ratings that would occur for a
restaurant at a given quality level. When reviewers differ in precision, both arithmetic and adjusted averages are
unbiased estimates for true quality. But, relative to arithmetic average, adjusted average converges faster to true
quality. The difference in converging speed increases when elite reviewers’ precision relative to that of non-elite
reviewers is larger.

Notes: The above figures simulated 95% confidence interval for adjusted and simple average ratings in predicting true
restaurant quality. When reviewers have popularity concerns, arithmetic and adjusted averages are both unbiased
estimates for true quality. But, relative to arithmetic average, adjusted aggregation converges faster to the true
quality, and the relative efficiency of adjusted average is greater when reviewers’ social incentive is larger.

Notes. 1. The above figures plot the mean absolute errors of adjusted and simple average ratings in estimating
quality when quality evolves in a random walk process. To isolate randomness in review frequency on restaurants, we
fix the frequency of reviews on restaurants to be one per month. We simulate a history of 60 reviews, or a time span
of 5 years. 2. The figures show that simple averages become more erroneous in representing the true quality over
time while the adjusted average keeps the same level of mean absolute error. The error of simple average is greater
compared with adjusted average if a restaurant has larger variance in quality, and changes quality more frequently.

Notes: The above figures plot the simulated mean and 95% confidence interval for the average ratings that would
occur for restaurants with biased reviewers. The figure on the left assumes that restaurants have fixed quality at 3,
and reviewers’ bias is trending downwards with restaurant age. The figure on the right assumes that the restaurants
have quality trending downwards with restaurant age, and the reviewer bias is unaffected by restaurant age. In both
cases, we assume that reviewers perfectly acknowledge other reviewers’ biases and the common restaurant quality
trend. So in both cases, adjusted aggregation is an unbiased estimate for true quality while the simple average is
biased without correcting the review bias.

Notes: The above figures plot the simulated mean of the average ratings for a single restaurant whose quality follows
the random walk process. A “fake” review that is fixed at 1.5 appears as the first or the fifth review on the restaurant.
We consider the review “fake” if a reviewer misreports her signal. Both aggregating algorithms weight past ratings,
and are affected by the “fake” rating. But compared with arithmetic mean, adjusted aggregation “forgets” about
earlier ratings and converges back to the true quality in a faster rate.

Appendix F: “Restaurant Reviews Beliefs Survey” Questionnaire
To test our model against external source of information, we conducted an online survey using
Amazon Mturk (“Restaurant Reviews Beliefs Survey,” February 1, 2016) in which we asked how
respondents used and comprehended restaurant ratings online (we didn’t mention Yelp in the
survey). In total, 239 Mturk workers responded to our survey. The following shows the screen shot
of the questionnaire.
