                                        ABSTRACT

The U.S. tuberculosis movement pioneered many of the strategies of modern public health
campaigns. Dedicated to eradicating a specific disease, it was spearheaded by voluntary
associations and supported by the sale of Christmas seals. Although remarkable in its scope and
intensity, the effectiveness of the tuberculosis (TB) movement has not been studied in a
systematic fashion. Using newly digitized mortality data at the municipal level for the period
1900-1917, we explore the effectiveness of the measures championed by the TB movement. Our
results suggest that the adoption of a municipal reporting requirement was associated with a 6
percent decrease in pulmonary TB mortality, while the opening of a state-run sanatorium was
associated with an almost 4 percent decrease in pulmonary TB mortality. However, these and
other anti-TB measures can explain, at most, only a small portion of the overall decline in
pulmonary TB mortality observed during the period under study.

1. INTRODUCTION

         In 1900, 194 out of every 100,000 Americans died of tuberculosis (TB), making it the

second-leading cause of death, behind only pneumonia/influenza (Jones et al. 2012). Although an

effective treatment would not be introduced until after World War II (Daniel 2006), the TB

mortality rate fell dramatically over the next three decades. By 1920, it had fallen to 113 per 100,000

persons; by 1930, it had fallen to 71 per 100,000 persons (Jones et al. 2012).

         How was TB vanquished, or at least controlled, in the United States and other developed

countries? Scholars have proposed several explanations, including better living conditions, herd

immunity due to natural selection, reduced virulence, and improved nutrition (Smith 2003; Daniel

2006; Kunitz 2007, pp. 196-197; Lönnroth et al. 2009; Mercer 2014, pp. 127-129). The introduction

of basic public health measures (e.g., isolating patients in sanatoriums and TB hospitals) is another

potential explanation (Wilson 1990; Fairchild and Oppenheimer 1998), but scholars have questioned

whether such measures contributed meaningfully to the decline in TB mortality (McKeown 1976;

Coker 2003; Daniel 2006).1

         Drawing on newly digitized data from a variety of primary sources, the current study

explores whether the TB movement contributed to the decline in TB mortality in the United States.

The movement began with the establishment of the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of

Tuberculosis in 1892 and gained momentum when the National Association for the Study and

Prevention of Tuberculosis (NASPT) was founded in 1904 (Shryock 1957, p. 52; Teller 1988, p. 30).

Spearheaded by voluntary associations composed of both laypersons and physicians and supported



1 See also Tomes (1989), Bates (1989; 1992), Vynnycky and Fine (1999), and Wilson (2005). Bates (1989, p. 349) wrote
that, “in the absence of controlled studies”, we may never know “whether or to what degree the tuberculosis movement
contributed to the declining death rate in the United States or improved the health of tuberculosis patients.” Tomes
(1989, p. 477), although also skeptical, argued that “[h]istorians may fairly question the wisdom of spending money on
sanatoria instead of on housing subsidies, but they cannot conclusively prove that the tuberculosis movement as a whole
played no role in the ‘retreat’ of the disease.”

by the sale of Christmas seals, the U.S. TB movement pioneered many of the strategies of modern

public health campaigns (Teller 1988 p. 1 and pp. 121-126; Jones and Greene 2013; Rosen 2015, pp.

226-231).

         Between 1900 and 1917, hundreds of state and local TB associations sprung up across the

United States (NASPT 1916; Knopf 1922). These associations distributed educational materials and

provided financial support to sanatoriums and TB hospitals, where patients with active TB were

isolated from the general population and, if lucky, could recover. In addition, these associations

advocated, often successfully, for the passage of legislation designed to curb the transmission of TB,

including requirements that doctors notify local public health officials about active TB cases.

         Reporting requirements were a key feature of the campaign against TB (Knopf 1922, p. 149;

Teller 1988, p. 22; Rothman 1995, p. 187). These requirements prevented physicians from

concealing a diagnosis of TB from their patients and allowed local health officials to monitor TB

patients, ensuring that they were taking precautions not to infect others (Teller 1988, p. 22). In

several states, “careless consumptives” could be forcibly committed to TB hospitals or sanatoriums,

where they were not a threat to the health of their family and co-workers (Teller 1988, pp. 93-94;

Roberts 2009, p. 186). When a TB patient died, municipalities and states often required that his or

her premises be thoroughly disinfected.

         Although remarkable in its scope and intensity, the effectiveness of the U.S. TB movement

has, to date, not been studied in a systematic fashion.2 Using municipal-level data for the period


2 Two recent working papers by economists have examined the effects of specific anti-TB public health measures
undertaken before an effective treatment for TB was available. Hollingsworth (2014) estimated the relationship between
sanatoriums and pulmonary TB mortality using data from North Carolina for the period 1932-1940. He found that an
additional sanatorium bed reduced the pulmonary TB mortality rate among whites by .695 per 100,000 population, but
had no effect on the black TB mortality rate. Hansen et al. (2017) estimated the relationship between TB dispensaries
and TB mortality at the municipal level using data from Denmark for the period 1890-1939. These authors found that
the opening of a TB dispensary was associated with a 16 percent reduction in the TB mortality rate, an effect they
attributed to dispensaries “facilitating a local diffusion of (hygiene) knowledge about the disease.” Hansen et al. (2017)
also found that the opening of a sanatorium was associated with a (statistically insignificant) increase in the local TB
mortality rate, but noted that, because Denmark is not a large country, TB patients “had the liberty of choosing the

                                                            2
1900-1917 from Mortality Statistics, which was published on an annual basis by the U.S. Census

Bureau, we estimate the relationship between pulmonary TB mortality and the introduction of

public health measures designed to curb the spread of the disease. Such measures included the

establishment of sanatoriums, TB hospitals and open-air camps, prohibitions on spitting and the use

of common drinking cups, requirements that local health officials be notified about TB cases, and

requirements that the premises of deceased TB patients be disinfected.

         Our estimates, which control flexibly for common shocks and municipal-level heterogeneity,

suggest that most anti-TB measures had no discernable impact on pulmonary TB mortality. Two

exceptions to this general result stand out: requiring TB cases to be reported to local health officials

is associated with a 6 percent reduction in pulmonary TB mortality, and the opening of a state-run

sanatorium is associated with an almost 4 percent reduction in pulmonary TB mortality. These

estimated effects are robust across a variety of specifications, but can explain, at most, only a small

portion of the overall decline in pulmonary TB mortality observed during the period 1900-1917.



2. BACKGROUND

         Today, cancer and coronary health disease are the leading causes of death in the United

States (National Center for Health Statistics 2016), but, at the turn of the 20th century, most

Americans did not expect to die from these so-called “modern diseases”: influenza, pneumonia,

tuberculosis, and gastrointestinal infections took a far greater toll (Jones et al. 2012). The United

States experienced a rapid decline in mortality from infectious diseases during the early 1900s (Jones

et al. 2012). By 1930, coronary heart disease had become the leading cause of death (Jones et al.




sanatorium across the country that they liked the most.” By contrast, all but the wealthiest TB patients in the United
States would have viewed out-of-state sanatoriums as too expensive (Rothman (1995, pp. 207-210). In the United
States, state-run and local sanatoriums represented a substantial portion of total capacity (Teller 1988, p. 82), making it
much easier to identify their effects on TB mortality.

                                                              3
2012); by 1948, Secretary of State George Marshall declared with confidence that the conquest of all

infectious diseases was imminent (Garrett 1994, p. 30).

         In an oft-cited review, Cutler et al. (2006) attributed the unprecedented decline in infectious

disease mortality experienced in the United States and other Western countries to basic public health

measures, including the building of sewage systems, the delivery of clean water, and educational

campaigns designed to promote better hygiene. The evidence that sewers and clean water

contributed to declines in mortality from diarrhea, dysentery, enteritis, typhoid, and other

waterborne diseases is quite strong (Troesken 2001; Cutler and Miller 2005; Ferrie and Troesken

2008; Alsan and Goldin 2015; Beach et al. 2016).3 However, several prominent scholars have

suggested that public health measures did not contribute meaningfully to the decline in TB mortality

(McKeown 1976; Coker 2003; Daniel 2006), nor is there particularly convincing evidence that public

health measures contributed to the decline in mortality from other important airborne diseases such

as influenza, scarlet fever, and whooping cough (Condran and Crimmins-Gardner 1978; Condran

and Cheney 1982; Swedlund and Donta 2002; Bootsma and Ferguson 2007).

         Gaining a better understanding of the factors that contributed to the control of infectious

diseases in the United States could help in the design and implementation of public health

interventions in the developing world, where TB remains widespread (World Health Organization

2015; Houben and Dodds 2016). Although most TB infections can be successfully treated with

antimicrobial drugs, the World Health Organization estimates that 3.3 percent of new TB cases are

multidrug-resistant (WHO 2015, p. 4). The recommended treatment for drug-susceptible TB lasts 6

months, but treatment for multidrug-resistant TB takes 20 months, requires more toxic drugs, and




3 Relatedly, Clay et al. (2014) found that waterborne lead exposure was associated with higher rates of infant mortality at
the turn of the 20th century.

has a much lower success rate (Lange et al. 2014; WHO 2015, p. 56).4 With multidrug-resistant TB

infections on the rise (Lange et al. 2014), some experts have suggested that it may be “time to bring

back sanatoria” (Dheda and Migliori 2012, p. 773). At a minimum, assessing the effectiveness of

basic public health measures, many of which were pioneered by the U.S. TB movement, has taken

on a new urgency.



2.1. A brief introduction to tuberculosis

           TB can affect bones, the central nervous system, and other organ systems, but it is primarily

a pulmonary disease. In 1882, Robert Koch demonstrated that TB is caused by Mycobacterium

tuberculosis, which can be spread through coughing, sneezing, or spitting, although many turn-of-the-

century doctors in the United States still believed that TB was inherited (Teller 1988, p. 23).5 During

the period under study, TB was often referred to as “consumption” and its sufferers were referred to

as “consumptives” (Bynum 2012), reflecting the gradual weight loss caused by the disease.

           Over 90 percent of TB infections are latent–asymptomatic and non-communicable (Lawn

and Zumla 2011, p. 61). However, approximately half of individuals with active pulmonary TB

eventually die if they do not receive treatment (Rutledge and Crouch 1919; Thompson 1943; Gideon

and Flynn 2011).6 Symptoms include a chronic cough, fevers, night sweats, and weight loss (Lawn

and Zumla 2011, p. 65).




4Multidrug-resistant TB is caused by the bacteria adapting to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most potent anti-TB
drugs, making them ineffective (Lange et al. 2014).
5   See Lawn and Zumla (2011) for more about the history and microbiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

6For instance, Thompson (1943) examined 406 TB patients diagnosed between 1928 and 1938. One year after their
diagnosis, 40 percent had died; two years after diagnosis, almost 60 percent had died. In a review of studies from the
pre-chemotherapy era, Tiemersma et al. (2011) concluded that the duration of TB from onset to either cure or death
was, on average, 3 years.


                                                             5
         At the turn of the 20th century, TB was the second-leading cause of death in the United

States (Jones et al. 2012).7 It was greatly feared, in part because it often affected healthy men and

women in the prime of life (Donald 2016; Tomes 2000). Incident rates were highest in the rapidly

growing urban areas of the United States, where people lived and worked in close proximity to one

another. In rural areas of the United States, the TB mortality rate was roughly half that of large

cities such as Boston, New Orleans, New York, San Francisco, and Washington D.C.8 An effective

treatment would not be introduced until after World War II (Daniel 2006), yet the TB mortality rate

fell by more than 60 percent from 1900 to 1930 (Jones et al. 2012).9 Many, if not most,

contemporary observers credited the TB movement for this dramatic reduction in TB mortality

(Emerson 1922; Bates 1992, pp. 317-318).



3. THE TUBERCULOSIS MOVEMENT

         The TB movement was, in many respects, the first modern public health campaign.

Dedicated to eradicating a specific disease, it was spearheaded by voluntary groups, involved

laypersons as well as medical professionals, and, beginning in 1908, was almost entirely funded by

the sale of Christmas seals (Knopf 1922, pp. 55-66; Shryock 1957, pp. 55-57; Rosen 2015, pp. 226-



7 TB has a long and reasonably well documented history. Lesions and other tubercular deformities have been found on
the mummified remains of ancient Egyptians, and classical Greek and Roman doctors recognized its symptoms (Daniel
2000, p. 29; Daniel 2006, p. 1863; Smith 2003, p. 465). In Homer’s Odyssey, the poet referenced a “grievous
consumption”, which took the soul from one’s body (Bynum 2012, p. 13). TB mortality rates in Europe soared with the
growth of urban centers such as London and Paris, and peaked in the first half of the 19th century (Dubos and Dubos
1952, p. 9 and pp. 185-186; Smith 2003, p. 465).

8See the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1908, p. 66) for TB mortality rates in cities with a population of greater than
100,000 and in the rural areas of registration states.
9The first vaccine, BCG, was introduced in 1921 (Lawn and Zumla 2011, p. 67). Although vaccination campaigns were
undertaken in Europe, no such campaign was launched in the United States (Cutler et al. 2006, p. 103). Today, despite
widespread use of the BCG vaccine, TB is still one of the leading causes of mortality in developing nations, with 1.5
million people succumbing to it every year (World Health Organization 2015). It is estimated that approximately one-
fourth of the world’s population has a latent TB infection (Houben and Dodd 2016).

231).10 By harnessing the enthusiasm of laypersons, and coupling this enthusiasm with the

knowledge and guidance of professionals, the TB movement inspired and directly shaped

subsequent public health campaigns in the United States and around the world (Jacobs 1921;

Shryock 1957, pp. 55-56 and pp. 179-182; Rosen 2015, pp. 226-231).

         Between 1900 and 1917, hundreds of state and local TB associations were established across

the United States (NASPT 1911, 1916, 1919). By 1917, the last year for which we have data, the

NASPT was raising well over a million dollars per year through the sale of Christmas seals, and

every state had its own association (Knopf 1922). TB associations sponsored lectures, mounted

exhibits, distributed press releases, and gave out circulars emphasizing the importance of germ

awareness and proper hygiene (Teller 1988, pp. 59-61). Men were urged to shave their beards and

carry pocket spittoons, women were urged to stop wearing trailing dresses, and children were taught

to play outdoors, keep their face, hands, and fingernails clean, and cover their coughs and sneezes.11

         The goals and aspirations of TB associations went well beyond educating the public. TB

associations provided financial support to sanatoriums, TB hospitals, open-air camps, and

dispensaries. They also advocated for the passage of legislation designed to curb the spread of TB

and worked closely with local and state health officials, who adopted and distributed their


10
 Even today, the American Lung Association’s mission is largely funded by the sale of Christmas seals (see
www.christmasseals.org).
11For a historical perspective on the hygiene practices promoted by tuberculosis associations see Tomes (1998, pp. 113-
134) and Tomes (2000). An exhaustive list of contemporary hygiene-related admonitions is provided by Knopf (1901).
For instance, Knopf (1901, pp. 21-22) wrote:

         In factories, stores, railway cars, waiting-rooms…, menageries—in short wherever many
         people congregate—there should be a sufficient number of cuspidors well kept and regularly
         cleaned. They should be made of unbreakable material and have wide openings. If such
         measures are carried out, there will be no excuse for any one to expectorate on the floor and
         thus endanger the lives of his fellow-men.

Knopf (1901) also urged children “to always play outdoors unless the weather is too stormy” (p. 72), and advised them
to “learn to love fresh air”, not to “kiss any one on the mouth”, and not to “put pencils in your mouth or wet them with
your lips” (p. 71).

educational materials.12 Below, we describe the history and functions of sanatoriums, TB hospitals,

open-air camps, and dispensaries. After describing these institutions, we briefly summarize the anti-

TB legislation passed during the period under study.13



3.1. Sanatoriums

           The first sanatoriums in the United States were established at the end of the 19th century

(Knopf 1922, p. 10). Typically located in rural areas or the mountains, they provided a place for TB

patients to rest, breathe fresh air, and eat nutritious food. Although TB patients admitted to

sanatoriums had similar recovery rates as compared to those who went untreated (Bignall 1977;

Teller 1988, pp. 89-90; Daniel 2006), medical professionals at the turn of the 20th century, including

the leaders of the TB movement, were convinced that sanatoriums could cure pulmonary TB

(Wethered 1906; Knopf 1908). In addition to offering the promise of a cure, sanatoriums isolated

TB patients from the community at large and taught them how to avoid infecting their family,

friends, and coworkers.

           In 1900, there were only 34 sanatoriums operating in the United States, with a total capacity

of roughly 4,500 beds (Rothman 1995, p. 198). After the NASPT began selling Christmas seals,

additional funds became available and the number of sanatoriums grew rapidly. By 1917, there were

well over 200 sanatoriums in operation with a total capacity of more than 19,000 beds (NASPT

1916; Teller 1988, p. 82). Some sanatoriums catered to the rich, offering excellent food and a spa-

like atmosphere (Bates 1992, p. 195; Rappold 2007). In contrast, conditions at publicly funded

sanatoriums could be quite primitive with patients living in tents or lean-tos on the outskirts of


12Teller (1988, p. 46) wrote that “cooperation between public health officials and the voluntary associations was very
common”, but noted that “some officials resented the interference of the tuberculosis associations or thought their
enthusiasm was misplaced.”
13   Knopf (1922), Shryock (1957), and Teller (1988), among others, provide detailed histories of the TB movement.

urban areas. Several publicly funded sanatoriums required patients to perform manual labor as a

means of controlling costs.14



3.2. TB hospitals

         By 1908, a number of prominent public health experts had come to the conclusion that

sanatoriums were inadequate to the task at hand (Bloede 1908; Brown 1908; Newsholme 1908). TB

patients were observed to recover when provided with nutritious food and an opportunity to rest,

only to relapse upon discharge. More resources, they argued, should be devoted towards isolating

the most infections patients—those with advanced pulmonary TB (Bloede 1908; Brown 1908;

Newsholme 1908; Hutchinson 1911; Flick 1912). Although a handful of hospitals specialized in

caring for these patients, beds were in short supply and conditions were generally abysmal (Waters

1912; Teller 1988, p. 92; Abel 2007, p. 42). Working together, local TB associations and municipal

governments opened more facilities; by 1917, there were roughly 150 TB hospitals operating in the

United States (NASPT 1916; Knopf 1922; Teller 1988, p. 92).15



3.3. Open-air camps

         Open-air camps (also referred to as day camps), were seen as a low-cost alternative to

sanatoriums for ambulatory TB patients (Robbins 1906; Townsand 1909). During the day, patients

received care and were taught how to avoid infecting their family, friends, and coworkers. At night,

they returned home “to practice the lessons learned” (Townsand 1909, p. 755). The first open-air

camp in the United States was established by the Boston Association for the Relief and Control of

Rappold (2007) for more details on the conditions in sanatoriums.
15This count includes both hospitals specializing in the care of TB patients and general hospitals with wards set aside
specifically for TB patients.

Tuberculosis in 1905 (Robbins 1906). A decade later, more than 60 open-air camps were operating

across the country (NASPT 1916).



3.4. Dispensaries

         Dispensaries functioned as diagnostic units, disseminated educational materials to the public,

and served as “clearing houses”, sending patients to physicians, sanatoriums, or TB hospitals for

treatment (Knopf 1911, p. 112; Bynum 2012).16 Dispensaries also provided medicines such as cod

liver oil or opiate-based cough mixtures (Bynum 2012; Fraser and Clark 1912), which offered

temporary relief but could not cure TB. The first TB dispensary in the United States was established

in 1891 by Philadelphia’s Rush Hospital for Consumption and Allied Diseases; by 1917, there were

hundreds of dispensaries in operation across the country (NASPT 1919).



3.5. Reporting requirements

         Tuberculosis associations advocated forcefully, and often successfully, for the passage of

laws designed to prevent the spread of the disease. In particular, reporting requirements were

viewed as crucial to the success of the anti-TB campaign (Knopf 1922, p. 149; Teller 1988, p. 22;

Rothman 1995, p. 187). Today, TB case-notification policies and practices are well established in

developed, Western countries, yet under-notification remains a problem in the developing world

(Uplekar et al. forthcoming).17

         At the turn of the 20th century, it was common for physicians to conceal a TB diagnosis

from their patients (Ambler 1903; Cabot 1908; Girdwood 1910). Physicians feared that their


16 Dispensary staff made home visits to educate TB patients on disposing of their sputum, using separate utensils, and
cleaning their home and laundry (Bynum 2012).
17The World Health Organization’s End TB Strategy specifically highlights mandatory TB case notification as integral to
ending the TB epidemic by 2030 (Uplekar et al. forthcoming).

                                                           10
patients, upon being told that they had an incurable disease, would seek a second opinion or remove

themselves to a sanatorium (Fox 1975). By obligating physicians to notify local health officials of

active TB cases, reporting requirements were designed to put an end to this practice and facilitate

the monitoring and education of TB patients. During the period under study, 27 states and over 100

municipalities adopted reporting requirements (NASPT 1911, 1916). In New Jersey, New York,

Minnesota, Virginia, and Wisconsin, so-called “careless consumptives” could be forcibly committed

to TB hospitals or sanatoriums (Teller 1988, pp. 93-94; Roberts 2009, p. 186).



3.6. Disinfection laws

         Between 1900 and 1917, 15 states and over 150 municipalities adopted disinfection

requirements (NASPT 1916). When a living space was left vacant by the death or removal of a TB

patient, the attending physician was expected to notify public health officials so that it could be

disinfected. Health officers directed the disinfection and, when deemed necessary, the renovation of

the premises.18



3.7. Spitting bans

         Chewing tobacco was popular at the turn of the twentieth century, and spittoons could be

found in offices, hotels, and public buildings. Despite the availability of spittoons, contemporary

accounts describe sidewalks and even the floors of street cars as covered in spittle (O’Conner 2015).

By 1917, there were over 150 municipal bans on spitting (NASPT 1916). There is anecdotal




18Knopf (1901, pp. 22-23) provided step-by-step instructions on the “disinfection of the sick-room.” See Vallejo,
California (1913) and Colorado (1914) for examples of disinfection laws.


                                                          11
evidence, however, that these bans were not particularly well enforced. Despite fines as high as $25

dollars per infraction, very few people were actually arrested for spitting in public (Newton 1910).19



3.8. Common drinking cup bans

         Common drinking cups, which were located in schools, trains, and next to municipal water

pumps, were viewed as yet another important source of TB infection (Sedgwick 1902; Tomes 1998;

Sattar 2016). By 1917, 17 states and more than 150 municipalities had banned the use of the

common cup (NASPT 1911, 1916). Working with local governments, tuberculosis associations

made drinking fountains available in schools and other public buildings, but common cups

continued to be popular, especially in small towns and rural areas (Nydegger 1917; Boudreau 1920;

Gladden 1921; McGuire 2012).20



4. MORTALITY DATA AND EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK

         Municipal-level mortality data come from Mortality Statistics, published annually by the U.S.

Census Bureau. The inaugural issue of Mortality Statistics was published in 1900 and contained

mortality counts by cause for over 300 municipalities.21 By 1917, mortality counts for over 500

municipalities were available. Although the Census Bureau continued to publish Mortality Statistics




19Enforcement appears to have been stricter in New York City where, according to Newton (1910), health officers had
made 2,513 arrests for violations of the anti-spitting ordinance passed in 1896. Although anti-spitting laws are still on
the books, enforcement appears to be extremely lax (York 2003; Williams 2015).
20Along with drinking fountains, dispensable cups (e.g., the Dixie Cup) eventually replaced the common cup entirely
(Lee 2007).

21 Cause of death was obtained from the death certificate and coded using the International Classification of Diseases. When
more than one medical condition was listed on the death certificate, cause of death was based on a standardized
algorithm (Armstrong et al. 1999). There is evidence that deaths from TB were, with some frequency, attributed to
bronchitis, malaria, and/or pneumonia (Cabot 1900, p. 27; Cabot 1912), an issue we address below.


                                                             12
through 1922, we chose to focus on the period 1900-1917 in an effort to avoid potential

confounding from the effects of the 1918 influenza epidemic.

            In Figure 1, we report the pulmonary TB mortality rate per 100,000 population for the 548

municipalities in our sample by year.22 The pulmonary TB mortality rate was 173 per 100,000

population in 1900.23 From 1900 to 1917, it fell by nearly 28 percent, to 125. We begin our

exploration of whether the anti-TB measures championed by the TB movement and described in

the previous section contributed to this dramatic reduction in pulmonary TB mortality by estimating

the following baseline regression:



(1)                  ln(Pulmonary TB Mortalitymt) = β0 + Xmtβ1 + vm + wt + Θm· t + εmt,



where m indexes municipalities and t indexes years. Our interest is the variables that compose the

vector Xmt, which were constructed using information available in NASPT (1911, 1916, 1919).

Specifically, the vector Xmt includes separate indicators for whether municipality m was served by a

sanatorium, TB hospital, or an open-air camp in year t. Appendix Table 1 details when the first

sanatorium, TB hospital, and open-air camp opened in each of the municipalities in our sample.24

            The terms v m and wt represent municipality and year fixed effects, respectively. The

municipality fixed effects control for municipal-level determinants of pulmonary TB mortality that

were constant over time. The year fixed effects control for common shocks to pulmonary TB

mortality, although it should be noted that there were no national newspapers or commercial radio


22   On average, each municipality contributed 13.6 observations to the analysis.
23By comparison, the U.S. mortality rate from all forms of TB was 222 per 100,000 population (U.S. Bureau of the
Census 1908, p. 66).
24Note that Appendix Table 1 lists only municipalities for which we have TB mortality data both before and after the
particular anti-TB measure was established.


                                                             13
broadcasts. Efforts to educate the public about TB and encourage good hygiene were undertaken

entirely at the local (e.g., municipal) level until 1908, when the NASPT established a press service

that released bulletins to newspapers and wire services (Teller 1988, p. 59).25 Throughout the period

under study, magazines such as Good Housekeeping, Ladies Home Journal, and Popular Science Monthly ran

stories promoting “antisepticonsciousness” (McClary 1980; Tomes 2000; 2002). Any effect these

publications might have had on TB mortality is captured by the year fixed effects. In addition to the

municipality and year fixed effects, we include municipality-specific linear time trends (Θm· t) to

account for the possibility that pulmonary TB mortality rates evolved at different rates in

municipalities that adopted anti-TB measures versus those that did not. Standard errors are

corrected for clustering at the state level (Bertrand et al. 2004), although clustering at the municipal

level produced almost identical results to those reported below.

         After estimating the baseline regression, we augment the vector Xmt with an indicator for

whether municipality m required the reporting of TB cases. By 1917, 91 municipalities in our sample

had adopted ordinances requiring that active TB cases be reported to local health officials.26 We also

include an indicator for whether the municipality was located in a state that required the reporting of

TB cases, and separate indicators for whether the municipality required the disinfection of premises

vacated by TB patients and whether it was located in a state that required disinfection.

         Next, we augment the vector Xmt with an indicator for whether municipality m prohibited

spitting in public. We also include separate indicators for whether it prohibited the common cup



25Many state and local TB associations established their own press services after 1908 (Teller 1988, p. 59), but before
then newspapers regularly covered the parades, exhibits, and Christmas seal campaigns sponsored by these associations
(Tomes 2002). The first U.S. commercial radio broadcast occurred on November 2, 1920 (election night) in Pittsburgh.
Up until then, radio stations were operated by amateur hobbyists whose target audience was composed of other
hobbyists (Sterling and Kittross 2002, pp. 44-48 and p. 66).
26We observe mortality data before and after the adoption of a reporting ordinance for 71 of these cities (see Appendix
Table 1).


                                                          14
and whether it was located in a state with a common cup ban. Finally, we include separate indicators

for whether municipality m had a TB association, whether it was located in a state with a TB

association, and whether it was served by a TB dispensary.27 Descriptive statistics and definitions for

all of the variables used in the analysis are reported in Table 1.28 Information on when these anti-TB

measures were adopted is available in Appendix Tables 1 and 2.



5. RESULTS

         In the first column of Table 2, we report estimates from the baseline model, which focuses

on the relationship between pulmonary TB mortality and the institutions explicitly designed to

isolate and care for TB patients. While the estimated coefficients of the sanatorium and open-air

camp indicators are negative, they are small in magnitude and not statistically distinguishable from

zero. The relationship between pulmonary TB mortality and the TB hospital indicator is positive,

but also insignificant.

         In the second column of Table 2, we report estimates from a regression model that includes

the reporting and disinfection indicators on the right-hand side. The adoption of a reporting

requirement at the municipal level is associated with a 5.5 percent (e-.057 - 1 = -.055) decrease in the

pulmonary TB mortality rate, an estimate that is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. By

contrast, there is little evidence that state reporting requirements mattered: the estimated coefficient

of the state reporting requirement indicator is small and insignificant. Likewise, there is little


27 Because we have the exact date on when state TB associations began operation, the first year of the state TB indicator
is coded as a fraction. Our definition of TB dispensaries also includes clinics where special medical staffs and separate
hours were set aside for TB patients (NASPT 1911, 1916, 1919).
28 Although not shown in Table 1, we also include binary indicators to control for missing information on the municipal-
level anti-TB measures. For instance, if a city had a common cup ban but information on when the ban went into place
was missing, we coded Common Cup Ordinance as equal to zero and included a separate indicator for this missing
information. With one exception, each of our municipal-level anti-TB measures has non-missing information for at least
92 percent of the sample. We observe non-missing information for the municipal disinfection ordinances for 73 percent
of the sample.

                                                           15
evidence that disinfection requirements at either the municipal or state levels had an effect on

pulmonary TB mortality.

         In the third column of Table 2, we report estimates from a regression model that includes

spitting and common cup bans on the right-hand side; in the fourth column, we report estimates

from a regression model that includes the TB association indicators and an indicator for whether

there was a dispensary in operation in municipality m and year t. None of these anti-TB measures

appear to have had an appreciable impact on the pulmonary TB mortality rate. The estimated

coefficients are, without exception, small in magnitude and measured imprecisely. By contrast, the

relationship between municipal reporting requirements and pulmonary TB mortality is negative,

significant, and remarkably stable across these specifications.29



5.1. A closer look at the role of sanatoriums

         Up to this point in the analysis, we have attempted to capture the effect of the sanatorium

movement with a simple indicator of whether municipality m was served by a sanatorium in year t.

However, the most populous cities in the United States were typically served by multiple

sanatoriums by the end of the period under study. Moreover, private sanatoriums were often




29 In Appendix Table 3, we report the results of regressing the natural log of pulmonary TB mortality on three separate
anti-TB indices. In the first column of Appendix Table 3, we consider an index based on the sum of the state anti-TB
measures listed in Table 1; in the second column, we consider an index based on the sum of the municipal anti-TB
measures listed in Table 1; in the third column, we consider an index based on the sum of all of the anti-TB measures
listed in Table 1. The results provide no evidence of a relationship between pulmonary TB mortality and these
alternative measures of the intensity of the anti-TB movement. We also experimented with consolidating the variables
on municipal- and state-level reporting requirements, disinfection requirements, common cup bans, and TB associations
into four separate indicators. For example, we defined the reporting requirement variable as equal to one if the
municipality or the municipality’s state required the reporting of TB cases. None of these alternatively defined anti-TB
measures were significantly associated with the pulmonary TB mortality rate. Lastly, we explored whether reporting
requirements were more effective in municipalities that were served by a sanatorium. We found no evidence that the
interaction between Reporting Ordinance and Sanatorium had an effect on the pulmonary TB mortality rate.


                                                          16
located in rural areas where air pollution, which was intense in industrial cities such as Chicago,

Pittsburgh, and St. Louis (Stradling and Thorsheim 1999), would not interfere with recovery.30

          In the first column of Table 3, we replace the sanatorium indicator with a continuous

variable equal to the number of sanatoriums in municipality m at time t.31 In 1900, only three

municipalities in our sample were served by a sanatorium; by 1910, 37 of the municipalities in our

sample were served by at least one sanatorium, 8 had at least two, and 4 had three or more; by 1917,

80 municipalities were served by at least one sanatorium, 13 had at least two, and 6 had three or

more.32

          The estimated coefficient of the continuous sanatorium variable is positive, but not

significant at conventional levels. In an effort to rule out reverse causality, we experimented with

adding leads of the sanatorium variables to the regression model. There was no evidence that

sanatoriums were opened in response to upswings (or downswings) in TB mortality.33

          In column (2), we replace the sanatorium indicator with the number of sanatorium beds in

municipality m at time t.34 In our sample, the average sanatorium had a capacity of nearly 100 beds.

However, the number of beds varied widely, with some sanatoriums serving fewer than 10 patients

and others accommodating over 1,000. While the estimated coefficient on our measure of


30Private sanatoriums catered to the affluent, but could be as large as publicly funded sanatoriums. For instance, the
Agnes Memorial Sanatorium in Denver, CO accommodated over 150 patients in 1916, while the Sanatorium of the New
Bedford Anti-Tuberculosis Association in New Bedford, MA accommodated over 100 patients (NASPT 1916).
31We also experimented with using the number of sanatoriums per 100,000 population of municipality m in year t, but
found no evidence that this alternative measure was related to the pulmonary TB mortality rate.
32
 We have pulmonary TB mortality data before and after the opening of a sanatorium for 70 of these cities (see
Appendix Table 1).
33These results are available upon request. We experimented with including 1-3 leads of the sanatorium indicator as well
as including 1-3 leads of the continuous sanatorium measure. The estimated coefficients of these leads were consistently
small and statistically insignificant. We found similar results when we experimented with using continuous variables for
open-air camps and TB hospitals.
34
 We also experimented with using the number of beds per 100,000 population, but found no evidence that this
measure was related to the pulmonary TB mortality rate.


                                                          17
sanatorium capacity is negative in sign, it is small in magnitude and statistically indistinguishable

from zero.35

         In columns (3) and (4), we explore whether the opening of sanatoriums at the state, as

opposed to the municipal, level had an effect on pulmonary TB mortality. Specifically, in column (3)

we show the results of augmenting the baseline equation with an indicator for whether municipality

m was located in state with a sanatorium, and in column (4) we include the total number of

sanatoriums operating in the state at time t. The results suggest that the opening of sanatoriums at

the state level did little to curb the spread of pulmonary TB.

         Finally, in column (5) of Table 3, we investigate the role of state-run sanatoriums. In 1900,

there were no state-run sanatoriums in the country, but by the end of the period under study there

were 29 in operation and they represented a substantial portion of total capacity (NASPT 1919).36

State-run sanatoriums were typically located in rural areas and were considered more desirable than

county-run or municipal sanatoriums. Unlike other publicly funded sanatoriums, state-run

sanatoriums often charged weekly fees to “keep out the riffraff” and prioritized admitting incipient

TB cases over chronic or advanced cases (Rothman 1995, pp. 207-208).37


35It should be noted that our sanatorium-bed measure is, because of data limitations, somewhat crude. We only observe
sanatorium capacity at the three points in time corresponding to the publications of the NASPT’s Tuberculosis Directory
(1911, 1916, and 1919). For the intervening years, we assume that capacity remained constant.

36According to Teller (1988, p. 82), there were 94 public sanatoriums operating in the United States by 1916. A total of
7,501 beds were available in state-run sanatoriums, 1,279 beds were available in federal sanatoriums, and 4,736 beds were
available in municipal sanatoriums. By comparison, there were 87 private sanatoriums operating in the United States in
1916, with a total of 3,447 beds, and 42 philanthropic sanatoriums with a total of 2,711 beds (Teller 1988, p. 82). See
Appendix Table 2 for information on when each state-run sanatorium opened during the period 1900-1917. We observe
mortality data for 277 municipalities before and after the opening of 25 state-run sanatoriums.

37Dr. Herbert Clapp, a supervising physician at the Massachusetts state-run sanatorium, described cases that should be
refused admission:

         No bedridden patients should be accepted, nor even those who are confined to their rooms.
         If an applicant is not strong enough to ride some distance to the examining office, it is cause
         enough for his rejection…No case of acute tuberculosis should be admitted, nor any case
         with high fever, nor even with a temperature which, after rest in bed with open windows for
         one or two weeks, does not come down to perhaps 100° (Clapp 1906, pp. 342-343).


                                                            18
         The estimated effect of state-run sanatoriums is negative and significant, although relatively

small in terms of magnitude. Specifically, the opening of a state-run sanatorium is associated with a

3.7 percent (e-.038 - 1 = -.037) reduction in the pulmonary TB mortality rate. This effect is explored

in greater depth below.



5.2. Extensions and robustness checks

         In Table 4, we present estimates of equation (1) augmented with leads and lags of the

municipal reporting ordinance. Consistent with the parallel trends assumption, there is little

evidence that pulmonary TB mortality increased in the years leading up to the passage of TB

reporting requirements. Before Year 0 (the year in which doctors were required to report active TB

cases to local health officials), estimates of the relationship between the reporting indicator and

pulmonary TB mortality are small and statistically insignificant; after three years, these estimates are

consistently negative and statistically significant at conventional levels. Three or more years after

being adopted, the reporting ordinance is associated with a 9-12 percent decrease in pulmonary TB

mortality.38

         Previous studies have produced strong evidence that turn-of-the-century efforts to improve

water quality led to substantial reductions in mortality from waterborne diseases (Troesken 2001;

Cutler and Miller 2005; Ferrie and Troesken 2008; Beach et al. 2016). Moreover, there is evidence,

albeit descriptive in nature, that these efforts reduced mortality from non-waterborne diseases,




38In Appendix Table 4, we present estimates of equation (1) augmented with leads and lags of the state-run sanatorium
indicator. Again, consistent with the parallel trends assumption, there is little evidence that pulmonary TB mortality
increased in the years leading up to the opening of the first state-run sanatorium. By contrast, after 3 years it is
associated with a 3-5 percent decrease in pulmonary TB mortality, although it should be noted that the estimated
coefficient of the 3+ Years After State-Run Sanatorium indicator is not consistently significant at conventional levels.


                                                           19
including TB (Sedgwick and MacNutt 1910; McGee, 1920).39 Although some contemporary

researchers suggested that tuberculosis might be transmitted through waste water (Brown et al. 1916;

Fink et al. 1917), a more likely explanation for what was dubbed the “Mills–Reincke Phenomenon”

is that typhoid and other gastronomical diseases weakened the host, increasing his or her

susceptibility to infection from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Ferrie and Troesken 2008).

         Because municipal chlorination and filtration projects could have been correlated with the

adoption of TB reporting requirements, we included the mortality rate from typhoid on the right-

hand side of the estimation equation as a robustness check (Clay et al. 2014). The results of this

exercise are reported in the first column of Table 5. Including the typhoid mortality rate as a proxy

for water quality reduces the magnitude of the estimated relationship between municipal reporting

requirements and pulmonary TB mortality. Specifically, requiring that TB cases be reported to local

health officials is associated with a 4.9 percent decrease in pulmonary TB mortality, an estimate that

is significant at the 10 percent level.

         In column (2) of Table 5, we restrict our attention to municipalities with more than 50,000

residents. With this restriction in place, reporting requirements are associated with a 6.5 percent

decrease in pulmonary TB mortality, which is slightly larger than the baseline estimates reported in

Table 2. In column (3) of Table 5, we restrict our attention to municipalities with more than 50,000

residents and population densities in the top 50th percentile.40 Perhaps because overcrowding

facilitated the spread of TB (Rothman 1995, pp. 184-185; Schmidt 2008), the estimated effect of

reporting ordinances in column (3) is slightly larger than the baseline estimates in Table 2. Likewise,



39See also Ferrie and Troesken (2008). Using data from Chicago for the period 1855-1925, these authors found a
positive relationship between typhoid mortality and mortality from respiratory diseases. Specifically, an additional death
from typhoid fever was associated with 1-1.5 additional deaths from tuberculosis and pneumonia.
40Information on population density for the 100 largest cities in 1910 is available from the U.S. Census Bureau at:
http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab14.txt.


                                                            20
when we restrict the sample to municipalities with 18 years of non-missing data, the adoption of a

reporting requirement is associated with a 6.8 percent decrease in the pulmonary TB mortality rate.

         Reporting requirements were aimed at reducing the human-to-human transmission of

pulmonary TB. In column (5) of Table 5, we test whether they were related to non-pulmonary TB,

which was usually caused by contaminated milk (Teller 1988, pp. 67-68).41 Because the incidence of

non-pulmonary TB mortality was much lower than that of pulmonary TB (and was, in fact, equal to

zero for 716 municipality-year combinations), we take its quartic root instead of taking its natural

log.42 Reassuringly, requiring that TB cases be reported to local health officials is not associated with

decreased mortality from non-pulmonary TB. In fact, the estimated marginal effect, although small

relative to the mean of non-pulmonary TB mortality, is positive. By contrast, taking the quartic root

of pulmonary TB mortality produces an estimated marginal effect that is similar in magnitude to the

original estimate reported in Table 2.

         In Table 6, we investigate the robustness of the negative relationship between the opening of

a state-run sanatorium and pulmonary TB mortality. Controlling for typhoid mortality reduces the

absolute magnitude of this relationship, but the estimated coefficient is still negative and significant

at the 5 percent level. Likewise, restricting the sample to municipalities that contributed 18 years of

data produces a slightly smaller estimate than that reported in Table 3, but it is still significant at

conventional levels. Finally, while there is no evidence that state-run sanatoriums affected non-




41In general, the TB movement was focused on eliminating human-to-human transmission of pulmonary TB and all but
ignored bovine TB (Teller 1988, p. 69). Although, a handful of states required the tuberculin testing of dairy cows,
bovine TB was not effectively controlled until after 1917, when the USDA undertook a campaign to eradicate the
disease (Olmstead and Rhode 2004). Throughout the period under study, milk stations in New York and other cities
provided clean milk at a reduced price to poor mothers (Meckel 1990, pp. 78-80). In 1909, Chicago became the first
municipality to require the pasteurization of milk. By 1921, most large cities in the United States required pasteurization,
which protected consumers from bovine TB and other milk-borne diseases such as typhoid (Meckel 1990, p. 89).
42This method of dealing with zeros has been used by Thomas et al. (2006), Tarozzi et al. (2014) and Ashraf et al.
(2015), among others. The marginal effect of requiring that TB cases be reported to local health officials is in brackets.

                                                            21
pulmonary TB mortality, their impact appears to have been most pronounced in municipalities with

more than 50,000 residents.



6. WAS MORTALITY FROM OTHER AIRBORNE DISEASES AFFECTED?

        In Figure 2, we show trends in mortality for influenza/pneumonia and other airborne

illnesses, a broad grouping that includes mortality from measles, scarlet fever, whooping cough (i.e.,

pertussis), and diphtheria/croup. Like pulmonary TB, these diseases are typically transmitted by

aerosolized respiratory secretions (for instance, from coughing or sneezing).43 During the period

1900-1917, mortality from influenza/pneumonia remained relatively stable, while the mortality rate

from other airborne illnesses fell from 105.8 to 45.6.

        Did the measures championed by the U.S. TB movement affect mortality from

influenza/pneumonia and/or other airborne illnesses? Several anti-TB measures could have, in

theory, reduced mortality from other diseases transmitted through respiratory secretions. Indeed,

the Centers for Disease Control still recommends frequent hand washing and the covering of

coughs to prevent the spread of germs, and would presumably frown upon public spitting and the

use of common cups. Although the threat of TB has receded and anti-spitting laws are no longer

enforced in the United States (York 2003; Williams 2015), authorities in Beijing, London, and

Mumbai have justified recent efforts to discourage spitting on public health grounds (Yardley 2007;

Pettitt 2015; Sujit and Iyer. 2015).

        In the first column of Table 7, we report results from regressing mortality due to influenza

and pneumonia on the spitting law and common cup indicators. In addition, we control for whether

municipality m had a TB association and whether it was located in a state with a TB association.


43During the period under study, there were no effective vaccines or cures for influenza, measles, scarlet fever, or
whooping cough (Quinn 1989; Roush and Murphy. 2007; Cowling et al. 2013; Cherry 2015). However, diphtheria could
be treated using a horse-derived antitoxin (Wagner et al. 2009).

                                                        22
This exercise produces no support for the notion that spitting laws, common cup ordinances, or

efforts on the part of TB associations to educate the public and legislate its behavior had an impact

on mortality due to influenza and pneumonia. When we include the other anti-TB measures (e.g.,

the sanatorium and TB hospital indicators) on the right-hand side of the regression, the results are

similar. However, we do find some evidence that municipal spitting laws may have led to small

reductions in the influenza and pneumonia mortality rate.

         Next, we examine the effects of anti-TB measures on mortality from other airborne illnesses

(i.e., measles, scarlet fever, whooping cough, and diphtheria/croup). The results provide little

support for the notion that the adoption of anti-TB measures contributed to the dramatic reduction

in mortality due to these illnesses documented in Figure 2.44



7. GAUGING THE OVERALL IMPACT OF THE TB MOVEMENT

         We begin this section with an examination of municipal reporting requirements and their

contribution to the overall decline in pulmonary TB mortality. As noted above, 91 municipalities in

our sample had adopted ordinances requiring that active TB cases be reported to local health

officials by 1917; the adoption of such an ordinance is associated with an approximately 6 percent

decline in the pulmonary TB mortality rate (Table 2).

         To gauge the impact of reporting ordinances, we calculated what the pulmonary TB

mortality rate would have been had none of the municipalities in our sample required reporting of

active TB cases. Figure 3 shows the predicted pulmonary TB rate for every year t (and its 90 percent

confidence interval) under this scenario. Predicted pulmonary TB mortality rates are based on the




44 Because deaths from TB were, with some frequency, attributed to bronchitis, malaria, and/or pneumonia (Cabot 1900,
p. 27; Cabot 1912), we experimented with including these diseases in Other Airborne Illnesses Mortality. The estimates
reported in Table 7 changed very little when using this alternative definition.

                                                         23
regression estimates in column (4) of Table 2. The actual pulmonary TB mortality rate among the

municipalities that compose our sample is also provided.

       The actual and predicted pulmonary TB mortality rates are not far apart throughout the

period under study, suggesting that the ordinances did not contribute substantially to the observed

overall decline in pulmonary TB mortality. By 1917, the actual pulmonary TB mortality rate among

municipalities in our sample was 125 per 100,000 population, its lowest level during the period under

study. Had no municipality adopted a reporting ordinance, we predict that it would have been 128

per 100,000 population. Even using the upper bound of the 90 percent confidence interval, we

predict that the pulmonary TB mortality rate would have fallen from 173 to 132 had no reporting

ordinances been adopted.

       Finally, we use a similar strategy, and the regression estimates in column (4) of Table 2, to

gauge the combined contribution of all the anti-TB measures adopted during the period under study

(Figure 4). From 1900 to 1917, the pulmonary TB mortality rate among the municipalities in our

sample fell by nearly 28 percent, from 173 to 125 per 100,000 population. Had no anti-TB measures

been adopted, we predict that the pulmonary TB mortality rate would have been 122 per 100,000

population in 1917. Using the upper bound of the 90 percent confidence interval, we predict that

the pulmonary TB mortality rate would have still fallen by 22 percent, to 135.5 per 100,000

population, had no anti-TB measures been implemented at either the municipal or state levels.



8. CONCLUSION

       One out of every 4 people alive today has a latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (Houben and

Dodds 2016). Most TB infections, if they become active, can be successfully treated with

antimicrobial medicines, but the WHO (2015, p. 56) estimates that 3.3 percent of new TB cases are




                                                 24
multidrug-resistant.45 With experts warning that multidrug-resistant strains of TB represent a

“looming public health crisis” (Frieden 2015), it is perhaps more important than ever that we

accurately assess the effectiveness of basic, “low-tech” public health measures, many of which were

pioneered by the TB movement.

         The U.S. TB movement can be traced to the establishment of the Pennsylvania Society for

the Prevention of Tuberculosis in 1892 (Shryock 1957, p. 52); it gained momentum with the

founding of the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis (NASPT) in

1904. Between 1904 and 1917, hundreds of state and local TB associations were established across

the country with the goal of educating the public and providing support to sanatoriums, TB

hospitals, and open-air camps. TB associations also advocated for the passage of legislation aimed at

curbing the spread of TB. Such legislation included bans on public spitting and requirements that

active TB cases be reported to health officials. Reporting requirements prevented physicians from

concealing TB diagnoses and allowed public health officials to monitor TB patients (Teller 1988, p.

22).

         Despite the remarkable scope and influence of the TB movement, its effect on TB mortality

has not been studied in a systematic fashion. In fact, many historians appear to believe that gauging

the impact of the TB movement on TB mortality is impossible. For instance, Bates (1989, p. 349)

wrote that, “in the absence of controlled studies,” we may never know “whether or to what degree

the tuberculosis movement contributed to the declining death rate in the United States or improved

the health of tuberculosis patients.” Experts from other disciplines have also expressed skepticism

regarding the effectiveness of the TB movement (McKeown 1976; Coker 2003; Daniel 2006).




45Multidrug-resistant TB is caused by the bacteria adapting to the drugs typically used to treat it, making them
ineffective. The recommend treatment for drug-susceptible TB lasts six-months, but treatment for multidrug-resistant
TB takes 20 months, requires more toxic drugs, and has a much lower success rate (WHO 2015, p. 4).

                                                         25
        Using newly digitized mortality data at the municipal-year level, we explore the effect of the

TB movement on pulmonary TB mortality. We find strong evidence that requiring TB cases to be

reported to local health officials led to a 6 percent reduction in the pulmonary TB mortality rate,

lending support to the argument that addressing the under-notification problem is critical to the

success of anti-TB efforts in developing counties today (Uplekar et al. forthcoming). We also find

that the establishment of a state-run sanatorium led to an almost 4 percent reduction in the

pulmonary TB mortality rate. By contrast, there is no evidence that other anti-TB measures (for

instance, requiring the premises of deceased TB patients to be disinfected or the prohibition of

common drinking cups) were effective.

         Finally, to gauge the overall effect of the TB movement, we calculated what the pulmonary

TB mortality rate would have been had no anti-TB measures been implemented. During the period

under study, the pulmonary TB mortality rate among the municipalities in our sample fell by nearly

28 percent, from 173 to 125 per 100,000 population. Had no anti-TB measures been adopted, we

predict that the pulmonary TB mortality rate would have been 122 per 100,000 population in 1917.

Using the upper bound of the 90 percent confidence interval, we predict that the pulmonary TB

mortality rate would have still fallen by 22 percent, to 135.5 per 100,000 population, had the TB

movement never occurred. Based on these estimates, we conclude that the basic anti-TB measures

employed during the early 1900s did not contribute substantially to the marked decline in the TB

mortality rate.

Notes: Based on annual data from Mortality Statistics for the period 1900-1917, published by the U.S. Census Bureau. Each column represents the
results from a separate OLS regression. Columns (1)-(4): The dependent variable is equal to the natural log of the pulmonary tuberculosis mortality
rate per 100,000 population in municipality m and year t. Columns (5)-(6): The dependent variable is equal to the quartic root of the specified
mortality rate per 100,000 population in municipality m and year t; marginal effects are in brackets. Controls include the covariates listed in Table 1,
municipality fixed effects, year fixed effects, and municipality-specific linear trends. Regressions are weighted by municipality population. Standard
errors, corrected for clustering at the state level, are in parentheses.

Notes: Based on annual data from Mortality Statistics for the period 1900-1917, published by the U.S.
Census Bureau. Each column represents the results from a separate OLS regression. The dependent
variable is equal to the natural log of the pulmonary tuberculosis mortality rate per 100,000 population
in municipality m and year t. Column (1): The state anti-TB index is equal to the sum of the state anti-
TB measures listed in Table 1. Column (2): The municipal anti-TB index is equal to the sum of the
municipal anti-TB measures listed in Table 1. Column (3): The state and municipal anti-TB index is
equal to the sum of all of the anti-TB measures listed in Table 1. Controls include municipality fixed
effects, year fixed effects, and municipality-specific linear trends. Regressions are weighted by
municipality population. Standard errors, corrected for clustering at the state level, are in parentheses.

Notes: Based on annual data from Mortality Statistics for the period 1900-1917, published by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Each column represents the results from a separate OLS regression. The dependent variable is equal to the natural log of
the pulmonary tuberculosis mortality rate per 100,000 population in municipality m and year t. Controls include the
covariates listed in Table 1, municipality fixed effects, year fixed effects, and municipality-specific linear trends.
Regressions are weighted by municipality population. Standard errors, corrected for clustering at the state level, are in
parentheses.
