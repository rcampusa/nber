Academic Engagement, Commercialization, and Scholarship: Empirical Evidence from Agricultural
and Life Scientists at U.S. Land-grant Universities

                                          ABSTRACT

This article examines the involvement of agricultural and life science faculty at U.S. land grant
universities in two types of university-industry relations: academic engagement (sponsored
research, industry collaborations, and presentations), academic commercialization (patenting,
licensing, and start-ups) and traditional academic scholarship. It exploits large-scale, random
sample cross-section surveys of nearly 1,500 scientists at the original 52 Land Grant Universities
in 2005 and 2015. We fill a knowledge gap regarding the prevalence, coincidence, intensity,
importance and factors shaping faculty involvement in university-industry relations (UIR). After
several decades of promotion and emphasis on UIR activities participation in them has plateaued
and is stable at a fairly high level. Academic engagement is far more prevalent (at 76% of
faculty) and important than is academic commercialization (at 19% of faculty). Academic
engagement generates 15-20 times the research funds than academic commercialization does, but
both continue to be dwarfed by public funding. We find evidence of synergies between UIR
activities and academic scholarship. We also explore how individual, institutional, and university-
level factors help explain faculty UIR participation. We find differences across academic
disciplines and highlight the role that faculty attitudes toward science and commercial activity
shape involvement in UIR. Significant differences also stem from university level effects and
may be contingent on culture, history, location, and quality of science.

1       Introduction


        Research on the factors shaping University-Industry Relations (UIR) has exploded in recent
decades, as reflected by the hundreds of recent articles published on this topic.1 At the heart
of this take-off was the push by universities worldwide to pursue opportunities to commercialize
intellectual property rights. Arguably, the 1981 passage of the Bayh-Dole Act put U.S. public
research universities at the forefront of this global expansion. It expanded the intellectual property
rights of American universities and their researchers to commercialize innovations and discoveries
associated with federally sponsored research (Henderson and Jaffee, 1998; Grimaldi et al., 2011;
Sampat, 2006; Thursby and Thursby 2011). European and universities elsewhere followed suit to
varying degrees. In the process, UIR around the globe expanded traditional scholarship models
of publishing and training students into directly engaging with industry and entering commercial
domains via patents, start-ups, and other forms of corporate-university alliances.

        Our study sheds light on the ground-level of UIR at leading U.S. Land-Grant Universities
(LGUs) by examining the activities, attitudes, and research choices of individual agricultural and
life science faculty. At LGUs, faculty engagement with industry dates back to the end of the 19th
century based on an explicit emphasis on practical agricultural and engineering sciences, formal
extension appointments for faculty, and ongoing outreach with farms and firms to improve their
performance. The recent salience of UIR activities to U.S. LGUs stems from the considerable
financial stress they faced over the past three decades due to significant declines in state and
federal support (Just and Huffman, 2009; Ehrenberg, 2012; Hoag, 2005).2 Hence, most U.S. LGUs
pursued academic commercialization as a potential mechanism to generate royalties and start-up
revenue streams (Thursby and Thursby, 2011).

        Our article exploits rich and unique, representative individual-level cross-sectional and panel
survey data gathered in 2005 and 2015 from agricultural and life science faculty from all 52 of the
    1
     See for example: Agrawal, 2001; Djokovic and Souitarius, 2008; Geuna and Muscio, 2009; Perkmann et al.
2013; Sengupta and Ray, 2017.

     For example, compared to the 2007/08 school year, state spending on higher education, which is a significant
portion of Land Grant University budgets nationwide was down in 2015 by 23% or $2,026 per student (Mitchell,
Palacios, Leachman; 2015)

original 1863 U.S. Land Grant Universities. We explore the prevalence, intensity, and importance
of U.S. land-grant faculty's work with industry as compared to traditional scholarship activities.
We also examine how faculty attitudes toward research choices shape their participation in UIR,
and how they combine UIR with traditional scholarship activities. We divide university indus-
try relations into two types.3 One is academic engagement (AE), defined as faculty participation
in sponsored and collaborative research, contract research, consulting, and informal relationships
with private firms and institutions. Academic commercialization (AC) is the other, defined as fac-
ulty participation in private intellectual property creation (via invention disclosures, patents, and
licensing) and entrepreneurship (e.g., start-ups). These definitions are used in other recent articles
that examine UIR among university faculty in Europe (D'Este and Perkmann, 2011; Perkmann et
al., 2011; Tartari et al., 2014; Tartari and Salter, 2015; Sengupta and Ray, 2017).

       These apparently contrasting categories are not mutually exclusive types of UIR, with many
faculty doing both academic engagement and commercialization (AE/AC). In our analysis we
contrast faculty who engage in these three categories - engagement (AE), commercialization (AC),
and both (AE/AC) - with faculty who are not engaged in any of the three, which we categorize as
"Traditional Scholar" (TS) .4 Together these four categories (AE, AC, AE/AC, and TS) characterize
how university faculty engage with industry.

       We address four major questions: What is the prevalence and intensity of `academic engage-
ment' and `academic commercialization' activities among agricultural and life science faculty at
flagship public research universities across the United States? What role does UIR play in funding
faculty research? How do the research and teaching outputs of faculty active in UIR activities
compare to those of Traditional Scholars? And, last but certainly not least, how do the UIR
activities and attitudes of land grant agricultural and life science faculty align with researcher
motivations for their choice of research problem? Because UIR activities "tend to be individually
driven and pursued on a discretionary basis," (Perkmann et al. 2015, p. 424), we examine them
   3
    We follow the classification adopted in Perkmann et al (2013).
   4
    We are cognizant of the long-standing tradition of faculty, especially at Land-Grant Universities, engaging with
industry. Our nomenclature is meant to distinguish between the traditional activities of teaching and research with
UIR.




                                                         3
at the individual faculty level where we can probe how they meet the values and motivations of
faculty. Participation largely depends on the `independent initiative of autonomous, highly skilled'
faculty pursuing research and knowledge transfer activities that they value for scientific and/or
commercial reasons.

    Our work builds on several recent research contributions, and is especially motivated by the
Perkmann et al. (2013) review on faculty activity in university industry relations. They identify
three major information gaps, which we address directly in this paper. One is the lack of com-
parative evidence from U.S. universities regarding faculty engagement in distinct types of UIR
activities, since the literature is mostly based on European university data. They also document
surprisingly little examination of the two UIR activities (engagement and commercialization) side-
by-side and the factors shaping faculty engagement with them. Although there is a vast body
of research on academic commercialization and its impacts on faculty scholarship (Agarwal and
Henderson, 2002; Azoulay et al. 2007), relatively little research compares and contrasts it with the
full set of possible ways for faculty to engage with industry, as we do here. The third is the lack of
temporal - including longitudinal - evidence that allows attention to trends over time of innovation
in UIR. This is now a relatively mature episode, with the academic commercialization take-off in
the U.S. having occurred by the 1990s and in Europe not long afterwards, which warrants study.

    Other recent papers help to motivate this article. Sengupta and Ray (2017) probe the dynamic
relationship between both types of UIR (what they call Knowledge Transfer) and traditional re-
search outputs at UK research universities. Using a longitudinal, university-level dataset (spanning
2008-14), they find that both academic engagement and academic commercialization are positively
associated with past research performance. However, consistent with the higher prevalence and
intensity of academic engagement relative to academic commercialization in UK universities, they
also show that only the former has strong positive feedback effects on subsequent research perfor-
mance, both via funding and research scholarship (using both quantity and quality measures). This
major finding in the UK helps to set the broad stage for our analysis of UIR and research activities
among individual agricultural and life science faculty in the major U.S. Land-Grant universities.




                                                  4
    In D'Este and Perkmann's (2011), they distinguish between two ways in which faculty at-
titudes toward UIR may shape their participation. In the first, faculty are viewed as academic
entrepreneurs who seek to engage in UIR for commercialization reasons, what we refer to as
commercial motivation. In the second, faculty are viewed as scientists operating in a `strongly in-
stitutionalized environment' who mainly seek UIR collaborations to advance their research efforts,
what we later call intrinsic motivation. We recover these motivations from our data using factor
analysis of attitudinal questions and then in a similar fashion to D'Este and Perkmann (2011) link
them to faculty activity choices.

    Finally, Perkmann et al. (2013), as well as Sengupta and Ray (2017), highlight the potential
importance of university level infrastructure, research quality, and incentives for promotion and
salary increases in shaping faculty engagement with UIR activities. Specifically, the historical
experience and current resource base associated with university technology transfers offices can
positively shape UIR outcomes. Likewise, universities with higher quality research performance
may be more attractive to industry partners and thus attract UIR. Cutting the other way is the
possibility that faculty at the very top universities, especially in some fields, may be less inclined
toward applied research and UIR relative to pursuing large public or foundation grants and peer-
based collaborations.

    Our analysis of the data on LGU faculty answers the four research questions as follows. First, at
U.S. LGUs, academic engagement, which includes sponsored research, industry collaborations, and
presentations, is far more prevalent and intensively pursued than is academic commercialization,
which includes patenting, licensing, and start-ups. Several decades into the LGU push toward
commercialization, faculty participation appears to have plateaued at much lower levels than their
academic engagement. And, additional longitudinal evidence shows that academic engagement
is the more steadily pursued form of UIR, while academic commercialization appears to be more
opportunistic, perhaps consistent with the notion that only occasional scientific breakthroughs are
worthy of a patent.

    Second, commercialization generates very low levels of revenue streams for the operation of



                                                  5
LGU faculty research labs. By contrast, funding generated by sponsored research of various sorts
(including continued support from commodity organizations) outpaces commercialization revenues
by a ratio of about 15:1, and represents for many faculty a substantive portion of their research lab
expenditures. Nonetheless, public funding, especially federal funds, continue to be the majority
source of faculty lab funding. Thus, while academic engagement is far more important as a revenue
stream for faculty research activities than is commercialization, it remains overall a distant second
to public funds.

    Third, consistent with many previous studies we find that UIR activities of both types are
higher among faculty with higher levels of traditional academic scholarship outputs. Thus, UIR
and academic scholarship appear to be synergistic, reflecting at an individual level the dynamic
feedbacks identified by Sengupta and Ray (2017) in UK data at a university level. This 'synergy'
finding also implies that concerns about major trade-offs between faculty UIR activity and tradi-
tional academic scholarship may be off track. Indeed, they appear to overlook a positive dynamic
feedback loop that can nourish more of both types of activity over time.

    Finally, the regression analysis reveals that individual, institutional, and university-level fac-
tors all help to explain faculty UIR activity. As found elsewhere, attitudes and activity choice align
in ways consistent with faculty participating in UIR for reasons related to advancing scientific re-
search rather than pursuing commercialization outcomes. The university-level fixed effect results
are also intriguing, as they suggest that higher levels of UIR activity are contingent on culture,
history, location, and quality of science associated with the overall university (not just individual
faculty).

    The next section describes the context of colleges of agriculture and life sciences at U.S. Land
Grant Universities, while section 3 introduces the data and explains our methods. Section 4
presents the results, while section 5 discusses the implications of our findings for UIR in the U.S.
Section 6 concludes.

2   U.S. Land-Grant Universities


    Three major legislative acts frame the longstanding tradition of academic engagement at US
LGUs (Fitzgerald et al. 2016). The first is the Morrill Act of 1862 which granted states land to help
finance the establishment of public universities. They emphasized agricultural and mechanical arts
in support of those two major economic sectors, while broadening access to education and training.
The second is the Hatch Act of 1887 which provided funding to land-grant universities to invest
in agricultural experimental stations. It recognized the value of increasing public commitment to
research that advanced knowledge for both farmers and consumers with respect to production and
nutrition/health outcomes. Finally, the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 created the infrastructure for
delivering knowledge to society via an extension system. It aimed at both sharing research discov-
eries with farmers, firms, and consumers and identifying future research issues based on feedback
from those and other `stakeholders'. Combined, these three acts shaped a long and rich history of
`academic engagement' at US LGUs that featured colleges of agriculture (and later `life sciences')
as the cutting-edge of UIR activities. Some faculty appointments included explicit attention to
`extension' in combination with traditional scholarship: research and instruction duties.

    Faculty in US colleges of agricultural and life sciences generally span the breadth of basic
and applied sciences reflected across the rest of public research universities. Some departments
are filled primarily with mostly basic scientists. This holds especially in "biology" departments,
such as genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry, as well as in "ecology" departments (of var-
ious names). There are mostly applied (but some basic) scientists in animal science departments
(including specialties in dairy or poultry science), food and nutrition science departments, plant
science departments (including agronomy, entomology, horticulture, plant pathology, and soil sci-
ence), and agricultural or biosystems engineering. Finally, colleges of agriculture and life sciences
have social scientist departments of various names that include economists, sociologists, journalism
and communications, and regional planning and community development faculty. While most of
these social scientists tend to work on more `applied' questions, there are also some who could be
viewed as closer to `basic' in their orientation to pursuing advances on `theory' and `measurement'



                                                 7
issues rather than emphasizing applied questions. Thus, the fields in US LGUs tend to provide
distinctive `institutional' contexts in which to frame the likely connections between faculty and
UIR activities.

    In the 1990s, as with other universities, academic commercialization efforts took off in US
Land Grant University colleges of agriculture and life sciences (Barham et al. 2002; Foltz et al.
2003; Sampat, 2006). Biotechnology patents especially were viewed as a potential source of growth
and expansion in both UIR and revenue streams for universities and faculty inventors. A plethora
of literature explores this period (Phan and Siegel, 2006; Grimaldi et al., 2011), with a primary
focus on whether academic activities and the pursuit of open science would be advanced or reduced
by the attention to commercialization efforts (Thursby and Thursby, 2011). At the `field level',
this AC push arguably expanded the potential for higher levels of faculty participation in UIR
among more basic scientists who might be able to pursue patents on discoveries more readily than
they might seek out sponsored research or active collaboration with industry scientists. Thus, it is
arguable that AC engagement may be higher among biologists, but the longstanding engagement
with AE activities by the more applied scientists could also readily give rise to patenting and
commercialization efforts depending on the research topics and discoveries being pursued. These
cross-cutting trends make it difficult to envision a clear distinction in terms of AC participation
across the natural science fields. On the other hand, social scientists are far less likely to be
engaged with patenting and licensing efforts. Most of their `idea' discoveries are likely to be
algorithms and statistical or system modeling innovations rather than material ones. As a result,
AC participation among social scientists is likely to be lower than other types of science faculty in
colleges of agriculture and life sciences.

    The rise in US LGU efforts to promote AC coincided with a secular decline in federal and
state support for higher education (Ehrenberg, 2012). While LGUs were initially able to largely
compensate for that decline by raising tuition fees, significant pressures on the research and salary
expenditures were experienced especially between 2005 and 2015 (Mitchell, Palacios, Leachman,
2015). During that time period, most LGUs experienced an overall decline in state revenues.
Faculty increasingly experienced real declines in salary levels as well as increased pressure to pursue


                                                  8
extramural funding of various types - including UIR - to support their labs and their salaries
(American Academy of Arts & Sciences, 2016). Indeed, many colleges of agricultural and life
sciences pursued conversions of faculty salary contracts from 12-month to 9-month appointments.
Faculty were `incentivized' to pursue the additional 3 months of salary through external sources
or `administrative' postings. All of these changes could potentially be viewed as commercial or
financial motivations to increase both AE and AC efforts, if in fact they held potential for filling
holes in research budgets and faculty summer salary needs.

        Two other contextual trends in US LGUs warrant attention here. One is the pressure on
research time associated with `changes' in university budgets. As documented in Barham et al.
(2014), US LGU agricultural and life science faculty reported declines in `research time' and con-
comitant increases in time spent on administrative activities. Reducing support staff and increasing
faculty reporting efforts is one way in which LGUs dealt with budget cuts and compliance demands.
This could have put pressure on faculty to limit UIR as part of the overall pressure on their time,
especially research time. The other one, which is `more speculative', is the potential for morale
issues associated with this long period of budget pressures and time constraints. It seems likely
that these could either have dampened enthusiasm for UIR activities (exhaustion) or increased
incentives for faculty to pursue especially commercial links for more personal gain.



3       Data, Methods and Descriptive Statistics


        This paper is based on data collected in surveys of agricultural and life science faculty con-
ducted in 2005 and 2015. In each data collection effort we administered a survey to nearly 3,000
agricultural and life science faculty at all of the U.S. 1863 LGUs.5 Both surveys had a sample
frame that included all tenure-track faculty scientists in agricultural and life science departments
at these land-grant universities. We culled faculty names from university web directories to create
the cross-sectional sample frame and then randomly selected a sample of scientists who were sent
a web-based survey with follow-up paper-mail reminders as in Dillman (2011). In addition to
    5
   The Institutional Review Board at UW-Madison approved both of these surveys, with the latest approval being
#2015-0924


                                                      9
the random samples in both years, we also re-sampled respondents from the 2005 survey in 2015
in order to have longitudinal data on 244 faculty. The response rate in 2015 was 31% based on
respondents who answered at least one survey question, with a higher response rate in 2005 of
60%.

    Response rates in 2015 did vary somewhat by discipline, from a high of 42% among plant
scientists (the largest discipline represented) to only 28% among agricultural engineering scientists
(the smallest discipline). We accept the null hypothesis of no response rate bias (see Barham
et al. 2017) with respect to the following observed characteristics: field, gender, faculty size of
the agricultural college, total university research funding, or total full-time university student
enrollment. In Appendix A we report further sample restrictions. Our final sample for analysis,
from the random sample data collection, covers 881 scientists in 2005 and 598 in 2015 across all
52 LGUs. We also report some results from the longitudinal sample of scientists surveyed in both
years.

    Table 1 details the set of questions with respect to faculty University-Industry Relations (UIR)
activities in our data. Academic engagement activities span a similar range described in the afore-
mentioned studies in the UK. They cover collaborations, sponsored research by industry (and com-
modity organizations), presentations to industry or farmers, and research problem identification.
Likewise, academic commercialization activities span invention disclosures, patenting, licensing,
product development, and start-ups.

                                 We use these UIR related items in the data to construct categorical variables of academic
engagement and commercialization participation measures, as well as ones that identify when in-
dividuals do both. We identify individuals not fitting in any UIR category as Traditional Scholars.
The participation measure is `liberal' in the sense that participating in any of the academic en-
gagement or commercialization activities identifies an individual with that category. We use these
categorical variables to describe trends in UIR participation on the `extensive' margin.

                                 In addition to individual participation in university-industry relations, the subsequent analysis
also focuses on other faculty research activities. We mostly focus on published articles, training
of graduate students, and receipt of research funding. Those research activities are incorporated
into the comparisons of faculty across UIR categories in order to help identify the potential for


                                                                                 11
synergies or trade-offs between UIR and traditional scholarship outcomes. Similarly, we use data
on total research grant revenues and different sources of revenue, such as federal, state, industry,
commodity groups, foundations, and licensing revenues.

      Two other important sets of measures from the survey warrant description here. First, in both
2005 and 2015 surveys, respondents were asked about the reasons motivating them to pursue a
certain research topic in the last five years. They are generally oriented toward `intrinsic' motiva-
tions, such as `scientific curiosity' or `potential contribution to scientific theory', or extrinsic ones,
such as `potential marketability' or `potential to patent and license the discovery'. The full set of
14 questions are shared in Table 8. The items are in a 1-5 Likert-type scale with a score of 1 being
"not at all" and a score of 5 being "Extremely". Responses to these questions are examined using
factor analysis in order to uncover latent factors that might shape faculty research choice. That
approach is also more fully described in the Appendix, reporting on the actual factor loadings. We
use the loadings to identify the block of items that with internal consistency. We calculate indexes
for each measure of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Indexes are calculated as the response
average for the block of items within each factor as reported in Table 9.


3.1    Descriptive Statistics


      We start with three broad observations that start to frame U.S. Land-Grant Universities
(LGU) participation in university-indsutry-relations (UIR) activities. They can be gleaned from
Tables 2, 3, and 4. Table 2 provides a comparison for 2005 and 2015 of the prevalence of each
of the UIR activities. Table 3 provides a comparison over time of faculty participation in the
four UIR categories. In Table 4 we describe participation rates in academic engagement and
commercialization UIR activities by gender, rank, appointment type, and field.

    We find that U.S.-LGU faculty participation rates in UIR activities are high, with an average
of 78% of faculty participating in some type of UIR (Table 2). Consistent with other evidence
in the literature, academic engagement (AE) is far more prevalent than commercialization (AC),
with about 75% of LGU faculty pursuing AE as compared to about 20% in some type of AC.
Moreover, if we isolate on the AC only category in Table 3, we find that around 2-3% of faculty
are just doing AC in the two time periods. In other words, the vast majority of faculty engaged
in AC activities are also active in AE. The proportion of faculty that are not engaged in UIR, the


                                               13
traditional scholarship (TS) category, is greater than the total proportion active in AC. Thus, AC
participation is the least prevalent in the mix of faculty engagement types examined here.

    UIR participation declined somewhat between 2005 and 2015. Declines in commercialization
activities led the way, with a 6 percentage point decline from 25% of respondents in 2005 to
19% in 2015. When we look at the four exclusive measures, this change concentrates in faculty
moving from practicing both engagement and commercialization (AE/AC) to engamement (AE)
only. Academic engagement participation was essentially unchanged. The decline in academic
commercialization between 2005 and 2015 contradicts the expected increase based on university-
level commercialization promotion in previous decades. We conclude that the popular perception
following university rhetoric on expansion of UIR activities is not borne out by the behavior of
LGU faculty in terms of engaging with industry in commercialization activities.

    Across fields, participation varies between 60-90% of faculty engaging in UIR, as detailed in
Table 4. We performed statistical tests to identify the differences across categories. There is statis-
tically significant variation at a 95% level across gender, with men being on average 6 percentage
points more likely to engage in UIR than women. We find no statistically significant differences in
participation by appointment type and/or level. In terms of field of study differences, the highest
rates are in applied/production agricultural disciplines while the lowest UIR participation rates
are in the 60-70% range for the biological, ecological and social sciences. This outcome is also
consistent with findings from the UK mentioned above, where more basic research is associated
with relatively lower UIR activity.

AE = Academic Engagement; AC = Academic Commercialization. We define Traditional Scholarship (TS) as those that do not engage
in either AC or AE.




     While suggestive of different norms, the decline in commercialization captured in the cross-
section analyses might be a result of changes in the demographic composition of types of faculty.
To control for potential demographic composition changes, we next investigate the individuals for
which we have panel data to check for changes in individual faculty behavior over time. This smaller
panel dataset was gathered as part of the ongoing study to probe the persistence of individual
participation in each of the categories. Table 5 provides a transition matrix between 2005 and
2015 of UIR participation rates across the UIR categories.

       This tables reports results from the Panel data linking individuals between 2005 and 2015 waves.



    We offer four observations based on the transition patterns in Table 5. First, academic engage-
ment or mixed UIR categories show a higher rate of persistence over time that does commercializa-
tion only. There is a high exit rate out of academic commercialization reflected in the AE/AC and
AC rows, where only a little over half of faculty that were doing commercialization (AC) in 2000-05
stay engaged in AC activities in the 2010-15 time-period. By contrast, about 85-90% of faculty
who were engaged in academic engagement (AE) or both (AE/AC) activities in 2000-05 remain
engaged with AE activities in 2010-15. Second, the commercialization (AC) category is by far
the least likely to gain faculty across the two time periods, reflecting the low likelihood of faculty
activity in just commercialization. In fact, the decline in AC evident in the cross-sectional data
also shows up as a lack of persistence and a lack of new faculty entrants into this activity. Third,
a transition to AE/AC from any of the other categories is far more likely, suggesting the potential
joint nature of academic engagement with academic commercialization rather than the move to
commercialization as an independent activity. Fourth, 25% of traditional scholars transitioned to
AE activities over time, but at the same time a larger number of scholars transitioned from the
UIR categories into the TS category. Thus the traditional scholars category increases from 16% to
20% of the sample, showing its robustness to the purported increase in UIR emphasis at LGUs.

                                                     16
      Table 6 shows research funding for different UIR participation categories. It compares amounts
of funding from different sources as well as the shares associated with each funding source.6 Across
all of the UIR categories federal funding remains the primary source of research funds, with industry
and commodity organizations playing a substantial but subordinate role. At less than 2% overall,
licensing revenues from AC activities are a trivial source and they are 10 - 15 times smaller than
the funds earned by faculty doing AE from private industry and commodity organization sources.
Interestingly, faculty who earned patent royalties are only found within the AC faculty who also
engages in AE. It is also worth noting that for the median research lab revenue, those associated
with faculty engaged in AC and AE/AC have the highest research funding levels across both years
of data, although this pattern is less evident in the mean values. Both AE only and TS labs have,
at the median, lower levels of funding.

     Note that "Private Industry" and "Commodity Organization" funding are used to define AE and "Patent Roy-
alties" to define AC. Therefore, by definition, these amounts are zero for some UIR categories.

    For each category of UIR, Table 7 reports on scholarly outputs: articles published in the last
5 years and being the main advisor for Ph.D. and Masters' students. Consistent with many other
previous studies in the literature, academic outcomes are robust to faculty participation in UIR
activities. The most active faculty in UIR, the AE/AC group have the highest article productivity
(mean of 23 articles in 2010-15) and a similar number of Ph.D. students trained (mean of 2.5 in
2010-15) to the AC group (2.8). These compare to about 14 articles over 2010-15 for AE and TS
categories and 1.6 Ph.D. students for those two categories. The high outputs of the AE/AC group
are consistent with synergies between UIR and scholarly outputs that is found in econometric

studies elsewhere (e.g., Foltz, Kim, & Barham, 2003). Table 7 is also noteworthy for providing
continued evidence of rising productivity over time of U.S.-LGU faculty based on article counts
(Prager et al. 2014).7

     We turn next to Table 8 showing the values or stated preferences of U.S.-LGU faculty with
respect to their motivations for `research problem choice'. We first report for both 2005 and 2015
the average scores (1 low to 5 high) for a select set of questions related to `intrinsic motivations'
versus `extrinsic motivations' and compare them across UIR categories. Note first that in both
years, `enjoy the research' and `scientific curiosity' scores average well above 4 for all categories
of faculty. By contrast, the scores for `potential marketability' or `private firms commercialization
interest' are lower for all of the UIR categories relative to intrinsic motivations, by at least a full
point and often times two or three points.

     We make no effort to control for quality or potential increases in co-authorship either of which could lead to an
adjustment in the raw measure provided here. The evidence from Foltz, Kim, & Barham (2003) suggests quantity
and quality (as measured by citations) are highly correlated, which suggests the bias from unmeasured quality could
be small. We have no evidence on which way the bias from co-authorship patterns might go.

      We next use factor analysis to recover underlying factors explaining the variance in the mo-
tivations for research choices data. Two factors explain most of the variance in the data, which
we identify as Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation factors. We constructed indexes (simple average)
within the items identified as a factor. Some have consistent `high loadings' within each identified
factor, such as scientific curiosity or potential contribution to scientific theory, which we interpret
as intrinsic motivation. Meanwhile, likely interest by private firms in commercializing the discov-
ery and potential marketability of the final product "loads high" in what we interpret as extrinsic
motivation.

Note: Factors are calculated jointly for both waves. Comparing eigenvalues and its variances we confirm the existence of two factors.
Together, they explain 93% of the variance. We used Principal Factor with orthogonal quartimax rotation to estimate the factor
loadings. Measures on Intrinsic and Extrinsic motivations are calculated as the average of the items within each identified factor.




     We show the distribution of the indexes by UIR category in Figure 1. In 2005 and 2015, faculty
report higher mean intrinsic than extrinsic motivations when it comes to research problem choice.
The distribution of intrinsic motivations is skewed to the right, averaging 4 points. Meanwhile,
extrinsic motivation appears to be less important to faculty, averaging 2 points. Both measures
decreased between 2005 and 2015, with the larger decrease in extrinsic motivation moving the
distribution of that measure to be almost entirely distributed below "neutral". Meanwhile the
intrinsic index, while decreasing remained strongly distributed in the very to extremely important
zone.

                      In Figure 2 we report the distributions of the motivation indexes by UIR category. As would be
expected by their actions, traditional scholars are skewed far to the right on intrinsic motivations
and far to the left on commercial ones. Yet we see that both categories of academic commer-
cialization (AC and AE/AC) also have high levels of scientific motivation, with only academic
engagement as distinctly below the others. AE/AC appears to show both the highest average
levels of commercial motivation and the greatest diversity of motivations within the category, as
exemplified by a flatter distribution. The Academic Commercialization only group shows high lev-
els of intrinsic motivation as well as a bi-modal distribution of commercial motivation with some
at both high and low levels.8
         8
   Results for the exclusive Academic Commercialization category need to be interpreted with caution due to the
small number of cases in our sample.

4    Empirical Strategy and Results


    Descriptive statistics show remarkable differences in academic outputs across UIR categories
as well as in factors shaping research topic choice. In order to isolate these relationships, we use
regression techniques to estimate correlations between UIR categories and various university out-
puts. The models, which should be interpreted as correlational rather than causal, use Traditional
Scholars (TS) as our comparison category.

    In the first set of estimates, we explore individual and institutional determinants of UIR
engagement, including the relative role of faculty motivations, and field and university specific
effects, while controlling for faculty characteristics. We estimate Equation 1 using a linear prob-
ability model with standard errors clustered at the university level to account for university level
heterskedasticity. Our dependent variable U IRif u is a binary indicator variable for any UIR engage-
ment, relative to traditional scholarship (TS). We adopt a flexible functional form to capture the
                                                                          k=4
potential correlation between motivation and UIR participation,                   m , with m  {Int, Ext}.
                                                                                Qki
                                                                          k=1

The regressors, Qk F m are indicators for each quartile k of each motivation F m distribution. We
omit the first quartile: Q1 F m . The vector X measures individual characteristics and includes:
gender, university appointment (professor, assistant professor or full professor), and an indicator
for whether the scientist was awarded a Ph.D. from a land-grant institution. The variables µf and
u are field and university fixed effects, respectively.

                                k=1                  k=1


    To demonstrate the correlations between UIR participation and our variables of interest which
are all categorical we plot the effects in a series of figures. Figures 3 and 4 plot the set of estimated
                                      m
parameters for categorical variables, k , µf and u , which are respectively motivation categories,
university effects, and field effects.

    Figure 3 shows the parameter estimates for quartiles of the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
indexes on the probability that a faculty member engages in UIR activities. The figure shows


                                                       24
estimated parameters for both unconditional (no other controls) and conditional (all controls in
equation (1)) along with 95% confidence bands. The figure shows that as the intrinsic index
increases the probability of doing UIR activities marginally decreases, with intrinsic motivation
playing a small role differentiating UIR engagement. As for extrinsic motivation, there is a higher
probability of UIR engagement as this indexes increases. These correlations corroborate the de-
scriptive statistics that intrinsic motivation is high across the board whereas extrinsic motivation
plays an important role in differentiating UIR engagement. Overall, these determinants are robust
to the inclusion of a variety of controls.

    In figure 4 we show how the estimated parameters on university fixed effects, estimated from
equation (1) vary across university, with University of Wisconsin-Madison, which has the oldest
technology transfer office among US universities as the baseline. There are high university specific
effects, which indicate more UIR activity at that university, at some of the large LGU's such
as Illinois, UC-Davis, Purdue, Iowa State. But we also see some smaller LGU's such as Alaska,
Rutgers in the top tier. There are some surprising effects with UC-Berkeley and Cornell in the
bottom tier along with a number of smaller LGU's that have fewer resources and newer traditions
of UIR. Since we have controlled in these regressions for both individual and observable university
characteristics, the best interpretation for these results is a measure of the UIR "culture" at these
universities. Universities such as Cornell and UC-Berkeley may have stronger basic science cultures
with less focus on UIR, while the large mostly midwestern LGU's that are high on the list may
have stronger outreach and extension cultures which promotes more UIR.

    The second half of the figure shows the estimated parameters on the field of specialty level fixed
effects, with plant sciences, which is the largest category, as the baseline. The other production
agriculture sciences, namely animal sciences, agricultural engineering, and food and nutrition stud-
ies are not statistically distinguishable from plant sciences. This result, likely driven by academic
engagement in production agriculture fields, is expected. Ecology and basic biological sciences,
however, show lower levels of UIR engagement than do plant sciences, despite those fields poten-
tially having higher potential in commercialization. This may be due to the stronger basic science
orientation of these fields relative to applied production sciences. And as one would expect the


                                                 25
social sciences are at the lowest levels of all of the agriculture and life science college disciplines in
terms of UIR activities.

Note: For both panels, dependent variable is an indicator for whether individual engages in any UIR type (1) as
opposed to being a traditional scholar (0). (a) coefficients are for 52 university indicators, with UW-Madison as
omitted variable. (b) coefficients are for field indicators, with plant science as the omitted variable. We choose plant
science as the omitted variables for being the most popular field in our sample. Additional controls include: gender,
position as professor, a dummy for whether PhD was in a land grant institution. Standard errors are clustered at
the university level.
                                                                              27
    In a second set of regression estimates, we isolate how each type of UIR activity correlates with
academic productivity. The uniqueness of our dataset allows us to control for an often unobserved
dimension of individual heterogeneity: faculty motivations, both intrinsic and extrinsic, allowing
for direct effects of these characteristics besides its effects through UIR engagement. We also
control for individual, field and institutional characteristics.

    We estimate different versions of Equation 2, in which Yif u varies in each regression covering:
number of journal articles, Ph.D. graduates and total funding for scientist i in field f at university
u. AC, AE/AC and AE are our mutually exclusive measures of UIR and traditional scholars
is the omitted baseline category. The values FiI and FiE are the index scores for intrinsic and
extrinsic motivation, respectively. The vector X measures individual characteristics and includes:
gender, university appointment (professor, assistant professor or full professor), and an indicator
for whether the scientist was awarded a Ph.D. from a land-grant institution. The variables µf and
u are field and university fixed effects, respectively. Equation 2 is as follows:



         Yif u =  + 1 AC + 2 AE/AC + 3 AE + S FiS + C FiC + Xi + µf + u +                if u     (2)


    The standard errors are clustered at the university level to control for university level het-
eroskedasticity.

    Table 10 shows the results of estimating equation (1) with journal articles and Ph.D. students
produced over the last five years as the dependent variable. The columns provide increasing levels
of control variables, with a first column the baseline, the second adds in our motivational measures,
the third individual controls, and the fourth field and university fixed effects. Across all models
one sees two dominant statistically significant and large effects, which are (i) that compared to
traditional scholars, AE/AC and AC only faculty produce more journal articles and more Ph.D.
students and (ii) that levels of "intrinsic motivations" are directly correlated with both journal
articles and PhD students whereas extrinsic (commercial) motivations do not play a direct role
besides those embedded in how they determine UIR participation. Overall the picture that emerges
from Table 10 is that UIR faculty, especially those with commercial ties are more productive than


                                                   28
traditional scholars. In addition, those in the AE-only category appear to produce scholarship and
students at about the level of traditional scholars.

     Table 11 shows the results of estimating equation (1) with total funding and public funding
as the dependent variable. It is worth noting that our categories of UIR are partially created
with funding data, so we should expect a positive relationship with total funding, though not
with public funding. Here we see very strong and statistically significant correlations of any UIR
activity with both total funding and federal funding. While the former is somewhat expected,
the latter suggests that rather than be a distraction from traditional scholarship directions, faculty
engagement in UIR activities is synergistic in terms of bringing in federal funding which is generally
associated with traditional scholarship. Again, we see strong correlations of intrinsic motivations

not.

5      Discussion


       Our empirical findings present a number of new findings for the study of UIR activities at U.S.
universities on a number of important fronts. First, faculty participation rates in UIR activity are
quite high; generally, around 70-80% of U.S. LGU agricultural and life scientists engage in AE, AC,
or both. Second, faculty participation in UIR is predominantly in the area of academic engagement
(AE), the more traditional type of research collaboration involving sponsored research, industry
collaboration (including farmers and their commodity organizations), and other types of research
exchanges (presentations and shared problem identification). In fact, only about 2-3% of faculty

                                                           30
in either the 2005 or 2015 survey participated in just AC activities. Third, as a source of research
funding for agricultural and life science faculty at U.S. LGUs, AE industry revenues completely
dominate AC license revenues, but the largest individual faculty funding levels come from those
who do both AE and AC. Overall, patent license revenues provide about 1% of lab revenues, as
compared to close to a 20% share for industry and commodity group funds. This funding outcome
appears to be in `steady-state' now thirty-five years after the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act and
more than twenty-five years after the takeoff of US public university patenting activity, as the ratio
of AE to AC funding was the same in 2015 as it was in 2005.

    This study also finds descriptive evidence that UIR activities are highly correlated and likely
synergistic with traditional academic scholarship activities. This outcome is consistent with pre-
vious studies that find the more productive researchers are also often the ones most highly `in
demand' or active in UIR activities. While this study does not undertake the type of longitudinal
dynamic statistical analysis of Sengupta and Ray (2017) who find positive feedbacks between AE
and research outcomes at the university level, prima facie evidence presented in our work at the
individual faculty level is consistent with that outcome. In particular our finding that the AE/AC
faculty persist across time periods and that this group has more research revenues and higher
publication and student counts, demonstrates this individual positive feedback loop.

    In examining factors shaping the participation of U.S.-LGU faculty with UIR activities, we find
that institutional factors, specifically `fields' or `disciplines' are a significant conditioning factor,
with more applied science fields like plant and animal sciences having higher UIR rates than more
basic ones like biological and ecological ones. Most of the differences in UIR activity by fields
are driven by variations in AE rather than AC as shown in the UIR activity regressions. This
finding is consistent both with the lower overall participation in AC and the fact that most of the
faculty active in AC are also active in AE. The reverse is not true. Most faculty engaged in AE
are not active in AC. In this regard, it appears that AC may be somewhat opportunistic, and may
depend on the types of inventions or discoveries being made by scientists. Put simply, ongoing
collaboration with industry or sponsored research arrangements may, from time to time, give rise
to the pursuit of invention disclosures and patents, and so entry and exit into AC activities appears


                                                   31
to occur regularly as shown in the transition matrix in Table 5 above.

    The most substantive individual factors shaping the intensity of participation in UIR appear
to be faculty `attitudes' with respect to research problem choice. While we do not attempt here
to identify a causal relationship between attitudes and UIR activity involvement, agricultural and
life science faculty at U.S.-LGUs report that their research problem choices are strongly driven
by intrinsic factors, such as curiosity or the potential to contribute to scientific theory relative to
intrinsic motives. This is true across all of the UIR categories used here, though what distinguishes
the AE, AC, and AE/AC from TS is a somewhat stronger level of extrinsic motive. This basic
preference for science has been a consistent outcome across decades of surveys of U.S.-LGU faculty
and is consistent also with the continued importance of federal, competitive grants as a primary
source of research funding.

    Finally, university fixed-effect measures in our UIR regressions reveal statistically significant
differences in university "cultures" with respect to UIR. These differences appear to relate to the
timing of initial commercialization activity and potentially to other historical and locational factors
that could be important for how they shape faculty behavior over time. This is an area of ongoing
interest and potentially productive future inquiry.



6   Conclusion


    This article has examined the university-industry relations activities of agricultural and life
science faculty at the premier U.S. Land Grant Universities, using survey data gathered from
large, random and longitudinal samples in 2005 and 2015. The analysis of this unique set of data
fills an empirical gap identified in the literature by carefully exploring the relative importance of
academic engagement and academic commercialization. Because U.S. LGUs are `ground-zero' of
U.S. public research university University-Industry-Relations activities, the empirical context is of
broader significance to the U.S. and beyond. We have found descriptive and correlational evidence
that traditional academic scholarship has not systematically been distorted or constrained in the
ways that some originally feared, and that UIR while important to faculty, universities, and society


                                                  32
is not a fundamental threat to the advancement of science.

    At U.S. Land Grant Universities, the longstanding tradition of academic engagement, involving
sponsored research and direct collaboration with scientists and managers in industry and agricul-
ture, dominate the new academic commercialization relationships in prevalence and importance for
faculty research funding. Moreover, these two types of UIR appear to be complements, with AC
being an occasional outgrowth of AE in some fields and for some faculty, which likely depends on
the continuity of AE relationships to emerge. Seen in this way, the UIR activities of agricultural
and life scientists at LGUs is more of a natural outgrowth of the Land-Grant system's traditional
model of working with industry to foster improved outcomes in their own states and the nation.
Fears of UIR subverting the LGU mission appear to be misplaced. Rather we find that UIR com-
plements the traditional scholarship of top scholars in agricultural and life science fields in part by
helping them access more funding and connections with industries in their field.

    Future research with these data will attempt to pursue causal identification of UIR participa-
tion and intensity outcomes using historical information as instruments as well as more exploitation
of the panel data. Expanding the focus on university-level factors seems worth special attention
in this effort. In addition, given the significant growth in the proportion of women and foreign
faculty in the U.S. LGUs over time, there are open important questions as to whether this has
changed the dynamics of UIR participation.

scale ranging from 0 to 5. We assigned a neutral value, "3", if the individual answered the block
at least partially. When all items are missing, variables remain missing; (ii) UIR related measures:
assigned zero to missing when the person answered part of the block. When all are missing,
variables remain missing; (iii) Extension and Outreach: as long as the block is not all missing,
missing values are replaces as zero; (iv) PhD Students: if block is not all missing, value is set to
zero; For each block, we calculated the total number of imputed values and results are robust to
adding these variables in the regression as a control. Results upon request.
