                                        ABSTRACT

We examine the impact of the global recession triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic on women's
versus men's employment. Whereas recent recessions in advanced economies usually had a
disproportionate impact on men's employment, giving rise to the moniker "mancessions," we
show that the pandemic recession of 2020 was a "shecession" in most countries with larger
employment declines among women. We examine the causes behind this pattern using micro data
from several national labor force surveys, and show that both the composition of women's
employment across industries and occupations as well as increased childcare needs during
closures of schools and daycare centers made important contributions. While many countries
exhibit similar patterns, we also emphasize how policy choices such as furloughing policies and
the extent of school closures shape the pandemic's impact on the labor market. Another notable
finding is the central role of telecommuting: gender gaps in the employment impact of the
pandemic arise almost entirely among workers who are unable to work from home. Nevertheless,
among telecommuters a different kind of gender gap arises: women working from home during
the pandemic spent more work time also doing childcare and experienced greater productivity
reductions than men. We discuss what our findings imply for gender equality in a post-pandemic
labor market that will likely continue to be characterized by pervasive telecommuting.

1       Introduction

The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in the sharpest global economic downturn since
the Great Depression. Figure 1 displays deviations from long term trends in GDP and
aggregate hours worked in the United States, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain,
and the United Kingdom from 2006 until the second quarter of 2020.1 In each of these
countries, the drop in output and labor supply during the pandemic recession is much
larger than during any previous downturn in this period, at least twice as large even
compared to the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009. Understanding the nature and conse-
quences of this massive economic shock is a central task for economic research.

           (a) GDP, cyclical component                        (b) Hours Worked, cyclical component
Notes: See Appendix for data sources. Hours index is the index (=100 in 2006) of total hours of people (20-64) in
the economy. Seasonally adjusted quarterly real GDP and hours index (2006 Q1-2020 Q2) are HP filtered with
smoothing parameter 1600 and cyclical components are reported.


At the onset of the crisis, Alon et al. (2020a) predicted that beyond its cause and mag-
nitude, a key difference between the pandemic recession and others that preceded it
would lie in its impact on women's employment. Recent pre-pandemic recessions have
usually been "mancessions" in which men lost more jobs than women. The prediction
by Alon et al. that the pandemic recession would be a "shecession" with larger employ-
ment losses for women was based on two observations. First, while regular recessions
heavily affect sectors such as construction and manufacturing in which many men work,
it became quickly apparent that the pandemic recession would have its biggest impact
    1
   The figure depicts the cyclical components of both GDP and hours worked. Appendix Figure A2
shows the raw data.


                                                       1
on sectors such as hospitality and tourism with high female employment shares. Second,
the pandemic also led to school and daycare closures that massively increased parents'
childcare needs, and given that mothers provide a much larger share of childcare than
fathers do, this would constrain women's ability to work more than men's.

With the benefit of hindsight, in this paper we provide a comprehensive empirical as-
sessment of the role of women's employment in the pandemic recession of 2020­2021.
We argue that the evidence largely confirms the expectation of a larger impact on women
in general and on working mothers in particular. As an illustration for the case of the
United States, Figure 2 reports changes in the employment gap (the difference between
the employment rate of women and men) during the pandemic recession of 2020­2021
compared to the Great Recession of 2007­2009.2 During the Great Recession, women's
employment increased compared to men, with gains gradually building as the reces-
sion progressed. This is the typical pattern of a mancession that puts more men than
women out of employment. In the pandemic recession, in contrast, women's employ-
ment declined relative to that of men. For women without children, this decline was
mild, but among women with children the drop in employment exceeded 5 percentage
points two months into the recession (compared to men with children). Employment
losses declined somewhat during the summer of 2020, but expanded again in the fall.

Expanding on this evidence, we document the impact of the pandemic recession on
women's versus men's employment across advanced economies; we use micro data to
assess the role of childcare needs, industry and occupation effects, and other factors
in generating gender differences; and we assess how the gendered impact of the crisis
matters for aggregate outcomes during the recession and for the evolution of gender
inequality in the labor market beyond. We find that the pandemic recession had an
unusually large impact on working women across a large set of countries, but also that
there is wide heterogeneity in the magnitude of the impact and the role of different chan-
nels underlying these impacts. The heterogeneity that we observe is informative for the
role that policies and institutions play in shaping the economic impact of the recession.
We also point to evidence that the pandemic recession will have long lasting effects on
the labor market. In particular, the recession is likely to result in a substantial rise in
employment flexibility in the post-pandemic "new normal," which has the potential to
greatly benefit many working women.

To provide a baseline to compare the pandemic recession to, the first step in our anal-

Figure 2: Change in Gender Gap in Employment in the United States during the Great
Recession and the Pandemic Recession




Notes: The y-axis reports cumulative log point changes in the employment gender gap from the start of each reces-
sion (difference between women's and men's employment, negative numbers denote a decline in women's relative
employment). Sample includes all civilians ages 25 to 55 who are either employed, unemployed, or not in the labor
force. Employment series are seasonally adjusted by group from January 2000 to October 2020. Great Recession
corresponds to November 2007 to June 2009. The pandemic recession corresponds to February 2020 to October
2020. Workers "with kids" are those who have at least one own minor child (ages 0 to 17) residing in the same
household.


ysis is to use aggregate data for 28 advanced economies to characterize the impact of
regular, pre-pandemic business cycles on women's versus men's employment. Similar
to what Doepke and Tertilt (2016) established for the United States, we find that with
few exceptions regular recessions are mancessions in these countries, i.e., during a typ-
ical business cycle downturn, male labor supply falls by much more than female labor
supply. We also show that differences in the cyclical volatility between industries with
high female versus male employment shares play an important role in accounting for
this pattern. Turning to the pandemic recession, we find that in most of these countries,
the current recession is a shecession, i.e., declines in employment and hours worked are
larger among women. Moreover, in the few countries where the pandemic had a larger

                                                       3
impact on men, the relative impact on women's labor market is usually more severe than
what would be expected based on earlier recession. Thus, a disproportionate impact on
working women is a common feature of the pandemic recession that is shared among a
large set of countries.

To learn more about the causes and consequences of this shecession, we turn to micro
survey data from the six countries represented in Figure 1: the United States, Canada,
Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. These countries represent a
wide range of experiences in terms of the impact of the pandemic recession on the labor
market. In the United States, Canada, and Germany there is a substantial gender gap
in the response of hours worked. In the United States there is also a large gender gap
in terms of employment changes, but not so in Germany, a first indication that policy
responses (such as more generous employment protection and furlough in Germany)
play an important role during the crisis. In the Netherlands, Spain, and the United
Kingdom, gender gaps in changes in both employment and hours worked are generally
small.

Information on individual characteristics in the micro data allow us to assess the role of
childcare needs, industry and occupation, and other factors in generating gender differ-
ences during the pandemic recession. Regarding childcare, we find that the impact on
the gender gap is largest among parents with school-age children, pointing to the role
of school closures. As Figure 2 shows, in the United States the impact of the childcare
channel is large. We find large gender gaps in labor supply response among parents
of school-age children, even in countries where the overall gender gap in the impact of
the pandemic is small, such as Spain. Beyond childcare, industry and occupation effects
account for another sizeable part of the gender gap in the impact of the crisis. Neverthe-
less, childcare, industry, and occupation are not the only channels at work: even when
controlling for industry and occupation and considering only workers without children,
we still find large gender gaps in several countries. For the United States, a decomposi-
tion analysis shows that the childcare and industry/occupation channels each account
for a little less than 20 percent of the gender gap in terms of hours worked, with the
remainder due to other factors.

We also analyze other dimensions of heterogeneity. A factor that matters a lot in the
United States, Canada, and Spain is single parenthood: both hours and employment
decline by more for single compared to married mothers. Much of the single-married
divide disappears when controlling for industry and occupation, implying that the kind

                                            4
of jobs that single mothers hold matter. We do not find significant differences between
married and single mothers in the other countries, although this result is inconclusive
due to relatively few observations of single mothers in the Netherlands and Germany.

With regard to education, in the United States and Canada we observe larger gender
gaps in the labor supply response of less educated workers. Interestingly, the opposite
finding arises in Spain and the United Kingdom (countries with a small overall gender
gap in the impact of the pandemic) where we find a substantial gender gap in hours
changes among parents of school age children with college education, but not among
less educated parents.

In the United States, it is well documented that the Black and Hispanic population was
particularly strongly affected by the labor market consequences of the pandemic (e.g.,
Hershbein and Holzer 2021). However, we generally do not find large or statistically
significant differences in the gender gap in the labor supply response between different
races and ethnicities or between workers with and without a migration background.
The two exceptions are Germany, where the gender gap in employment losses is larger
among those with a migration background, and Canada, where we observe a similar
pattern in both employment and hours.

The disproportionate impact of the pandemic recession on women's employment not
only matters for the distribution of the welfare cost of the pandemic recession, but also
has wider economic repercussions. Based on the analysis of Alon et al. (2020b), we
argue that qualitative differences between shecessions and mancessions arise from the
different dynamic behavior of women's and men's labor supply. Women's labor sup-
ply is generally more elastic than that of men, suggesting that in a shecession, lowered
earning prospects after an unemployment spell are more likely to result in a persistent
reduction in labor supply. A shecession also reduces households' ability to self-insure
against income shocks, resulting in a stronger transmission from income shocks into
consumption demand.

The legacy of the pandemic recession is likely to include changes in the labor market
that will long outlast the recession itself. One feature of the post-pandemic new nor-
mal that is already becoming apparent now is that working from home, near universal
among office workers during the pandemic, will have a permanent place in the future
workplace (Barrero, Bloom, and Davis 2021). Alon et al. (2020b) argue that increased
access to telecommuting and other forms of work flexibility has the potential to drasti-
cally reduce gender inequality in the labor market. The basis for this argument is that

                                           5
much of today's gender gap arises from the "motherhood penalty" (i.e., women's earn-
ings start to lag behind those of men after having children). Work flexibility in general
and telecommuting in particular are associated with a more equal division of childcare
duties among mothers and fathers, thereby lowering the conflict for mothers between
having a family and a career. Hence, if the future workplace indeed is more flexible, the
motherhood penalty should shrink and so should overall gender inequality in the labor
market.

Our empirical results reaffirm the notion that job flexibility is a particular benefit to
working mothers. For the countries where we have information on telecommuting,
we find that the gender gap in labor supply is concentrated among those that cannot
telecommute. Among non-telecommuters the gender gap is especially large among par-
ents, whereas among those who can work from home gender gaps are small regardless
of whether children are present. While several recent papers (e.g., Adams-Prassl et al.
2020b) have pointed out that the ability to telecommute protects workers from job loss
in the current pandemic, our findings show that it is mothers who reap the largest gains
from being able to work from home.

These findings suggest that the pandemic legacy of an expanded ability to telecommute
will play an important role in advancing gender inequality. Yet, there is a caveat. For the
motherhood penalty to be reduced in the new normal, both mothers and fathers work-
ing from home would have to get their work done. In contrast, evidence from the pan-
demic suggests that combining working from home with caring for children imposes a
bigger drag on mothers' compared to fathers' productivity. In the Netherlands, we find
that among parents working from home during the crisis, mothers used a larger frac-
tion of the work time to provide childcare at the same time, particularly so if they had
school-age children. Other studies document that among academic researchers (where
productivity can be measured using publications and new working papers) produc-
tivity declined more among women than among men during the pandemic, with the
largest productivity declines among mothers of young children (Amano-Patiño et al.
2020; Ribarovska et al. 2021; Barber et al. 2021). Hence, increased work flexibility after
the pandemic opens up the potential for reduced gender inequality, but the full potential
for change is unlikely to be realized without shifts in additional factors, such as social
norms, that also determine the division of labor between mothers and fathers.

Our work contributes to the literature on the role of women's employment over the
business cycle. Even though by now women account for the majority of the US work-

                                            6
force, for a long time most business cycle models have been unisex models that do not
allow for gender differences. More recent studies argue that the role of women over
the business cycle has substantially changed over time due to the rise in female labor
force participation (Albanesi 2020; Fukui, Nakamura, and Steinsson 2019). The changed
nature of business cycles also matters for policy. Bardóczy (2020) argues that the details
of decision-making in the family are an important determinant of the transmission of
macroeconomic shocks. Ellieroth (2019) analyzes the quantitative importance of fam-
ily insurance over the business cycle using a joint-search model. Other contributions to
the literature on women's employment and household decision-making within macroe-
conomics include Greenwood, Seshadri, and Yorukoglu (2005), Ortigueira and Siassi
(2013), Doepke and Tertilt (2016), Mankart and Oikonomou (2017), Borella, De Nardi,
and Yang (2018), Mennuni (2019), Olsson (2019), and Wang (2019).3 In addition, Al-
banesi and S ¸ ahin (2018) and Coskun and Dalgic (2020) note the impact that the gender
breakdown of employment in various industries has on the contrasting cyclicality of
male and female employment. This is an important factor in the pandemic recession,
since the industries hit the most by the pandemic are not those most affected by regu-
lar recessions. Finally, our work is part of the emerging literature on the impact of the
Covid-19 pandemic on gender inequality in the labor market, including contributions
such as Alon et al. (2020a, 2020b) and Adams-Prassl et al. (2020b). Our contribution is
related in particular to Albanesi and Kim (2021), who take a similar empirical approach
but focus entirely on the United States, and the studies by Dang and Nguyen (2020),
Galasso and Foucault (2020), and Leyva and Urrutia (2020), who also provide evidence
across countries but without delving into detailed micro data.

In the next section, we examine the impact the pandemic recession and earlier economic
downturns on women's and men's employment in 28 countries using aggregate data. In
Section 3 we use micro data from national employment surveys to examine the sources
of the gendered impact of the pandemic recession. In Section 4 we provide further re-
sults for the United States, where the gender gap in the impact of the pandemic of the
recession is particularly large. In Section 5 we examine heterogeneity along the dimen-
sions of education, race, single parenthood, and the ability to telecommute. Section 6
analyzes the impact of the pandemic on women's and men's productivity at work. In
Section 7 we discuss the general lessons that can be learned from our analysis, and Sec-
tion 8 concludes.

2     Aggregate Evidence across Countries
We start by providing an overview of the impact of earlier recessions and the pandemic
recession on women's and men's employment across countries using aggregate data.
We use data for 26 European countries from the European Labor Force Survey (EU-LFS),
US data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), and Canadian data from Canadian
Labor Force Survey (CLFS).

2.1   Regular Recessions

Doepke and Tertilt (2016) document that in the United States, women's labor supply
is substantially less cyclical than that of men. In recessions, the labor supply of single
men usually declines the most, whereas the drop in labor supply is smallest for married
women. The same patterns can be observed in most countries in our data set. To charac-
terize how labor supply varies over the cycle, we first compute the cyclical component
of GDP as the difference between GDP and a Hodrick-Prescott trend. We then focus on
the correlation between the cyclical component of GDP with the the ratio of women's
to men's labor supply. Figure 3 shows that in most countries in our data set male labor
supply is more cyclical than female labor supply. This is true both for the extensive and
the intensive margin: panel (a) shows a negative correlation between the cyclical com-
ponents of relative female/male employment and GDP while panel (b) shows a negative
correlation between the cyclical components of relative hours and GDP. There are a few
exceptions (Romania, Greece and Belgium for the correlation with relative employment,
and Romania and Czechia for the correlation with relative hours), but in all these cases
the correlations are small.

The literature points out two primary explanations for the countercyclicality of women's
relative labor supply: the distribution of women's employment by industry and occu-
pation (Albanesi and S  ¸ ahin 2018, Coskun and Dalgic 2020) and within-family insurance,
i.e., countercyclical adjustments of women's labor supply in response to job loss or (risk
thereof) of their husbands (Doepke and Tertilt 2016). These factors give rise to substan-
tial variation in the cyclical behavior of women's labor supply across countries, depend-
ing on factors such as a local industry composition of employment, marriage rates, and
married women's labor force participation. Nevertheless, as Figure 3 shows in almost
all cases the end result is a lower cyclicality of women's compared to men's labor supply.

Beyond correlations of relative labor supply and the cyclical component of GDP, we can
analyze cyclical variation in women's and men's labor supply in more detail using the

methodology of Doepke and Tertilt (2016). Their analysis distinguishes the total volatil-
ity of labor supply (the percentage standard deviation of the Hodrick-Prescott residual)
from its cyclical volatility, which is the percentage standard deviation of the predicted
value of the Hodrick-Prescott residual of labor supply on the Hodrick-Prescott residual
of GDP per capita. The concept of cyclical volatility captures the part of total volatility
that is related to the economic cycle, as opposed to other factors such as variation in
cohort sizes.

Table 1 shows how the total and cyclical volatility of labor supply for different groups
compares between the United States and five other countries: Canada, Germany, the
Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. In five of the six countries, volatility is
smaller for women than for men. Only the Netherlands stand out with a higher volatility
for women than men.4 When focusing on cyclical volatility, in all countries (including
the Netherlands) women's hours worked vary less over the business cycle than men's.
The gender gap is sizeable, ranging from a modest difference in the Netherlands to a

    The higher volatility for women in the Netherlands is related to a large decline in hours worked of
married women in 2005, see Figure 1b. There was a break in the time series in 2005 which we attempted
to correct but which may still have an impact on measured volatility.

cyclical volatility that is almost twice as high for men relative to women in the United
Kingdom.

With the exception of the Netherlands, the cyclical volatility of labor supply is lower
for married women than for single women. Among singles, the cyclical volatility of
single women is lower than that of single men in all countries. Thus, women's labor
supply in general, and married women's in particular, tends to dampen fluctuations in
aggregate labor supply over the business cycle. The overall impact of women on the
behavior of aggregate labor supply not only depends on the volatility of women's labor
supply, but also on their share in aggregate labor supply. Women's share of total hours
varies from 35 percent in the Netherlands, where married women usually work part-
time, to 43 percent in the United States. Women's contribution to the overall volatility
of aggregate labor supply is always lower than the hours share and varies between 26
percent in the United Kingdom and 32 percent in Spain. Hence, in all countries women
account for less than a third of the volatility of aggregate labor supply. The volatility
share of married women differs widely across countries, ranging from only 5 percent in
the United Kingdom to almost 20 percent in the Netherlands.

Figure A1 in the Appendix displays the cyclical component of hours worked over time
for each country. An interesting observation that has not been explored yet in the litera-
ture is that the male cycle seems to lead the female cycle, especially for singles.

2.2   The Pandemic Recession

The evidence shown so far establishes that in pre-2020 economic fluctuations, women's
labor supply was less cyclical than men's across a wide range of countries. Let us now
consider what happened during the pandemic recession of 2020. Figure 4 shows how
the labor supply of women versus men changed in each country. Unlike in a regular re-
cession, women's labor supply fell relative to men's in 18 of 28 countries when measured
by employment, and in 19 of 28 countries when measured by hours worked. Quantita-
tively, we observe larger changes in terms of hours worked, with a drop of more than 10
percent in women's relative hours in Portugal.

Rather than looking at the absolute change in the ratio of women's to men's labor supply,
we can also ask how observed changes compare to what would be expected based on
the pre-pandemic relationship of women's and men's labor supply to the business cycle.
Accordingly, Figure 5 plots the actual change in labor supply in each country against the

predicted change based on pre-pandemic data. Here we see that most countries are be-
low the 45-degree line, implying that women's relative labor supply either declined or
increased by less than what would have been expected based on earlier recessions (the
few exceptions are all close to the 45-degree line). The countries that display a decline in
men's relative employment even during the Covid-19 recessions (most notably Portu-
gal, Austria, and the United Kingdom) are countries that have particularly pronounced
mancessions in regular times.

2.3   Pattern Across Industries

Why is the pandemic recession so different from usual recessions in its impact on women's
versus men's employment, and what explains the substantial variation in the impact
across countries? Starting with Alon et al. (2020a), the literature has focused on two
explanations for the gendered impact of a pandemic recession. The first explanation is
about the impact of the recession on different industries and occupations; because the
impact is related to lockdowns and social distancing measures, the parts of the economy
most affected by the current downturn are not the ones that decline the most in regular
recessions. Second, widespread school and daycare closures affect the ability of parents,
and often mothers, to work.

We can use our cross-country data set to provide a first assessment of the first explana-

Notes: Observed changes are the ones reported in Figure 4. Predicted changes are calculated by multiplying the esti-
mated coefficient from a regression of the cyclical component of relative employment/hours on the cyclical component
of GDP (for the years 1998­2019) and the observed GDP change between 2019-Q4 and 2020-Q2.


tion, namely the role of the employment composition by industry. To do this, we divide
industries into three groups: those with high male employment shares, those with high
female employment shares, and "neutral" industries in the intermediate range. The in-
dustry classification is the same for all countries (see Appendix B.2 for details). We can
now check how male, female, and neutral industries are affected by regular recessions
and the pandemic recession in each country.

The left panel of Figure 6 shows that, as expected, in pre-2020 data male industries dis-
play more cyclical volatility in employment than female industries. At the same time,
the figure also shows large cross-countries variation; for example, in the US the down-
ward sloping pattern is particularly pronounced, while in Slovenia female industries
are more volatile than male ones and in Germany there is little difference in the cyclical
volatility between male and female industries.

The right panel shows how employment in the same set of industries in each country
was affected by the pandemic recession in 2020. In a regular recession we would ex-
pect to observe an increasing slope moving from male to female industries, i.e., larger
job losses during the recession in male industries. The actual pattern is the opposite:
on average, female industries suffered larger employment losses than male industries.
In Spain, for example, the employment decline was more than twice as large in female
industries than male ones. Once again there is sizeable variation across countries. For

Notes: Each dot depicts a group of industries (female, male, or neutral) in a country. See Appendix for data

quarterly frequency, and is defined as the log deviation of the predicted value of a regression of the HP-residual of
industry employment on the HP-residual of real GDP. The female share for each industry is the average of 2019.


example, in the United Kingdom example employment declines were slightly smaller
in female industries. These differences in industry composition and the impact of the
pandemic recession on industries with relatively more female or male workers can ac-
count for some of the variation evident in Figure 4. For example, women's employment
was much strongly affected in Spain compared to the United Kingdom, and according
to Figure 6b differences in the impact of the crisis across sectors (i.e., the large impact on
and the large size of the tourism sector in Spain) can account for some of that.

Another way to see how starkly different the pandemic recession is from previous reces-
sions is to compare it specifically to the Great Recession. In Figure 7 we do this for the
United States. The left panel shows that the most cyclical sectors, especially construc-
tion and manufacturing, also experienced the largest employment declines in the Great
Recession. As the right panel shows, in the pandemic recession the pattern is completely
different: the largest employment declines were experienced by the leisure sector, which
is usually not particularly cyclical. It also happens to be a sector dominated by female
employees.

Notes: Data from Bureau of Labor Statistics, seasonally adjusted quarterly industry employment numbers 1998-
2020. Cyclical volatility has been calculated for the period 1998­2019, and is defined as the log deviation of the
predicted value of a regression of the HP-residual of industry employment on the HP-residual of real GDP. Em-
ployment change in the Great Recession is the log change in industry employment from peak to through by NBER
recession dates, and for the Covid recession the employment change corresponds to the period 2019Q4­2020Q2.


2.4   The Childcare Channel in Cross-Country Data

In addition to industry effects, increased childcare needs due to school and daycare
closures are the other leading explanation for the impact of the recession on working
women. The impact of this channel varies across countries, depending on factors such
as mother's labor force participation and the length and severity of school and daycare
closures. For example, in Sweden school closures were much more limited than in most
other countries, and Sweden is also one of the few countries were women's relative
hours increased in the pandemic recession (see Figure 4b).

Childcare (or the lack thereof) likely matters not just for the gender gap in labor supply,
but also for the overall employment impact of the pandemic. School closures affect all
working parents, so that the extent of school closures should have an impact on the
overall depth of the recession. In addition, the more hours women work in normal
times, the more likely it is that reductions in work hours are necessary to cope with the
increased childcare needs during the pandemic.

To explore the overall impact of these channels on the labor market during the pandemic
recession, in Tables 2 to 5 we present cross-country regression results that show how
various country-level characteristics are correlated with the aggregate changes in the
labor market and with relative changes for women compared to men. With regard to
aggregate employment, in column (1) of Table 2 we regress the overall change in labor
supply during the crisis (the hours index) in each country on an index that measures
the severity of school closures. The regression shows that indeed, countries with more
severe school closures experienced a greater drop in labor supply; the school closure
index alone accounts for about 25 percent of the variation in hours changes. However,
on its own the school closures index is not associated with larger employment changes
or with differential impacts on women versus men (column (1) in Tables 3­5).5

In interpreting these results, it should be kept in mind that they represent correlations
in cross-country data that are not necessarily causal and that are subject to the usual
limitations of cross-country regressions. For example, differences in the severity of the
pandemic across countries would be expected to generate some variation in the sever-
ity of school closures and also have a direct impact on employment (e.g. through the
length of lockdowns). Hence, the results described in Tables 2­5 should be interpreted
as correlations that help summarize the data and can provide a first pass at assessing
the importance of different channels, without being conclusive on their own.

    The severity of school closures may also be endogenous to the labor market structure. For example,
in countries where many employees have children, political pressure may have kept more schools open.
Indeed, Figure A3 in the Appendix shows that in countries where women work more and/or a greater
share of labor force is in need of childcare, schools closures were less severe.

The next variable we explore is the pre-pandemic level of women's labor supply. In a
country were most mothers work full time, increased childcare needs during the pan-
demic may have a larger impact compared to a country were many mothers are either
out of the labor force or working part time. Our results indicate that, when also con-
trolling for the school closures index, countries where women's labor supply is higher
experienced somewhat smaller aggregate declines in hours (column (2) of Table 2), but
larger relative employment declines for women compared to men (column (2) of Table
5).

Next, we consider the role of industry composition and job characteristics. In the pan-
demic recession, the hospitality sector (including restaurants) has seen the largest em-
ployment decline across countries (see the right panel of Figure 7 for the United States).6
The size of the hospitality sector also varies widely across countries (in our sample, from
5.6 percent of total employment in Poland to 16 percent in Spain). Column (3) of Tables
2 and 3 shows that a larger hospitality sector is indeed associated with a substantially
larger overall decline in hours and employment in a country. However, there is no dis-
cernible impact on the relative changes for women versus men (column (3) of Tables 4
and 5).

In terms of job characteristics, arguably the most important one during the pandemic
is whether the job can be done from home during shutdowns. Indeed, we find that
countries with a larger share of telecommutable jobs experience a smaller decline in
labor supply during the pandemic (column (4) of Table 2) and a smaller impact on the
    6
    In these regressions we use a broad definition of hospitality that includes hospitality, leisure, and
other services.

                                                                                        18
labor supply of women compared to men (column (4) of Table 4). When we include both
measures together with the school closures index, both continue to have a substantial
impact on the total hour change (column (5) in Table 2), whereas the effect of school
closures turns insignificant. This regression also has the highest R2 among specifications
considered, accounting for more than 50 percent of the variance in overall labor supply
changes across countries.

We also considered a number of other potential determinants of the labor market impact
of the pandemic, but found that they showed little correlation with employment changes
and gender differences.7 An additional conjecture is that the extent of employment pro-
tection may explain some of the variation in employment losses across countries. We
indeed find that the OECD index of employment protection for temporary worker has
a small correlation with overall employment changes in the expected direction, but the
effect is quantitatively small and accounts for little of the observed variance across coun-
tries. Employment protection does not have a significant effect on gender differences in
the impact of the pandemic.

While the correlations documented in Tables 2-5 are suggestive, only so much can be
learned from cross-country correlations in aggregate data. To make progress, we now
turn to household-level evidence from a smaller set of countries.


3       Micro Data Across Countries

The potential explanations for the gendered impact of the current pandemic recession
generate distinct implications for which groups of women would suffer the biggest em-
ployment losses. For example, if childcare obligations during school closures were the
main driving force behind women's employment losses, we would expect to observe a
large impact on the employment of mothers with young children, but not on women
without children or women with adult children. We can use micro data from national
employment surveys to examine these implications. For this analysis, we focus on a
smaller set of countries for which this data is already available up to at least the second
quarter of 2020, namely the United States, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain,
and the United Kingdom. As Table 6 shows, these countries also display a lot of vari-
ation in terms of the structure of women's labor supply, industry composition, and the
    7
   These include the existence of emergency care, the duration of short-term work allowances, a govern-
ment response stringency index, and the fraction of employees with childcare obligations.

driving forces discussed in the previous section.

3.1    Data and Empirical Design

The data stem from a variety of surveys (see Appendix C for details on the data sources
and the sample used) and there is variation in the questionnaires, the frequency of the
surveys, and sample selection. We start by focusing on regressions that can be carried
out in a similar way in all countries and give us a set of comparable results. The first
set of regressions aims to examine the two leading explanations for the large impact of
the pandemic on women's employment, namely the role of childcare and the role of
industry and occupation. Our benchmark regression equation takes the form:

                                yit = 0 + 1 Fi + 2 Dt + 3 Fi × Dt + 4 Xit +                              it .                            (1)

Here yit is the outcome variable of interest for individual i at time t, which is either a
binary employment indicator or the inverse-hyperbolic sine transform of hours worked
last week. We apply this transformation to approximate the natural logarithm of hours
worked last week while keeping the extensive margin of employment (i.e. zero hours).8
Fi is an indicator for female, and Dt is an indicator for the Covid-19 pandemic, here cor-
responding to the second and third quarters of 2020 (the last two quarters in our data
sets). The vector Xit consists of control variables that include gender specific time trends
in labor supply, quarterly seasonal dummies, age dummies, education categories, mar-
ital status, and race.9 We also include a dummy for education workers in the summer
   8
     See Bellemare and Wichman 2020 for more discussion and applications of the inverse hyperbolic-sine
transformation.
   9
     For Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, and Spain we use migration status instead of race, see Ap-
pendix C for details.


                                                                   20
months, since hours worked for this group drop strongly in the summer months. The
main coefficient of interest is 3 on the interaction of Fi and Dt . Here 100*3 captures the
percentage difference in the impact of the pandemic on women versus men.
We use additional regressions to characterize the extent to which the raw gender differ-
ences are due to industry, occupation, and childcare responsibilities. To get at the role of
industry and occupation, we employ the following specification:

          yit = 0 + 1 Fi + 2 Dt + 3 Fi × Dt + 4 Jobit + 5 Jobit × Dt + 6 Xit +                   it .    (2)

Here Jobit is a vector combining occupation and industry information, with a dummy
variable for each occupation-industry combination and an additional dummy variable
for those not working to keep them in the sample. This job-type variable is interacted
with the pandemic dummy Dt , which captures the differential impact of the recession
on workers in different industries and occupations. The coefficient 100*3 captures per-
centage changes in the gender gap net of any industry-by-occupation-specific pandemic
effects. For example, if gender differences arose entirely because more women than
men work in the hospitality sector, we would expect to see a negative estimate of 3 in
Regression (1) but a zero estimate of 3 in Regression (2).
Our third main specification examines the role of childcare responsibilities for gender
gaps in employment during the pandemic by focusing on differences between individ-
uals with and without children. The specification has the following form:

       yit = 0 Kidit + 1 Fi × Kidit + 2 Kidit × Dt + 3 Fi × Kidit × Dt + 4 Xit +                  it .   (3)

Here Kidit is a vector of three dummy variables grouping households by age of their
youngest child into three groups: pre-K (<5), school age (5-17), and a third group that
combines those with no or only adult children.10 The coefficients 0 to 3 are vectors in
this regression with a separate entry corresponding to each child group. In this regres-
sion, the coefficients in 3 capture the gender gap in the employment impact of the pan-
demic conditional on the child group. If gender differences arose solely because mothers
are more affected by the rise in childcare needs during the pandemic than fathers, we
would expect a negative coefficient within the groups with young and school-age chil-
dren, but a zero coefficient in the no child/adult child group.
  10
    In Spain, the group of school-age children includes children up to the age of 19, based on the available
age brackets in the Spanish micro data set. Similar data limitations in Germany allow us to only form two
groups of households in Germany: those with a child below 16 and those without.

                                                    21
Our final specification combines (2) and (3) by adding the work-type controls and inter-
actions to the child-type regressions:

  yit = 0 Kidit + 1 Fi × Kidit + 2 Kidit × Dt + 3 Fi × Kidit × Dt
                                                    + 4 Jobit + 5 Jobit × Dt + 6 Xit +         it .   (4)

 Once again, adding work type controls allows us to assess how much of the observed
effects are due to industry and occupation. For example, one may conjecture that young
mothers have different jobs than young fathers; the full specification allows us to mea-
sure the differential impact of the pandemic on the employment of mothers and fathers
beyond what is accounted for by such industry and occupation differences.

3.2    Gender Gaps Across Countries in the Micro Data

Table 7 summarizes the results for these regressions with employment status (employed
or not) as the left-hand side variable, and Table 8 does the same for hours. For com-
parison, the first row displays the overall percentage employment change (Table 7) and
hours change (Table 8) in each country during the pandemic. Employment dropped by
more than five percent in the United States, Canada, and Spain, by less than one percent
in Germany and the United Kingdom. Changes in hours are much larger and range
from a decline of 36 percent in the United States to more than 50 percent in Germany.11
The Netherlands are an outlier in both dimensions: the data actually indicate a small
but insignificant rise in employment and hours during the crisis. Rather than reflecting
a true increase in employment, it is more likely that this increase reflects a change in the
questionnaire in the Dutch LISS survey that reduces comparability of reported hours
before and during the pandemic.12 We keep the Netherlands in the sample because the
variation in outcomes across different groups in the crisis is still informative.

It is notable that Germany and the United Kingdom display the smallest decline in em-
ployment but among the largest drop in hours. This suggests an important role of fur-
lough schemes in these countries that preserved employment while allowing large re-
  11
      The large impact on hours worked in Germany arises in part because the work-time measure here
includes commuting time, which drops while many people work from home during the pandemic. In ad-
dition, in the German data, post-pandemic hours are observed primarily in Q2/2020, potentially leading
to larger effects compared to other countries that rely on hours observed all the way through September
2020. Finally, for Germany we have only one pre-Covid data point on hours dating back to 2018. See
Appendix C.3 for details on the German data.

Notes: Coefficients reported are in percentage points. Sample includes all civilians aged 25 to 55 who are either
employed, unemployed or not in the labor force. The p-values are reported in parentheses below estimates. Unless
otherwise noted, all regressions include gender specific time trends and controls for age, education, race, and marital
status, in addition to quarterly indicators and a fixed effect for education sector workers in summer months to control
for seasonality. No controls are used in the estimation of the overall employment decline. For Canada, Germany, the
Netherlands, and Spain, we group people by migration background instead of race. Child age brackets are assigned
by the age of the youngest child (<5 and 5-17). In Spain, the group of school-age children includes those up to the
age of 19. Due to data limitations, for Germany we can only estimate the combined effect of having children below
16 (including pre-K), which in the table is reported in the "school age kids" rows. Furthermore, due to a shorter data
availability, in Germany and the Netherlands we cannot control for gender specific time trends, quarterly indicators,
and the summer-education fixed effect. For details on the data, see Appendix C.

ductions in hours (often to zero), which should be kept in mind when interpreting the
results.

The other entries in Tables 7 and 8 are estimates for the gender-gap coefficients of interest
3 , 3 , 3 , and and 3 . Each entry in the table corresponds to an estimate from a separate
regression, and p-values are displayed in parentheses. The row labeled as "Basic Gen-
der Gap" displays the coefficient estimate for 3 for each outcome and for each country.
In terms of employment, a sizeable and statistically significant gender gap in the im-
pact of the pandemic on employment is observed only in the United States and Spain.13
Note that according to Table 6, these two countries have the highest employment share
of the hospitality sector. In terms of hours (Table 8), we observe a substantially larger
impact on women's compared to men's labor supply in the United States, Canada, and
Germany, but no statistically significant difference in the Netherlands, Spain, and the
United Kingdom.14 One reason for these cross-country differences is likely the different
labor market structure in these countries. The fall in relative hours was large and signif-
icant in those countries where the pre-covid cyclicality of relative hours was high and
where female hours worked are relatively high (see Table 6).

The following rows of Tables 7 and 8 break down the gender gap between individuals
with young children, school-age children, and either no or older children. Controlling
for children matters a lot, in part because of differences within the two groups with chil-
dren. In most cases, the gender gap in the "no kids" group is similar to the basic gender
gap. With the exception of the Netherlands, among individuals with pre-K kids there is
either no gender gap or women experience smaller employment and hours losses than
men in this group. It is among workers with school-age children where large gender
gaps in the impact of the crisis arise.

In the United States, for example, there is no significant gender gap among parents of
pre-K kids for both employment and hours, a gender gap of 1.6 percentage points for
employment and 6.6 percentage points for hours within the no-child group, but large
gaps of 4.2 and 17.9 percentage points for employment and hours within the group
with school-age children. The patterns in Canada, Spain, and the United Kingdom are
  13
      To reconcile the results in Tables 7 and 8 with Figure 4, note that the regression include various con-
trols such as time trends and seasonal dummies, implying that results are not directly comparable. In
those cases where coefficients are significant, the sign of effect does line up with Figure 4.
   14
      Note that our measure of hours worked for Germany includes commuting time. Since men on average
spend more time commuting than women, they also likely faced larger reductions in commuting time
during the pandemic. Thus, the true increase in the gender gap in hours worked (without commuting)
should likely be even larger than our estimate.

Notes: Coefficients reported are log points difference of the pandemic's effect on women versus men. Hours index
is calculated using inverse hyperbolic sine transformation of reported hours worked last week. Sample includes all
civilians aged 25 to 55 who are either employed, unemployed or not in the labor force. The p-values are reported in
parentheses below estimates. Unless otherwise noted, all regressions include gender specific time trends and controls
for age, education, race, and marital status, in addition to quarterly indicators and a fixed effect for education sector
workers in summer months to control for seasonality. No controls are used in the estimation of the overall hours
decline. For Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain, we group people by migration background instead
of race. Child age brackets are assigned by the age of the youngest child (<5 and 5-17). In Spain, the group of
school-age children includes those up to the age of 19. Due to data limitations, for Germany we can only estimate
the combined effect of having children below 16 (including pre-K), which in the table is reported in the "school age
kids" rows. Furthermore, due to a shorter data availability, in Germany and the Netherlands we cannot control for
gender specific time trends, quarterly indicators, and the summer-education fixed effect. For details on the data, see
Appendix C.

qualitatively similar to the United States; while the magnitudes differ, in each case the
gender gap is largest among parents of school-age children (in Germany, we do not have
information to distinguish parents of pre-K and school-age children). The only country
with a substantially larger impact on the labor supply of women in the pre-K group is
the Netherlands, and even here the effect is only observed in terms of hours but not
employment. Overall, these findings are consistent with a major role of school closures
for explaining gender gaps during the pandemic.

3.3   The Role of Industry and Occupation

We next turn to the role of differential trends across industries and occupations dur-
ing the pandemic. The bottom half of Tables 7 and 8 shows results after adding work-
type controls for all industry-occupation combinations. As shown in Equation (2), these
work-type controls are interacted with the pandemic dummy, so that we account for the
differential impact of the pandemic on workers in each industry-occupation combina-
tion. If gender differences in a given group were entirely due to a different distribution
of women and men in the group across industries and occupations, we would expect to
observe a zero coefficient in the regressions controlling for these trends.

The results indicate that industry and occupation effects do matter, but only account for
a limited fraction of gender gaps. Consider first the United States. After controlling for
work type, the overall gender gap declines by 43 percent in terms of employment and
33 percent in terms of hours. Among parents of school-age kids, the gender gap declines
by more than 50 percent in terms of employment and a little under 50 percent in terms of
hours. While this shows that the work-type distribution accounts for a sizeable fraction
of the gender gap among parents of school age children, this group still exhibits the
largest gender gaps after controlling for work type. Another notable finding is that the
gender gap among parents of pre-K kids switches sign; once work type is controlled for,
mothers in this group lose more employment and hours than fathers. In other words,
mothers of young children are likely to hold jobs that were relatively secure during the
pandemic recession. However, even after controlling work type effects, the gender gap
in this group continues to be smaller compared both to parents of older children and
individuals without children.

There is a lot of variation in the role of work type across countries. In Canada, for ex-
ample, gender differences among parents with pre-K children in terms of hours actually
increase after controlling for work type, suggesting that fathers of young children work

                                           26
in jobs that were more exposed to the pandemic recession. The gender gap continues to
be largest among parents of school-age children, while it shrinks for those without kids.
In Germany, controlling for work type has only a small effect on the results. In Spain,
controlling for work type accentuates the role of children for gender differences: a large
and significant gender gap in terms of hours is only observed among parents of school-
age children after including work-type controls. The pattern in the United Kingdom is
similar but is just below statistical significance.

3.4   Interpreting the Empirical Findings

A few broader conclusions arise from the empirical analysis so far. First, in the Nether-
lands, Spain, and the United Kingdom gender gaps in the impact of the pandemic
are generally small, and statistically insignificant for both employment and hours once
work type is controlled for. Nevertheless, within this group we find a statistically signif-
icant gender gap in the hours response among parents of school-age children in Spain
and parents of pre-K children in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands this gap in hours
is quantitatively large, even though there is no gender gap in employment among the
same parents. Evidently, many mothers of young children in the Netherlands reduced
their hours at work while holding on to their job. The ability to do so depends on the
availability of flexible furlough schemes and/or additional parental leave, which is one
way in which policy choices shape the gender gap in the labor market during the crisis.

The remaining countries of the United States, Canada, and Germany all display a sub-
stantial overall gender gap in the hours response to the pandemic, with or without work-
type controls. In the United States and Canada we also observe gender gaps in the em-
ployment impact of the crisis, whereas there are no statistically significant employment
effects in Germany. In fact, in Germany there is no statistically significant decrease in
overall employment (both men and women), even though the decline in hours is large,
once again suggesting that employment protection and furlough schemes--which are
extensive in Germany ("Kurzarbeit"), see Table 6--play an important role in shaping
the employment effects of the recession.

Moving on to the role of childcare, in both the United States and Canada we find that the
gender gap in the impact of the pandemic on employment and hours is largest among
the parents of school-age children, and smallest (and even reversed in sign) among the
parents of pre-K children under the age of 5. While the large gender gap among parents
of school-age children lines up with a notion from the existing literature that childcare

                                            27
responsibilities during school and daycare closures have a negative effect on mothers'
employment, our findings for the parents of younger children do not support this chan-
nel and are surprising at first sight. In terms of the sign of the effect on parents of young
children, it turns out that controlling for industry and occupation is crucial: without
such controls mothers experience smaller employment and hours losses than fathers in
this group, but mothers' losses are larger after allowing for different trends across work
types. In other words, among parents of young children, mothers who are in the la-
bor force are more likely than fathers to work in industries and occupations that were
relatively protected from the effects of the pandemic.

Still, even after introducing work type controls, the gender gap is substantially smaller
among parents of young children compared to parents of school-age children. We con-
jecture that this observation may reflect a selection effect. The labor force participation of
mothers of young children is lower than that of mothers of school-age children. Mothers
who decide to work while raising a young child may have stronger labor force attach-
ment than average women. Also, the fact that a mother of a younger child is working
may reflect that she has more help with childcare, be it through a father who does a
large share of the work, the presence of other family members such as grandparents
who help out, or the financial means to employ a nanny. The same factors may also lead
to a smaller impact of the pandemic recession on these women's employment. Mothers
of young children who managed to work prior to the pandemic without using formal
childcare clearly experienced less of a shock to their childcare needs compared to moth-
ers of older children who normally attend school.

A final notable outcome is that even after allowing for the childcare and industry and
occupation channels, sizeable gender gaps remain. The last rows of Tables 7 and 8 show
that within the no-child group and after controlling for work type effects, women suf-
fer larger employment losses than men in the United States, and larger reductions in
hours of labor supply in the United States, Canada, and Germany. In fact, the gender
gap within the no-child group is only slightly smaller than the overall gender gap in
the United States and Canada, and larger (in terms of hours) in Germany. This shows
that the gender gap in the impact of the pandemic goes well beyond the childcare and
industry/occupation channels that have been emphasized by the literature so far.

3.5   Relating the Findings to the Literature

Several studies have analyzed gender differences in the labor market during the pan-
demic, typically focusing on one country at a time. None of these studies has applied
the same methodology to analyze multiple countries in a comparable way. Existing
studies also analyze only a subset of the issues that we do, and often only with data
from the first couple of months of the pandemic. Still, to the extent that the scope of
existing studies overlaps with ours, it is instructive to check how the results line up.

A number of studies have been conducted about the United States, almost all of them
using CPS data as we do. Some of the early studies include data only until April or May
2020 and each of them looks only at a subset of the issues we do. Nevertheless, by and
large the results support our findings of large gender gaps in employment and hours re-
ductions in response to the pandemic, especially for those with children (Dias, Chance,
and Buchanan 2020; Cowan 2020; Montenovo et al. 2020; Fabrizio, Gomes, and Tavares
2021; Collins et al. 2020; Couch, Fairlie, and Xu 2020). There are two papers that exploit
geographic variation in school and daycare closures to isolate the effect of increased
childcare needs. Heggeness (2020) studies school closures and finds that mothers living
in early closure states were more likely to take temporary leave or stop working en-
tirely. Even mothers who maintained their jobs in early closure states were 53 percent
more likely to not be at work compared to mothers in late closure states. Russell and
Sun (2020) analyze childcare center closures instead and find similar effects for mothers
of younger children. Using a triple-differences approach, they find evidence that the
unemployment rate of mothers of young children increased substantially.

Like we do, studies analyzing Canadian data find sizeable gender gaps in labor sup-
ply declines. Qian and Fuller (2020) analyze the Canadian LFS (same data as we use)
and find a large increase in the gender employment gap for parents of primary school
age (6-12) children. They find even larger gender gaps when "being employed and at
work" is used as an outcome variable. Lemieux et al. (2020) document that employment
and hours worked of mothers with school-age children dropped substantially early on
in the pandemic. Beauregard et al. (2020) analyze data from Quebec and find a larger
impact of the pandemic on mothers relative to fathers in dual-parent households. They
also find larger employment declines for single parents compared to dual-parent house-
holds. They further exploit the differential timing of primary school re-openings across
regions. Using a triple-difference-strategy, they find a positive effect of re-openings on
parental work, a more pronounced effect on single mothers, and stronger impact when

                                           29
the job cannot be done from home.

For the United Kingdom, like we do, Hupkau and Petrongolo (2020) find no increase
in the gender gap in paid employment using the same labor force survey that we rely
on. One explanation for these findings may be a more equal division of childcare within
British households. Hupkau and Petrongolo (2020) and Sevilla and Smith (2020) both
document a decline in the gender childcare gap during the pandemic, especially when
men can work from home or lost their jobs. Within specific subgroups, some studies
do find gender gaps even in the United Kingdom. Andrew et al. (2020a) focus on two-
parent families and find larger declines in employment for mothers than fathers within
this group. Analyzing data from a real time survey in April, Adams-Prassl et al. (2020b)
also find gender gaps in employment losses in the United Kingdom. Adams-Prassl et al.
(2020a) document a different kind of gender gap in furlough decisions: mothers were
more likely than fathers to initiate furloughing (as opposed to it being the employer's
decision), while no such gender gaps were found among childless workers.

For the Netherlands, Holler et al. (2021) use the same data that we employ and find little
overall widening of the gender gap in employment or hours, in line with our findings.
They distinguish essential from non-essential workers and find that women working in
non-essential occupations reduced hours by more than men in the same occupations, but
the opposite pattern is observed in essential occupations, where women reduced hours
by less. Meekes, Hassink, and Kalb (2020) use administrative data for the Netherlands
until June 2020. Like us, they find no significant widening of the gender employment
gap in the first half of 2020. They argue that this is largely due to institutions such
as a large short-time work scheme, generous paid family leave, and the availability of
emergency childcare. The authors do find gender differences among subgroups: single
moms of small children classified as essential workers experienced larger reductions in
hours worked than other female essential workers.

González (2021) uses the Spanish labor force survey up until the third quarter and, in
contrast to us, finds no evidence for a gender gap in employment losses. However,
the paper uses a different definition of employment (classifying those furloughed and
working zero hours as unemployed, while we define furloughed workers as employed)
and does not consider hours worked, which likely explains the different result.

Previous findings for Germany are mixed. Adams-Prassl et al. (2020b) find no significant
gender gap in employment losses in data from a real time survey conducted in April
2020. Möhring, Reifenscheid, and Weiland (2021) find that women participate less in

                                           30
short-time work in Germany, so that women's employment is more polarized between
job loss or working on-site. Dullien and Kohlrauch (2021) argue that school closures
played a relatively small role for aggregate employment and hours losses in Germany.
Yet, they also find an increase in the gender employment gap. In their survey, 20 per-
cent of parents with children that need care said they reduced working time because
of child-care and home-schooling requirements in June 2020, and 13 percent said so in
June. Also more mothers than fathers perceived the situation as "extremely/strongly
stressful" during the pandemic.


4        A Closer Look at the United States

In this section, we provide a more detailed look at the case of the United States, the
largest country in our study and the one with the largest gender gap in the employment
impact of the pandemic.

4.1      Decomposition of Channels Underlying the Gender Gap

Building on the regression results in the previous section, we start by providing a de-
composition analysis to asses the relative importance of the childcare and occupational
channels for generating gender gaps in the impact of the pandemic. Given the results
of Regression (4), the decomposition answers the following question: how much of the
pandemic-induced change in the gender gap can be explained by the presence of chil-
dren, and how much is due to industry and occupational effects? We apply this decom-
position to the population of workers who were employed on the eve of the pandemic.15

An intuitive way to understand our decomposition is as follows: for each individual,
we use the regression results in (4) to predict their pandemic-induced change in la-
bor supply. Given the specification, this will depend on their gender, the presence of
children, and their occupation. We then calculate the pandemic-induced change in the
gender gap as the difference in the average change in labor supply for women and the
average change in labor supply for men (in logs). Consequently, the aggregate change
will depend on the micro effects (the estimated parameters 2 , 3 , and 5 ) and the joint
distribution of characteristics--specifically gender, children, and occupations--in the
population. For example, the contribution of the childcare channel is larger when more
    15
   Workers who are out of the labor force for prolonged periods lack information on industry and oc-
cupation, so that a decomposition taking occupation effects into account is more informative for initially
employed workers.


                                                   31
workers have a child. For our analysis we use the distribution of characteristics in the
pre-pandemic data (i.e., Dt = 0). The decomposition then assigns aggregate changes
associated with 5 to the labor demand channel. The childcare channel captures contri-
butions from 2 and 3 relative to the effect on those with no kids. The residual accounts
for any widening in the gender gap among workers with no kids that is not explained
by occupation effects (3,none ). Details on the derivation and implementation of this de-
composition are provided in Appendix D.

        Table 9: Decomposition of Pandemic-induced Change in the Gender Gap

      Outcome            Childcare Channel   Occupation/Industry Channel   Residual
      Employment              13.7%                    12.4%                73.9%
      Hours                   17.7%                    19.8%                62.5%

See Appendix D for details.


Table 9 gives the results. We find that about 14 percent of the gender gap in the em-
ployment decline and 18 percent in the hours decline can be attributed to the childcare
channel. The occupational channel can account for 12 percent and 20 percent, respec-
tively. These numbers imply that there is a large residual: two-thirds of the widening
in the gender gap cannot be explained by the two channels. The size of the residual
is likely related to a missing data problem: for many individuals who are temporarily
not working, no information on occupation or industry is collected. This creates noise
that likely reduces the measured contribution of the occupational channel. To assess the
importance of this issue, we re-estimate our model on the sample of employed individ-
uals only. Conditioning on employment means we can only decompose the intensive
margin, as we are losing the extensive margin by construction. We do carry out this
decomposition in Appendix D. The decomposition of the widening of the gender gap in
hours (conditional on working) based on an estimation using employed workers only
leads to a much smaller residual: we find that 21 percent of the gender gap can be at-
tributed to the childcare channel and 50.5 percent to the occupational channel, leaving
a residual of only 28.5 percent. Note that while the occupation channel gains in impor-
tance, the contribution of the childcare channel is similar to the decomposition based on
estimates for the entire sample.

Even a residual of just under 30 percent suggests that in the pandemic recession, there
are channels beyond childcare and occupation that have a sizeable role in explaining the

                                              32
disparate effects of the pandemic on women and men. One possible channel is related
to the gender wage gap. If families try to minimize family exposure to Covid-19, some
family members may quit jobs or reduce hours to reduce the family's total infection risk.
Such a behavior would make the most sense for family members with low earnings or
working in high-contact occupations, such as women working as nurses, physical ther-
apists, or grocery store clerks. Another possibility is that our estimate of the childcare
channel understates the total effect, for instance, because it ignores the effects on grand-
mothers in multi-generational households, some of whom may also have reduced work
in order to provide more childcare.

4.2      The Impact over Time

Since for the United States we have monthly data through October 2020, we can estimate
how the gender gap changes over time. To do so, we re-estimate Regressions (2) and (4),
but instead of interacting the female and job effects with a pandemic indicator, Dt , we
interact them with monthly time fixed effects. To add precision, we take advantage of
the longitudinal dimension of the CPS data and include individual level fixed effects in
the regression.16 The covariates Xit now consist of marital status, race, education, and
age; other time trends and seasonality controls are subsumed by the non-parametric
time trends we include. Also, we simplify child groups into a binary variable by com-
bining parents of pre-K and school-age kids into one group. Those leaves us with two
groups, those who have children under the age of 18 and those who do not. Results for
the overall gender gap are depicted in Figure 8, and Figure 9 and 10 provide separate
results for those with and without children. In each case, changes are reported relative
to January 2020.

Figure 8 shows that the gender gap was the largest early on in the pandemic. In April
and May 2020, the gender gap was two percentage points higher compared to January
in terms of employment, and ten percentage points in terms of hours. The employment
gender gap started to narrow in June and had more than halved by October. The hours
gap stayed wide for longer and started narrowing only in September.

Figures 9 and 10 plot estimates over time for those with and without children. While
both groups faced a widening of the gender gap in hours as well as employment due to
the pandemic, in April and May 2000 the gender employment gap among parents had
widened by almost three percentage points relative to January, compared to about two

percentage points among non-parents. For hours worked, trends across those with and
without kids are similar. The gender gap in hours and employment declines over time,
and by October 2020 the gender gap in employment remains statistically significant only
among parents.

Generally, the impact of having children in the results displayed in Figures 9 and 10
is smaller compared to the raw data displayed in Figure 2 (and also Figure A4 in the
appendix). Unlike Figure 2, the regressions underlying Figures 9 and 10 rely on micro
data and include various controls, individual fixed effects, and differential trends across
industries and occupations. Clearly, allowing for these controls and trends accounts for
some of the raw gender gap displayed in Figure 2.

4.3   Pandemic Recession versus Great Recession

In our analysis of the micro data, we have so far focused entirely on outcomes during the
pandemic recession. We have already established in Section 2 that the aggregate impact
of the pandemic recession on women versus men is drastically different from regular
recessions in a large set of countries, but this still leaves open the question of whether
there are gender gaps related to parenthood and childcare in other recessions, too. To
make one such comparison we focus on the contrast between the pandemic recession

Notes: Coefficients reported are percentage points. Sample includes all civilians ages 25 to 55 who are either em-
ployed, unemployed or NILF. The p-values are reported in parentheses below estimates. Unless otherwise noted, all
regressions include gender specific time trends and controls for age, education, race, and marital status, in addition
to quarterly indicators and a fixed effect for education sector workers in summer months to control for seasonality.
Child age brackets are assigned by the age of the youngest child (<5 and 5-17).


Table 10 provides results for the same specifications as in Tables 7 and 8 for the Great
Recession in the United States. To focus on the first six months of the recession (as we do
in Tables 7 and 8) we set the recession indicator Dt to one starting in December 2007 until
May 2008. As expected given the results in Section 2, the table shows that, unlike the
pandemic recession, the Great Recession was a mancession with larger declines in both
hours and employment for men. Furthermore, the impacts on the gender gap among
parents and non-parents are of the same sign and of a similar magnitude. These findings
are consistent with the notion that both the overall impact on women in the labor market
and the special role of parenthood are unique to the pandemic recession of 2020.


5        Heterogeneity by Education, Race, Single Parenthood, and Ability
         to Work from Home
We now return to the full set of countries and explore which other dimensions of het-
erogeneity (beyond parenthood and industry/occupation) are connected to gender dif-
ferences in the labor market during the pandemic recession.
    17
    We focus on the United States here because the overall impact of the 2007-2009 financial crisis on
employment and the timing of the related economic downturn differed substantially across the countries
we consider.

5.1    The Role of Education and Race

Consider, first, the role of education. Tables 11 and 12 present results analogous to Ta-
bles 7 and 8 with separate results for individuals with at least college education and
less-educated workers.18 The regressions in Tables 11 and 12 already include industry
and occupation controls, and thus capture education effects beyond those that arise be-
cause education and work type are correlated.19

Notes: The notes of Table 7 apply. All regressions include occupation×industry controls interacted with the pan-
demic indicator. For details on the data, see Appendix C.


Recall that only the United States and Canada display a large and statistically significant
overall gender gap for both employment and hours after controlling for industry and
occupation effects (Tables 7 and 8). Tables 11 and 12 show that in the same two countries,
  18
     We include a dummy indicating college education as an additional interaction term in our regression
specifications (1)--(4). Hence, Tables 11 and 12 report the pandemic-induced gender gap interacted with
the respective education level (and the presence of children).

     Tables A3 and A4 in the appendix display results without work type controls.

the gender gap for both employment and hours is much larger among less-educated
workers. In both countries, the gender gap for employment is more than three times
larger among less educated workers compared to workers with college education. For
hours, the gender gap among less educated workers is three times as large among the
less educated in the United States, and a bit more than 50 percent larger in Canada.
The role of childcare in accounting for these differences varies across countries. In the
United States, it is notable that among college-educated workers, the gender gap in the
impact of the crisis is entirely due to those with children--there is no significant gender
gap for either employment or hours among those without kids. In contrast, among less
educated workers women suffer larger declines in employment and hours even without
children. In the United Kingdom (where the gender gap in the impact of the crisis is
generally small) the only group where we observe a large and statistically significant
gender gap in the decline in hours worked consists of college-educated workers with
school-age children.

Another salient dimension of heterogeneity is race; in the United States for example,
overall employment losses have been substantially larger among Black and Hispanic
compared to white workers. Tables 13 and 14 examine whether the gender gap in the
impact of the crisis also varies across races. The underlying regressions include indus-
try and occupation controls, and thus are not driven by differences in the distribution
of workers of different races across work types.20 Data on race is available only for the
United States and the United Kingdom; for these countries, to maintain sufficiently large
sample sizes we focus on differences between white workers and all others. For Canada,
Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain we display analogous results focusing on differ-
ences between the native-born population and workers with a migration background
(see Appendix C for details).

We find that in the United States, the gender gap is generally of a similar size between
white and other workers. Having school age children expands the gender gap a bit more
among white workers. Likewise, in the United Kingdom there are no significant differ-
ences in patterns between white and non-white workers. Notice that these results reflect
relative changes between women and men; even though non-white workers generally
experienced a larger reduction in employment and hours, this does not seem to affect
women more strongly than men, and in the United States somewhat less so if they have
school-age children.

In Germany, the gender gap in the impact on employment is much larger among work-
ers with a migration background. This difference is not driven by childcare: the gap is
similar among workers with and without children. The same gap is not observed for
hours. This suggests that among workers with an immigration background, women
were more likely to lose their job in the crisis, whereas immigrant men and native work-
ers were more likely to hold on to their job but then reduce hours through the use of fur-
lough schemes. Some of this pattern may arise because many immigrant women have
"minijobs" without formal employment protection. In the Netherlands, there is a sub-
stantial gender gap for both employment and hours among parents of young children
with a migration background. In Canada, the gender gap among immigrants widens
substantially for both employment and hours, particularly for those with school-age
children. For non-immigrants we observe a similar effect for hours but of a smaller
magnitude.

5.2     The Role of Single Parenthood

Our results so far indicate that childcare obligations are one major reason why women
in many countries faced a deterioration in labor market opportunities during the crisis.
The role of childcare suggests that single parents, who have less flexibility in sharing
responsibilities with a partner, should be particularly exposed to the effects of the crisis.
To examine this possibility, we now consider differences in the impact of the crisis on
single mothers versus mothers living with a partner. The regressions take the form:

      yit = 0 Kidit + 1 Si × Kidit + 2 Kidit × Dt + 3 Si × Kidit × Dt + 4 Xit +                   it .   (5)


Here yit is the outcome variable for individual i at time t, Si is an indicator for a sin-
gle mother, Dt is the indicator for the Covid-19 pandemic, and Kidit is a vector of two
dummy variables grouping households by age of their youngest child into two groups:
pre-K (<5) and school age (5-17).21 The vector Xit consists of the same control variables as
in the earlier regressions. We run this regression on a sample consisting only of mothers
with kids up to the age of 18 (below 20 in Spain); here we are interested in the coefficients
3 on the interaction of Si , Dt and Kidit , which captures the difference in the impact of
the pandemic on single mothers versus mothers living with a partner by child age.
  21
    In Spain, the group of school age children includes children up to the age of 19, based on the available
age brackets in the Spanish micro data set.



                                                    42
We also carry out a version of this regression analogous to (4) with work type controls:

  yit = 0 Kidit + 1 Si × Kidit + 2 Kidit × Dt + 3 Si × Kidit × Dt
                                              + 4 Jobit + 5 Jobit × Dt + 6 Xit +      it .   (6)



Table 15 shows the estimates of the parameters 3 and 3 in these regressions. In the
results without work type controls, we find that in the United States, Canada, and Spain
single mothers of school-age children experienced larger declines in employment and
hours compared to mothers living with a partner. In the United States and Canada,
the same is true for single mothers of younger children. In contrast, in Germany, the
Netherlands, and the United Kingdom there are no significant differences in the impact
of the crisis on single versus other mothers.

The results controlling for work type indicate that a lot of the large impact on single
mothers in the United States, Canada, and Spain is due to the fact that single mothers
are likely to have jobs in industries and occupations that experienced larger employment
declines in the crisis. In all three countries, the gap between single mothers and mothers
living with a partner is substantially reduced once differential trends across job types are
controlled for. In the United States, in fact, all differences become statistically insignif-
icant. In Canada and Spain, a larger impact on single mothers remains. In these two
countries, the additional impact on single mothers remains quantitatively large even af-
ter controlling for work type. In Canada, for example, hours for single mothers decline
by an additional 5.1 percentage points for mothers of school-age children, and 14.4 per-
centage points for mothers of younger children. In the Netherlands the impact on the
employment of single mothers with school-age kids is larger after controlling for work
type.

The results provide support for the view that single mothers faced particularly large
challenges during the crisis, but also show that local conditions matter. The extent of
school closures and the availability of emergency childcare varied widely across the
countries considered. So does mothers' baseline labor supply. In Germany and the
Netherlands, for example, relatively few mothers work full time, which may give them
additional flexibility to deal with childcare needs compared to otherwise similar moth-
ers in the United States or Canada who were working full time at the beginning of the
crisis. We also note that for the Netherlands and Germany we have only few observa-

We already saw that the impact of the pandemic on workers varied widely across in-
dustries and occupations. Among the underlying job characteristics that give rise to
these differences, arguably the most important one is the ability to work from home. Job
losses were highest in industries and occupations were working from home is impossi-
ble, including much of the hospitality industry. In contrast, other groups such as office
workers and academics were able to continue work via telecommuting, and rapidly
adopted remote-working tools such as videoconferencing on Zoom and similar services
in the process. The ability to work from home also interacts with childcare needs; look-
ing after children in virtual school is easier for a parent who is working on a laptop a
few feet away compared to a parent who has to commute to a workplace.

To examine how telecommuting shaped the labor market experiences of women versus
men during the pandemic, we now consider how the gender gap in the impact of the cri-
sis differs between workers who are able to work from home during the pandemic and
those who are not. We focus on the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Nether-
lands, where information on telecommuting during the crisis is available. Moreover,
we limit attention to the intensive margin of labor supply (hours worked conditional on
being employed), because the place of work is only known for the employed.

For the United States, information on telecommuting during the pandemic is available
from the Covid-19 supplement to the CPS.22 The answers are available starting in May
2020, and we classify individuals as telecommuting if they worked remotely at any point
from May 2020 to September 2020. We retrieve labor market outcomes predating May
2020 using the panel dimension of the the CPS monthly files. In the United Kingdom,
telecommuting information is available for all employed individuals, including those
who report zero hours of work (i.e., workers on furlough). Note that our information is
on actual telecommuting rather than just the ability to work from home, so that results
could be influenced by workers' decision whether to work from home if they have the
ability to do so. Nevertheless, we conjecture that during the crisis most workers who
  22
   The relevant question is as follows: "At any time in the last 4 weeks, did (you/name) telework or
work at home for pay because of the coronavirus pandemic? (Enter No if person worked entirely from
home before the Coronavirus pandemic)"


                                                45
were able to work from home actually did so. In the Netherlands, the data contains
information on the hours worked from home in the reference week for March, April,
May, June, and September 2020. Hence, we follow the same approach as for the United
States and define individuals to be able to telecommute if they have been working from
home at any point between March and September 2020.

Notes: Coefficients reported are log percentage point differences of the pandemic's effect on women versus men.
Sample includes all civilians aged 25 to 55 who are employed (in the US restricted to positive hours, in the UK
including those with zero hours, e.g. those on furlough). The p-values are reported in parentheses below estimates.
All regressions include gender specific time trends and controls for age, education, race, and marital status, in
addition to quarterly indicators and a fixed effect for education sector workers in summer months to control for
seasonality. Child age brackets are assigned by the age of the youngest child (<5 and 5-17). For details on the data,
see Appendix C.


Table 16 displays how the gender gap in the impact of the crisis differs between work-
ers who can work from home and those who cannot. For the United States, the result
is straightforward to summarize: there are large gender gaps among workers who are
unable to work from home but only small ones among telecommuters, which become
insignificant when controlling for work types. This continues to be true when we sepa-
rate results between parents and others. Among telecommuters, gender gaps are small
among both parents and non-parents. In contrast, among non-telecommuters, there is
a large gender gap even among workers without kids, and an even larger one among
parents. Unlike in our baseline results that do not control for telecommuting, this time


                                                                46
the largest gender gap is found among parents of young (pre-K) children: in this group,
mothers are estimated to reduce hours by about 17 percentage points more than fathers
do. Among parents of school-age children the gender gap amounts to 14 percentage
points, versus 9 percentage points among those without kids under the age of 18. In-
terestingly, the results are essentially the same regardless of whether we also introduce
job type controls or not. This suggests that the ability to work from home is the main
job-type characteristic that matters during the pandemic, so that few additional effects
arise when telecommuters and non-telecommuters are already separated.

Notes: Sample includes all employed individuals, ages 25-55, not in the military. Report values correspond to
weighted average hours worked last week by sex, child group, and telecommuting status from May 2020 through
Oct 2020. Child age brackets are assigned by the age of the youngest child (pre-K: <5, middle school: 5-13, high
school: 14-17).

The central role of the combined effect of the ability to work from home and childcare
needs is also apparent from the raw data on labor supply for women and men during
the pandemic. Table 17 displays average hours worked conditional on being employed
in the United States broken down by gender, parental status, and telecommuting. For
men, weekly work hours vary little across these groups and are close to 40 hours per
week in each case. Similarly, for women who can telecommute labor supply is roughly
constant across groups, with all groups averaging between 35 and 38 hours per week.
For women who cannot telecommute, however, motherhood makes a big difference:
non-telecommuting mothers of pre-K children work more than 5 hours less per week
during the pandemic compared to non-telecommuting women without children. For
mothers of middle school children, there is still a gap of about 3 hours per week.

In the Netherlands, we observed in our baseline regression a large and significant gen-
der gap in hours for parents with pre-K kids (see Table 8). The coefficients in Table 16
suggest that this result is primarily driven by those parents who cannot telecommute.

                                                      47
In this group, we observe a stark contrast between those with small children and those
without children, although the results are not tightly estimated due to small sample size.

Regarding the United Kingdom, recall that unlike the other countries considered here
we did not find a substantial gender gap in the impact of the crisis. Once we sepa-
rate out telecommuters, most gender-gap coefficients in Table 16 continue to be small
and statistically insignificant. However, we now do find a sizeable gender gap among
workers who cannot telecommute and who have school-age children. In this group, the
negative impact on the labor supply of mothers is 9 to 11 percentage points larger com-
pared to fathers. Thus, even in the United Kingdom the combination of having to look
after school age children and being unable to work from home is associated with a large
decline in mothers' labor supply.

The gender gap among parents of school-age children in the United Kingdom is related
to the use of furlough schemes; there are more mothers than fathers recorded as em-
ployed but working zero hours.23 Furloughing accounts for most of the gender gap
in labor supply of non-telecommuting parents with school-age children: if we exclude
those who record zero hours, the gender gap turns insignificant.24 Hence, the data sug-
gests that furlough schemes gave workers additional flexibility in dealing with the crisis,
and that it was mothers of school-age children who used this flexibility to select into not
working temporarily (i.e., asking their employer to be furloughed if telecommuting was
not an option).25

Table 18 provides a further breakdown of the results of Table 16 for the United Kingdom
by allowing for separate interactions for more educated (BA degree or higher) and less
educated (less than BA) workers. Here we see that the option to telecommute in the pres-
ence of children matters a lot more for highly educated mothers. Among telecommuting
workers with at least BA education there is no significant gender gap in the impact of
   23
      The percentage point difference between mothers and fathers with a school-age child reporting zero
hours while being employed increases from 2.2 percentage points in Q1/2020 to 5.2 percentage points
in Q2/2020 and even further to 7.8 percentage points in Q3/2020. For those with pre-K children, there
is always a sizeable gender gap in those employed but working zero hours (18.5 percentage points in
Q1/2020), likely due to generous parental leave policies. For this group we also observe an increases,
but it is less pronounced: 18.5 percentage points in Q1/2020, 19.2 percentage points in Q2/2020, and 21.7
percentage points in Q3/2020. In contrast, the difference is stable for those without kids: 2.0 percentage
points in Q1/2020, 1.5 percentage points in Q2/2020, and 2.3 percentage points in Q3/2020.
   24
      In fact, if we exclude those who report zero hours, the impact of the pandemic on the gender gap
decreases in absolute value from -10.7 to -1.0 and once we control for work type from -9.0 to -0.7.
   25
      Adams-Prassl et al. (2020a) indeed find that UK mothers were more likely to initiate furloughing than
fathers (as opposed to the employer), while no such gender gaps were found among childless workers.


                                                    48
the crisis regardless of having children. In contrast, the gender gap among educated
parents who cannot work from home is large. Depending on the age of the children and
on whether we control for additional occupation and industry effects, the labor supply
of non-telecommuting educated mothers falls by 13 to 20 percentage points more than
the labor supply of fathers in this group. Among less educated workers, these gender
gaps are small or non-existent. Thus, even though overall the gender gap in the impact
of the crisis is small in the United Kingdom, even here we find that the clash of childcare
needs and having to be at work during the crisis was a challenge for many mothers.

Overall, our results suggest that the ability to work from home played a central role in
shaping the impact of the pandemic on working women. Being able to telecommute
is a clear advantage for all workers during the pandemic, both because this reduces
the probability of employment loss and because working at home reduces the risk of
exposure to disease. Parents get the additional benefit of having an easier time dealing

                                                        49
with additional childcare and supporting their children's education during school and
daycare closures. While this benefit in principle accrues to both fathers and mothers,
our results show that in practice it was primarily women's employment that suffered
where a conflict between children's needs and a lack of ability to telecommute arose.


6   The Impact of the Pandemic on Workers' Productivity
So far we have focused on labor supply to document inequality in the impact of the pan-
demic on the labor market. While we find a lot of evidence of gender inequality during
the crisis, we also document that workplace flexibility in the form of the ability to work
from home appears to protect women's labor market prospects. This could be taken as
a hopeful sign for the long-run impact of the pandemic on gender inequality. The recent
literature on the "motherhood penalty" shows that the combined challenge of career and
family goals is at the root of much of the gender inequality in the labor market today.
Our results suggest that workplace flexibility substantially reduces the conflict between
work and childcare. Moreover, now that many employers have adopted working-from-
home, liked the results, and plan to preserve work-from-home options in the future,
we can expect that after the pandemic workplace flexibility will be much more widely
available than previously. Should we therefore expect a smaller motherhood penalty
and lower gender gaps in the post-pandemic labor market?

While such an outcome of lower future gender equality is a possibility, our evidence
on labor supply may paint an incomplete picture of the impact of the crisis on work-
ing women and men. Even though working from home allowed many parents to con-
tinue working while also supervising their children, productivity at work may still have
suffered in the process. Moreover, if the division of childcare duties is unequal in the
family, the productivity impact may be more severe for mothers than for fathers. The
evidence indeed suggests that on average, mothers provided the larger share of the ad-
ditional childcare during the pandemic. For example, Adams-Prassl et al. (2020b) show
that during the pandemic women with children who worked from home spent one to
two hours more every day on childcare and home schooling compared to men in the
same situation, with remarkably similar patterns in the United States, Germany, and
the United Kingdom. This evidence suggests that combining working from home with
childcare was a greater challenge for mothers compared to fathers.

Our data for the Netherlands provides direct evidence of a greater clash between work
and childcare responsibilities for women compared to men. Table 19 shows that in April

2020, Dutch parents spent on average 13 hours per week working from home. A lot of
this time was combined with childcare: averaging between mothers and fathers, parents
report that for more than 60 percent of the time working at home they were simultane-
ously looking after their children. However, there is a large gender gap in doing double
duty. In line with our other results, this gender gap is largest for those with school-age
children (ages 6­14) who likely need help with home schooling. In this group, mothers
spent three quarters of their work time at home on simultaneously taking care of chil-
dren, which is 30 percent more than the fathers in this group. As a fraction of all work
hours (including those done outside the home), mothers of school-age children spent
close to 40 percent of work time on also doing childcare, about 40 percent more than
fathers did.

Andrew et al. (2020a) provide additional evidence of a gender gap in doing double duty
of work and childcare based on a survey of parents in the United Kingdom carried out
in April and May 2020. The authors find that mothers generally spent more time on
childcare and house work and less time on paid work compared to fathers. To assess
the extent to which other responsibilities such as childcare affect the quality of the time
spent working, the authors focus on work interruptions, defined as doing at least one


                                                  51
non-work activity during an hour of paid work. Whereas prior to the pandemic, both
mothers and fathers used to be interrupted proportionally to their work hours, during
the crisis mothers are interrupted about 50 percent more often. For mothers, 90 percent
of these interruptions are due to childcare. Overall, fathers working for pay ended up
with nearly twice as many uninterrupted work hours compared to mothers working for
pay.

This evidence suggests even though working from home may have cushioned the im-
pact of school and daycare closures on employment, the quality of parents' work time
and productivity are likely to have suffered in the process. This impact is much larger
for mothers than for fathers. Lower productivity at work, in turn, may have implications
for human capital accumulation on the job and future career prospects. While in some
occupations a short-run dip in productivity may be of little concern, in others mothers
with high childcare obligations during the crisis may miss out on raises or promotions
in the near future. In "up-or-out" occupations such as law, falling behind peers during
the crisis could put up a permanent ceiling to future career prospects.

For the most part, the productivity losses of working parents during the pandemic will
show up in the data only some years down the road. There is one sector character-
ized by "up-or-down" promotions where evidence on productivity during the crisis is
already available: academia. The productivity of academic researchers can be proxied
by real-time output measures such as publications and working papers. Several recent
research papers document a gender gap in researchers' productivity since the begin-
ning of the pandemic. Amano-Patiño et al. (2020) use data from the NBER and CEPR
working paper series and the "CEPR Covid Economics: Real-Time and Vetted Papers"
online journal to analyze the contribution of female economists during the first wave
of the pandemic. They find that while the relative number of female authors remained
constant at about 20 percent, women constituted only 12 percent of all authors working
on Covid-19 research. Since Covid-19 research was carried out during the pandemic,
while most other working papers were likely based on research started well before the
onset of the pandemic, this suggest a sizeable decline in the relative research productiv-
ity of women. Similarly, Ribarovska et al. (2021) document a small reduction in female
last authors in a neurology journal, and a much larger reduction of female first and last
authors among articles in a COVID-19 special issue. Kim and Patterson (2020) analyze
Twitter posts by academic political scientists between June 2019 and June 2020 and find
a larger decline in work-related tweets for women compared to men. The authors argue


                                           52
that this gender gap is likely driven by increased family obligations, since at the same
time female researchers became relatively more likely to tweet about family-related mat-
ters. Barber et al. (2021) use a survey of members of the American Finance Association
to examine determinants of research productivity during the pandemic, and find that
productivity fell more for women and for researchers with young children.

Many universities have announced policy changes to respond to the challenge that the
crisis poses for young researchers, such as tenure-clock extensions for assistant profes-
sors. However, with few exceptions these polices do not distinguish between women
and men or make special provisions for researchers with major childcare responsibil-
ities during the crisis. Given the emerging evidence of a relative productivity decline
of women in academia, the likely result is a deterioration of many female researchers'
relative prospects for tenure and career advancement. Given the broader evidence of
a more severe clash between work and childcare responsibilities for mothers compared
to fathers during the pandemic, it is likely that similar repercussions will occur in other
industries and occupations, although it will take some time until it will be possible to
verify this in the data.


7     What Have We Learned and Why Should We Care?
What general lessons can be learned from our analysis of data on labor market outcomes
for women and men during the coronavirus pandemic? Even though there are a lot of
differences across countries, a few common themes emerge. In this section, we sum-
marize our findings and discuss what they imply for how differences in the impact on
working women and men matter for economic outcomes during the crisis and beyond.

7.1   Summarizing the Findings

The main conclusions arising from our empirical analysis are as follows:

    1. The pandemic recession is a shecession (almost) everywhere. Figure 4 shows
       that in 18 out of 28 advanced economies women's employment fell by more than
       men's during the pandemic, and in 19 out of 28 countries women experienced a
       larger decline in hours worked. What is more, even in countries where the impact
       on women and men was similar, this still presents a sharp deviation from usual re-
       cessions, which tend to be mancessions in most countries. Figure 5b shows that in
       all but two countries (Ireland and Sweden) the negative impact of the recession on

                                            53
  women's hours worked relative to men's was larger than what would be expected
  based on earlier recessions. Overall, we conclude that the unusually large impact
  of the pandemic recession on working women is a common feature among a large
  set of economies, and a key distinction between this and earlier recessions.

2. Industry/occupation effects and childcare needs are the main, but not the only,
   cause of gender gaps. Figure 6 demonstrates that in many countries, the pan-
   demic recession had an unusually large impact on industries with high female
   employment shares, such as leisure and hospitality. Tables 7 and 8 show that in
   the countries with significant gender gaps in the impact of the pandemic on em-
   ployment or hours the gender gap is usually substantially reduced when control-
   ling for different trends across industries and occupations. The same tables show
   larger gender gaps among parents of school-age children, indicating the impor-
   tance of childcare and home schooling obligations. Nevertheless, gender gaps go
   beyond industry/occupation and childcare effects. Tables 7 and 8 show that in
   countries where there are statistically significant overall gender gaps in the impact
   of the pandemic on employment or hours, a substantial and statistically signifi-
   cant gap is observed even among workers without children and after controlling
   for industry/occupation effects. The decomposition analysis for the United States
   in Section 4 shows that the childcare and industry/occupation channels account
   for less than half of the total gender gap. Clearly, there are additional factors that
   made women's employment more vulnerable in the pandemic.

3. Gender gaps during the pandemic recession vary widely across countries. While
   qualitatively in most countries the pandemic recession is a shecession, quantita-
   tively there is wide variation in the gaps between the impacts on women and men
   across countries (see Figure 4). What is more, there is only a loose correlation be-
   tween the impact of the gender gap in terms of employment and hours. The United
   States is an example of a country with a large gender gap in the decline in employ-
   ment, yet hours worked relative to men changed less than in other countries. In
   contrast, in countries such as Denmark and Germany, women experienced fewer
   employment losses than men, but also a large reduction in relative hours worked,
   implying that women's labor supply conditional on working dropped sharply.

4. Policy difference likely contributed to cross-country differences in the impact
   of the crisis, but evidence is inconclusive. The policy response to the pandemic
   varied widely across countries, for example in terms of the severity and duration

                                         54
  of lockdowns and the extent and duration of school closures. Given that much
  of the pandemic recession is due to the response of the crisis rather than a di-
  rect consequence of disease, one would expect that policy differences contribute
  to cross-country variation in gender gaps. Tables 2 and 3 show that the extent of
  school closures is indeed correlated with employment losses during the pandemic
  across countries. However, there is no conclusive evidence that these policy differ-
  ences underlie cross-country differences in gender gaps (Tables 4 and 5). Another
  relevant policy dimension is the use of furlough policies (such as Kurzarbeit in Ger-
  many) to protect employment during the crisis. Tables 7 and 8 show that in Ger-
  many there is only a small effect on overall employment and no gender gap in this
  dimension, but a large overall impact and a large gender gap in hours. The United
  States, with little use of furlough policies, the overall impact and gender gaps are
  much larger in terms of employment and smaller in terms of hours. These obser-
  vations suggest that furlough policies in Germany protected formal employment
  relationships while also providing flexibility for large adjustments of labor supply
  on the intensive margin.

5. Work flexibility in the form of the ability to work from home greatly reduces
   the impact of the pandemic on gender gaps. Table 16 shows that in the United
   States and the United Kingdom, there is no statistically significant larger impact
   on women's hours worked among workers who can work from home during the
   crisis, regardless of industry, occupation, or childcare obligations. Table 4 shows
   that the fraction of jobs that allow for telecommuting is the only variable that is
   significantly correlated with differences in the gender gap across countries. This
   evidence suggests that work flexibility greatly reduces gender differences in the
   labor market during the pandemic. However, there is evidence that among those
   working from home, mothers experienced a larger decline in productivity while si-
   multaneously engaging in work and childcare. Table 19 shows that in the Nether-
   lands, mothers working from home spent a much larger fraction of the work time
   while also looking after their children than fathers did. Survey evidence for other
   countries and direct productivity measures for academic research also suggest a
   larger dip in women's work productivity during the pandemic.

7.2   Wider Implications for the Nature of the Pandemic Recession

Is a shecession the same as a mancession with signs reversed? For sure, the simple issue
of whether the bulk of employment losses falls on women rather than men is a big part
of what makes these types of recessions distinct. But there are equally important qualita-
tive differences between shecessions and mancessions. Understanding these differences
matters for policy tradeoffs during the recession and for the shape of the economic re-
covery that follows.

A first qualitative difference between shecessions and mancessions arises from the dif-
ferent dynamic behavior of women's and men's labor supply. Women's labor supply is
generally more elastic at the micro level (e.g., Blundell and MaCurdy 1999). Men's labor
supply elasticity is lower, and particularly so for married men. This implies that when
men lose employment in a recession, they are likely to stay in the labor force and return
to full-time employment in the recovery. In contrast, given their more elastic labor sup-
ply, when losing employment in a recession women are relatively more likely to drop
out of the labor force or to only seek part-time work. At the economywide level, these
patterns suggest that in a shecession, when job losses are concentrated on women, the
decline in aggregate labor supply will be more persistent, and continue to be concen-
trated on women during the recovery (see Alon et al. 2020b for a quantitative analysis
making this point).

A second difference between shecessions and mancessions relates to insurance within
the household. Married couples can provide each other with insurance for income
shocks. The mere presence of a second earner implies that a temporary job loss has
a smaller proportional impact on earnings compared to single-earner households. Cou-
ples are also able to provide each other with active insurance, such as the "added worker
effect" of a secondary earner joining the labor force in response to unemployment of the
primary earner (Lundberg 1985). Blundell, Pistaferri, and Saporta-Eksten (2016) show
that within-family insurance is the primary insurance channel for many households,
and Bardóczy (2020) argues that this insurance channel plays a central role in the trans-
mission of aggregate shocks.

The distinct behavior of women's and men's labor supply suggests that family insurance
is less effective in the pandemic recession compared to a regular recession. The large
overall impact on the employment of both women and men implies that there are many
families where both husband and wife experience earnings losses, which reduces the


                                           56
scope for passive insurance. More importantly, active insurance relies on the ability
of the spouse who did not experience unemployment or reduced earnings to increase
labor supply. In a mancession, the spouse who provides insurance is usually the wife.
More married women than men work either part time or are out of the labor force,
which means that there is scope for increasing labor supply. Therefore, in a mancession
active insurance can play an important role in buffering income losses for households.
In contrast, when married women lose employment in a shecession, their husbands
are often unable to provide active insurance, because they already work full time and
because married men's labor supply is generally inflexible. Overall, family insurance is
much less effective in a shecession such as the current pandemic recession compared to
a regular recession.

Beyond shaping labor supply responses, the lack of family insurance also matters for
how aggregate consumption and savings evolve in the recession. If households have
less access to insurance, economic shocks translate more directly into consumption. The
strength of this transmission can be summarized by the marginal propensity to con-
sume (MPC), which is the fraction of a one-dollar loss in income for a household that
will be reflected in lower consumption in the same period (instead of in lower savings).
Alon et al. (2020b) show that the loss of family insurance in a pandemic recession re-
sults in a sustained raise in MPCs relative to a regular recession. Higher economywide
MPCs, in turn, can result in a deeper recession and in a slower recovery, because higher
MPCs mean that aggregate demand will drop more sharply during the recession. To
be sure, a pandemic recession has additional implications for MPCs that do not relate
to the relative impact on women's versus men's employment, for example because of
reduced consumption opportunities during lockdowns and the effects of stimulus pay-
ments during the crisis. Depending on policy responses the overall evolution of MPCs
in a pandemic recession is therefore ambiguous, but the family insurance channel is a
force towards higher MPCs in this type of recession.

The impact of the pandemic recession on women's employment also matters through its
interaction with policies and institutions. In many countries unemployment insurance
is the primary social insurance channel in recessions. However, women who stop work-
ing during the pandemic because of childcare needs are usually out of the labor force
rather than unemployed, i.e., they stop looking for work. Therefore, traditional unem-
ployment insurance would not be accessible to women in this situation. Many countries
instituted temporary changes to their insurance systems during the crisis, such as ex-


                                          57
panding furlough pay and making unemployment benefits available also to those who
stop working because of family obligations. Still, some of these policy changes were
temporary and implementation varied across countries and U.S. states, so that some
policy-induced asymmetries remain.

7.3   Wider Implications for the Future Labor Market

The pandemic recession will also have repercussions for the future of the labor market
that far outlast the recession and the subsequent recovery. It is well known that losing
employment during a recession is associated with persistent earnings losses for the af-
fected workers (Stevens 1997, Davis and von Wachter 2011). The fact that more women
than men were affected by employment losses will tend to increase the gender pay gap
in the years after the recession. Women's higher flexibility of labor supply is also likely
to result in persistent changes in labor force participation; some women (especially mar-
ried women) who lost employment during the crisis will drop out of the labor force
for an extended period or only return to part-time work. Hence, women's labor force
participation will be lower as a result of the recession for years to come.

In addition to the direct impact on workers during the recession, the shock of the pan-
demic will also result in broader changes in the labor market that will shape the expe-
rience of current and future cohorts of workers alike. Arguably the most important one
of these changes is increased employment flexibility, such as a much expanded ability to
work from home for many workers. During the pandemic, most jobs that could be done
from in principle were switched to being done from home in practice. Office workers
who spend their days primarily working with computers almost universally worked
from their living rooms, kitchens, and spare bedrooms during the pandemic, rapidly
adopting new remote-work tools such as videoconferencing through Zoom in the pro-
cess. Much of this change is likely to persist beyond the crisis. Employers and em-
ployees have paid the fixed cost of adopting remote work; learning-by-doing has taken
place; employers have realized that working-from-home does not have to result in lower
productivity; and employers have started to appreciate the savings from needing much
less office space (Barrero, Bloom, and Davis 2021). Many have already announced that
work-from-home will continue to be central to the post-pandemic work environment
and have started the process of canceling leases for office space.

How is this new normal in the post-pandemic workplace going to change the labor mar-
ket? Change is likely to occur in a number of dimensions, from commuting patterns and

                                            58
the commercial real estate market to new ways of fostering coherence and interaction in
a workplace where face-to-face contact with coworkers is the exception rather than the
norm.

For our purposes, the most interesting changes concern gender inequality in the labor
market. We believe that increased work flexibility in the new normal has the potential
to substantially reduce gender inequality. This expectation is based on two observations
about the pre-pandemic labor market.

The first observation is that much gender inequality in the labor market in today's ad-
vanced economies is related to parenthood and childcare. The literature on the "moth-
erhood penalty" establishes that gender wage gap are small among young workers who
don't have children. In contrast, after having a child, the earnings of mothers stall,
whereas fathers continue climbing the career ladder (e.g., Miller 2011; Adda, Dustmann,
and Stevens 2017; Kleven, Landais, and Søgaard 2019; Kleven et al. 2019; Gallen 2018).
These observations suggest that the unequal division of the burden of childcare between
mothers and fathers is now the primary cause of gender gaps in the labor market.

The second observation is that job flexibility can do much to reduce inequality in the di-
vision of labor between spouses in terms of childcare and other home work. The general
point that workplace flexibility is a particular benefit to women's careers has been ad-
vanced by Goldin and Katz (2011) and Goldin (2014). Regarding telecommuting specif-
ically, Alon et al. (2020a) show that in pre-pandemic data, the ability to telecommute
is strongly predictive of mothers' and fathers' engagement in childcare. For example,
fathers who are able to work from home and are married to mothers who cannot, spend
about 50 percent more hours on childcare compared to otherwise similar fathers who
cannot telecommute.

Taken together, these observations suggest that the expansion of work flexibility brought
about by the pandemic recession may substantially reduce gender inequality in the labor
market in the long term, by allowing a more even division of childcare responsibilities
among the now much larger share of couples who can both work from home, and by
reducing the motherhood penalty that is at the root of today's gender inequality in the
process. Our finding above that there were hardly any gender differences in the impact
of the pandemic among workers who can telecommute is an indication of how powerful
this channel can be.

While this justifies some optimism about gender equality in the future workplace, there

                                           59
is an important caveat. The evidence discussed in Section 6 suggests that among cou-
ples with children who both worked from home during the crisis, women continued to
spend substantially more time on childcare, and their productivity likely suffered as a
result. Even if the effects are not immediately visible, lower productivity at work will
ultimately hinder career advancement and lower mothers' future earnings prospects.
Albanesi and Olivetti (2009) show that expectations of an unequal division of labor in
the household, once established, can be come self-fulfilling and create new barriers in
the labor market. The implications of increased workplace flexibility for gender inequal-
ity are therefore closely linked to what happens to the division of labor inside the home.

Hence, the upshot is that the pandemic is likely to bring about changes in the post-
pandemic workplace that open up the potential for much reduced gender inequality in
the labor market. But for this potential to be realized, changes in the workplace are not
enough; there also needs to be a shift in social norms and expectations that lead mothers
and fathers to make more equal use of the added flexibility that the new workplace
offered. Without such a shift, the strain of failing to do full justice to work, family, and
self-maintenance needs that was shared by many workers during the pandemic will
continue to be the reality of many working mothers in the new normal.


8   Conclusions
In this paper, we have documented that in a large set of countries, the Covid-19 recession
had a much larger impact on women's relative employment compared to pre-pandemic
recessions. One cause of this disproportional impact on working women was the sec-
toral distribution of the recession, which fell heavily on service sectors with high female
employment shares. Another cause was the increase in childcare needs during closures
of schools and daycare centers, which had a bigger impact on mothers' versus fathers'
labor supply. The fact that the pandemic recession was a shecession matters for the
shape of the economic downturn and the recovery. Moreover, the pandemic recession
is also likely to result in permanent changes in the labor market, such as a wider avail-
ability of work-from-home options and other forms of employment flexibility in the
post-pandemic new normal. These changes are likely to result in persistent changes in
women's and men's labor force participation and will shape gender inequalities in the
labor market.

Beyond the employment of women and men, there are additional dimensions which
make the pandemic recession of 2020 distinct from most others, and some of these di-

                                            60
mensions are likely to interact with the issues considered here. One example is the
impact of the pandemic on children's education. Early evidence suggests that virtual
learning during school closures is often a poor substitute for in-person schooling and
that children's skill acquisition will suffer as a result (e.g., Maldonado and De Witte
2020; Kuhfeld et al. 2020). Moreover, a growing literature suggests that school closures
during the pandemic will widen educational inequality across richer and poorer fami-
lies (Grewenig et al. 2020; Andrew et al. 2020b; Fuchs-Schündeln et al. 2020; Agostinelli
et al. 2020; Jang and Yum 2020). If learning losses result in greater need for parental
support in the following years, the impact on children can further amplify the persistent
effect on women's employment documented here. Once again, the ability to work from
home plays a central role, as parents who can work from home have an easier time sup-
porting their children's learning (Agostinelli et al. 2020). Hence, lack of work flexibility
likely had a double-negative effect on many families during the crisis, through the direct
impact on employment and through the repercussions for children's education.

Another likely consequence of the pandemic is a sharp drop in fertility rates (Kearney
and Levine 2020), which is already becoming evident in data on birth rates in late 2020
and early 2021. To some extent, the drop in fertility may reflect a delay in childbearing
that will be compensated by higher fertility in subsequent years, leading to additional
interactions with women's labor supply at that time.

Our analysis has also been limited to a set of high income countries. Many of the con-
ditions that created a disproportionate impact on women's employment in this group
are equally applicable to countries at other stages of development. For example, at the
height of the Covid-19 pandemic schools closed in most countries of the world, making
increased childcare needs during the crisis a near-universal phenomenon. Researchers
have addressed how the optimal response to the pandemic in terms of health policy
should be modified in developing countries (e.g., Alon et al. 2020c) but there is less work
to date on implications for gender inequality in the labor market. Both the short-run im-
pact on and the long-run repercussions for working women are likely to be different in
developing countries compared to the group considered here, for example because of a
bigger role of informal employment and much more limited remote-work opportunities.
Addressing the impact of the global Covid-19 pandemic on the labor market for women
and men in a broad set of countries is an important challenge for future research.
