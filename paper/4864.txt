       This paper proposes a method for computing tax rates using national accounts and revenue

statistics. Using this method we construct time-series of tax rates for large industrial countries.

The method identifies the revenue raised by different taxes at the general government level and

defines aggregate measures of the corresponding tax bases. This method yields estimates of

effective tax rates on factor incomes and consumption consistent with the tax distortions faced

by a representative agent in a general equilibrium framework. These tax rates compare favorably

with existing estimates of marginal tax rates, and highlight important international differences in

tax policy.

I. Introduction

        Public finance and macroeconomic analysis of fiscal policies emphasize the theoretical importance of

distortionary taxation as a determinant of economic decision-making.               However, despite the general

acknowledgement that taxes are powerful policy instruments, the assessment of macroeconomic implications of

alternative tax policies has traditionally been hampered by serious limitations in the measurement of relevant

aggregate lax rates. For instance, tax rates on factor incomes are a key element of the set of incentives and

constraints affecting economic decisions in the intertemporal framework often used in modem fiscal policy

anaiysisj/ Although there have been significant advances in the development of quantitative methods for

studying complex intertemporal models, empirical studies in this area are still lacking reliable measures of actual

aggregate tax rates on factor incomes and consumption. These lax rates are necessary both to develop quantitative

applications of the theory and to help transform the theory into a policymaking tool. Thus, in this coatext, it

seems that the rewards for making progress in the measurement of aggregate tax tales could be considerable.

        The benefits of constructing tax rate estimates usefl for macroeconomic modelling also seem large in

light of important ongoing political debates on the implications of significant fiscal policy changesâ€”such as tax

harmonization and fiscal convergence in the European Union and among G-7 countries, and deficit reduction and

healtb-care and welfare reforms in the United States. There are in addition important debates on the welfare gains

of optimal taxation (see Lucas 1991, Cooley and Hansen 1992, and Mendoza and Tesar 1994). and on business

cycle and growth implications of taxation (see Greenwood and Huffman 1991, and Easteiiy and Rebelo 1993k')

the solutions of which depend critically on a realistic characterization of tax policies.

       The measurement of Lax rates for macroeconomic models has proven to be a difficult task. The large

existing literature on the measurement of marginal income tax rates proposes different strategies to combine

intbrmaiion on statutory tax schedules, tax returns, and tax codes with data on income 'distribution, household

Greenwood and l-luffman (1991), Rthelo (1991) and Baxter and King (1993). See Frenkel and Razin (1987)

for a review of some of this literature.

surveys, and projections of real present values For investment projects in specific industries.2/ However, as

Frenkel, Razin, and Sadka (1991) argue, the complexity of tax credits, exemptions, and deductions that exist in

most countries, as well as the numerous equivalences that link broad categories of taxes, complicate the

construction of effective tax rates useful for macroeconomic modelling. It is also not clear that marginal tax rates

that apply to particular individuals in a household survey, or a specific aggregation of incomes based on tax-

bracket weights, are equivalent to the aggregate tax rates that affect macroeconomic variables as measured in

national accounts. Moreover, time-series and international cross-section applications of existing methods for

computing marginal tax rates are seriously limited by data availability.

        Lucas (1990) and (1991) and Razin and Sadka (1993) have suggested an alternative method that produces

effective tax rates using data on actual tax payments and national accounts. The method takes into account the

effective, overall tax burden resulting from major taxes, and produces measures of tax rates that are consistent

with the concept of aggregate tax rates at the national level and with the representative agent assumption. The

empirical work they conducted suggests that the resulting tax .ates are useful approximations to the taxes that

distori economic decisions in dynamic macroeconomic models.

        This paper proposes an extension of this method to compute time series of effective tax rates on

consumption, capital income, and labor income for C-i countries using information publicly available from the

OECD. The three tax rates are measured as ad-valorem estimates by classifying virtually all forms of tax revenue

at the general government level into one of the three taxes. Each measure of tax revenue is then expressed as

a fraction of a precise estimate of the corresponding tax base. As Razin and Sadka (1993) show, these ad-valorem

tax rates reflect specific (or per-unit) tax rates faced by a representative agent in a general equilibrium framework.

       The main advantage of our method is that is less stringent on data requirements than existing methods

because it exploits the consistency of available international sources on national accounL' and revenue statistics,

and hence is much easier to use to produce time-series and cross-country samples of tax rates. In addition to its

simplicity, our method also achieves simultaneously three objectives: (a) it takes into account the net effect of

existing rules regarding credits, exemptions, and deductions, (b) it separates taxes on labor income from lazes

on capital income, and (c) it incorporates the effects of taxes not filed with individual income tax returns (such

as social security contributions and property taxes) on factor income taxation.      However, our method has the

disadvantage that it does not take into account information on statutory tax rates and income distribution per tax

bracket. To examine the relevance of this simplification, we compare our estimates of tax rates with some

available estimates of marginal tax rates derived in other studies. We find that, despite differences in levels, the

tax rates constructed here are within the range of marginal tax rate estimates and display very similar treads.

       Our estimates of tax rates suggest that there are important differences in the distribution of the tax burden

on consumption, labor income, and capital income between North America, Japan, and large European economies.

Consumption and labor taxes in Japan and the United States are significantly lower than in Canada and the

European countries, while for capital income tax tales the opposite occurs. In all 0-7 countries tax rates on

capital income and consumption fluctuated without trend during the period 1965-88 (except in the case of the

capital income tax raLc in Japan). while labor income tax rates in all countries rose sharply. The cross-country

evidcace shows that countries with higher capital income taxes tend to display lower savings and investment rates.

From a time-series perspective, there is a negative correlation between savings or investment rates and the capital

income tax rate, and between hours worked and labor and consumption taxes.

       The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology and sources used to construct

effective tax rates and compares the resulting tax rates across 0-1 countries. Section 3 compares the effective tax

rates with estimates of marginal tax rates obtained in other studies. Section 4 concludes.

2. A Method for Computing Macroeconomic Measures of Effective Tax Rates

       The concept of a marginal tax rate is very simple in theory, and relatively' easy to quantify at a

microeconomic level. Computing effective marginal tax rates that apply at a national or iaternational level is,

however, Less straightforward for several reasons. First, different taxes result in equivalent effects on observable

variables that could be used to construct tax rate estimates (see Freakel, Razin, and $adka 1991). Second, the

complexity and variety of tax exemptions, deductions, and credits make it difficult to extrapolate the actual tax

burden from information on statutory tax rates. Thini, tax revenue data and the tax system itself do not conform
                                                        -4-

 to the aggregate concepts of a macroeconomic model. Fourth, most available methods for computing aggregate

 marginal tax rates require data on the distribution of income consistent with income tax schedules and returns and

with the schedule of social security contributions. Finally, tax systems often include different forms of taxation

affecting the same tax base--such as individual income taxes levied on wages and social security taxes, both of

which constitute a tax on labor income. At an international level, the situation is complicated further by

diFferences in the structure of tax systems and limitationsof the mformation available on lax revenues and income

distribution (see Easterly and Rebelo 1993a).

        in this section we descn be an alternative approach for computing tax rates for macroeconomic models.

Our methods constructs aggregate effective tax rates based on actual tax payments and national accounts,

following the theoretical foundations proposed by Razin and Sadka (1993) in their study of optimal taxation for

Israel,)! which was in turn based on guidelines suggested by Lucas (1990) and (1991). We then use the method

to compute time senes of tax rates for (1-7 countries covering the period 1965-1988 using data from the OECD's

Revenue Statistics (OECD, 1990) and National Accounts: Volume 11. Detailed Tables (OECD, 199la).

2.! Macroeconomics    of Ad- Valoreni Tax Rates
        Consider an economy with three goods, consumption (c), labor (I), and capital (k).           Households'

consumption allocations of each good are denoted by the vector b=(bc.hl,hk). and government sets exogenous

policies with respect to expenditures in each good, denoted by the vector g=(ggl.g). Firms produce c using

k and I, which are provided by households, and government finances g by levying taxes on consumption, capital

income, and labor income. There are two price vectors; the consumer post-tax price vector p = (Pc'Pl 'Pk) and

the producer pre-tax pnce vector q=(%.ql,q). Tax policy is cbai-acterized by a vector of specific tax rates

t=(tc,tl,tk) per unit oF the respective good. Thus, t=p-q and the corresponding vector of ad-valorem tax rates

is '=c"l'k)' where r=t/q for i=c,l,lc. Since the price vectors p and q are not readity available, it is easier




 / These authors start their analysis by examining the details of the Israeli tax laws, including credits and

exemptions, and the effects of the inflation tax on measures of effective marginal tax rates on capital income

similar to those of King and Fullerton (1984) and Auerbach (1987).

to approximate measures of the tax rates by multiplying Ã§ and q1 limes an appropriate quantity measure, thus

using data on tax revenues and tax bases rather than price data.

       The appropriate quantity measures that should be used can be obtained by examining the households'

budget constrarnt:


                                          phâ€”e-b) qy â€” pL)                                                (1)

In this expression, the vectors e and b represent possible endowments and government transfers of the three

goods, y is the net output vector and pcD represents a lump-sum consumption tax that finances any government

deficit.4/ The net consumption vector to which the specific tax vector t applies is (h-c-b). Note that the net

consumption vector for I is negative and b1=Oâ€”i.e. households supply labor and government cannot make

transfers in units of labor time- Also, y measures net output of the consumption good by the private sector

(y>O)' while yj and y correspond to production inputs &L,Yk<O). It follows from this anangement that q.y

measures profits, which are a pel of households' income.

       The ad-valorem tax rates in this economy are:




                                                    PcYc â€”
                                                    _______                                               (2)

  4/ We base our discussion on a static model. Ruin and Sadka (1993) argue that under certain conditions

the equilibrium of a dynamic economy reduces to the equilibrium of the static economy with private saving

added to current consumption and the government deficit lumped together with taxes.

                                                              â€” (-p*m)
                                             *a                                                                (4)


The numerators in the above equations measure the difference between the pre-tax and pos-tax valuation of

consumption, labor income, and capital income respectively, which can be approximated by measures of tax

revenue derived from each tax. The denominators are measures of consumption and the income derived from

labor and capital valued at pre-tax prices, and thus con-expend to measures of the tax base affected by each tax.

The key issue for the constniction of a reliable estimate of the r vector is! therefore, the determination of

measures of tax revenues and tax bases that reflect closely the corresponding measuies of post-tax and pre-tax

valuations of income and expenditures.

        Note that the method described here, by suggesting the use of data on pre- and post-tax income and prices.

produces aggregate effective tax rates that in fact correspond to realized avenge tax rates. These tax rates

aggregate the information on statutory taxes, credits, deductions, and exemptions implicit in national accounts and

revenue statistics in a maimer that captures the overall tax burden from each tax and maintains consistency with

the representative agent framework.

2.2 Data Sources

       The four-digit codes listed below identify different measures of tax revenue and correspond to the codes

used in the OECD's Revenue Statistics. This publication is extremely useful because it collects information on

tax revenues from country sources and organizes it under a uniform format at the general government level and

on a cash basis. Oilier sources, such as the IMPs Government Finance Statistics are nor adequate because for

several countries data reflect only central government figures, thus ignoring state and local taxes, and correspond

to budget estimates rather than cash receipts.5/ Also listed below are variables obtained from the OECD's

National Accouats Volume II. Detailed Tables which are codified using abbreviations in capitalized letters. The

detailed tables of the OECD National Accounts are consistent with the Revenue Statistics data of the same source.

Of particular importance for the computation of tax rates is the data at the disaggregated level that the National



 5/ This is a shortcoming hard to overcome in multi-country studies including non-OECD countries (see, for

example, Easterly and Rebelo 1993a).
                                                      -7-

Accounts provide on detailed accounts for households, corporate enterprises, and government. The data from

both OECD sources covers the period 1965-1988. The key to variables is:

Revenue Statistia:

1100 = Taxes on income, profits, and capital gains of individuals

1200 = Taxes on income, profits. and capital gains of corporations

2000 = Total social security contributions

2200 = Employer's contribution to social secunty

3000 = Taxes on payroll and workforce

4100 = Recurrent taxes on immovable property

4400 = Taxes on financial and capital transactions

5110 = General taxes on goods and services

5t21      Excise taxes

National Accounts:

C      Private final consumption expenditure

G = Government final consumption expenditure

GW = Compensation of employees paid by producers of government services

OSPUE = Operating surplus of private unincorporated enterprises

PEI = Household's property and entrepreneurial income

W = Wages and salaries

OS = Total operating surplus of the economy

2.3 Effective Tax Rate on Consumption

         Following the principles presented in 2.1, we assume a representative household that purchases an

aggregate consumption good and pays an ad-valorem tax. The consumption tax rate corresponds to the percentage

difference between the post-tax consumer price and the pre-tax price at which firms supply the good. Thus, using

OECI) data, the effective average tax rate on sales of consumption goods r is:
                                                           -8-



                                      r   =[         5110+5121
                                                              1 xlOO.                                              (5)
                                             LC40â€”0W_51l0_5121i
The numerator of this expression is the revenue from indirect taxation, which includes general taxes on goods

and services plus excise taxes6/ The total revenue from indirect taxation is equal, by definition, to the

difference between the nominal value of aggregate consumption at pm-tax and post-tax prices. The denominator

is the base of the consumption tax, which is the pm-tax value of consumption. The latter is measured as post-tax

consumption expenditures minus the revenue from indirect taxation. The formula lakes advantage of the fact that

nominal consumption expenditures in national accounts are at post-tax prices. Government consumption of goods

must be included in the denominator because Revenue Statistics reports data on indirect tax revenue that includes

tans paid by government. However, this only applies to purchases of goods and non-factor services, and hence

the compensation of government employees GW must be deducted from C.

2.4 Effective Tax Rate on Labor Income

        The effective ad-valorem tax on labor income in equation (3) corresponds to the percentage difference

between post- and pre-tax labor income In practice, however, computing this tax rate is difficult because of the

manner in which data on income taxes and other taxes based on labor income are reported. One common

problem, which also affects most computations of aggregate marginal labor income tax rates (as in McKee, Visser

and Saunders 1986, Barro and Sahasakul 1986, and Easterly and Rebelo 1993a), is that tax revenue sources

typically do not provide a breakdown of individual income tax revenue in terms of labor and capital income. This

is due to the fact that tax returns are typically filed to cover all of a tax-payer's income, regardless of its origin.

We address this problem by assuming that all sources of the households' income are taxed at the same rateâ€”an

assumption which according to 1991 statutory tax rates in OECD member countries (see OECI) 1991b) is a good

approximation. Mother issue of concern is the fact that, in addition to the individual incdne lax on wages, there




 / Import and export taxes are excluded without affecting the results because they represent a minimal

fraction of taxes on goods and services in (3-7 countries. However, they should be kept in mind in extending

the method to other countries.
                                                       -9-

are other important taxes on labor income such as social security contributions and payroll taxes that need to be

taken into account (see Bano and Sahasakul 1986).7/

       We begin by computing the households' average tax rate on total income



                                       TA =       [                 1 xtÂ®.                                  (6)
                                                  L05PUEPEI*H'J
Thus, the representative agent's total income tax rate is the ratio of individual income tax revenueâ€”which

represents the difference between post-tn and pre-tax individual incomeâ€”to pm-tn household income. The latter

is defined as the sum of wage and non-wage individual income (i.e. the sum of wages and salaries, property and

entrepreneurial income, and the operating surplus of private unincorporated enterprises).

       We then estimate the revenue from the income tax on wages and salaries as n,W and compute the effective

average tax rate on labor income



                                              [rhw+2c'_o+cool                                               (7)

In addition to the tax on wages and salaries, this calculation incorporates all social security contributions and

payroll taxes as part of the revenue derived from labor income taxes, and expands the tax base to include the

employers' contribution to social securityâ€”since households are not taxed on the portion of compensation to

employees that represents social security contributions by firms.




 7/ We do not consider social security benefits paid to households, which could be viewed as a rebate of

labor income tax revenue. Since these and other net government transfers are large and difficult to relate to a

particular tax, they are best treated not as part of the tax system but of government expenditures.

2.5 Effecrive Tax Rate on Capital Income:

        Continuing under the assumption that all sources of the households' income are taxed uniformly, the tax

rate on capital is constructed by estimating first the revenue from the capital income tax on       individuals as

This formula represents the difference between post-tax and pre-tax capital income divided over pre-tax capital

income as postulaLed in equation (4). The difference between post- and pre-tax capital income includes, in

addition to the households' payments of capital income taxes, the payments of capital income taxes made by

corporations,9/ all recurrent taxes on immovable property paid by households and others, and the revenue from

specific taxes on financial and capital transactions. The pre-tax capital income which serves as the base of the

tax is the operating surplus of the economy as a whole (gross output at producers' values less the sum of

intermediate consumption, compensation of employeesâ€”which is wages and salaries plus employers' contributions

to social securityâ€”, consumption of fixed capital, and indirect taxes reduced by subsidies). Note that this

definition of pre-tax capital income implicitly assumes zero net profits and an aggregate constant-returns-to-scale

technology (set   Ruin and Sadka 1993).

2.6 International Comparisons of Tax Rates

        Time series of the effective tax rates on consumption, labor income, capital income, and corporate capital

income for C-7 countries over the period 1965-1988 are reported in Tables 1-4 and plotted in Figures 2-4. The

tax rates provide some evidence on important differences in tax systems across 0-7 countries. Tax rates have

fluctuated markedly since 1965 in response to both long-term fiscal reforms and short-term policy changes in

statutory taxes, tax credits, deductions and exemptions. Our estimates are also somewhat sensitive to cyclical



 9/ PEI includes dividends, interest, rents, and royalties which are forms of capital income. OSPIJE, in

contrast, may not reflect only capital income if it has implicit small business owners' salaries.

 2/ The average income tax rate on corporate capital can be computed in a similar manner by dividing the

income tax bill of all corporate enterprises over the operating surplus of the corporate sector.

factors and unusual shocks that may affect our measures of tax revenues       and tax bases4Q/ While tax rates on

consumption and capital income appear to be stationary (except for the tax rate on capital income'in Japan). the

tax rate on labor income has followed an increasing trend in all countries.

        Cross-country differences in tax rates, particularly labor income tax rates, narrowed considerably by the

end of our sample period. Nevertheless, as of 1988 there were still marked differences in tax systems. In general,

countries that taxed consumption and labor income more (less), leaded to tax capital income less (more). The

Lax on consumption was significantly lower in Japan and the United States than in the rest of the 0-7 countries.

Turning to labor Income tax rates, the countries in our sample can be divided into three groupsâ€”four countries

with a rate between 26 and 28 percent (Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States), two with a

rate of about 41 percent (Germany and Italy), and France stands apart with a rate of nearly 47 percent. Similarly,

taxes on capital income can be broken down into three groups. The capital income lax was significantly higher

in the United Kingdom and JaÃ´an, at about 57 percent, than in the other countnes.fl/ In Canada and the United

States capital income was taxed at about 40 percent, while in France, Germany, and Italy, that tax rate was

around 25-28 percent. A comparison of Figures 3-4 suggests also that the mix between corporate and individual

capLtal income taxes shifted over time in most countries.




 mi Fluctuations in the U.K. corporate income tax rate an particularly notorious. The sharp increases

following oil-price shocks reflect temporary gains from the petroleum revenue tax and a supplementary

petroleum duty (see OECI) 1990. p. 136). as well as declines in the operating surplus of corporations due to

the recession induced by those shocks. Still, the effective corporate income tax during 1973-1982 was

centered around 52 percent, in line with the statutory General Corporate Tax prevailing at that time.

 flI The fact that the effective capital income tax rate in Japan has increased in a sustained manner since

1965 is interesting in light of the strong growth performance of this country over the saute period.
                                                       -12-

       Table S reports averages of Lax rates for each country and time-series correlations with savings and

investment rates and with an index   of hours worked.LV The avenges of savings and investment rates and the
hours index are also provided for cross-sectional comparisons. These statistics must be interpreted with caution

because some of the series, in particular labor income tax rates, do not appear to be stationary. With regard to

time-series co-movements, the tax rate on capital income is generally negatively correlated with savings and

investment rates, and hours worked are negatively corretated with the sum of labor and consumption tax rates in

all countries except Italy. Cross-country comparisons of mean tax rates confirm most of the differences in the

structure of the tax systems identified earlier in Figures 1-4. Cross-country comparisons also suggest that higher

savings and investment rates tend to be associated with lower capital income tax rates and higher consumption

and labor income taxes coincide with less hours workedâ€”with the exception of Germany.

       Table 6 reports cyctical properties of tax revenues based on the estimated tax rates and using the Hodrick-

Prescott filter. The revenue of all three taxes is more variable than output in each country, and capital income

tax revenue tends to fluctuate more than the revenue from labor income tax and the consumption tax. Revenues

are also generally procyclical. These results suggest that, while our measures of effective tax rates may be

contaminated by business cycle effects, as explained before, the fact that tax revenues and tax bases tend to move

together over the business cycle contributes to reduce that source of error.

3. Comparison with Estimates of Marginal Tax Rates

        The ability of our tax rate estimates to approximate the tax wedges affecting macroeconomic decisions

could be questioned because we do not use information on statutory tax rates and the peculiarities of the tax laws

of each country, nor do we incorporate data on the income distribution according to income tax brackets and the

schedule of social secunty taxes. In this section we examine the implications of these simplifying assumptions

by comparing our results with those obtained in the literature on the computation of aggrate marginal tax flieS,

which makes extensive use of detailed tax information. In general, the alternative methods proposed in this




  12/ Data on national accounts aggregates was obtained from OECD (1991a) and data on hours worked,

which cot-responds to an index of hours worked per employee in the manufacturing sector, was obtained from

Bureau of Labor Statistics (1992).
                                                        -13-

literature are impractical for international analysis given limitations of international data on tax returns and the

complexities of tax systems in different countries. However, estimates of aggregate marginal tax rates are a good

benchmark for evaluating the accuracy of our measures.

3.1 Marginal Tax Rates on Individual Income for the United States

       A number of studies have computed estimates of aggregate marginal individual income tax rates for the

United States, as in Joines (1981), Seater (198S). Bairn and Sahasakul (1986), and Easterly and Rebelo

(1993a).131 These studies compute aggregate marginal lax rates by calculating weighted averages of tax rates,

or tax bills, per tax bracket, using as weights the shares of income oa total income pertaining to each lax bracket.

Most of these studies consider both income tax returns and social security contributions, with the exception of

Easterly and Rebelo (1993a) that due to data limitations abstracted from including social security taxes.

        Seater defines each tax-bracket's marginal lax rate as the ratio of the difference between the tax bill of that

bracket and the lax bill of die previous bracket divided over the difference between the income earned by

individuals in the same two tax brackets. Joines' measure is similar but he adjusts for the number of tax returns

in each bracket and incorporates property, sales, and other proportional taxes. In contrast, Barro and Sahasakul

compute aggregate marginal tax rates by taking a weighted avenge of the statutory tax rates listed in income lax

schedules. Because their analysis is based on statutory taxes, the estimates are biased upwards to the extent that

credits, exemptions, and deductions are not taken into account. Easterly and Rebelo adopt a more eclectic

 approach that combines statutory lax rates with tax returns by computing income-weighted lax rates assuming a

 logistic functional from for the marginal tax schedule and a normal distribution for personal income. However,

 the intense data requirements of this approach limit the coverage to a potnt estimate for 1984.

        All of the studies cited above faced the problem that individual income tax data do not provide a

 breakdown of revenue derived from labor income and from capital income. Seater, Batro and Sabasalcul, and

 Easterly and Rebelo set this problem aside by focusing on tax rates for individuals, without distinguishing between

 capital and labor income. Joines takes a similar approach to the one proposed here by assuming that personal

 income tax rates apply uniformly to capital and labor.




   flI For earlier studies of this issue see Seater (1982), Barro and Sahasakul (1983). and Wright (1969).
                                                        -14-

       Figure 5 plots the available time series for aggregate marginal tax rates on individual income from Joines

(1981), Seater (1985), and Barro and Sabasakul (1986). together with the effective tax rate on labor income

estimated in Section 2 and the two 1984 income tax rate estimates of Easterly and Rebelo (l993a).j4/ The chart

shows that despite methodological differences, which result in differences in the level of the tax rates, the general

trend of the four series is very similar. The Barro-Sahasakul tax rates are the highest because, as noted earlier,

the statutory tax rates they use ignore the information on tax credits and exemptions that estimates based on actual

tax returns capture. The tax rates that Seater estimated using actual tax returns are the lowest, but considering

Joines' adjustments to take into account the number of returns per tax bracket and taxes that tend to be

proportional to income--such as consumption taxes--the outcome is a series on tabor income lax rates that is aot

very different from our effective labor income tax rate. If our measure of the effective consumption tax is added

to our effective labor income tax, the difference with Joines' marginal labor income tax rate series is

negligible.15/ Note also that Easterly and Rebelo's 1984 point estimate of the income tax rate under the

assumption of a zero minimum statutory marginal tax is very close to our estimate of the labor income tax for

that year.

3.2 International Estimates of Marginal Tax Rarer

       We focus now on studies of aggregate marginal tax rates based on international data. These are the study

on capital and labor income taxes in OECD countries by McKee, Visser, and Saunders (1986), the studies on

effective tax rates on marginal investments by King and Fullerton (1984) and OECI) (1991b), and the international

tax rate estimates provided in the studies of taxation and growth by Easterly aad Rebelo (1993a) and (1993b).




 j4/ Easterly and Rebelo (l993a) report two estimates depending on whether the statutory minimum

marginal lax rate is assumed to be zero or set to some figure suggested by the data.

 12/ Joines (1981) also constructed estimates of the (3.5. marginal tax rate on capital income by computing a

weighted avenge of proportional taxes (sales taxes, property taxes, corporate income taxes, and state and

local income taxes) and non-proportional taxes (federal personal income tax). Joints' estimates are slightly

higher than the effective tax rates o capital income reported here, but the two series display similar trends.
                                                        -15-

       The tax rates on labor income consuucted by McKee a aJ. differ 1mm the marginal tax rates discussed

in 3.1 in that they do not represent weighted avenges of tax-bracket data. Instead, McKee et al. based their

calculations on statutory taxes, tax returns, and post- and pre-tax labor income as they would apply in different

countries at the income level ola hypothetical 'Average Production Worker' (APW), which the OECD uses as

a reference for international comparisons.j&/ Their estimates incorporate payroll taxes, social security

contributions, income taxes, and consumption taxes, assuming that individuals do not collect capital incomeâ€”so

that statutory taxes on individual income and individual income tax returns are treated as corresponding to labor

income taxes. Two sets of tax rates are produced, corresponding to APWs that are single workers and APWs

that are single-earner married couples with children, so as to capture differences in credits, exemptions, and

deductions. The estimates are for the years 1979, 1981, and 1983. The limitations of the sample are due to

restrictions imposed by data availability.

       We compare our tax rate estimates with the estimates produced by McKee a al. (1986) in Table 7. On

a country-by-country basis, changes in the labor income tax rates computed by McKee         a al. coincide with the
changes in the effective tax rates computed in Section 2. The ranking of tax rates across countries is also very

similar. Nevertheless, the estimates ol McKee a al. are generally higher than our estimates. This bias reflects

in part the addition of individual capital income tax as part of the labor income tax, and is also an indication of

the relative position of the hypothetical APW in each country's tax schedule and income distribution.

        The international studies on capital income taxation by McKee et. al. (1986) and OECD (1991b) axe based

on a methodology originally developed in the work of King and Fullerton (1984). This method computes rates

of taxation on marginal investments as the percentage difference between post- sad pie-tax net rates of return on

specific investment projects. The pre-tax real rate of return is defined as the value of the marginal rate of return

that equates the expected discounted present value of the future stream of after-tax pmflt of the project with its

cost, net of grants and allowances, and after deducting the rate of depreciation. The procedure requires,

 therefore, that researchers obtain information on the statutory taxes on corporate and individual capital income

 according to ownership institutions, industries, and form of income (Le. interest, dividends, or retained earnings),




   16/ The APW income is the avenge of earnings of production workers in the manafacturing sector.
                                                        -16-

as well as information on application     of taxes, credits, and exemptions according to form of financing and

accounting of depreciation. Moreover, the computation of real internal rates of return also requires assumptions

regarding the expected path of the rate of inflation and the market discount factor.

        The international estimates of capital income lax rates computed by McKee ci al. (1986), OECD (19911,)

and King and Fullerton (1984) illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the King-Fullerton approach. The tax

rates differ significantly depending on the sector to which investment is going, on whether, within each sector,

it is oriented towards equipment. stnsctures or inventories, on whether it is financed by debt, new share issues,

or retained earnings, on whether it is undertaken by firms owned by households subject to personal income taxes

or by tax-exempt institutions, and on the assumed inflation and market discount rates. For instance, McKee a.

al. showed that for the United States in 1983, the tax rate on investments in manufacturing, assuming inflation

fixed at 8.3 percent, varied from -137.8 percent for equipment investments by tax-exempt institutions incurring

in debt to 97.1 percent for ivestments in stnsctures financed by household-owired firms issuing new shares.

Thus, while this methodology provides very accurate measures of the effective marginal tax on specific

investments at the microeconomic level, it is nonetheless difficult to introduce in an aggregate model to produce

the relevant tax rates for explaining macroeconomic phenomena. In addition, the assumptions of perfect-foresight

regarding the future paths of profits and prices seem difficult to integrate with the uncertain environment that

modem macroeconomic models emphasize.

        Easterly and Rebelo (I 993b) constructed four cross-country measures of tax rates in the process of

conducting their empirical analysis of fiscal policies and economic growth. One measure are the income-weighted

marginal tax rates from Easterly and Rebelo (1993a) discussed earlier. The other three measures are (a) avenge

tax rates computed as ratios of tax revenues to rough measures of tax bases, (b) 1984 statutory tax rates from the

study by Sicat and Virmani (1988), and (c) marginal tax rates computed as coefficients ortime-sesies regressions

of tax revenues on tax bases, as in Koester and Kormendi (1989). The first of these three estimates are closest

in spirit to the method proposed in Section 2. The key difference is that in our analysis the different sources of

tax revenue and the corresponding tax bases are clearly isolated. For instance, Easterly and Rebelo consider

either the ratio of total tax revenue from income, profits and capital gains taxes to total ON' or the ratio of total

individual income taxes to personal income, while we separate the revenue derived from taxes on labor income,
                                                          -17-

capital income, and consumption, and measure ad-valorem tax rates by constructing close estimates of pre- and

post-tax measures of factor incomes      and consumption. It is also worth noting that in Easterly and Rebelo's

growth analysis, only two of the measures of tax rates are statistically significant at the 10 percent confidence

level for explaining growth, and one of them is the avenge tax rate measured as the ratio of individual income

taxes to personal incomc.17/

4. Conclusions

         'rhis paper presents a method for computing aggregate effective rates of taxation on consumption and the

income derived from capital and labor based on data from revenue statistics and national income accounts,

Following recent work by Lucas (1990) and (1991) and Razin and Sadka (1993), we construct estimates of the

ad-valoretu tax rates that represent the wedges distorting optimal plans in a macroeconomic, representative agent

setting by companng measures of aggregate post- and pm-tax incomes and prices. The method is used to compute

time series of the three tax rates for G-7 countries covering the period 1965-1988.

         The potential applicability of the resulting tax rates in the design of macroeconomic models of fiscal policy

is examined by comparing the tax rates with several existing estimates obtained in the Literature on aggregate

marginal tax rates. The methods used to date in this literature are often impractical for international analysis

given limitations imposed by data availability and difficulties in dealing with the complexity of actual tax systems.

Nevertheless, the comparison between the effective tax rates computed here and available estimates of aggregate

marginal tax rates shows that the trends of all these tax rates are very similar. Moreover, our measures of

etiective tax rates are within the range of existing estimates of marginal tax rates, and a large fraction of the

difference can be attributed to the treatment of tax credits and exemptions and the treatment of consumption taxes,

and not to the use of income distribution data to compute income-weighted tax rates.

         The tax rates constructed here illustrate important trends and differences in the struÃ¨ture of the tax systems

across industrial countries. While labor, capital, and consumption taxes have fluctuated sharply in response to

changes in statutory taxes and policies regarding credits, exemptions, and deductions, capital and consumption




 fl/ The second measure is the marginal tax rate defined as the coefficient of a regression of total income

taxes   on GDP.
                                                         -18-

taxes have not exhibited a marked trend in general, while the tax on labor income has increased over time in all

C-i countries. The rates of indirect taxation and labor income lax tend lobe higher in European countries relative

to Japan and the United States, while the effective tax rates on capital income in the United States have been

higher than in other large industrial countriesâ€”except the United Kingdom, and in recent years Japan.

Notwithstanding significant differences in tax systems, tax rates have tended to converge for groups of countries

over the last 20 yearsâ€”particularly in the case of consumption taxes in European countries (except France), labor

income taxes in North America, Japan, and the United Kingdom, and capital income taxes in Germany, italy, and

France and in the United States and Canada.

       This paper's aim at providing an accurate, and yet flexible and accessible, method fbr computing aggregate

tax rates is motivated by the fact that the development of quantitative dynamic macroeconomic models of fiscal

policy depends critically on realistic meas-ures   of these tax rates. Existing empirical studies on implications of

tax policy for growth and business cycles based on these models, as in Greenwood and Huffman (1991), Cooley

and Hansen (1992), McGrattan (1994), and Easterly and Rebelo (1993b), are suggestiveof the potential relevance

that reliable estimates of tax rates can have in practice. Directions for further research that could exploit the lax

rate estimates constructed here are therefore numerous. For Stance, Razin and Yuen (1994) examine the

potential for the estimates of capital income tax rates to explain cross-country growth differentials, and Mendoza

and Tesar (1994) quantify the inefficiencies resulting from existing tax systems and the potential welfare gains

of tax reforms in a dynamic model of an integrated world economy.

  Li'  Data are annual observations for the period 1965-1988 (except 1970-
1988 for France and 1980-1988 for Italy), expressed in per capita terms,
logged, and detrended using the Hodrick-Prescott filter with the smoothing
parameter set at 100. Measures of tax revenue were computed using revenue
figures from OECD (1990). Output and revenue figures were deflated using
the private consumption deflator.
