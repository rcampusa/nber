                                                ABSTRACT

Even though formal property rights are the theoretical response to open access involving natural and
environmental resources, they typically are adopted late after considerable waste has been endured.
Instead, the usual response in local, national, and international settings is to rely upon uniform rules
and standards as a means of constraining behavior. While providing some relief, these do not close
the externality and excessive exploitation along unregulated margins continues. As external costs and
resource values rise, there finally is a resort to property rights of some type. Transfers and other concessions
to address distributional concerns affect the ability of the rights arrangement to mitigate open-access
losses. This paper outlines the reasons why this pattern exists and presents three empirical examples
of overfishing, over extraction from oil and gas reservoirs, and excessive air pollution to illustrate
the main points.

           crisis and other regulations have proven inadequate. Even then the
           disputes over initial allocations and other design features of the proposed
           system have gone on for years. In the meantime the situation has gotten
           worse. This has happened in the United States, in Iceland, and in Chile.”2

           “The contrasts between unit operation in southwest Asia and
           “unregulated” operation in the United States are unfavorable to the
           wasteful system followed in developing American fields…It is difficult to
           understand why in the United states, even admitting all obstacles of law
           and tradition, not more than a dozen pools are 100 percent unitized (out of
           some 3,000) and only 185 have even partial unitization.” 3

           “Turning to institutional considerations, the very structure of pollution
           problems promised something less than rapid resolution; there were strong
           incentives to pollute and weak ones at best to achieve control. Policy, of
           course, aggravated these unhappy facts. By its inertia, its allocation of the
           burden of uncertainty, its early reliance on volunteerism, its approach of
           technological feasibility, it invited delay in many ways.” 4

Introduction.

           Despite their attractions for more effectively reducing open-access losses

involving natural and environmental resources, formal property rights typically come late

after considerable waste has been endured. Instead, the first official response, when it

comes, is prescriptive government regulation that calls for uniform rules and standards as

a means of constraining behavior. Only later, when these have proven ineffective to

prevent further external costs and resource values have risen is there a resort to property

rights of some type.5 This paper outlines the theoretical reasons why this pattern exists

and presents three empirical examples of overfishing, over extraction from oil and gas

reservoirs, and excessive air pollution to illustrate the main points. The paper is not

advocating the assignment of property rights as the only institutional response to the

wastes of over access, but rather is describing why delay is a common feature in the

assignment property rights.

         The key argument is that early, formal property rights involve high resource and

political costs relative to their expected gains. They have formidable information and

input requirements in allocation, measurement, bounding, and enforcement, and they

have substantial distributive effects when there is too much uncertainty as to how these

might impact key constituencies. Hence, there is delay in the assignment of property

rights to address open access. In this context, delay implies an optimal time for shifting

regimes, from open access to uniform regulation to property rights. During this period of

transition asset rents are dissipated, but enduring these losses does not imply inefficiency

when the resource costs of developing the institutional response (regulation, property

rights) are considered. As outlined below, a focus solely on rent dissipation in

determining the optimal timing of response is incomplete without incorporating the




5
  There are exceptions when the resource is of very high value, information costs regarding the problem are
low, and rights can be relatively easily assigned. Consider gold and silver and other hard rock minerals. For
Discussion see Gary D. Libecap, 2007, “The Assignment of Property Rights on the Western Frontier:
Lessons for Contemporary Environmental and Resource Policy,” Journal of Economic History, 67(2): 257-
291, especially 266-271. When these conditions are not met, however, the general processes of delay and
inertia are characteristic. Throughout this discussion I am referring to formal regulation and property rights
rather than informal norms and customs that can be adopted under certain circumstances to address
common pool resources (CPR). More generally, see Elinor Ostrom, 1990, Governing the Commons: The
Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action, New York: Cambridge University Press for discussion of
local responses to open-access losses.

transaction costs of collective action within groups, within the political arena, and across

countries.6

        When the value of the resource or the cost of the externality is relatively low,

prescriptive regulation to limit exploitation through uniform restrictions can be cost

effective and politically acceptable. Information demands are limited to the setting and

administering general rules and standards; it does not involve obvious redistribution; and

reliance upon standardized regulations reduces uncertainty regarding the impact on

constituencies. The various parties involved can predict how they might be affected and

their current political and wealth standings are unlikely to be importantly altered. At the

same time, however, these policies incompletely address the externality, leaving many

margins for rent dissipation unconstrained.

        Over time as the externality becomes more serious, information is generated about

the benefits and costs of property rights in confronting it; information asymmetries are

reduced; and overall uncertainty is diminished. At that point more parties see that they

will be made better off, and it becomes more economically rational and politically

feasible to adopt property rights.

        Property rights are relevant because they address the externality directly and link

individual incentives with social objectives for resource use. But they are adopted only

when their costs are offset by the aggregate rents that are saved from over exploitation.

Since these transaction costs can be considerable, the value of the resource and the nature

of uncertainty determine the optimal time for introducing formal property rights. Crises

that suddenly and sharply raise benefits and lower uncertainty speed this process.7 Crises

are events or spikes that dramatically raise the wastes associated with open access and at

the same time lower the transaction costs of collective action by providing new

information about the benefits of institutional change to combat the problem.

II. The Problem of Open Access.

         Too much air pollution, over fishing and depletion of stocks, too rapid withdrawal

from subsurface oil and gas reservoirs or water from aquifers are all examples of “The

Tragedy of the Commons”.8 The tragedy occurs because there are no clear property rights

(informal or formal, group or individual) to the resource and open access prevails. As a

result, individuals do not bear the full costs of their actions so that excess and waste are

the result. Aggregate short-term production or use levels are too high and investment is

too low. The parties inflict harm on one another with costly technological and pecuniary

externalities. In anticipation of these spillovers, there can be competitive rush to exploit

the resource. Because exchange is not possible within large groups in the absence of

property rights, the parties cannot bargain with one another to constrain behavior or to re-

and by Steven Cheung, 1970, “The Structure of a Contract and the Theory of a Non-Exclusive Resource,”

allocate the resource to higher-valued uses currently or across time.9 There are no price

signals to reveal opportunity costs and free riding is rampant. Valuable labor and capital

inputs are diverted from productive use to predation and defense.10 Conflict and violence

are potential outcomes.

        These wastes can be large, and the social savings from avoiding them provide the

incentives for collective action to secure more official group or government regulation of

access and resource use or to assign property rights for private restrictions on behavior. In

the following section, a framework is presented to describe the collective action problem

in bargaining within groups and across groups to address the tragedy of the commons.

III. Analytical Framework.

     A. Bargaining within Groups.

        In collective action negotiations, each party determines whether or not to

participate by comparing their current welfare situation with what is forecast through

group efforts. If individual expected net gains are positive, the parties will chose to take

action with the group. These net gains are a function of the predicted aggregate benefits

and costs of eliminating the externality and their proposed distribution among group

members. The greater the uncertainty associated with cost and benefit calculations, the

lower the anticipated returns. The benefits of group efforts also depend upon monitoring

and enforcement. If monitoring and enforcement costs are so high that free riding is

9
 Bargaining of the kind discussed by Ronald Coase, 1960, “The Problem of Social Cost,” Journal of Law
and Economics 3: 1–44 is not possible.

prevalent, then the advantages of collective action are reduced. Indeed, as in cartels,

widespread defection or failure to comply among members can lead to an unraveling of

any arrangement to mitigate the losses of open access.11

         Collective action is promoted if the number of parties is small; if they are similar

in the expected net gains of agreement; if there is little uncertainty regarding the size and

distribution of costs and benefits (information, measurement, bounding, and compliance

costs are small); and if the aggregate gains of taking action are large relative to the costs.

These are the conditions that characterize successful efforts among relatively

homogeneous, small groups as described by Elinor Ostrom.12

         Important deviations from these criteria, however, hinder group efforts. If

aggregate net gains are limited (the common resource is of low value and/or the

transaction costs of addressing the problem are high), there are few incentives for action

until values increase or costs fall. As group size grows, bargaining and compliance costs

rise. If the aggregate benefit is a public good (high bounding costs) whereas the costs of

taking action are private, free riding and defection are encouraged.

         High information costs lead to uncertainty in calculating aggregate net gains and

their distribution, and hence, in estimating how individuals will fare from group action. If

32, 431lists the conditions necessary for self-governance of common pool resources to include clearly
defined boundaries; the distribution of benefits is roughly proportionate to costs and appropriation rules are
consistent with local conditions; affected individuals can participate; monitors are accountable to
appropriators; there are graduated sanctions; appropriators have access to low cost, local arenas for
resolution of conflicts; the right to organize are not challenged by governmental authorities; and there are
nested enterprises for appropriation, provision, monitoring, enforcement, conflict resolution, and
governance.



                                                      7
the uncertainty is uniformly distributed across members, agreement on measures to be

taken can still be reached. But asymmetric information and related differences in

publicly-available and privately-held information about costs or benefits result in

divergent views of the overall advantages of addressing the externality and sharing the

resulting net returns.

        Collective action, which has not possible early, can become more practical after

delay as transaction costs fall. New information emerges regarding the severity of the

problem, reducing uncertainty and measurement costs and eliminating information

asymmetries; the resource becomes more valuable (perhaps due to greater depletion),

raising the benefits of action; new technology or techniques are developed to lower the

costs of closing the externality; and the number of parties declines as the private returns

to exploitation fall. At this point, distributional concerns become subordinate to the

overall need to respond to open access, and group efforts follow.

     B. State Action: Political Bargaining Across Constituencies.

        If the open-access problem is larger, spreading across multiple groups or

constituencies, then its resolution requires broader government involvement and the

efforts of politicians. When there are numerous constituencies who are affected

differently by the problem and the costs of its resolution, politicians must balance

constituent interests in a manner described by Sam Peltzman and Gary Becker so as to

maximize political support for taking action.13 In so doing, politicians face the same

problems encountered in the group negotiations outlined above.

                                                  8
       When constituencies are heterogeneous in the net gains of collective action,

politicians must devise side payments from high gainers to those who expect to do less

well in order to build a political consensus. They seek transfers that minimize political

opposition and risk, but these can be controversial among general taxpayers if they seem

to be too obvious and unfairly rewarding particular groups. Camouflaging transfers,

linking them to popular public goods, and tying them to broad distributional norms

reduce the political costs of transfers to politicians. Their design, however, may lower the

overall effectiveness of the government regulation of the externality. Uncertainty in

predicting aggregate costs and benefits and their distribution across constituencies

complicates the crafting of side payments by encouraging disputes over the size, nature

and direction of compensation, and these disputes increase political risk and reduce the

expected benefits to politicians of deal making to address the externality.

       As a result, politicians select policies that lower uncertainty and raise expected net

gains for key constituents. These include postponing any action; encouraging research in

information about the externality; promoting new technology that lowers costs; investing

in resource stock enhancement, including restricting access by non citizens or other

politically-weak groups; and adopting standardized regulations that reduce the externality

while appearing to be neutral and not changing the existing distribution of wealth and

political power.

       The assignment of property rights to address open access entails more hazards to

politicians. They are turned to only if general regulation fails to adequately remedy the

problem and if the benefits of a rights system are clear enough to reward politicians and

to offset political reaction. They entail the most direct and transparent assignment of




                                             9
benefits and costs, as well as require more costly allocation, bounding, and enforcement

policies.14 Any property right that has meaning involves exclusion, potentially raising

distributional conflicts. Further, the resource may rebound if open-access losses are

reduced and become more valuable so that ownership brings new wealth, status, and

political influence to those who secure property rights, changing existing social and

political positions and inciting controversy that can be costly to politicians. Finally,

constituencies that benefited from the previous regulatory arrangement are likely to be

disadvantaged by the new rights system. Inefficiencies generate their own constituencies

for keeping things as they are.15

           To build political support, politicians mold the assignment of property rights in a

manner that achieves other distributional objectives or meets the demands of those who

claim to be harmed. These adjustments also weaken the ability of the rights regime to

reduce the losses of open access.

           The arguments outlined here regarding the government response to open access
                                                            16
are similar to those described by Krier and Ursin. They listed six themes associated

with government environmental policies: 1). Politicians (and agency officials) adopt

regulations that take the path of least resistance; that they are reactive, rather than

precautionary in order to garner political support for regulation and to minimize the

political risk of adopting inappropriate or extremely costly policies. 2). Politicians place

14
  As pointed out by Thomas Merrill, the nature of the ex ante allocation rule affects the costs of assigning
property rights. For example, assignment of rights where possible by accession (tying rights to the
ownership of related resources) could be less costly than reliance upon first possession where documenting
past use is required and where there is the potential for dissipation due to a race to document previous use.

the burden of uncertainty on those parties seeking policy change. Since new regulations

potentially impose vague costs on other constituencies, politicians insure that proposed

standards and other controls are based on reliable data through additional research. 3).

Political action follows crises that clarify the benefits of new policies through the

generation of additional information and a broader sense of immediacy among citizens.

4). Politicians rely on technological solutions, rather than more fundamental programs to

change citizen behavior, which can be controversial with costs spread unevenly. Since

technology mandates can be applied uniformly, they appear to maintain existing

distributions of wealth and political support and avoid divisive distributional issues,

especially in the design of transfer payment schemes. 5). Politicians take action only

after research and learning reveal what is most likely to work, lowering uncertainty and

the costs imposed on constituents. 6). There is a lag or a seemingly “unwarranted delay in

government resolution of a social problem.”

     C. Bargaining Across States.

        When environmental and natural resource externality problems cross political

boundaries as in the case of green house gas (GHG) emissions and wild ocean fisheries,

the bargaining to address them occurs among politicians as representatives of various

national constituencies. The same information and uncertainty problems and public

choice considerations described above apply in these negotiations. They are more severe

because of greater information problems, more heterogeneity, and higher monitoring and

enforcement costs among the jurisdictions affected.17


17
   For discussion of the transactions costs of cross-country bargaining, see Beth V. Yarborough and Robert
M. Yarborough, 1994, “International Contracting and Territorial Control: The Boundary Question,” Journal
of Institutional and Theoretical Economics, 150 (1) 239-264 and James K. Sebenius, 1984, Negotiating the
Law of the Sea, Cambridge: Harvard University Press.


                                                   11
       In international negotiations toward resolution of an open-access resource

problem, the expected benefit that a country derives is the sum of both the net gains

resulting from international actions, plus any transfer payments that it receives (or

provides). No national politician will seek the support of his or her constituents unless the

country’s expected net benefits exceed the cost of no agreement.

       If the underlying constituencies in a country are very heterogeneous with respect

to support for international efforts, then the politician representing them has to balance

international demands with differential constituent costs and benefits to maximize

internal political support. As noted above, this requirement poses a formidable public-

choice problem, and it is more complicated if there is important uncertainty about the net

benefits of international efforts. The benefit that any internal group derives from a

particular international effort depends on its outcome. Incomplete and imprecise

information about the effects of international actions, the costs involved, and compliance

generate uncertainty about the potential results of collective action.

       If uncertainty is widespread across countries, international efforts are unlikely. If

countries vary in their expected returns, however, there is an opportunity to devise

transfers to gain support. As in national negotiations, devising transfers is complex

because of differing views on the appropriateness, size, form, direction, and timing of

side payments. Additionally, there are greater problems of enforcing compliance by

member states.

       For these reasons, just as in the national political arena, politicians have incentives

to delay action until the open-access problem becomes serious enough to generate the




                                             12
information needed to make the distribution of the benefits and costs across countries and

across constituencies within them clearer. At that time politicians are better able to

mobilize political support for international action that entails both costly production

adjustments as well as paying (or receiving) internal and external transfers to garner

collective efforts.

        All told, in group, national, and international actions to reduce the losses of open

access, the incentives seem clear. The parties involved are more likely to reach agreement

when uncertainty is reduced, when differences in expected costs and benefits across

constituencies are narrowed, and when the aggregate benefits of collective efforts

(reduced resource rent dissipation from open-access externalities) exceed the transaction

costs involved. These points suggest that there will be widely differing views regarding

the extent of early open-access problems and the importance of confronting them. These

conditions encourage group members and politicians to wait. When action is taken, it will

involve general rules, regulations, and standards that involve the fewest costs and

information demands and raise the least allocation concerns.18 These acts will be

insufficient so that the problem will intensify. Only then, will formal property rights be

implemented, and their success in attacking the externality will depend upon how

distribution demands were overcome in their design and allocation.

IV. Application: Fisheries.

     A. Fisheries:

        Wild ocean fisheries are a classic open-access resource. With virtually unlimited

entry and growing harvest pressures, the result has been depleted stocks, falling catch-

per-unit-of-effort, declining incomes, and over capitalization. These conditions follow

from the high and growing value of fish as a source of protein, the fugitive nature of most

species, the great migratory distances involved, overlapping or absent political

jurisdictions, the absence of property rights, and large numbers of heterogeneous,

competing fishers.19

        The implications of open access have been understood for a very long time—

certainly by fishers themselves and by pioneering students of the problem, such as Scott

Gordon, Anthony Scott, and Vernon Smith.20 Nevertheless, in 2000, Quinton Grafton,

Dale Squires, and Kevin Fox described the continuing dramatic wastes of over fishing

and inappropriate regulation in the Pacific Northwest halibut fishery; in 2003, Ransom

Myers and Boris Worm warned that the world’s major predatory fish populations were in

a state of serious depletion; and in 2006, Jennifer Devine, Krista Baker, and Richard

Haedrich provided a similar dire assessment for other deep-sea fisheries.21

        The first government reaction to open access has been implementation of uniform

restrictions on access and fishing effort, which minimize information requirements and

avoid significant deliberate changes in status quo economic and political rankings among

the parties involved. Uniform regulations, however, are unlikely to be fully effective

because they do not align the incentives of the parties with the objectives of reduced

harvest and conservation of the stock. Accordingly, if the fishery is sufficiently valuable,

at some point there has been a turn to property rights of some type. But these have come

late, only after the stock has collapsed and declining returns have made existing practices

untenable. Even then, conflict of over the nature of the rights to be granted and their

allocation has slowed adoption of a rights regime, constrained the privileges assigned,

and limited the overall benefits obtained.

        Rognvaldur Hannesson, Ragnar Arnason, and Ross Shotton, among others,

outline a common process of open-access losses, delayed regulation, and finally, a

limited adoption of individual transferable quotas (ITQ’s) or individual vessel quotas

(IVQ’s).22 Further, Ronald Johnson and Gary Libecap describe the contracting problem

among fishers, who differ in skill and returns under both open access and regulation.

  ITQ’s are the most widely applied form of property right in fisheries (Hannesson, 2004, 56). See also

These heterogeneities determine the kinds of regulations that can be agreed to and limit

their timely adoption.23

           For migratory offshore fisheries, the closing of the commons required the

existence of political jurisdictions and/or international agreements on fishing

restrictions.24 This began with the establishment of 200-mile exclusive economic zones

(EEZ’s) by coastal states, but it did not occur until the 1970s following the Law of the

Sea negotiations. For instance, Iceland staked its claims in 1975; the U.S. Congress did so

in 1974, followed by Presidential Proclamation in 1983; and Canada acted in 1977.25

These national ocean claims, however, were not made part of international law until

1994. There was nothing biologically or environmentally significant with 200-mile zones

in fisheries, beyond which many stocks migrate. Efforts in 1993 to extend them to more

effectively address over-harvest in the open seas under the UN Conference on Straddling

Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks failed due to disputes among coastal states over

the size of allotments. An international agreement was reached in 1995, but it did not

extend the exclusive zones, rather it avoided the issue by vesting management in regional

fisheries’ organizations that lacked any real enforcement power.26

           The 200-mile limit, however, made regulation possible within it, and by the 1970s

important, valuable fisheries were already seriously over exploited. Among these were

the British Columbia salmon fishery, the North East Atlantic, Icelandic, and North Sea

Herring fisheries, and the Norwegian cod fishery.27 In response to these conditions, ITQ’s

were suggested by fishery economist Francis Christy in 1973 as a means of raising

fishing incomes and of motivating fishers to conserve stocks.28

           The response to over harvest, however, was not the assignment of property rights,

but rather the adoption of generalized season, vessel, and equipment controls. With

diverse interests, ranging from inshore and offshore fishers, large and small boat owners,

fishers from different locales, sports and commercial fishers, processors, equipment

sellers, labor groups, and regulatory officials, there could be agreement only on

standardized rules and not on the more difficult task of assigning and monitoring

individual property rights.29 Indeed, fishers and government officials had incentives to

adopt visible, yield-enhancing restrictions that seemed to benefit all parties as a public

good and to avoid policies that would more directly and transparently allocate fishing

rents to specific individuals or groups. In this process, fishers were uncertain how they

might fare in a property rights allocation, relative to their expected returns under more

certain uniform rules.30

     Hannesson (2004, 69-71, 103, 116-117).
28
     Hannesson (2004, 71).
29
   Hannesson (2004, 172) stated: “More typically, ITQs have been put in place after a fishery has reached a
crisis and other regulations have proven inadequate. Even then the disputes over initial allocations and
other design features of the proposed system have gone on for years. In the meantime the situation has
gotten worse. This has happened in the United States, in Iceland, and in Chile.”
30
 These arguments are outlined by Johnson and Libecap (1982) and illustrated with regard to the Gulf
Coast Shrimp Fishery.


                                                    17
           Unfortunately, while attractive for technological and distributive reasons, these

regulations did not successfully address open access. Non-citizens were excluded or

given only very narrow access privileges, and this action alone provided short-term gains

to the countries that implemented controls. But nationals were allowed to expand their

fleets to fill the void, and they did so. Domestic fleets were subject to season constraints

and equipment controls, such as vessel licenses to limit the total number in the fishery

and minimum net sizes to release adolescent fish.31

           Nevertheless, boat capitalization increased, stocks plummeted, and fishing

seasons were shortened drastically. For example, in the British Columbia halibut fishery,

when regulation began in 1980, total capacity was set 435 vessels, and new entry to meet

that target was rapid, with the number of vessels rising by 31 percent within 9 years.

Increased fishing pressure, however, brought a fall in the stock, and regulators gradually

reduced the season from 65 days to 6 days by 1990. The shortened season led to further

investment by fishers in larger and more powerful vessels and a competitive fishing

derby to harvest as many fish as possible in the limited time available. Harvests had to be

processed and frozen, and more valuable fresh halibut were not available for market after

the season closed. In response to these conditions, IVQ’s were adopted in 1991.32 After

that, the number of vessels fell as quotas were purchased and consolidated and the season

was expanded to 245 days by 1993 as stocks rebounded. With longer seasons fresh

halibut again could be offered for most of the year.33

           Similar problems with uniform regulation occurred in other fisheries. In the 1970s

the Alaska halibut and sablefish season was over 100 days annually, but by 1995 (just

before adoption of the ITQ’s) it had dropped to 2-3 days.34 Additionally, the Canadian

sablefish season shrank from 245 days in1981 to 14 days in 1989; the fishery was closed

in 1995 and reopened with tighter restrictions in 1996.35

           Although centralized regulation in fisheries generally has not been successful in

protecting, let alone re-establishing stocks, ITQ’s and IVQ’s have been adopted only after

crises when stocks have crumbled. This pattern is not only found in the halibut fisheries

described above but also in the Canadian West Coast salmon fishery, the Newfoundland

and Iceland cod fisheries, and others.36

           Under ITQ’s and IVQ’s, regulators set the total annual allowable catch based on

assembled biological information, anticipated environmental conditions, and expected

harvest impacts. Each authorized fisher or vessel is granted a share in the annual catch

based on the allocation rule, and the quotas generally can be traded, although with

varying restrictions. The most common allocation rule is first-possession or historical

catch. Past investment in vessels and equipment also often is taken into account.37 The

advantage of ITQ’s is that they better align the harvest practices of fishers with practices

that protect or enhance the stock. The value of their quotas, which often can be major

sources of wealth, depends upon the long-term health of the stock.38 Hence, there are

incentives for self and group monitoring of compliance, and importantly, ITQ’s, as a

property right, are the basis for further contracting among fishers to reduce fishing

pressure.

           These advantages depend upon the strength of the property right, and this varies

across countries. ITQ’s in the U.S. and Canada are clearly specified as being use

privileges and not property rights, revocable without compensation. By contrast in

Iceland, New Zealand, and Australia, ITQ’s are considered to be more secure property

rights.39 These differences in the nature of property rights follow from controversies over

allocation and how some parties might fare under an unrestricted market system.

Distribution concerns have resulted in various constraints on ITQ’s, and they are most

severe in countries where fishing is a tiny portion of GNP, such as the U.S.40 In the U.S.

with its relatively few ITQ systems, there has been an effort to preserve the relative

position of regions, communities, fleets, capital, and crew by limiting the assignment and

trading of ITQ’s.41 Some U.S. ITQs are reserved for community development and not

granted to individuals. There also are formal limits on the size of individual quota

holdings and their transferability. In the Alaska halibut fishery, for example, only

transfers from larger to smaller vessel classes are permitted, and no individual is allowed

to own more than 0.5 percent of the total quota. There are other controls on share

consolidation to limit holdings and to maintain a targeted number of vessels in the halibut

fleet.42 Further, in 1996 the Magnuson Act placed a four-year moratorium on the

adoption of further ITQ’s in U.S. fisheries.43 .

       B. Oil and Gas Extraction.

           As with wild ocean fisheries, oil and natural deposits that lie under private lands

in the U.S. are open-access resources. They are lodged in subsurface reservoirs under

great pressure. When any part of the surrounding geologic formation is punctured by a

well bore, a low-pressure area is created. Natural gas and oil migrate rapidly toward the

opening. Migration potentially allows adjacent landowners to extract their neighbor’s oil.

Movement depends upon subsurface pressures, oil viscosity, and the porosity of the

surrounding rock.

           Because of the fugitive nature of subterranean oil and gas, in situ property rights

are not assigned to surface land owners, as is done with fixed subsurface mineral

resources, but instead are granted only upon extraction or capture, as is done with wild

animals (minerals ferae naturae).44 This ownership rule creates conditions for

competitive withdrawal. Owners lease exploration and production rights to oil and gas

firms, and these firms have incentives to drill and drain to increase their shares of oil field

rents, even though these individual actions lead to aggregate open-access losses.

           Rents are dissipated as capital costs are driven up with the drilling of excessive

numbers of wells (more than geologic conditions require or price and interest rate

projections warrant) and with the construction of surface storage, where the oil can be

held safe from drainage by other firms. Unfortunately, once in surface storage, oil is

vulnerable to fire, evaporation, and spoiling. Rapid extraction also increases production

costs as subsurface pressures are vented prematurely, forcing the early adoption of pumps

and injection wells. Total oil recovery falls as pressures decline because oil becomes

trapped in surrounding formations, retrievable only at very high extraction costs. Finally,

rents are dissipated as production patterns diverge from those that would maximize the

value of output over time.

           The problem of competitive withdrawal was recognized when oil was first

discovered in the United States in 1859. The nature and extent of the externalities

involved, however, were not well enough understood to attempt coordinated strategies to

constrain them.45 By the early twentieth century, however, the economic value of oil was

high enough to raise concern about waste. For example, in 1910, it was estimated that up

to 11 percent of California's (a major producing state) annual oil output was lost owing to

fire while in surface storage. In 1914, the director of the Bureau of Mines estimated that

the costs of excessive wells equaled about a quarter of the value of total annual U.S. oil

production.46 Oil recovery was estimated at only 10-20 percent of the total resource in

place, but in many cases, it would have been much less than this overall average.47

           These losses stimulated scientific research on subsurface reservoir mechanics and

on how production practices could affect over all recovery.48With this knowledge, there

was a basis for negotiations among private parties to reduce the losses of open-access.

Buyouts of all, but one party on a reservoir to place it under single ownership or

unitization for cooperative production were the most complete solutions. Neither was

widespread. As a result, as with fisheries, initial formal efforts to address open-access

turned to state regulation, but this too did not arrive until comparatively late, in the 1920s

and 1930s.49

           State regulation focused on limiting the drilling of wells and the extraction of oil

and gas from them. The Texas Railroad Commission and other state regulatory agencies

set monthly statewide production levels and allocated the total among regulated wells as

quotas under a system termed prorationing. These production rules were applied

uniformly to all oil fields, even though each field had a unique physical configuration and

optimum production potential.

           Regulation was controversial, especially among the very numerous small firms

(independents) that had adapted to open access and produced more than their share of

field deposits would warrant. Large firms (majors) tended to be the proponents of state

intervention because they bore more of the field-wide losses of competitive extraction.

To elicit the political support of small firm owners and oil-field equipment suppliers for

regulation, they were granted preferential treatment. These privileges were a (costly)

form of transfer payment, but were less transparent and more politically feasible than

were outright cash payments.50

           For example, individual well quotas, or allowables, were based on acreage and

depth, but the Commission gave more weight to depth, encouraging oil firms with limited

leased acreage to drill deeper. Minimum spacing rules were adopted to limit overall

drilling, but the Commission also routinely granted exemptions to small firms. Further, in

Texas, the large numbers of very high-cost wells (stripper wells) were exempted from

any production controls. The costs of these uniform prorationing regulations and

exemptions were criticized. By the early 1960s, energy economist M.A. Adelman

estimated that they were substantial, probably exceeding $2 billion per year.51 State

regulation of well spacing and well production rates was able to reduce some of the

losses of open-access.

           Nevertheless, dissatisfaction with state regulation led larger oil and natural gas

firms to consider either private collective action through buyouts or unitization of fields.

Unitization was the preferred solution for many firms because it maintained their lease

ownership in the field at a time of considerable uncertainty about long-term lease values

that prevented agreement on sales prices. But lease valuation problems also hindered unit

agreements.52

        With unitization production rights are delegated through negotiation to a single

firm, the unit operator, with net revenues apportioned among all parties on the field

(including those that would otherwise be producing). As the only producer on the field

and a residual profit claimant, the unit operator has incentive to maximize field rents.

Accordingly, unitization results in important economic gains: a time stream of output that

more closely approximates the rent-maximizing pattern, increased oil recovery, and

reduced wells and other capital costs.

        Unit agreements, especially during primary production when natural subsurface

pressures could force oil to the surface, however, were very difficult to complete.

Unitization during secondary recovery was easier because of existing coordination among

producers for injecting water, gas, or other fluids to push oil out of the ground. Otherwise

field output would plummet. Accordingly, secondary recovery and unit agreements could

be written jointly, but the losses of competitive production during primary recovery

remained.

        The key issue of contention in these collective efforts is the allocation of shares of

the net proceeds of unit production.53 These shares are property rights to the unit rents

and are based on estimated pre-unit lease values. Contingent updates are not possible

because once the unit is formed individual leases lose their meaning and reservoir

production dynamics change.54 The bargaining problem arises due to disagreement on

lease values.

        Lease values are based on current and cumulative oil and gas production, the

estimated size of the deposit below them, predicted oil migration and viscosity, the

porosity of the surrounding medium, and other environmental factors. Assessing these

and calculating lease value involves subjective guesswork, and the process is contentious.

Firms have private information that may be difficult to credibly convey to other parties.

Public information, such as past production and surface acreage, can be poor indicators of

lease value. The problems are greatest for small, strategically-located leases with most

production potential, longest expected life, and hence, greatest long-term uncertainty. As

fields age and primary production wanes, many leases become unproductive and others

have short futures unless secondary injection begins. Accordingly, at those times, private

and public information about lease characteristics converge and unit agreement is more

feasible.

        As a result of conflicts over allocation, unit agreements can take a very long time

to negotiate or they breakdown and result in incomplete units that cover only part of a

field. In their detailed analysis of seven units in Texas and New Mexico, Steven Wiggins

and Gary Libecap found that they required from four to nine years from the time

described the nature of a complete unit contract.

negotiations began until agreements could be reached. Moreover, in five of the seven

cases the acreage in the final unit was less than that involved in the early negotiations.

With incomplete units, part of the reservoir remained open-access or was organized into

competitive subunits with significant losses.55

           The problems of negotiation are more difficult for reservoirs that involve mixtures

of oil and natural gas. Differences in price volatility for the two substances make it

difficult to agree upon conversion factors. Such reservoirs are frequent since 63 percent

of the largest U.S. oil fields contained significant volumes of natural gas along with oil.56

Oil lease owners prefer to re-inject gas into the formation to expel the oil, whereas gas

lease owners prefer to sell their gas.

           The huge Prudhoe Bay field is a case in point.57 It was discovered in 1968, and

unit negotiations took over eight years. Even then, the field was not effectively unitized,

but rather was partitioned into two (competing) units or participating areas, one for oil,

led by British Petroleum (BP) and one for gas, led by Atlantic Richfield (ARCO).

Conflicts between the firms continued because of their differential production incentives.

The original unit agreement was significantly amended on at least seven occasions during

the 1980s and 1990s as disputes were settled on a piecemeal basis. By 1988, Prudhoe Bay

production began to decline, not because of physical depletion of the underlying oil

deposit but because of disagreement about which parties would pay for the facilities

required to handle the rising volume of gas that was produced along with oil as the field

matured. Finally in 1999, BP purchased ARCO and effectively unitized the field, 31

years after discovery.

           To promote unitization, states have intervened with compulsory or forced

unitization statutes.58 These statutes relaxed the unanimity voting rule on share

allocations. In Oklahoma, compulsory unitization legislation was enacted in 1945. It

stated that once 85 percent of the leases approved unitization, the remainder could be

forced to join.59 Small firms resisted the new law, challenged it in court, and attempted

repeal in 1947. By 1951, however, opposition to compulsory unitization in Oklahoma

was largely spent, and the original law was amended with little controversy to lower the

required majority from 85 to 63 percent.60 In Texas, however, small firms resisted the

loss of the regulatory advantages afforded them through the state's prorationing

regulation, and because of their large number and political influence, Texas was never

able to adopt a compulsory unitization law.61 Between the late 1940s and the 1960s, all

other oil-producing states adopted some form of forced unitization law to facilitate unit

formation. Not surprisingly, Texas has had a lower share of production from fully-

unitized fields than does other states. It also has had more high-cost producers than other

states. For instance, Libecap and Wiggins reported that as late as 1975 only 38 percent of

Oklahoma production and 20 percent of Texas production came from complete, field-

wide units.62

        Accordingly, the pattern of responding to open access in oil and gas reservoirs is

similar to that which occurred in fisheries. Tolerance of open access until the costs

became large compared to expected benefits of minimally addressing it; adoption of

uniform production rules, molded by political factors; finally, resort to property rights, in

this case through buyout or field unitization. Uncertainty in estimates of how the parties

would fare under new regulations or property rights regimes, relative to the status quo,

delayed action. Even then, the extent and form of the side payments necessary to meet

distributional and political demands, limited the effectiveness of the regulations and

unitization (rights) arrangements that were possible.

     C. Air Pollution.

        Excessive air pollution also is an open-access problem. Emissions arise from

manufacturing plants, utilities, vehicle exhaust, as well as a myriad of other sources that

are part of a modern economy. The opportunity to dispose of wastes in the air has been

viewed as an entitlement, or a form of property right.63 At the same time, there are no

property rights to the atmosphere, which is fugitive and virtually impossible to bound. All

of this provides the potential for too many emissions. If the emitted particles are

relatively large or they interact with local sunlight and geographical factors, as with urban

smog, air pollution has localized effects. Where the emissions travel larger distances, as

with SO2, the external effects are more broadly cast, and if they migrate to the upper

atmosphere, global externalities result, as with chlorofluorocarbons (CFC’s) and CO2. So

long as releases are limited and the airborne stock is small relative to the atmosphere

affected, there is little adverse impact. As emissions grow and the stock of pollutants

increases, however, air pollution becomes a more serious problem. As concerns about air

pollution have risen, the regulatory response has been slow and the adoption of property

rights to mitigate the problem, when it has occurred, generally has come even later.

Indeed, the notion of tradable emission permits to address air pollution was put forward

by Thomas Crocker in 1966 and by J.H. Dales in 1968, but their adoption took another 30

years.64

           Consider the problem of urban smog. James Krier and Edmund Ursin (1977) and

Krier (1994) describe the sluggish pace of government response to air pollution in

Southern California. As they point out, although there had been growing persistence of

smog in the Los Angeles Basin by the early 1940s, it took approximately 35 years before

regulations were enacted to directly attack the major source of the problem—auto

exhaust. Early state and local regulations ignored vehicle emissions.65 In 1950 research

revealed that there was a photochemical reaction that converted pollutants from refineries

and motor vehicles into smog, but the focus of government action was on further research

on air quality standards and the extent and nature of vehicle pollution.66 All the while as

more research confirmed the link between exhaust and smog, the problem intensified,

eventually involving air quality alerts by the 1960s.

           Even when the California Pure Air Act of 1968 authorized air pollution control

districts, their authority was restricted.67 The primary regulatory response was on

technological adjustments to reduce emissions as a condition for licensing new vehicles

and some used cars, and the establishment of uniform emissions standards for stationary

sources, rather than on behavioral changes, such as restrictions on driving.68 Most mobile

pollution sources remained relatively unregulated by the state.

           The Federal Clean Air Act of 1963 set the stage for more involvement by the

federal government in regulating air pollution, including federal auto emissions standards

that followed from the Motor Vehicle Control Act of 1965. The Federal Air Quality Act

of 1967 required states to set air quality standards consistent with the Clean Air Act.

California’s Pure Air Act of 1968 set higher emissions standards and created the Air

Resources Board with regulatory jurisdiction over mobile and stationary sources.69 The

Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 established uniform air quality standards

across the country and identified non-attainment areas where more restrictive controls

were to be implemented.70 Market-based, pricing approaches, such as emissions taxes

were not adopted.71 Although pollution levels were reduced in some areas, states

consistently failed to meet targeted standards during 1970-90, and in many areas air

quality actually worsened.72

           Finally, in 1994, some 50 years after the first concerns about smog, California

implemented a property rights approach to reduce NOx and SO2, the major sources of

smog, in the Los Angeles Basin with the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market,

RECLAIM. Los Angeles was the only area in the country to fall into extreme non-

attainment of ozone level targets, despite previous regulatory efforts. Unfortunately,

RECLAIM applied only to certain stationary facilities—utilities, refineries, and

manufacturing plants and not motor vehicles.

           These facilities were granted emissions quotas, based on historical releases and

annual reduction rates. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD)

set total annual allowable releases, with each facility’s quota a share of the aggregate.

The quotas were a property right to emit pollutants, and they could be traded to

encourage those organizations that could reduce pollution at lower cost to do so while

selling the residual to sources with higher abatement costs.

           There is a similar pattern of delay, reliance upon technology and uniform

standards, and finally on property rights in national efforts to lower S02 pollution. In the

1960s there was growing awareness of the damage caused to lakes and forests from acid

rain downwind from power plants that released S02 into the atmosphere. The 1970 and

1977 Clean Air Act Amendments set national maximum concentrations of S02 and the

states were charged with meeting those standards.

           To reduce emissions, the laws employed technology-based regulations. These

included specifying the equipment to be used, such as types of scrubbers, even if the

utility used low-sulfur coal, and setting new source performance standards that applied to

new plants. Older plants were not regulated so that controls moved at the pace of the

slowest or least able source to comply.73 These rules benefited high-sulfur coal producers,

mining unions, and Midwestern and Northeastern utilities with older facilities that burned

high-sulfur coal. The losers were utilities with new equipment and that used low-sulfur

coal, as well as coal producers in the West, a major source of low-sulfur coal. Subsequent

dissatisfaction with the costs of these regulations led to the adoption of limited trading

programs, including bubbles, allowing exchanges among different sources in a single

plant; netting, allowing plant expansion if overall pollution did not increase; banking,

allowing firms to carry forward unused credits; and offsets, allowing new plants to be

brought on line if existing ones reduced pollution.74 Despite the costs, total emissions of

S02 peaked in the 1970s and declined through the 1980s.75

           Nevertheless, acid rain continued to be a problem, and much more significant

reductions in S02 releases were determined to be necessary, particularly new ones aimed

at controlling emissions from the dirtiest units.76The political and economic costs,

however, were viewed as being prohibitive unless policies were changed to allow for

more cost-based approaches.

        During the previous 20 years, pollution abatement costs had continually increased

as stricter standards were adopted. By 1990 U.S. pollution control costs had reached $125

billion annually, nearly a 300 percent increase in real terms from 1972 levels.77Existing

uniform rules generally did not recognize that the costs of controlling emissions varied

across and within firms. Since traditional regulation gave advantages to old plants and

technology, there were few incentives for those organizations to develop new

technologies to reduce emissions at lower cost. Newer units were forced to adopt the

technology specified by the regulator, rather than that which might have been more cost

effective.78 Further, central regulation and its reliance on uniform standards could be used

politically to disadvantage certain firms and regions (those that used and produced low-

sulfur coal) at the behest of entrenched interests (those that used and produced high-

sulfur coal) with little environmental benefit.79

        In response, Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments finally authorized

electric utilities to trade allowances to emit S02 while reducing total allowed emissions by

approximately 50 percent. This was the first large-scale, long-term U.S. environmental

program to rely on tradable emission permits.80 The objective was to reduce SO2 and NOx

emissions by 10 million and 2 million tons respectively from their 1980 levels. The

flexibility underlying the tradable emission permit system overcame political opposition

to the ambitious air pollution reduction objectives.

           Under the permit system, an annual targeted level of emissions was set and

prorated across permit holders, who were allowed to discharge a specified amount of the

gasses. Emission permits were allocated to utilities through first-possession rules, based

on past electricity production, heat generation, fuel use or emissions, free of charge, and

hence grandfathered in existing utilities. Utilities in certain states such as Illinois,

Indiana, and Ohio were allocated an additional 200,000 allowances annually during the

first phase of regulation. Those states had important coal interests and all had ranking

members or chairs of key Congressional subcommittees.81

           These preferential quotas, as with those granted in oil and gas prorationing, were

adopted, in part, to make the new property rights program politically viable for

incumbent firms, and to encourage investment in new and renewable energy technology

by newer utilities that had more limited quotas.

           As in the RECLAIM program, the permits were a tradable property right to

discharge a specified amount of S02 and NOx. Rather than equating pollution levels

across firms as in past regulation, by trading these instruments marginal abatement costs

could be equalized across firms. Those firms that could reduce emissions at lower cost

could do so and sell the residual emission rights, apply them to offset excess emissions in

other parts of their operations, or to bank them. An active market in emission permits

developed. Adoption of tradable emission permits has been viewed as a successful means

of lowering overall air pollution with a cost savings of over $1 billion relative to what

might have been possible under previous regulation.82 But as with similarly successful

ITQ’s in fisheries and unitization in oil and gas reservoirs, tradable emission permits

were not adopted until existing regulation proved both to be too costly and too ineffective

in mitigating the losses of open-access. Moreover, by that time the benefits and costs of

adopting property rights were sufficiently clear to allow side payments in the allocation

property rights to address distributional demands.

           In efforts to address global air pollution externalities, the problems of uncertainty

in estimating the aggregate costs and benefits of regulation and their distribution across

countries have been even more severe in hindering timely action. The very nature of

global environmental externalities presents incentive problems. Abatement by any

country benefits others as a public good, but if abatement is costly to a country’s citizens,

its politicians have incentive to invest less in reduction efforts than would be globally

optimal and free ride on cutbacks taken elsewhere.

           Consider first, the most successful effort to address international air pollution, the

Montreal Protocol of September 1987 on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.83

Concern about the build up of chlorofluorocarbons in the upper atmosphere surfaced in

1974 when two studies hypothesized that chlorine released from the breakdown of CFC’s

had destructive effects on stratospheric ozone.84 CFC’s were inexpensive chemicals used

since 1931 in refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and more recently in the production and

cleaning of computer components and other electronics. The U.S. accounted for from 25

to 30 percent of the world production of CFC’s between 1974 and 1986, and hence had a

vital interest in any international agreement to regulate or eliminate their production.85

Congressional hearings were conducted on the extent of ozone depletion and possible

remedies, but no unilateral action was taken. In 1977 the EPA proposed uniform

regulations to prohibit manufacture, processing, and interstate distribution of CFC’s. The

main advocates were environmental organizations and certain groups of scientists, but the

U.S. chemical industry successfully opposed regulation.86

        In the 1970s the imperative of taking unilateral action that could involve

substantial economic costs in the U.S. was not compelling for key constituencies. The

actual atmospheric mechanisms involved were incompletely understood, and the extent

of ozone depletion and its consequences were unclear. Indeed, in 1983, under the Reagan

Administration, the EPA advised Congress that no action should be taken until the

relationship between CFC’s and ozone depletion was more clearly determined.87

           In March 1988, the NASA Ozone Trends Panel released additional scientific

information suggesting that the ozone “holes” were larger than previously believed and

that there were tighter links between ozone layer deterioration and CFC emissions. This

new information helped to shift the U.S. position on international collective action. It also

changed because domestic political opposition to regulation had diminished. The

chemical industry, with new technologies for CFC substitutes, no longer resisted

domestic CFC controls, and it lobbied for international restrictions to phase out CFC

production and trade.88 A mandated switch to new CFC substitutes had potential to

provide American firms with a competitive advantage relative to European producers of

CFC’s. Retrofitting by refrigeration and air-conditioning industries was costly, and U.S.

CFC-substitute producers needed guarantees that their customers could not shift to

alternative foreign sources of CFC’s. An international agreement to regulate CFC trade

would serve that purpose. Naturally European firms were more skeptical of the need to

restrict CFC’s, and the support of European governments for regulatory action generally

came later than the U.S. Even then there were disagreements between U.S. and European

representatives on timing and identification of the chemicals slated to be phased

out.89The more serious opposition, however, came from representatives of undeveloped

countries who saw restrictions on CFC’s as being particularly costly.

           The first international action was launched 11 years after the ozone “holes” were

first detected. The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer was

completed in 1985 and ratified by the U.S. one year later, in 1986.90 As with early smog

regulations in California, the convention offered no binding restrictions, but rather

emphasized research. It established broad international objectives to protect human health

and to promote study of the impact of CFC’s on the ozone layer. Disagreements,

especially between representatives of developed and developing countries, blocked any

actual CFC control measures.91 For developing countries CFC’s were a source of low-

cost refrigerants, and the global externality resulted from a build up of emissions from

developed countries. Accordingly, representatives of developing countries, notably China

and India, demanded side payments to as a condition for coordinated action to protect the

ozone layer.

           In response, representatives from the U.S., Canada, Japan, and Europe offered

countries with low per capita consumption of CFC’s various exemptions from

international regulations. This concession led to the agreement on the 1987 Montreal

Protocol. Under the Protocol, developed countries were to cut production and

consumption of CFC’s by 20 percent of their 1986 levels by 1993 and by 50 percent by

1998. CFC trade with countries not adopting the restrictions was to be stopped. With the

notion of “common but differentiated responsibilities” developing countries were allowed

an extra 10-year’s delay to reach reduced production targets and were authorized to

exceed their 1986 levels of production by up to 10 percent to satisfy “basic domestic

needs.”92

           Even so additional concessions had to be granted in order to get developing

countries to ratify the protocol. A Second Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol

was held in 1990 to devise additional side payments. A Multilateral Fund was established

to provide developing countries with financial assistance and CFC replacement

technology was to be transferred if they agreed to the protocol.93 Creation of a

multilateral fund, however, raised new distributional concerns among donor and recipient

countries. These included the size of individual contributions, the nature of penalties if

donors defaulted on their assessments, the amount of money to be granted recipients, and

their documentation requirements.94 Not all of the issues could be resolved at the second

meeting. Only very general language stating that the parties must take “every practicable

step” to control CFC emissions could be agreed to. The World Bank was to be the

administrator, and $160 million was to be made available to developing countries for

complying with the CFC accord. Further, the fund was to be increased by $80 million

when India and China ratified the Montreal Protocol.95

           It took 16 years to reach general international agreement on controlling the

production and dissemination of CFC’s. Regulation has been based on production bans

and technological substitution. There also has been use of tradable emission permits for

achieving compliance with the Montreal Protocol, and a tax on CFCs was introduced

later to accelerate the phase out. CFC emissions have declined, and taxpayers in

developed countries have born most of the costs of the regulations.96 In the aggregate

these payments likely have been relatively small, given the benefits involved of

protecting the Ozone layer. Further, the chemical industry and environmental groups

have been formidable constituencies within developed countries for the protocol.

        Despite all of this, the thickness of the South Pole ozone layer continues to

decline during the peak ozone-depleting season, and there are calls for even stricter

emissions controls. But the concessions made to developing countries to gain their

participation pose barriers for further reductions. China, which has become a large

producer of CFC’s and related refrigerants, is likely to resist loss of a profitable new

industry.97 .

        The second example of international air pollution control efforts to limit green

house gas (GHG) emissions, however, faces even more difficult problems. There have

been delays, differential responses among countries to calls to address the externality, and

no success in reducing overall emissions. It seems unlikely that any effective, coordinated

response will take place until crises increase perceived benefits and mitigate international

distributional concerns. The issues are quite similar to those that have arisen regarding

CFC control.

           Global warming has been a concern in many quarters at least since the 1990s and

perhaps earlier.98 It is an open-access problem. With unrestricted access to the

atmosphere, gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), Nitrous Oxide (N2O),

Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC’s) and methane (CH4) are released as by-products of human

activities and other natural sources across countries. Regardless of their origin the gases

are spread around the globe with potential external effects. The gases retard the re-

radiation of the sun’s energy from the earth’s surface back into space. Under debate are

whether and how much the further accumulation of these gases will generate a damaging

rise in global temperatures and what to do about it.99

           There are many sources of uncertainty regarding aggregate effects of global

warming, their distribution among countries, and the costs of reducing GHG emissions.

The magnitude of global warming and associated climate change remains generally

undetermined, although there is more of a consensus on the issue than even a few years

ago.100 The scientific uncertainty comes in estimating the rate at which greenhouse gas

concentrations will increase, the corresponding impact of rising GHG concentrations on

temperatures, the patterns of climate change across the globe, and their impact on the

regions affected.101 The research evidence on key aspects of these issues remains

incomplete and inconclusive. The resulting scientific uncertainty regarding global

warming allows politicians to chose among conflicting evidence for justifying positions

desired by critical constituencies with more certainty than actual understanding may

merit.102

        The necessary emission reductions in response to possible climate change and the

associated economic costs involved are similarly unclear. The magnitude of the costs

depends upon the amount of the reduction required for each country and its pace. There is

the politically important issue of the global distribution of abatement costs. The costs are

the greatest for the countries that produce the most CO2 and other green house gasses.

The U.S. and China are currently the largest producers of CO2. Within countries

abatement efforts will have differential impacts, with the transportation, manufacturing,

and utility sectors incurring higher costs. There are many estimates of the costs of

emissions controls in the U.S. with the results dependent on the assumptions made

regarding timing, magnitude, and the instruments used.103 Those countries and interests

that anticipate bearing more of the costs of regulation understandably resist action until

compensating arrangements are implemented, but agreement on them is subject to the

same side-payment disputes noted above over who should pay and receive, the amounts

involved and the forms and timing of compensation. These negotiations also are

benefits of international efforts.

           Additionally as with the Montreal Protocol, there is no underlying enforcement

mechanism within the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, which was the first formal international

treaty to reduce GHG emissions.104 Under the protocol monitoring depends on annual self

reports by countries using comparable methodologies. Expert review teams are

authorized with voluntary country visits. No consequences of noncompliance could be

agreed upon, and the compliance provisions that are included apply only to Annex 1 or

industrialized countries. Absent effective enforcement, there are incentives for countries

to defect whenever the political costs become too high.

           Given the unclear and uneven distribution of the costs and benefits of

international action and a general lack of immediacy in taking it, it is understandable that

progress has been slow regarding global warming. As of December 2006, 169 countries

had ratified the Protocol, but the U.S. and Australia had not, and China and India, as well

as other developing countries which have ratified it, are not required to take direct

action.105 Indeed, representatives of developing countries continue to demand that most

restrictions be implemented in developed countries. The Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012,

and GHG emissions have continued to increase.106

            To lower the costs of GHG abatement, the Kyoto Protocol incorporated tradable

emissions permits based on their success in SO2 regulation in the U.S.107 In response, the

European Union, which ratified the protocol, created a multi-national GHG emissions

trading scheme, the largest in the world. Emissions were capped, and permits were

allocated for virtually all stationary industrial and electricity-generating units in the E.U.

A market developed with two trading periods, 2005-2007 and 2008-2012. The program

generally has been viewed as a success.108 This is the unusual case where property rights

have been established relatively early in the process of responding to an open-access

externality. One reason for this occurrence is general industry support due to lower

information costs about the use of emission rights as compared to reliance upon uniform

standards. Based on the lower costs and accomplishments of the U.S. SO2 trading

program, relative to alternative centralized regulation, industry representatives may have

preferred a cap-and-trade scheme over a more costly and uncertain multi-national

regulatory arrangement. If so, this institutional response is consistent with the overall

thesis of the paper.

IV. Concluding Remarks: Delay in Response to Open Access and the Adoption of
Property Rights.

       Theory and research regarding collective action in addressing open-access

resource problems indicates that success in controlling externalities comes when there is

a consensus on the aggregate benefits to be gained, that the parties perceive positive net

gains from agreement, and that they are homogeneous with respect to bargaining

objectives and in the distribution of the costs and benefits to be incurred. Agreements

reached under these conditions tend to be self-enforcing because it is in the interest of all

parties to insure success. Collective action may also achieve its objectives if the parties

are heterogeneous with respect to the net gains from cooperation, if the spread is not too

great and there are agreed-to bases for constructing side payments to compensate those

parties that may bear more costs or receive fewer gains. The resulting arrangement must

be secure enough so that the side payments are long term and predictable.

       Uncertainty in predictions regarding aggregate benefits and costs of collective

action and their distribution among constituencies complicates this process by raising

transaction costs. Uncertainty makes it more difficult for parties to determine how they

will fare with formal arrangements to mitigate open-access externalities. Accordingly, the

incentives are for delay and for subsequent adoption of policies that involve the least cost

and minimize distributive effects. Property rights which are the fundamental solution to

open access, however, are more costly and they can result in a major redistribution of

wealth and political influence. In this case, it is efficient to wait as we have seen in

fisheries, common oil pools, and air pollution control. Accordingly, for individuals, as

well as, risk-adverse politicians and agency officials, property rights often are the

solution of last resort, rather than the front line of attack on the tragedy of the commons.
