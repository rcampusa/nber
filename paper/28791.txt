                                         ABSTRACT

According to the World Health Organization, obesity is one of the greatest public-health
challenges of the 21st century. Body weight is also known to affect individuals' self-esteem and
interpersonal relationships, including romantic ones. We estimate "utility-maximizing" Body
Mass Index (BMI) and calculate the implied monetary value of changes in both individual and
spousal BMI, using the compensating income variation method and data from the Swiss
Household Panel. Two-stage least squares models are estimated for women and men separately,
with mother's education as an instrument to account for the potential endogeneity in income.
Results suggest that the optimal own BMI is 27.4 and 22.7 for men and women, respectively. The
annual value of reaching optimal weight ranges from$3,235 for underweight women to $32,378
for obese women and from $19,088 for underweight men to $43,175 for obese men. Women on
average value changes in their own BMI about three times higher than changes in their spouse's
BMI. Men, on the other hand, value a reduction in their spouse's BMI almost twice as much
compared to a reduction in their own BMI.

1 Introduction

Obesity is one of the greatest public-health challenges of the 21st century according to the World
Health Organization. Its prevalence has tripled in many European countries since the 1980s and
continues to rise (World Health Organization, 2007). In addition to increasing a person's risk of
various physical ailments, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes (WHO, 2007),
body weight is also known to affect individuals psychologically based on factors such as social
norms that are formed through interactions with society at large and interpersonal relationships
(Carr and Friedman, 2005).
       Efficient resource allocation is a challenge within any health-care system. An important
part of tackling this challenge is knowledge of the value of health itself together with the more
easily measured costs and benefits of health interventions, such as medical expenses and changes
in productivity. Policies that affect individuals' body weight alter individual well-being, which is
likely to weigh heavily in many cost-benefit or cost-utility analyses, leaving studies that exclude
or miscalculate such benefits severely biased. Furthermore, increasing allocation of resources to
health care, highlights the importance of efficiency comparisons, not only within health-care
systems, but also between health care and other uses of resources.
       One way to determine individuals' value of improvements in intangible desiderata like
body mass index (BMI) is to calculate the willingness to pay (WTP) for such improvements or
the willingness to accept (WTA) compensation for losses. That is, to estimate how much money
individuals would be willing to give up (or receive) in exchange for such improvements (losses).
Studies determining the monetary value that individuals place on intangible goods are scarce
because the methods traditionally used have limitations. This has led researchers to focus largely
on non-monetary measures such as health-related quality of life (HRQoL), which limits
efficiency evaluations to cost-effectiveness analyses that can only serve as a prioritization
mechanism within health systems rather than cost-benefit analyses that allow for evaluation of
efficiency in general.
       A promising method to calculate the monetary value of health and other goods that do not
have a revealed market price, and thus facilitate efficiency comparisons between health care and
other uses of resources, is the compensating income variation (CIV) method. The method is
firmly rooted in economic theory (Hicks, 1939) and has been used to estimate the monetary


                                                 3
value of various non-market goods, although economists have only recently started using it for
health-related conditions. Applications to health include some studies examining specific
conditions, such as migraines (Groot and Maassen van den Brink, 2004) cardiovascular disease
(Groot and Maassen van den Brink, 2006), and pain (Ferrer-i-Carbonell and van Praag, 2002;
McNamee and Mendolia, 2014; Ólafsdóttir, Ásgeirsdóttir, and Norton, 2020), body composition
(Asgeirsdottir, Buason, Jonbjarnardottir, and Olafsdottir, 2020), depression and anxiety (Buason,
Norton, McNamee, Thordardottir and Asgeirsdottir, 2021), and studies examining a set of
different health problems and diseases (Asgeirsdottir, Birgisdottir, Ólafsdóttir, and Olafsson,
2017; Asgeirsdottir, Birgisdottir, Henrysdottir and Ólafsdóttir, 2020, Powdthavee and van den
Berg, 2011; Howley, 2017). In addition, the method has been used to estimate the dollar value of
a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (Huang, Frijters, Dalziel and Clarke, 2018) and changes in
HRQoL (McNamee and Mendolia; 2018).
       Applications of the method to estimate the monetary compensation needed to offset the
welfare loss associated with a sub-optimal Body Mass Index (BMI) is limited. Kuroki (2016)
calculated the CIV for being overweight and obese. He concluded that life satisfaction of people
who are overweight or obese is statistically significantly lower than people who are of normal
weight, even after controlling for socioeconomic factors and obesity-related health variables. He
also found the relationship to be greater for overweight women than men. Asgeirsdottir et al.
(2020) also found gender differences using the method, but more importantly highlighted the
importance of income measurement when using the method. Although Kuroki (2016) and
Asgeirsdottir et al. (2020) mark important first attempts at estimating the CIV for body weight,
we substantially improve upon their results in several important ways. First, we calculate the
CIV for being below, as well as above the optimal body weight, defined as the weight that
optimizes life satisfaction, which was not done by Kuroki and analysed in a limited manner by
Asgeirsdottir et al. (2020), due to a small overall sample size, and with only under 1% of their
sample being underweight. We furthermore estimate the CIV for the continuous measure of BMI
for the first time. Second, and more importantly, we can implicitly account for endogeneity in
income, which is not accounted for by Kuroki at all, and bias adjustments are only implemented
manually by Asgeirsdottir et al. (2020), using information from the literature. Third, and maybe
most interestingly, the study sheds light on the interplay between own and a spouses BMI and
the corresponding CIVs, which to our knowledge has not been done before.

                                                 4
       A benefit of the CIV method is that it can be applied to existing data, contrary to most
valuation methods. Individual responses to questions about life-satisfaction, as well as BMI and
income, are used for the direct estimation of a life-satisfaction equation. The estimation results
are then used to calculate the income-BMI trade-off that keeps life satisfaction constant. The
CIV thus represents the monetary compensation needed by an individual with a sub-optimal BMI
to have the same level of well-being as with optimal BMI, ceteris paribus. Our definition of sub-
optimal is any deviation from optimal BMI, where optimal BMI is defined as the BMI that
maximizes life satisfaction.
       We calculate CIVs for the individual's own and spouse's optimal BMI directly from the
data and assess the concordance in couple's BMI preferences. Meylera, Stimpson and Peek
(2007) performed a systematic review of 103 studies of health-concordance in mental health,
physical health, and health behavior among couples. The review suggests evidence for
concordant mental and physical health, as well as health behaviors among couples. Studies have
furthermore found BMI to be highly correlated between spouses (Jeffery and Rick, 2002, The
and Gordon-Larsen, 2009). Clark and Etilé (2011) found that the negative well-being effect of
own BMI is lower when the individual's partner is heavier, which is consistent with social
contagion effects in weight. This paper extends the analysis made by Clark and Etilé (2011) by
producing CIV estimates and by including a separate underweight category for BMI.
Furthermore, this paper calculates values for optimal own BMI conditional on spouse's BMI and
optimal spouse's BMI conditional on own BMI.
       We choose Switzerland for the context of our study due to the availability of exceptional
data. The Swiss Household Panel is a rich dataset, which includes 21 waves and is well suited for
estimation of CIVs, for example including a commonly used instrument for income. Two-stage
least squares (2SLS) models are estimated for women and men separately, with mother's
education as an instrument to account for the potential endogeneity in income, following Howley
(2017) and Ólafsdóttir et al. (2020). Evidence suggests that endogeneity likely causes the effect
of income on life satisfaction to be significantly understated without instrumentation and the
derived CIVs might consequently be biased upwards (Groot and Massen van den Brink 2004,
2006; Powdthavee 2010, Powdthavee and van den Berg, 2011). Calculating CIVs for sub-
optimal BMI using data from Switzerland adds to the existing CIV literature, as well as the
literature on sub-optimal BMI that has been analyzed in different contexts. However, it should be

                                                 5
kept in mind that results could be context specific, especially as Switzerland has a relatively low
rate of obesity (OECD, 2017). It is therefore possible that there is a greater penalty in
Switzerland for being above optimal BMI than in other countries.
    The results suggest that both women and men would be willing to pay an increasing amount
to reach the optimal BMI the further away from the optimal BMI they become, both when below
and above the optimal weight. The values from women range from $59 and up to $1,203 per
BMI unit per year (1-10 BMI units away from optimal), and from men the values range from $95
and up to $2,005 (see Table A1). Similarly, there is a positive value for changing the BMI of a
spouse whose BMI is sub-optimal, which is conditional on one's own BMI (see Table A2 for
amounts per BMI unit). This spousal analysis highlights the gender differences in own and
spousal CIV for BMI changes, and shows how limited the individual analyses can be.
Importantly, women's values are on average about three times as much for changes in their own
BMI compared to changes in their spouse's BMI. Values from men, on the other hand, are
almost twice as much for a reduction in their spouse´s BMI towards the optimal level compared
to a reduction in their own BMI when above their optimal BMI.




2 Data

The Swiss Household Panel (SHP) data is a nationally representative annual survey conducted
since 1999 with information on living conditions in Switzerland. All individuals aged 14 or older
who live in the household are eligible to answer the individual questionnaire. We use waves 6
(2004) to 21 (2019) because they include the variables needed to calculate CIV for sub-optimal
BMI. The original sample of the sixteen waves consisted of 124,700 observations on 19,031
individuals. Our final sample, after dropping observations with missing values, consisted of
112,710 observations on 18,012 individuals. The size of the sample is lower in the spousal
analysis, or 49,784 observations on 8,099 individuals, because it includes only those who have
spouses.
       Well-being is measured with a question about satisfaction with life in general. The
question is on an 11-point scale and the respondents are asked the following question: In general,
how satisfied are you with your life if 0 means "not at all satisfied" and 10 means "completely

                                                  6
satisfied"? As expected, the distribution of life satisfaction over the sample is highly skewed with
an average of 8.0 and the interquartile range (IQR) is 2. Despite some criticism, measures of
subjective well-being such as questions on life satisfaction have been widely used in social
sciences and psychology, as well as in some economic studies. For a reference to discussion on
the vast testing of the robustness of these subjective measures, we refer the reader to Clark,
Frijters, and Shields (2006). To ease interpretation of the estimated coefficients and comparisons
to previous results in the literature, the life satisfaction variable is standardized to having a mean
of zero and a standard deviation of one.
       BMI is calculated using respondents self-reported height and weight and is the ratio of
weight, in kilograms, over height, in meters, squared. For the most part BMI is used in
continuous form, although for certain purposes it is categorized into the traditional four
categories using criteria from the WHO. Individuals are defined to be underweight if their BMI
is under 18.5, normal weight if their BMI is between 18.5 and 25, overweight if their BMI is
over 25 and up to 30, and obese if their BMI exceeds 30 (WHO, 2007). As the survey is a
household survey, the spouses BMI is also available based on self-reported weight and height.
       Income is yearly household income equivalized according to a modified OECD scale
(Voorpostel et al., 2016). We use the log of income in our estimations to account for diminishing
marginal utility of income (Layard, Nickell, and Mayraz, 2008). To prevent inflation from
affecting the results, the income variable was CPI-adjusted to the 2019 price level (Federal
Statistical Office of Switzerland, 2021), and we convert the results to US dollars to facilitate
comparison with other studies, using the average exchange rate from 2019 of one CHF equaling
0.9937 US dollar (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (U.S.), 2021).
Other control variables are years of education based on the International Standard Classification
of Education (ISCED classification scheme), age, marital status, labor-force status, wave
dummy, degree of urbanization, and number of children. We include age in 5-year brackets, as
previous research suggests that it is important to include age in the model in a flexible form
(Blanchflower and Oswald, 2008). Table 1 shows means, and standard deviations of continuous
variables and percentage distributions of dummy variables used in the study. Table 2 shows
within and between variance of the main variables of interest.

3 Methods

We follow Groot and van den Brink (2004), Asgeirsdottir et al. (2017 & 2020), and Olafsdottir et
al. (2020) and define an indirect well-being function W which is determined by household
income Y, BMI status B, and other individual characteristics X as



                                W = W(Y ,B ,X).                                     (1)




                                                  9
Comparison of well-being with a sub-optimal BMI status  to that of optimal BMI status  can
be expressed as follows:


                        =  (, |) -  (,  |).                                           (2)



The CIV is the additional amount of income that leaves the individual with the same level of
well-being with the sub-optimal BMI status as without it so that:



                        ( +  |, ) =  (| , ).                                          (3)


       Three different empirical estimations of equation (1) are considered. The first model
represents  as dummy variables indicating a person's BMI category, i.e., whether a person is
underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese. The model is empirically estimated using the
following equation:

                                                                    
                        = 0 + 1  + 3
                                   =1 2, , + =1  , +                                  (4)


where  is life satisfaction of individual i at time t, and the ´s and ´s are coefficients
measuring the relationship between the independent variables and life satisfaction.  is the error
term, and , represents other individual characteristics. The benchmark BMI category in this
model is normal weight. We can then use point estimates from equation (4) to calculate the CIV
from equation (3) as follows:


                                                2,
                                   
                                 =   -                - 1                             (5)
                                                 1



where  is average income and 2, represents the coefficient of sub-optimal BMI category j.

       Using BMI categories has two notable disadvantages. First, the categorization of this
continuous variable inevitably discards some within-category information. Second, this
categorization is based on the medical literature and does not have to be in accordance with

                                                10
people's preferred weight. In the second model, the  in equation (1) is modelled as the
continuous form of BMI and includes a square term of BMI as well. The motivation for
including the square term in BMI comes from the hump-shape shown in Figure A1, where life
satisfaction increases up to a peak level and then decreases again with increasing BMI after
accounting for outliers. The following model is empirically estimated:

                                                            
                = 0 + 1  + 2  + 3 2
                                   + =1   , +                                           (6)


where  , the ´s, ´s and the , are the same as in equation (4). In this model, BMI is related
to life satisfaction in a parabolic way, and the vertex of the parabola represents a well-being
optimizing BMI, provided that 2 > 0 and 3 < 0. The optimal BMI is then found using the
standard formula for the vertex of a parabola:


                                                 2
                                         = -          .                                 (7)
                                                 23



Employing the point estimates from equation (6), one can calculate the CIV for moving to the
optimal BMI from equation (3) as follows:


                                                           )+  2 - 2 
                               =   - 2 (-                    3
                                                                      - 1               (8)
                                                           1



where  is average income and  is found from equation (7). Note that the CIV is now a
function of  so that for each value of  we get a specific CIV value.
       In the third approach, we follow Clark and Etilé (2011) and define a model in terms of
both individual's and spouse's BMI together with the square of both BMI levels and their
interaction. The questions are then what BMI level for the spouse would maximize the
individual's life satisfaction, given the BMI of the individual, and what the optimal BMI for the
individual would be, given the BMI of the spouse. Representing the BMI of the individual as 
and the BMI of the spouse as  , the third model is empirically estimated using the following
equation:


                                                 11
                          = 0 + 1  + 2  + 3 2
                                             + 4  +
                               2       
                            5  + 6   + =1  , +                                        (9)


where  , the ´s, ´s and the , have the same meaning as in equation (4). Both individual
BMI and spouse's BMI have a squared term in the model, and the model also includes their
interaction. Fixing all variables except  in equation (9), there is an optimal BMI for the
individual that maximizes life satisfaction. As for equation (7), the optimal BMI is found using
the standard formula for the vertex of a parabola:


                                              2 +6 
                                       = -                ,                           (10)
                                                23




provided that 2 + 6  > 0 and 3 < 0. The optimal BMI for the individual depends on the
BMI of the spouse. If 6 > 0 the optimal BMI for the individual increases with increasing BMI
of the spouse. Employing the point estimates from equation (9), one can calculate the CIV for the
individuals own weight changing to its optimal, given the weight of the spouse as follows:


                                                          2  2
                                            (2 +6  ) - +3   -  
                          =   -                                         - 1            (11)
                                                                  1




where  is average income and  is found from equation (10). Note that the CIV is now a
function of both  and  so that for each pair of values  and  we get a CIV value.
Similarly, holding all variables except  in equation (9) constant, there is an optimal BMI for
the spouse in the sense that the life satisfaction of the individual is maximized. The optimal BMI
for the spouse is then


                                                4 +6 
                                         =-                   ,                       (12)
                                                     25




                                                12
provided that 4 + 6  > 0 and 5 < 0. Note that the optimal BMI for the spouse depends on
the BMI of the individual, allowing for exploration of potential social interaction in BMI
between spouses (Clark &. Etilé, 2011). If 6 > 0 the optimal BMI for the spouse increases with
increasing BMI of the individual. Employing the point estimates from equation (9), one can
calculate the CIV for changing the spouse's weight to its optimal from equation (3) as follows:


                                                              2   2
                       =   - (4 +6  )( - )+5  -  - 1                                    (13)
                                                      1



       Previous studies have suggested that an OLS estimator may result in a substantial
downward biased income effect in life-satisfaction equations as explained by Powdthavee
(2010). Subsequently the derived CIVs might then be biased upwards if income is not
instrumented for (Howley, 2017; Ólafsdóttir et al., 2020). Howley (2017) used parental
education as an instrument for income and found that the estimated effect of income on life
satisfaction more than tripled in size between OLS and the two-stage least squares (2SLS)
model. Ólafsdóttir et al., (2020) found that, compared to the OLS results, the income coefficient
was 3.6 times larger when they used mother's education as an instrument for income. The SHP
data contains both parent's highest education level, which can be used as an instrument in
accordance with the literature. The parental education did not pass the Sargan-Hansen test for
overidentification, and the tests of endogeneity were somewhat more favorable for mother's
education than for father's education. We therefore used mother's education as an instrument,
which passed the Wu-Hausman test of endogeneity (p-values ranged from 0.00-0.04). F-statistics
in the first-stage regressions ranged from 15 to 31, suggesting that mother's education is not a
weak instrument (Stock, Yogo, and Wright, 2002). Besides passing statistical validation tests,
previous research suggests that children of highly educated parents do not enjoy higher life
satisfaction in their adulthood compared to other children (Frijters, Johnston, and Shields, 2014),
and thus the instrument has continued to be used in the literature. There is thus empirical
evidence to support our choice of instrument, but it is also reassuring that the changes in the
income coefficient are very similar when other instruments are used (see for example Luttmer
2005). However, for comparison to our main estimations, and to facilitate comparisons to



                                                 13
Asgeirsdottir et al. (2020), we also report results in which the income endogeneity is adjusted for
manually based on Lindqvist, Östling and Cesasrini (2020) (see Table A3).
       Several endogeneity biases in the body-weight coefficients can be hypothesized.
However, neither the direction of the body-weight bias nor its magnitude is as established in the
literature as the well know income-endogeneity bias. In an earlier version (Clark and Etilé, 2010)
of their paper, Clark and Etilé (2011) applied past changes in BMI as an instrument on the BMI
variable. Their results were inconclusive, and they observed that finding a good instrument for
BMI is very challenging (Clark and Etilé, 2011). Katsaiti (2012) tried to account for the
endogeneity of BMI by using height as an instrument. That instrument is however unlikely to
fulfill the exclusion restriction since height has been shown to have a significant effect on well-
being (Deaton and Arora, 2009). Kuroki (2016) and Asgeirsdottir et al. (2020), the only two
papers in the literature to calculate the CIV of BMI, were also unable to account for endogeneity
due to similar data limitations. Asgeirsdottir et al. (2020) however, point out that although the
endogeneity of body weight in subjective well-being regressions could hypothetically cause
biases either way, some clues can be found in studies using polygenic risk scores as instruments
for BMI when regressed on depression (Huang et al., 2014; Jokela et al., 2012; Lawlor et al.,
2011; Tyrell et al., 2019; Walter et al., 2015; Willage et al., 2018). In all six studies the non-
instrumented results showed a positive relationship between BMI and depression, while the BMI
coefficient either increased with instrumentation or decreased. This suggests therefore that it is
difficult to assess the direction of any endogeneity bias in the BMI coefficient, if such a bias
exists. However, the mixed results on the direction of the bias in depression equations indicates
that an extreme bias is unlikely to affect our results.
       Due the nature of the data, panel regressions were explored. However, the main variation
in BMI is between individuals (see Table 2). Approximately 75% of participants were always in
the same BMI category throughout the survey and 25% even had the exact same BMI every year
they participated. Furthermore, as our instrument is time-invariant, it is not possible to
implement fixed effects in our 2SLS estimations. Given the well-known endogeneity bias of the
income, it is deemed of greater importance to tackle that endogeneity with a two-stage
estimation. Although panel regression methods did not produce robust results they are reported
in the Appendix for completeness (see Table A4).

4 Results

Table 3 shows point estimates for the key variables of interest, BMI categories, and household
income, using our preferred model specification IV-2SLS along with the corresponding CIVs.
Point estimates are statistically significant except for the overweight coefficients. The results for
women suggest that higher income is associated with greater life satisfaction and that sub-
optimal BMI categories impact life satisfaction in a negative way. The CIVs for underweight and
obese women are in a similar range, but the CIV for overweight women is significantly lower.

Gender differences in CIVs are substantial. For men, being underweight produces the highest
CIV but the CIV for obese men is much lower and being overweight is estimated to be more
beneficial in terms of life satisfaction compared to being of normal weight. However, the point

caution.

        Optimal BMI for women is 22.7 and 27.4 for men. This means that the optimal level for
women is within the normal weight category but for men it is optimal to be slightly overweight.

        As seen in Table 3, men have a higher CIV than women when they are underweight, but
women have higher CIVs than men when they are overweight or somewhat obese. It can also be
seen from Table 4 that men whose BMI is 15 have a CIV value of $19,088 per year to achieve
the well-being associated optimal BMI or 24% of their average yearly income, but on the other
hand women´s CIV in the same situation is only $3,235 or 5% of their average annual income.
Table 4 shows that women with a BMI of 40 have a higher CIV than women with BMI 15 to
reach optimal BMI, with values of $18,043 (around 25% of their average annual salary) and
$3,235, respectively. Men with BMI of 40 would have a CIV value of $19,817 to reach the
optimal BMI of 27.9 (around 25% of average yearly salary), which is similar to their CIV if BMI
is 15. Appendix Table A1 contains the CIV for 1-10 BMI units away from the optimal BMI and

        For example, Table 5, section A for women shows that when the spouse's BMI is fixed at
22 or 28 the corresponding optimal own BMI levels are 24.1 and 24.7. If a woman's BMI is for
example 15 and her spouse has a BMI of 28, then she has a CIV of $7,733 to reach the optimal
BMI of 24.7. However, she has a CIV of $20,604 to reach the optimal BMI of 24.7 if her actual
BMI is 40 and her spouse has a BMI of 28. The results for section A can also be seen in the
upper half Figure 2.

       Table 5, section B for men shows that when their own BMI is fixed at 28 or 35, the
corresponding spouse's optimal BMI levels are 28.7 and 38.3. If a man´s own BMI is for
example at 28 and his spouse has a BMI of 15, the man has a CIV of $36,453 for his spouse to
achieve the optimal BMI of 28.7. However, the same man has a CIV of $23,553 for his spouse to
achieve the optimal BMI of 28.7 if his spouse has an actual BMI of 40. The results for section B
can also be seen in the lower half of Figure 2.
       Comparing sections A and B for women in Table 5 shows that women are generally
affected more severely by their own BMI being above their optimal BMI than by their spouses
BMI being above the optimal as indicated by the shaded area in Table 5. The CIV values for
men, on the other hand, show them to be affected by their spouse´s BMI being above the optimal
point for a spouse. In other words, they are more concerned (from the perspective of negative
impact on their own life satisfaction) about reducing their spouse´s BMI towards the optimal
than reducing their own BMI to the optimal level.
       For example, a woman with a BMI of 22 (section B, women) whose spouse has a BMI of
35 has a CIV of $4,600 to reach the same well-being as someone whose spouse's BMI is at the
optimal of 18.5. However, if the woman had a BMI of 35 (section A, women) and her spouse had
a BMI of 22, she has a CIV of $9,898 to reach the same well-being as if her BMI were at the
optimal of 24.1. Table A2 contains the CIV for 1-10 BMI units away from own optimal BMI and
spouse optimal BMI and CIV per unit BMI.
       Comparing the income coefficients from the IV-2SLS and OLS models (see OLS results
in the Appendix Tables A6-A8), shows an increase by approximately two to threefold with
instrumentation, which is in line with previous results (Howley,2017; Ólafsdóttir et al., 2017;
Powdthavee, 2010). Table A3 contains the comparison of IV-2SLS, OLS and adjustments
according to Lindqvist et al (2020) who used lottery winnings in Sweden to estimate the
treatment effect of one unit of log household income on standardized life-satisfaction, which is
only about 30% higher than our OLS coefficient.

5 Discussion

We find that the life satisfaction of people who are underweight or obese is lower than for people
with normal or slightly overweight BMI levels. Women have a higher value for not being in the
obese category than men, while men have a stronger preference than women to avoid being
underweight. When accounting for spouse's BMI, men are more sensitive to their spouse´s BMI
being above its optimal than to their own BMI. Women on the other hand have a higher WTP for
changes in their own BMI than their spouse's BMI. To our knowledge, CIVs for sub-optimal
BMI levels conditional on spouse's BMI have not been estimated before.
       Kuroki (2016) calculated the CIV for being overweight and obese using separate OLS
models but did not consider the CIV for being underweight as underweight individuals were
excluded from his study. Although Asgeirsdottir et al. (2020) included the underweight category
in their analyses, that was mainly for completeness, as power issues in their estimations
prevented any meaningful interpretations for that category. According to our results, including
underweight individuals is crucial to get the full picture of BMI preferences, especially in the
case of males. While we find women to be more sensitive to being overweight than men, we find
the opposite to be true in the case of underweight. Using the point estimates in Kuroki (2016),
which does not account for endogeneity, the CIV for overweight women was $39,434 and
$54,401 for obese women compared to our finding of $1,644 (overweight) and $8,300 (obese)
using IV-2SLS models (see Table 3). Similarly, Kuroki (2016) estimates the CIV for overweight
men to be $13,730 and obese men to be $37,128 while our findings suggest that men do not
require a CIV for being overweight, and our CIV for obese men is $3,679. While Asgeirsdottir et
al. (2020) do not find statistically significant estimates for overweight, which may be due to
power issues in their small sample, their point estimates are in accordance with our results,
showing males not to be impacted (from a life satisfaction perspective) from being overweight,
whilst they are impacted if they are living with obesity. Table A6 shows our results using OLS
which are closer to the results from Kuroki. That is in line with other research that also reports
lower CIVs when using IV-2SLS models (Howley, 2017; Ólafsdóttir et al., 2020) and highlights
the importance of accounting for the endogeneity of income. In addition to accounting for
endogeneity and meaningfully including underweight in the analyses, this study extends the
work of Kuroki (2016) and Ásgeirsdóttir et al. (2020) exploring both the individual's own and


                                                 21
spouse's optimal BMI taking into consideration their interactions. Kuroki (2016) uses a 4-point
life satisfaction scale while this study applies a more granular 11-point scale. Furthermore, this
paper applies a single regression where the reference group is normal weight while Kuroki
(2016) performed a regression for obese where the reference group consisted of both normal
weight and overweight and then a separate regression for overweight where the reference group
is normal weight and obese, making his results difficult to interpret. As with Asgeirsdottir et al.
(2020), all our comparisons are to the normal weight category only, when BMI categories are
used or to optimal BMI when continuous BMI is used. Finally, Kuroki (2016) applies the median
income of the whole sample when calculating the CIV while this paper applies the average
income of men and women separately, as in Asgeirsdottir et al. (2020).
        Clark and Etilé (2011) explored the association of sub-optimal BMI levels and life
satisfaction controlling for spouse's BMI but did not produce CIV estimates. In their semi-
parametric approach, they find that the optimal BMI for women is in the range of 22-23, and 24-
25 for men (both unconditional on spouse's BMI). Our unconditional optimal BMI for women is
22.7 and 27.4 for men as seen in Table 4. They also find spouse's BMI to be negatively
correlated with own life satisfaction above a certain level and that own BMI is positively
correlated with life satisfaction in underweight men and negatively correlated with life
satisfaction above a certain threshold. Furthermore, the threshold increases with spouse's BMI
when the individual is overweight. These findings are consistent with the quadratic model
employed in equation (9) and with the point estimates given in Table 5. Our findings also show
that optimal BMI increases with spouse's BMI.
        Clark and Etilé (2010) remarked that BMI instrumentation is remarkably difficult to carry
out in this context. This paper does not include an instrumental variable for BMI and conclusions
on causality can thus not be made. Instrumentation might impact the results in a similar manner
as in Clark and Etilé (2011), and this could be explored further in future studies. Although
depression and life satisfaction are clearly measuring different aspects of an individual's well-
being, it is reassuring that instrumentation of BMI in depression regressions does not consistently
create biases in one direction (Huang et al., 2014; Jokela et al., 2012; Lawlor et al., 2011; Tyrell
et al., 2019; Walter et al., 2015; Willage et al., 2018).
        When comparing results from different studies on valuation of relief from sub-optimal
health conditions, a few things should be kept in mind. The specific type of model used has a

                                                  22
significant impact on the CIV estimates. Other factors include size of the data sets and the
number of waves collected, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of specific control variables.
One take-away from the above comparisons is that simple OLS models are likely to substantially
overestimate CIVs. Thus, when putting the results in context, it makes sense to compare them to
other findings that account for the well-known endogeneity of income. Ólafsdóttir et al. (2020)
studied the sub-optimal health condition of chronic pain and used mother's education as an
instrument for income. They found the CIV for chronic pain to range between $20,444 and
$52,925 per year depending on models used (Ólafsdóttir et al., 2020). Howley (2017) used
parental education as an instrument for income in a health application of the CIV method and
found the CIV's that range from approximately $7,600 per annum for asthma to approximately
$41,500 for congestive heart failure. Comparing these results to our CIV estimates for the obese
category, suggests that the CIV for obesity is somewhat below the findings of Ólafsdóttir et al.
(2020) while being within the range reported by Howley (2017) for women, with the CIV for
obese men below this range (see Table 3).
       It is quite remarkable how similar differences between OLS and instrumented results are
between studies. Our income coefficient generally increases on average by a multiple of 3.2, by
3.6 in the case of Ólafsdóttir et al. (2020) and by 3.5 by Howley (2017), even though different
data, contexts, and instruments are used. The multiples are even quite similar to ones found in
studies using happiness as the dependent variable and completely different instruments. Luttmer
(2005) for example instrumented the log of household income using industry and occupation
information of the respondent and their spouses together with national earnings information, and
they concluded that the income coefficient was 2.9 times higher than that found using OLS.
Although instruments are rarely perfect, this consistency provides some comfort. However, a
recent study using lottery winnings in Sweden to assess the impact of money on well-being does
not produce a similar result. Lindqvist et al. (2020) estimated the treatment effect of one unit of
log household income on standardized life-satisfaction to be 0.377, which is only about 30%
higher than our OLS coefficient. For completeness, we followed Asgeirsdottir et al. (2020) and
estimated our models for BMI categories, forcing the income coefficient to match the coefficient
reported by Lindquist et al. (2018). Those comparisons can be found in the Appendix, Table A3.
Although general patterns of results remain similar, calculated CIV amounts increase. Given the
similarity between the Lindqvist et al. (2020) coefficient and our OLS coefficient, the CIV from

                                                 23
this exercise is naturally similar to our OLS estimates and higher than our IV-2SLS results
(Table A3). The value of the Lindqvist et al. (2020) study is that it is based on income variations
that are convincingly exogenous, that is lottery outcomes. However, the concern is that the study
does not concurrently measure life satisfaction and lottery winnings but uses life satisfaction
lagged by between 5 and 22 years, under the assumption of consumption smoothing.
           Our research has some limitations. The results are based on self-reported key variables
such as life satisfaction, income, height and weight which may be biased. However, a strength of
this study is the rich dataset, which made for opportunities to estimate different models,
instrument for income, as well as to explore both the individual's own and spouse's optimal BMI
accounting for their interactions. The results therefore add to the expanding literature applying
the CIV method and shed light on aspects of the method, opportunities, and challenges. The main
contributions are fourfold. Firstly, the study adds to the existing literature by estimating CIV´s
for all BMI categories, not only the overweight and obese categories as in Kuroki (2016) or
Asgeirsdottir et al. (2020) who only do so in underpowered estimations. This has proved
important to shed light on gender differences and is especially important for males. Secondly,
the study estimates the CIV for the continuous form of own BMI, allowing for optimal BMI to
differ from the health-maximizing BMI on which WHO results are based. Thirdly, the study
calculates the CIV for BMI conditional on spouse's BMI, which to our knowledge has not been
done before, and highlights important gender differences and relative effects based on spousal
BMI. Lastly, the study makes several methodological improvements to the previously published
results.
           The main methodological take-away from the study is the importance of adjusting for the
endogeneity of income. The main implications for policy are the systematic gender differences in
weight preferences, with females being more sensitive to being over the optimal weight than
under, while men would be willing to forego considerable consumption possibilities to not be
underweight. Similarly, it is interesting how females are quite sensitive to their own weight,
while males are more sensitive to the weight of their spouses when above their optimal. This
study sheds light on the monetary value individuals put on being near their optimal BMI and on
the value of concordance in couple's BMI levels.
