Over-optimism in Forecasts by Official Budget Agencies and Its Implications

NBER Working Paper No. 17239
July 2011, Revised October 2011
JEL No. E62,H50

                                                 ABSTRACT

The paper studies forecasts of real growth rates and budget balances made by official government
agencies among 33 countries. In general, the forecasts are found: (i) to have a positive average bias,
(ii) to be more biased in booms, (iii) to be even more biased at the 3-year horizon than at shorter horizons.
This over-optimism in official forecasts can help explain excessive budget deficits, especially the
failure to run surpluses during periods of high output: if a boom is forecasted to last indefinitely,
retrenchment is treated as unnecessary. Many believe that better fiscal policy can be obtained by means
of rules such as ceilings for the deficit or, better yet, the structural deficit. But we also find: (iv) countries
subject to a budget rule, in the form of euroland’s Stability and Growth Path, make official forecasts
of growth and budget deficits that are even more biased and more correlated with booms than do other
countries. This effect may help explain frequent violations of the SGP. One country, Chile, has managed
to overcome governments’ tendency to satisfy fiscal targets by wishful thinking rather than by action.
As a result of budget institutions created in 2000, Chile’s official forecasts of growth and the budget
have not been overly optimistic, even in booms. Unlike many countries in the North, Chile took advantage
of the 2002-07 expansion to run budget surpluses, and so was able to ease in the 2008-09 recession.

       Over-optimism in Forecasts by Official Budget Agencies and Its Implications

                                           Jeffrey Frankel

        Many countries are apparently unable to bring budget deficits under control
though eager to do so. This used to be less true of countries in the “North,” those
traditionally known as industrialized, than of those in the “South” – that is to say,
developing countries. The problem of the former has gotten worse since 2000, however,
the same period during which many of the latter have escaped their past history of
excessive deficits and debts, attaining smaller deficits or even surpluses.

        The problem in the North is worse than just a tendency toward excessive budget
deficits on average. Some advanced countries have followed generally procyclical fiscal
policies since 2000: taking steps to cut tax rates and increase spending during expansion
and then moving in the opposite direction in response to recession. This pattern is likely
to exacerbate the swing in the business cycle. Because the United States, the United
Kingdom, and most members of the euro-zone failed to take advantage of the expansion
of 2002-2007 to attain budget surpluses, when global recession hit in 2008-09 they found
themselves with such high levels of debt that they felt constrained to tighten fiscal policy.
Meanwhile, China, Chile, and some other emerging market countries had attained
sufficiently strong fiscal positions by 2008 that they felt able to respond to the recession
with substantial easing; this helps explain why they experienced a shorter and less severe
downturn.

        There is a huge public choice literature offering political economy explanations
for excessive growth of government spending and budget deficits. Budget deficits are
often viewed as the product of politicians who have short horizons. Short horizons can in
turn be rational under a system where politicians’ terms in office are typically short and
they have different priorities on what they would like to spend money.1 Dispersed
political power has not only been associated with fiscal policies that are excessively expansionary
                                                                2
on average but also with those that are excessively procyclical. Other explanations for
budget deficits abound as well.3

        Of the various ways that governments can fail to save enough, especially in boom
times, this paper studies the possibility that official forecasts of revenue are overly
optimistic. If the official forecast is optimistic, there is no reason to take painful steps
such as cutting spending or raising taxes. A prominent example is the overly optimistic

U.S. budget forecasts made by the White House in 2001 and subsequent years. Its
unrealistic forecasts were plausibly a major reason for the failure of the United States to
take advantage of the opportunity to save during the 2002-07 expansion.4 European
governments, too, persistently explained away large deficits during this period with
unrealistic predictions that in the coming years the deficits would fall.

         Are such instances of over-optimism in official forecasts systematic enough to be
statistically significant? Is the forecasting bias worse during periods of expansion?
What is the role of budget rules, such as the Stability and Growth Pact? How can the
problem of excessive exuberance on the part of fiscal authorities during booms be
addressed? This paper explores the bias toward over-optimism in official forecasts of
GDP and budget balances among 33 countries. The bias probably contributes to
excessive deficits. A common prescription for excessive deficits is a budget rule. But
we find that a rule such as the Stability and Growth Pact only worsens the bias toward
over-optimism in official forecasts: political leaders meet their targets by adjusting their
forecasts rather than by adjusting their policies. The paper finds a possible solution in
Chile’s structural budget institutions, particularly its insulation of official forecasts from
political temptation.

1. Are official budget forecasts overly optimistic on average?

    There is already evidence that government budget forecasts in many countries are
overly optimistic on average, often because official estimates of economic growth are
overly optimistic.
    Studies of growth forecasts by US government agencies in the 1960s and 1970s used
to find them generally unbiased and as accurate as private sector forecasts. But
subsequent analyses found bias. McNees (1995) updated the time sample to 1994 and
found an optimistic bias in some official forecasts of long-term growth. Auerbach
(1994) found overly optimistic forecasts in the decade preceding 1993. Auerbach (1999)
again found a tendency for the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in its semi-
annual forecast to overestimate revenues during the period 1986-93, but found a tendency
to underestimate revenues during the period 1993-99 (during the Clinton
Administration). McNab, Rider, and Wall (2007) find that OMB’s one-year ahead
forecasts of US tax receipts were biased over the period 1963-2003. They suggest that
the bias may be strategic on the part of various administrations seeking to achieve
particular goals, such as overstating budget balance when the administration is seeking to
increase spending or cut taxes. Frendreis and Tatalovich (2000) find that US
administrations (OMB) are less accurate in estimating growth, inflation and
unemployment than are the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve Board.

4
 The White House claim in 2001 that budget surpluses over the subsequent ten years would total
nearly $5 trillion, in round numbers, was a major factor in the political ability of the new
administration to persuade the Congress to approve long-term tax cuts and spending increases.
The outcome was that the ten-year U.S. fiscal outlook soon swung to a cumulative $5 trillion
deficit. One component of the over-optimism was a belief that tax cuts would stimulate the
economic growth so much they would raise tax revenue rather than lowering it. (Frankel, 2003,
2008b.)


                                                                                              3
They find partisan bias, which they interpret as Republican administrations over-
forecasting inflation and Democratic administrations over-forecasting unemployment.
    Forni and Momigliano (2004) find optimism bias among OECD countries more
generally. Ashiya (2005) finds that official Japanese growth forecasts at a 16-month
horizon are biased upwards by 0.7 percentage points, and significantly less accurate than
private sector forecasts. Canada evidently underestimated its budget deficits in the late
1980s and early 1990s, but subsequently (1994-2004) overestimated them, perhaps to
reduce the risk of missing its target of a balanced budget under its strengthened
institutional framework (O’Neill, 2005; Mühleisen, et al, 2005).
    Jonung and Larch (2006) find a clear tendency for EU governments, when making
budget plans, to overestimate the economic growth rate. The tendency toward overly
optimistic forecasts is notably strong in Italy (the average bias is around 0.6 percentage
points per year) and Germany. The UK is the exception. A three-author team finds a
statistically significant optimism bias for some euro members: France, Italy and Portugal
over the period 1991-2002 (Strauch, et al., 2004), and Germany, Italy, Greece,
Luxembourg, and Portugal when the data set is updated to 2004 (Von Hagen, et al, 2009).
The UK, Finland and Sweden, on the other hand, tend to overestimate their deficits. In
light of this difference, it is suggestive that the UK and Sweden were not trying to get
into the euro, which was supposed to require meeting the fiscal criteria of the 1992
Maastricht Treaty, while the others were trying to get in, and are now there and thus
subject to the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).5 Brück and Stephan (2006) explicitly
conclude that Eurozone governments have manipulated deficit forecasts before elections
since the introduction of the SGP. Most of these authors argue that the systematic over-
optimism in ex ante forecasts translates directly into larger ex post deficits, and
particularly to deficits larger than targeted under the SGP.
    Similarly, Beetsma et al (2009) find that ex post budget balances among SGP
countries systematically fall short of official ex ante plans. Marinheiro (2010) adds
another complete business cycle to the data under the SGP, and again finds that the
forecasts of European fiscal authorities are overly optimistic on average. This evidence is
not consistently strong across the set of 15 EU countries, but the bias is again high for
France, Italy and Portugal at all forecast horizons.6 Beetsma et al (2011) decompose the
overall optimism bias in the budget forecasts of EU governments into the component that
arises between initial plans and the first release of actual budget numbers and the
component that arises between the first release and the final revised budget numbers.

    There is far less research into the forecasting records of fiscal authorities in low-
income or medium-income countries than in advanced countries. One reason is limited
availability of data. But some major emerging market countries became more
transparent about their budgets after the crises of the 1990s.

       It was possible to obtain government forecasts of the budget balance for 33
countries. A majority of the countries are European (26, of whom 17 are euro members,
counting Estonia, which was approved for membership in 2010). The heavy

representation of these countries in the sample is because, unlike most countries, they
report official budget forecast data – as a side-effect of the Stability and Growth Pact
itself. But the European data will allow us below to test for the effect on forecast bias of
the political pressure from a budget rule such as the SGP. Of the additional seven
countries, three are advanced commodity-exporting countries (Australia, Canada, and
New Zealand), three are middle-sized emerging market countries that also export
commodities (Chile, Mexico and South Africa), and the last is the United States.
Emerging markets are under-represented; but national sources must be consulted one by
one, and for most countries the answer is that such data are not available, and perhaps do
not exist in cumulative form even inside the government. Some countries report
forecasts two or three years ahead;
     Looking across countries, at the average budget forecasting errors of each, the general
pattern, as suspected, is overoptimism.7 In most cases, the positive bias emerges more
strongly at the 3-year horizon than the 2-year horizon and more at the 2-year horizon than
the 1-year horizon. The average across all countries is an upward bias of 0.2% of GDP
at the one-year horizon, 0.8% two years ahead, and a hefty 1.5% three years ahead. It is
no surprise that the absolute magnitude of forecast errors increases with the length of the
horizon; this would be true even if forecasts were optimal. But the upward trend in the
bias suggests that, the longer the horizon and the greater the genuine uncertainty, the
more the scope for wishful thinking.
         If bias in forecasts is a reason for excessive deficits in booms, one would expect
the problem to be worse in developing countries. Many authors have documented that
fiscal policy has tended to be procyclical in developing countries, especially in
comparison with industrialized countries. 8 Most studies look at the procyclicality of
government spending, because tax receipts are particularly endogenous with respect to
the business cycle. An important reason for procyclical spending is precisely that
government receipts from taxes or royalties rise in booms, and the government cannot
resist the temptation or political pressure to increase spending proportionately, or more
than proportionately. Procyclicality has historically been especially pronounced in
countries that possess natural resources and where income from those resources tends to
dominate the business cycle.9
     Interestingly, the bias in our sample of 33 countries is not greater for commodity
producers or developing countries than it is for others, even though such countries have
been observed to have more highly procyclical fiscal policies historically than advanced
countries. The US and UK forecasts have substantial positive biases around 3% of GDP
at the three-year horizon (approximately equal to their actual deficit on average; in other
words, on average they repeatedly forecast a disappearance of their deficits that never
came). The forecast biases in the euro countries have already been noted from the
literature. But official budget forecasts in South Africa were overly pessimistic on

average as were those for Canada and New Zealand. Mexico is slightly overoptimistic on
average. Chile had no optimism bias; the conclusion of this paper will be that this
achievement was the result of admirable budget institutions that insulate the forecasting
process from political pressure.10

2. Are official growth forecasts overly optimistic on average?

    One likely reason for upward bias in official budget forecasts, in advanced and
developing countries alike, is upward bias in economic assumptions such as economic
growth and commodity prices. This is hypothesis of central interest in the paper. But
we should note that there are other possible reasons as well why official budget forecasts
could be overly optimistic on average. The official forecast may represent the desired
target in the plan of the executive, but there could be slippage by the time the final
expenditures are made, due to the usual political pressures.11 Those who write the initial
budget plan may even be fully aware of this tendency toward slippage and may place a
lower priority on statistically unbiased forecasts than on setting an ambitious goal so as to
achieve as strong a final outcome as possible.

    We look at the mean errors made by government forecasts of the rate of growth of
GDP, for our same sample 33 countries.12 Again the overall pattern is an upward bias
on average, which rises with the length of the horizon: 0.4 % when looking one year
ahead, 1.1 % at the two-year horizon, and 1.8% at three years. Again, the bias appears in
the US and many other advanced countries, and not necessarily among the commodity
producers in this sample.13 Chile on average under-forecast its growth rate, by 0.8 per
cent at the one-year horizon. South Africa was just slightly too optimistic on average
(0.2 per cent at the one-year horizon), and Mexico more so (1.7 per cent).

    Of more central interest for this paper are cyclical patterns in forecast errors. Is the
problem that government officials tend to get carried away during expansions,
unrealistically extrapolating them indefinitely into the future? Fewer authors have looked
for cyclical patterns in the systematic forecast errors made by national authorities than
unconditional average errors. One possible exception: an implication of Marinheiro

   I explore Chile’s achievement of countercyclical fiscal policy and the role of official forecasts
in greater detail elsewhere: Frankel (2011).
11
   Cárdenas, Mejía, and Olivera (2009) show how this process works for Colombia. There may
also be slippage that is not captured in the final budget numbers, because it takes place in “off
budget” agencies or categories.

   The country-by-country averages for growth forecasts are reported in Appendix Table 2 of
Frankel (2011).
13
   The commodity exporters in this data set almost certainly represent some sample selection bias,
in that only governments that are transparent enough to publish their budget forecasts are
included, for obvious reasons. Thus we do not emphasize tests of whether official forecasts
behave differently for commodity exporters than for others. Such tests appear to show that the
special commodity exporters in our sample are actually less optimistic than others. [Appendix
Table 3 in the January 2011 working paper.]


                                                                                                  6
  (2007) seems to be that European policy makers have underestimated growth after the
  trough of the business cycle.14

  3. The influence of macroeconomic fluctuations on budget balances

          Before we attempt to detect systematic cyclical patterns in the errors made in
  official forecast of budget deficits, it would be useful to confirm that a few
  macroeconomic variables such as the real growth rate are in fact key to the ex post
  determination of the actual budget balance. Then we will know to look to over-optimism
  in forecasts of these macroeconomic variables as a possible source of any observed over-
  optimism in budget forecasts.
          In Table 1a we regress the ex post budget outcome (expressed relative to the ex
  ante attempt to predict it) against the ex post real growth rate (again expressed relative to
  the forecast), for our full set of countries. At all three horizons, the growth rate is highly
  significant at determining the budget balance. For every 1 per cent of growth, relative to
  what was forecast a year previously, the budget improves by about half that amount,
  relative to what was forecast a year previously. The same is true at the two-year and
  three-year horizons. Thus we are likely to find over-optimism in forecasting the budget
  where we find over-optimism in predicting real growth.
          In some countries, inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax bracket.15
  Accordingly, in Table 1b we add the inflation rate as another possible determinant of the
  budget balance. (Both are again expressed relative to the official ex ante forecasts.) The
  finding is that inflation does indeed translate into a strong budget surplus, to a statistically
  significant degree at the two- and three-year horizon.16

  14
     The time period is 1999-2006. He is motivated by the finding of Galí and Perotti (2003) that
  discretionary fiscal policy became more countercyclical among euro countries after the
  Maastricht Treaty, and attributes it to cyclically-systematic forecast errors rather than to ex ante
  intentions on the part of fiscal authorities, which were actually procyclical.
  15
     At high levels of inflation, the Tanzi effect can go the other direction: Due to lags in tax
  collection, inflation erodes the real value of tax receipts and can worsen the budget deficit.
  16
     These tables allow random effects by country [which facilitates comparison across the three
  columns even though the sample of countries diminishes]. Results without random effects are
  reported in the January 2011 working paper. There the effect of inflation appeared a bit stronger

   4. Are budget forecasts more prone to over-optimism in booms?
            We now return to examination of the cyclical pattern of bias in government
   forecasts. Table 2 goes beyond testing for unconditional over-optimism in official budget
   forecasts, to see if the bias is greater in a boom, here measured as the deviation of output
   from a quadratic trend. The cyclical term is indeed positive and highly significant: over-
   optimism tends to be greater in booms. Its estimated magnitude rises as we move from
   the one year horizon to the two year horizon, and again as we move to the three year
   horizon. This makes sense: there is more scope for wishful thinking at longer horizons
   because the uncertainty is genuinely higher. But there is also evidence of a bias toward
   optimism even when GDP is at its trend value: the constant term is positive, and
   statistically significant at the two- and three-year horizons.

        We have four important findings so far and they are visible in Figures 1a-1c.
First, budget forecasts in most countries are biased upwards. (Most points appear above
the zero level of budget prediction error). Second, Chile is an exception. (The Xs in
Figure 1a mostly lie below the zero level.) Third the bias is greater at longer horizons.
(Compare the Figures with each other.) And fourth, the bias is greater in booms. (A
regression line slopes upward.) 17

5. Budget rules
         A common prescription to fix budget deficits that are too high on average and too
procyclical is by means of institutions that constrain fallible politicians, such as formal
rules to constrain fiscal policy.18 Examples of such rules are the budget deficit ceilings
that supposedly constrain members of euroland (3 % of GDP under the Stability and
Growth Pact) or U.S. proposals for a Balanced Budget Amendment (zero deficit). But
those attempts have failed, in part because they are too rigid to allow the need for deficits
in recessions, counterbalanced by surpluses in good times.
         It is not always the case that “tougher” constraints on fiscal policy increase
effective budget discipline. Countries often violate their constraints. In an extreme set-
up, a rule that is too rigid – so rigid that official claims that it will be sustained are not
credible -- might even lead to looser fiscal outcomes than if a more moderate and flexible
rule had been specified at the outset.19 Certainly euro countries large and small have
repeatedly violated the fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, originally a simple
ceiling on the budget deficit of 3% of GDP. The main idea that Brussels has had for
enforcement of the SGP is that a government that was unable to reduce its budget deficit
to the target would have to pay a substantial fine, which of course would add to the
budget deficit -- an enforcement mechanism that seems unlikely to help the credibility of
the rule.20
         Credibility can be a problem for budget institutions either with or without
uncertainty regarding the future path of the economy. Consider first the nonstochastic
case. Even in cases where the future proceeds as expected when the rule was formulated,
the target may be up against predictably irresistible political pressures. Special Fiscal
Institutions, which include fiscal rules and fiscal responsibility legislation, are often
abandoned before long.21
         The case of rules that are too onerous to last arises particularly in the stochastic
context. A target that might have been a reasonable goal ex ante, such as an

18
     Those who emphasize the role of institutions or rules in delivering more responsible fiscal
policy include Buchanan (1967), von Hagen and Harden (1995), Alesina and Perotti (1995,
1996), Poterba (1997), Poterba and von Hagen (1999), Persson and Tabellini (2004), Wyplosz
(2005), Calderón and Schmidt-Hebbel (2008), and Calderón, Duncan and Schmidt-Hebbel
(2010). For commodity exporters and developing countries more specifically: Alesina,
Hausmann, Hommes, and Stein (1999), Davis et al (2001, 2003), Ossowski, et al (2008), and
Stein, Talvi, and Grisanti (1999), among others
19
   Neut and Velasco (2003).
20
   An analogous example outside the realm of macroeconomic policy is the idea that the Kyoto
Protocol on Global Climate Change would be enforced by a provision requiring countries that
exceeded their allocation of greenhouse gas emissions in one period to cut emissions even further
below target in the subsequent period, a penalty with interest. One might as well tell someone in
a diet plan that if they fail to lose 5 pounds in the first week, then they have to lose 10 pounds in
the second week.
21
   An econometric analysis of these Special Financial Institutions for oil-producers by Ossowski,
et al (2008, pp. 19, 23, 24, 38-43) finds no statistically significant effect on the actual fiscal
stance. This may be partly due to econometric limitations. But it is evidently also in part due to
governments that, after having adopted these institutions, subsequently find them too rigid in
practice and so weaken or abandon them.


                                                                                                  11
unconditionally balanced budget, becomes unreasonable after an unexpected shock, such
as a severe fall in export prices or national output. Common examples are rigid balanced
budget rules that do not allow the possibility of fiscal deficits in bad times. A sensible
alternative is to specify rules that mandate changes in response to changed circumstances.
Instead of targeting an actual budget balance of zero, or some other numerical surplus,
the rule can target a number for the structural or cyclically adjusted budget.
        This alternative may not work, however, if the political process determines
whether a particular deficit is judged structural or not. Politicians can always attribute a
budget deficit to unexpectedly and temporarily poor economic growth. Since there is no
way of proving what an unbiased forecast of growth is, there is no way of disproving the
politicians’ claim that the shortfall is not their responsibility. Thus the rule does not
necessarily succeed in imposing discipline.


6. Are official budget forecasts more prone to over-optimism when the deficit is
subject to a rule?
         An interesting question is whether a legal agreement to target a particular budget
balance can result in official budget forecasts that have a tendency to be more overly
optimistic than they would otherwise be. Beetsma, Giuliodori, and Wierts (2009) use
the phrase “planning to cheat” to describe biased forecasts in rule-bound countries. If
formal constraints on the budget deficit, by themselves, are likely to lead to bias in
official budget forecasts, they might in theory even thereby lead to less budget discipline
than in a country without rules. The question of whether rules impair forecasting is
distinct, however, from the question whether rules help deliver fiscal discipline.22
         It is highly suggestive that Italy and other Mediterranean countries, the EU
countries that had to work the hardest to meet the Maastricht fiscal criteria, are also the
ones found by several studies to have had the greatest bias in their forecasts. Recall that
in the estimates of Jonung and Larch (2006), the UK is the country that does not show
significant over-optimism. Since the UK has not sought entrance into the euro, their
finding is consistent with the possibility that the bias is euro-related. Beetsma et al
(2010) find that in the Netherlands forecasts of growth rates (by the Economics Agency)
and revenue (by the Finance Ministry) have been realistic, unlike overoptimistic
projections in other EU countries. They attribute the recent record in part to a new
regime of “trend-based budget policy.” Thus the literature is consistent with the
hypothesis that formal adoption of a budget deficit ceiling may, by itself, induce a
tendency toward over-optimism in official forecasts, but that over-optimism can be
counteracted by the right sort of fiscal regime or institution.
         We report our own tests of the “planning to cheat” hypothesis, on a bigger data set
than the earlier studies. The examples of rule-bound countries are the euro members, as
in the literature. But rather than comparing them only to other European countries, we
also include others, including a number of commodity producers.



22
   For example, if we find a tendency toward overoptimistic forecasts, it could be only a partial offset to
tighter fiscal discipline. Or we may find that forecasts are not overly optimistic at all, and yet budget
deficits could turn out to violate legal constraints nonetheless.

  7. Is over-optimism in growth forecasts worse in booms?

         We saw above that for most countries, the evolution of the actual budget deficit at
  a one-year horizon is heavily influenced by the evolution of the economy, particularly
  GDP. In this section we test if the cyclical component to errors in budget forecasting
  derives to some extent from an analogous cyclical component to errors in economic
  forecasting. Table 4 tests if growth forecasts tend to be more overoptimistic when the
  economy is at a cyclical peak, here measured as the deviation of GDP from a quadratic
  trend. The answer is a resounding yes, especially as the horizon of the forecast
  lengthens, just as we found with forecasts of the budget deficit.

  GDP devq ≡ GDP as deviation from quadratic trend.
  Variable is lagged so that it lines up with the year the forecast was made in and not the year being forecast.




          The next step, in Tables 5a, 5b, and 5c, is to see if the pattern is worse among
  rule-bound countries. In every case, the term that interacts the SGP dummy with GDP
  has a significantly positive effect on the error made in forecasting output, very much like
  the positive effect in forecasting the budget. In other words, when the economy is at a
  cyclical high in rule-bound countries, forecasters tend to extrapolate, as if the boom
  would last forever. The significant positive coefficient on the SGP dummy in Table 4b
  diminishes or even disappears when we include the interactive term. Evidently the boost
  that a budget rule gives to the optimism bias, above and beyond the bias in other
  countries, comes in booms.

   All variables are lagged so that they line up with the year in which the forecast was made and not the year being forecast.

            We also tested for signs of forecast bias in potential member countries during the
    5 years preceding successful entrance to the euro. We did find statistically significant
    upward bias in their growth forecasts, but no evidence of over-optimism in their budget
    forecasts.23 A natural interpretation is that the political pressure of the Maastricht criteria
    was reflected in the actual ex post budget performance -- or at least in the ex post budget
    numbers reported -- because approval of admission was a successful enforcement
    mechanism, but that these governments had no incentive to exaggerate their prospects
    ahead of time.


    8. Are official forecasts overly optimistic at cyclical lows as well as highs?
            We have noted some evidence consistent with the idea that over-optimism thrives
    when genuine uncertainty is higher: the pattern whereby it increases with the horizon of
    the forecast. Uncertainty is probably greater at cyclical highs and lows, because it is
    difficult to tell whether the recent movement is temporary or permanent. These
    considerations suggest a further hypothesis worthy of testing: that forecasts are overly
    optimistic not just at the top of the business cycle, but at the bottom as well. The simplest
    way to test this hypothesis is to transform our cyclical independent variable, which has
    been expressed as the deviation of GDP from trend, to the absolute value of that
    deviation. Tables 6a and 6b offer strong support for the hypothesis as a characterization
    of bias in official forecasts of the budget balance. Tables 7a and 7b support the
    hypothesis for bias in official forecasts of economic growth. (R2s are higher too.)
    Evidently official forecasters are overly optimistic both in booms and busts, more so than
    when GDP is at its long-run trend. They over-estimate the permanence of the booms and
    the transitoriness of the busts. The pattern is worse for Europeans than for others.

9. Proposed solution: Follow Chile in insulating budget forecasting from politics

        We have hypothesized that one reason advanced countries have sometimes run
excessive deficits in periods of expansion is excessive optimism in official forecasts of
growth rates and budgets. We then supported the hypothesis with statistical evidence of
precisely such a bias. The paper began, however, by noting that some countries in the
South have since 2000 managed to achieve countercyclical policy, taking advantage of
the 2002-07 boom years to attain surpluses. This achievement is all the more remarkable
among countries dependent on exports of minerals and other commodities, because they
are the ones that have historically been especially procyclical. How have they done it?

        Consider the especially instructive example of Chile, a country highly dependent
on volatile copper exports.24 During the years 2003-08 copper prices rose, the economy
grew strongly, and government revenues increased rapidly. Unlike so many other
commodity exporting countries in the past, Chile saved most of this bonanza. Public
saving and national saving both rose strongly. Government debt fell and the sovereign
spread gradually declined. By 2007 Chile had become a net creditor. Its sovereign debt
rating climbed above that of its Latin American neighbors and even ahead of some
advanced countries.
        By the time copper prices reached a peak in 2008, the political pressure on the
government to spend the revenue had become intense. The insistence of the
government on saving the money for a “rainy day” helped push its poll ratings to very
low levels. In 2009, the global recession hit, copper prices fell sharply, and the Chilean
economy turned down as well. Yet, in the span of one year, the polls reversed
dramatically: the President and her Finance Minister attained the highest popularity
rating of any officials since the restoration of democracy in Chile twenty years earlier.
(See Figure 2.) The reason is that, now that the rainy day had arrived, the government
increased spending liberally, thereby moderating the downturn. It was in a good position
to do this, with no loss to its creditworthiness, because of the exemplary saving that had
come before.

        How was Chile able to achieve a countercyclical fiscal policy during the years
2000-2010? The actions of individual leaders were important. But equally important
was an institutional framework within which the political process operated. Chile
introduced a structural balance regime for fiscal policy in 2000 and codified it legally in
2006. Under this regime the government must set a structural budget target. It can run
a deficit larger than the target only to the extent that: (1) output falls short of its long-run
trend, in a recession, or (2) the price of copper is below its 10-year trend. If GDP and
the price of copper are above their long-run trends, the government must save the
resulting revenue in the form of surpluses. The key institutional innovation is that there
are two panels of experts whose job it is each mid-year to make the judgments,
respectively, what is the output gap and what is the medium term equilibrium price of
copper, rather than leaving the job to government officials.


24
   Frankel (2011) explains Chile’s structural budget rule in greater detail and gives further
references.


                                                                                                18
        Chile’s official forecasts have not been subject to the same bias toward over-
optimism that typifies other countries. If anything, its forecasts have erred on the
pessimistic side. The official forecast of real growth has fallen short of the ex post
numbers by an average of 0.8 per cent at the one-year horizon. The official forecast of
the budget surplus as a percentage of GDP has fallen short of the ex post numbers by an
average of 1.4 per cent at the one-year horizon.25 In Figure 1a, the observations
corresponding to Chile are indicated by Xs. Most lie below the line of zero budget
forecast errors and almost all of those that lie above miss by only a small margin. There
is no tendency for the forecast error to rise in booms, as with other countries.
        Chile’s fiscal institutions have apparently enabled it to avoid the problem of
official forecasts that fall prey to wishful thinking. Downturns or budget deficits are not
explained away with unrealistic forecasts of dramatic improvement; booms and
surpluses are not unrealistically extrapolated into the future.
        Any country could apply variants of the Chilean fiscal device. Countries could
set up independent institutions charged by law with estimating the output gap and such
other budget-relevant macroeconomic variables as the inflation rate and the fractions of
GDP going to wage versus non-wage income. A reinforcement of the Chilean idea
would be to give the panels legal independence. There could be laws protecting them
from being fired, as there are for governors of independent central banks. One could
imagine also broadening the responsibility of such panels beyond simply estimating the
long-run trend in income. The principle of a separation of decision-making powers
would be retained: only elected political leaders determine how spending is allocated or
taxes are raised.
        The United Kingdom in 2010 established an Office of Budgetary Responsibility,
designed explicitly to be independent and free of political bias. In addition to making
forecasts, the OBR scrutinizes the Treasury’s costing of Budget measures, judges
progress towards the Government’s fiscal targets, and assesses the long-term
sustainability of the public finances. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office, in addition
to making forecasts, estimates the fiscal impact of any sort of proposed measures and
undertakes a wide variety of research to aid in federal economic and budgetary decisions.
        Formal independence is no guarantee that fiscal over-optimism will be eliminated.
For one thing, analysts can make mistakes even if independent. For another thing,
politicians can sometimes “game” the institution. For example, US politicians have
legislated tax cuts with phony expiration dates to force CBO to issue a baseline forecast
of limited revenue loss, even while they publically declare their intention to extend the
tax cuts when the date of expiration arrives.
        Nevertheless the results of this paper suggest that any institutions that could
insulate budget forecasts from political temptations and make them more realistic could
eliminate a systematic tendency toward over-optimism that in many countries has
contributed to excessive budget deficits in expansions.
