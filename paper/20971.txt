The Catch-22 of External Validity in the Context of Constraints to Firm Growth
Greg Fischer and Dean Karlan
NBER Working Paper No. 20971
February 2015
JEL No. M1,O1

                                             ABSTRACT

We document the presence of multiple and varied constraints to small and medium firm growth. This
presents both a practical problem for business training programs and a challenge to academic economists
trying to identify mechanisms though which these programs may affect outcomes. External validity
needs theory. This pushes researchers to narrowly defined and highly selected sample frames, which
limits the potential for clear, generalizable policy prescriptions. Ultimately, larger samples, multi-arm
evaluations, process documentation, and narrowly-focused, theory-supported empirical work are all
needed, but the complexity of the problem limits what we learn from any single study.
