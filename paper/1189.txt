     The current crisis in international 'ending points up a lesson re—learned

several times in the past 150 years: the international loan markets function

very differently from the textbook model of competitive lending. This paper

discusses various extensions of the basic model.    First, we amend the textbook
model to show how limitations on a government's
                                                   taxing authority may greatly
affect its optima]. borrowing strategy.   Second, we explore the implications of a
debtor country's option to repudiate debt.    Third, we show that efficient

lending may require collective actions by bank syndicates, and that a breakdown

in collective action can result in serious inefficiencies and even financial

panics.

  I.    Introduction

        The current crisis in international
                                               lending points up a lesson re—learned
  several times in the past 150
                                  years: the international loan markets function
 very differently from the textbook model of
                                                 competitive lending. In the simple
 model, borrowers have ready access to loans at a given interest rate; they enter

 the loan market to finance all
                                   investment projects with positive present value
 at the prevailing interest
                              rate; and they use loans to equate the marginal

 utility of consumption at various points in
                                                 time. Actual lending behavior is
 far from this rosy view. Borrowers
                                        are extensively rationed in the

 international markets; they may be unable to obtain credit at any price, much

 less the posted market price.    Highly profitable investment projects may be left
 standing for want of foreign capital, or
                                            worse, may be abandoned mid-stream
 after creditors withdraw capital in a sudden loss of confidence. Various

institutions, such as the IMF and the BIS, have
                                                    an acknowledged role in
maintaining stability in the loan markets, even though such institutions are

superfluous in the simple model.

       The large gap between theory and practice has led to a search for new

theoretical concepts to explain actual loan behavior. A number of recent models

have taken seriously the
                           possibility of debt repudiation (or "sovereign risk")
on loans to developing country
                                  governments, and have shown that such a risk

radically alters the behavior of borrowers and lenders.      The presence of
sovereign risk can help to explain credit
                                              rationing, debt re—scheduling,
conditionality, and even the maturity structure of
                                                      international obligations
(see [6], [17]). Other models (e.g., [19]) have shown that credit

rationing may arise for other reasons as well, such as when lenders cannot
                                        —2—


                                                           Still other models (e.g.
evaluate the risk categories of potential borrowers.

                                                   financial systems in
[9]) have explored the interaction of the domestic

developing countries with international borrowing, to derive more useful policy

guidelines for international borrowing decisions.

     These new models are helpful not only in restoring the relevance of a

central class of economic models but also in shedding light on actual loan market

behavior. The theoretical advances can help us to define the proper role of the

IMF in the present debt crisis, and of the banks and borrowing countries in a

very imperfect market.

        This paper discusses some of the elements needed for a richer and more

realistic model of international lending to developing—country governments. It

draws on recent work and offers some new results as well, aimed at highlighting

what is right and wrong with the standard models of international lending. The

textbook case is both insightful and a natural starting point for discussion.

It is treated in Section II of the paper. We then proceed to three areas of
                                                             fundamentally alter our
that model, to show how more realistic assumptions can

views of borrower and lender behavior. The first revision comes in modelling

 the borrowing country itself. The textbook case treats the borrower as a

 "representative agent" maximizing utility subject to a budget constraint based
                                                  most international borrowing is by
 on national wealth (described below). Since

 governments or government enterprises, the textbook model implicitly assumes
                                                                     wealth. We follow
 that   governments   have an unlimited taxing power over national

 Kharas [9]   in   introducing a limit to the government's taxing authority, and

 show that optimal borrowing strategies may     be   quite different from standard
                                         —3—



  prescriptions.   In particular, governnent should no longer borrow in order to
  finance all investment projects with
                                         a positive present value at world interest
  rates. Such a strategy almost
                                  surely leads to slow growth and a credit squeeze.
       The second extension to the textbook model comes in the assumption about

  loan repayments. Standard models assume that loans are repaid as a long
                                                                          as
 resources are available to repay them.
                                            Implicitly, the models assume that the
 costs to a country of repudiating its
                                          debts always outweigh the benefits. There
 is no doubt that the costs of debt
                                       repudiation are high, in both economic and
 diplomatic terms. Nevertheless,
                                    governments have at times preferred unilateral
 debt repudiation (or at least
                                 a unilateral debt moratorium) to the arduous and
 politically unpopular task of servicing a
                                               heavy debt burden, even when the debt
 servicing was technically feasible.

      In the middle third of the paper, the textbook model is extended by giving

 the borrower the option of debt repudiation. The costs and benefits of debt

repudiation are made explicit, and all market participants are assumed to

understand these costs and benefits. A number of important implications
                                                                        are
then derived. Most obviously, the repudiation risk leads to an upward—sloping

supply of funds to borrowing countries, and to
                                                   credit rationing once high levels
of indebtedness are reached. Less
                                     intuitively, a number of inefficiencies arise
in the dynamic behavior of borrowing
                                       countries, since the default risk distorts
several of the borrower's incentives. Debtors
                                                   may be led to: (1) overborrow
period to period, relative to a path that would maximize ex ante expected

utility; (2) over—invest in risky projects at the expense of safe projects,

relative to a choice that would maximize
                                           ex ante utility; and (3) over—consume
                                    —4—


and under—invest relative to levels that would maximize ex ante expected

utility.

     The problems arise from the inability of borrowers to pre—commit themselves

to certain behavior once a loan is arranged. For example, a borrower might try

to convince lenders that it will act prudentially, and avoid overly risky

investments, in order to attract large loans at low rates. The problem is that
                                                 reduce the expected burden of the
after the loan is made, the borrower can often

debt by going ahead with the risky projects (or by over-borrowing, or

over—consuming, etc.). Since creditors anticipate that these actions will in

fact be pursued, they charge a risk premium for them in the original loan

contract. Not surprisingly, borrowers are best off when they can convincingly

foreswear these actions and thereby reduce their initial cost of borrowing. In

domestic capital markets, bond covenants are used for that purpose. In the

international markets, convincing ways to foreswear such costly behavior have

yet to be found.

      The third extension to the basic model involves loan supply behavior. The

                                            the institutional structure of lending.
 competitive loan model typically ignores

 Credit is assumed to be supplied elastically at a given interest rate, and

 little attention is paid as to whether that lending comes from a bank loan or a

 bond flotation, a single lender or a syndicate, etc. In fact, the nature of

 intermediation can be of profound importance.    Inherent risk considerations

 coupled with prudential bank lending rules have resulted in the syndication as

 the preferred form of lending. A standard loan to a borrowing country may be

 syndication   is that member banks do not necessarily act in their collective
                                                                               best

 interest when key contingencies arise, as would be the case, for example, if the

 loan were made by a single bank operating in a competitive environment.

      Many actions that a syndicate should take have "public good" features to

 them. For example, efficient loan packages may require that banks monitor a

 country's economic performance after a loan is made, but the banks may     have    no

 way to share in the finance of that monitoring. Even if the need
                                                                      for monitoring
 is clear, each bank might try to be a free rider on the monitoring expenditures

 of other banks. An insufficient amount of monitoring would result. More

 importantly, an efficient loan package sometimes requires that banks re—finance

 the debts of a heavily indebted country, at below market rates, in order to keep

it from imminent default. Collectively, the need
                                                      for re—scheduling may be
clear, but once again each individual bank might try to withdraw its own credits

in order to leave the debt burden to the other banks.

     The most dramatic breakdown of loan supply comes in a panic, in which a

fundamentally sound economy is forced into default by a shortage of credit.

This type of market failure can result from the rational behavior of a large

number of small lenders. Each bank rationally bases its loan supply decision

regarding a country on the actions of the other banks.      Suppose, for example,
that a country needs a large loan to tide it over a short—run fall in income.

If all banks but one stop lending, only a very large loan from the remaining

bank may save the country from default. But such a large loan may be
                                                                     precluded
by risk or regulatory considerations. Thus, if no other banks loan to the

country, the given bank may   also   choose to stop loaning; whereas if the other
                                     —6—



banks were to continue their loans, the given bank could safely contribute a

share of the total credit line. In these situations, two equilibria may
                                                                        be

present. In the favorable case, all banks continue to lend; in a panic, all

banks stop lending, because the others have stopped lending, and the "healthy"

country finds itself forced into default.

     There are several ways to overcome the collective action problems of the

creditors, though none is costless or foolproof. Syndicated loans typically
                                                            such as monitoring or
include loan managers, who provide public—good services,

legal representation, in return for management fees. Also, informal "fair

share" rules have emerged in the course of re—schedulings, in which various

burdens are divided on the basis of the banks' existing shares in the total

                                             institutions like the IMP (and to a

public-good aspects of international lending, such as monitoring and enforcement

costs.

  II. The Basic Model of International Borrowing

        Consider the standard borrowing problem facing a social planner of a small

 open economy (see [2], [3], [14] for examples). The economy produces a pure traded

 good in amount               in period t, according to a production function           =
                                                                                            F(Kt,Lt).
 The labor supply is exogenous (or perfectly elastic with a fixed wage w). The

 capital stock evolves according to the equation Kt+i =
                                                                    Kt(1_d)   +
                                                                                  't'   where I is
 gross investment and d is the rate of depreciation. In the closed
                                                                                    economy,
 total spending (the sum of consumption and investment) is equal to output. In

 the open economy, spending can be augmented by foreign borrowing. It is typical

 to assume that the economy can engage in one-period international loans at given

world interest rates. Let Dt+i be the stock of loans undertaken at time t for

re—payment at time t+1 , and let r be the real rate of interest on the loan (we

will simplify substantially and assume that r is fixed through time). With

national output given by                national income (denoted by        is given by             net
of interest payments on debt coming due:               'ft =   — rDt.   Total consumption in
period t is national income minus investment plus net new borrowing:

C. =   'ft   —
                 't   +
                          (Dt+i_Dt).
       The model is closed by specifying the terms of borrowing. How much can the

borrower borrow? The standard assumption here is that the borrower can attract

any loan that can feasibly be paid back. The incentive to make the necessary

loan repayments is simply assumed. In a finite—horizon version of the model,

say T periods, it is also assumed that there is no last—period debt, 80                     that
DT+l     0. The borrower faces the set of constraints:
                                                                     -8-

By a simple set of manipulations we                                  can    re—write   (1)   as:


             T              i.                         T               (.     \
(2)           E (i+rY"1 1C.                             z   (1+r)1            1(Q_I) — (1+r)D1
            i=1                                       i=1


This equation implicitly defines an upper bound to borrowing. Note that

 E (1+r)1_1) must be non—negative, since C. is non—negative. Therefore, by
                                          1

bringing    (1+r)D1 to the left—hand side of the inequality in (2) we find that:


                                             T              I.

In    any period t, we could perform the same                                     manipulations    for the remaining T—t

periods, to find

                                             T                  i.    \

Equation (4) states a very important point:
             In order for debt re—payment to be feasible, i.e. ,                                       for   DT+1   0,

             indebtedness at any time must be less than national productive
                                                     —9—


            wealth, where the latter is defined as the maximum                 discounted
            value of GDP net of investment in the
                                                                  remaining periods.
       If the constraint in (4) is ever strictly binding, it implies that

 consumption is zero along the entire remaining growth path. For that reason

 it is unlikely that an optimal borrowing
                                                           program involves borrowing Dt up to its
 maximum feasible level. It is a simple matter to transform (4) to the appro-

 priate expression for the infinite—horizon case.
                                                                   Feasibility conditions for
 re-payment in that case are found simply by replacing T with                   in (4):



 ()         (1+r)Dt         max           (1+rY(1t)(Q._I.)             (Infinite-Horizon Case)

                               i=t


      Now, let us state the full borrowing problem.

The infinite-horizon problem is found simply by substituting                   for T in (6).

This problem has been heavily explored, in various guises, in the economics

and planning literature, and in various degrees of sophistication. When stated

as in (6) ,   the problem results in the following necessary conditions of

optimization.

                                                                                  (1+r)D1
              i=1                               i=1

                                            (7)(a) states that the
There are three main conditions here. First
international loan market should be used to equate the marginal utility of

 consumption in each period, U, with a discounted marginal utility of wealth

 X(1+r)1. Second, (7)(b) states that investments should be undertaken in each

 period (except the last) in order to equate the marginal product of capital,

 aF/BK with the cost of capital, r                        +   d.   Finally, (7)(c) holds that the

                                                                          discounted value of total
 discounted value of total consumption equals the

 productive wealth net of initial indebtedness.                          We see from (2) that this

 condition is equivalent to assuming that DT+1 =                         0.

       The conditions (7)(a)—(c) are also properties of richer models, e.g., those
                                                 —11—


 that allow for productivity shocks or terms—of—trade fluctuations. When

 carefully interpreted they describe many of the standard guidelines in the

 development literature for foreign borrowing. For example, (7)(a) is really a

 prescription to smooth consumption over time relative to
                                                                     income, by borrowing
 when output is low relative to trend and
                                                     paying back loans, on net, when output
 is high. (See [14] and [16] for this interpretation). The country should

 borrow in order to finance consumption
                                                   during a temporary drop in income, but
 not during a permanent drop in the trend of income. On close analysis, (7)(a)

 makes explicit the IMF dictum to finance
                                                     temporary shocks, but "adjust" to per-
manent shocks.

       Equation (7)(b) states the standard cost—benefit condition for investment

projects in a small open economy. Regardless of the consumption stream, the

planner should invest so as to equate the marginal product of capital, evaluated

at world market prices, with the cost of capital also at world market prices. A

nearly equivalent condition is that all projects should be undertaken with posi-

tive present value at the world market prices and interest rates.

       A useful simplification for solving the borrowing model is to write utility

as additively separable:




                                       T
(8)
           u(c1 ,c2 ,...   ,CT)
                                  =     z u(C.)(i+S) 1
                                      i= 1
That   is, total utility is the sum of sub—utilities based on consumption in each

period. These sub—utilities are discounted according to the subjective rate of
                                                   —12—



time preference, 6. With this formulation, (7)(a) becomes u =

From    this   point forward, we will assume additive separability.

                                                                                be the maximum value
        A second transformation is also helpful. Let V(Kt ,Dt)

of utility that a borrower can achieve starting with Kt ,Dt.                     It is found   by

plugging the solution from (6) into the utility function.                      Then a T—period


or infinite horizon problem can be reduced to a two-period or three-period
                                                          be re—written as:

                (where U1      signifies      au/ac1)

 III. International Borrowing with Domestic Financial Constraints

         We now expand the model to allow for an explicit role for public—sector
                                       —13—


  financial variables. For simplicity we illustrate our results in the three—

  period version of the model just introduced.

      Kharas [9], Katz [8], and others have pointed out that the pure

 borrowing model should differentiate between the
                                                    private and public sectors and
 take seriously the empirical fact that most international lending to developing

 countries is to the public sector, or to the private sector with public—sector

 guarantees. In these circumstances, debt—servicing
                                                      capacity depends not only on
 national wealth but on the public sector's ability to tax that wealth.

 Moreover, domestic capital markets in the borrowing country tend to be highly

 segmented and imperfect so that the public sector must use its borrowing powers

 to bring about an efficient level of aggregate investment in the economy.

      Thus, let us suppose that the private sector in the
                                                            developing country
 saves a fixed fraction of post—tax income, which is available for private

investment, while the government uses its taxing and borrowing authority to

supplement private investment and/or private consumption (see Arrow and Kurz

[i], Ch. VI, for a similar set—up in a closed economy). Private investors

have no direct access to the international loan market. The government taxes

domestic output at rate Tt, which may change over time. This rate must be less

than 1.0, and may be less than zero if the government is making net income

transfers to the private sector.

     With domestic output given by     tax revenues are TtQt, and private Lector

savings are s(1_tt)Qt. Private consumption is given by   C = (1_8)(1_Tt)Qt.      In
any period, the government borrows Dt+i and repays (1+r)Dt. Total investment in

the economy is given by:
                                                      -14-


                                            +
               It    s(l_Tt)Qt +     TtQt       (Dt+i_(1+r)Dt)
                    (private       (tax              (net foreign
                     savings)        revenue) resource
                                                     inflow)


As written, it appears that all foreign borrowing is used for investment rather

than consumption, but this is true only as an accounting matter. Suppose ,   for

example, that the government wants to raise private consumption while holding

investment levels fixed. It merely raises Dt+i while reducing T     sufficiently
to keep I. constant; in that case the borrowing finances consumption 100% on the

margin.

     Now, let us calculate the optimal financial policy of the government,

assuming again that it tries to maximize an intertemporal utility function of

the form u(C1) +                       +
                         u(C2)/(1+&)        v(K3,D3)/(1+ô)2.

  As long as tax rates are
                                             completely flexible, the solution to this problem is
  identical to the social planner's solution
                                                                       of the earlier section, since the
  dynamic budget constraint facing the government is no different whether it

  chooses          and       as before or Tt and 1 as here.

        To show this formally, simply substitute for C1
                                                                                       ,

By   substituting (11)(a),(b),(d) into (11)(c), we                              find   that FK(K2) =       r+    d,   as
before; the conditions (11)(a) ,(b) and (d) are exactly as before. Thus, the

demonstration is complete.

       To find the tax rates implied by (ii), note that C =
                                                            (1—s)(1—t.)p(K.,)                                          ,   so

economy will involve a rising r. Low tax rates in the early period allow

households to benefit early on from the growth that will be achieved in

periods 2 and 3. Higher taxes later on are necessary to service the

international debt.

       Now let US introduce a simple yet crucial hitch into the model. Suppose

that the government can only raise tax rates to a limit r < 1 , and that the

constraint is binding in the sense that the optimal Ti and/or t2 exceeds i.

The first effect of the tax ceiling is to tighten significantly the feasibility

con8traint derived earlier in (4). Debt repayment now depends on taxing

authority as well as national wealth. The new constraint is that Dt must be

less than or equal to the maximum level of tax revenues net of government

investment. Government investment is i. minus private investment, s(1—Tt)Qt.

Thus,




(4')        Dt(i+r)
                      max
                       T,I   it

                                                   -   +
                                                           s(i_Tt)QtJ


It is more likely that (4') holds as a binding constraint than (4), since (4')

does not imply that future consumption must equal zero when the constraint

binds. Nonetheless, in the examples that follow, we do not consider the

binding case. We focus rather on the binding constraint T           ,   assuming

Dt remains below its maximum level.

        Since the optimal tax path tends to involve rising r, a natural case to

consider is one in which the tax constraint does not bind in period 1 while it

does bind in period 2. We consider that case first. By the Kuhn—Tucker

 conditions for optimization we know that U/t1 0, with the strict inequality
                                                        -17-



  holding when             is binding at the constraint .              Thus, when       < r and      =
           =   0 and au/ar2 > 0. What are the implications of the
  3U/3T1                                                          tax constraint?
  From (11)(b)       ,
                         u2 < _vD/(1+). The secondperiod marginal utility of consumption
  is "too low." The government would like to raise second—period
                                                                 taxes, reduce
  C2 and thereby raise u2, but it has already taxed to the limit. Let 8 be such
  that u2(1+O) =
                 _VD/(1+t) (clearly 8 must be positive). Substituting this
  relationship and (11)(d) into (11)(c) we see that:



 (12)          FK(K2) =      (r   +   d)   •
                                               y

                 =
                         (1+e)4(i+o) — O(l—s)(1—)j > 1
 We   have the key result:

               Under      a regime of constrained tax levies, the
                                                                               marginal product of
               capital should no longer be equated with the world market cost of

               capital but rather should be kept gher, to reflect a lower

               shadow value of second—period output.

The utility value of second-period output may be measured by
                                                             u2. Since this is no
longer equated to VD/(1+), second—period
                                                           returns to investment should be given
a weight less than 1.0 in project
                                                   analysis. By following the standard rule
FK(K2) =   r+    d,      the country is led to over—borrow, with the result that social

welfare is reduced.

      Let us consider a graphic case of this
                                                               issue that follows the analysis in

trying to maximize third—period national income (net of international

indebtedness). If              is not constrained, r1 and 12 should be set at 1.0, with

government revenue plus net foreign borrowing used to equate FK(K2) with r +                            d,
according to the classic policy prescription.

       Now suppose that                        T < 1. Since consumption has no weight in

utility, it is optimal to set taxes at their maximum rate:
                                                                                   =        r.     Then,

 Iv. International Borrowing with Possible Debt Repudiation

      So far, the creditors have
                                      only considered the feasibilit1 of debt
repayment in setting debt ceilings for the
                                                     borrowing country. In practice,
however, a loan must pass two hurdles to make it a reasonable bet: (i)
                                                                         it must
be feasible for the loan to
                            paid off; and (2) the borrower must have the
incentive to pay off the loan when it comes due. In some cases it
                                                                   may be less
onerous for a borrower to repudiate
                                    a debt obligation, and accept the penalties
that may arise, than to undertake
                                  the task of paying off the debt. In this
section we Study how the creditors
                                          and borrowers operate when such a possibility
exists.

     A word concerning terminology is useful at this point. In technical
                                                                         terms,
a default is any failure to respect the terms of a loan agreement. A

  may occur because Dt is mistakenly allowed to rise above productive wealth;
                                                                              or
  because the government is unable to levy the necessary taxes to service the

 debt; or, as we shall see in Section
                                        V, because the creditors panic and create a
 liquidity shortage for the borrowing country. In this section we analyze the

 possibility of defaults caused purely by the choice of the borrowing—country

 government in a situation in which debt repayment is feasible but perhaps

 unpleasant. For this type of default we follow Eaton and Gersovitz [6] in

 reserving the term "debt repudiation."



 A.   The Basic Model of Debt Repudiation

      The key to modelling debt repudiation is an explicit assumption

 regarding its benefits and costs. The benefits
                                                    are straightforward: the
borrower saves the real value of the
                                       outstanding debt, which it no longer
services. The costs are far more problematic, to judge from historical

experience (see [15]). One aspect of the costs is a partial or complete

inability to obtain new loans in the world
                                               capital markets, at least for some
time after the repudiation occurs. Another
                                                aspect of the cost may be a direct
seizure of the country's overseas
                                    assets, including bank accounts, direct

foreign investments, ships and aircraft. A third, and even more important cost,

may be a dramatic decline in the country's
                                               capacity to engage in trade, even if
no net new borrowing is involved. Modern trade is built on a sophisticated

system of revolving trade credits. Even if a country's net debt is zero, its

gross stocks of trade—related financial assets and
                                                      liabilities are likely to be
large. Because a borrower would have
                                       difficulty in arranging trade credits
                                          —21—


after a repudiation, the mechanics of trade would be made onerous. Moreover,

merchandise at ports ready to be dispatched to the debtor country could be

subject to seizure by the creditors.

       To introduce these elements, we assume that when a debt is repudiated the

creditors retaliate by imposing two costs: in all future periods, the

borrower's production is reduced, for given K and L, by a fixed fraction A; and

second, the borrower is excluded from all further borrowing.      Importantly, we

assume that this retaliation yields neither costs nor benefits to the creditors

(or that the costs and benefits cancel).

       As an easy start, we begin with a two-period version of the international

borrowing model (we simply drop V(K3,D3)). The tax considerations are ignored,

so that we implicitly assume that domestic tax levies are not constrained.

Loans are made to the sovereign borrower in period 1.      If they are not repaid in

period 2, the penalty is enforced and second—period output is reduced by AQ2.

The borrower makes the repudiation decision in the second period (there is no

way that it can pre—cornmit itself to a decision before the second period

arrives). Since second—period utility is simply u(C2) ,      the borrower compares

consumption levels with and without repudiation.       With repudiation, C2 equals

   —         =              (We denote this level as c.) With no repudiation,
       AQ2       (1—A)Q2.

C2 equals Q2       — (1+r2)D2, which we denote C. The borrower defaults whenever
 C exceeds C, and thus whenever (1+r2)D2 < XQ2. Note that the interest rate

 has a time—subscript; we can no longer assume a unique world interest rate for all

 loans, since creditors will now impose a risk premium to allow for default risk.

        There are two choices with respect to the timing of loans. The level of
                                           -22—


  credit D2 may be extended before or after the investment decision
                                                                    I is made.
  We shall see shortly that it is a great advantage to the country to be able to

  choose    before going to the capital markets, since I may then be chosen to

 make the credit terms on a given loan more favorable, or to increase the total

 amount that the country can borrow. A
                                            more natural assumption, however, is that
 loans are arranged first and that the government then allocates them to

 consumption and investment. This is more natural because the government will

 generally have an incentive to renege on a promised level of I once a loan is

 arranged, even if ex ante it would be better off to fix the
                                                                  I initially. Thus,
 promises concerning I will be Unconvincing. We term the case in which           is
 set first the "pre—comxnitment" equilibrium, and regard the other case as the

 "standard" assumption.

      The trick to solving the borrowing problem under certainty is to calculate

 the loan supply ceiling
                           D2, beyond which the creditors will not make loans. As
long as D2 is less than or equal to
                                      D2, the country will choose not to default.
The loan will be safe, and the interest rate will equal the safe rate of

interest, denoted by p. For       > D2, the country will default for        interest
rate greater than or equal to p. No risk premium can compensate for the

certainty of debt repudiation. All lending is cut off at the point

     In order to find D2, we first
                                     compute the country's investment choice as

a function of D2. For each D2, we find the level of utility of the borrowing

country for alternative values of I    ,   and choose the optimal I as a function

of D2. We thereby derive    I = 11(D2).    The borrowing ceiling D2 is found as the
point for which the default penalty, AF[K1(1—d) +
                                                     11(D2)],   just equals (1+p)D2.
In other words:
                                               —23—



                 =                  +
(14)                 XF[K1(1—d)         '1 ()]/(1+p)

       It remains to calculate 11(D2). Note that the borrower defaults if and

only if XF[K1(1—d) +           i]   > (1+p)D2. Thus, for each D2 there is a threshhold

I for which the country defaults if and only if I < I. To find the best

investment policy for given D2, the country makes two
                                                                      calculations: its best

utility if it heads for default (i.e., with I < I1), or if it plans to repay

its debt (i.e., with I I). It then picks the strategy which yields the

higher utility. Thus:


(15) 11(D2) is given as the solution to max (uB, UN)

Armed with the investment function, (14) may be solved for D2.

       Once 2 is known, the borrower's problem is easily specified.

                y = 0 for D <


                y > 0 for D =

 The interpretation is as follows. If the credit ceiling is not
                                                                binding, we are
back to the textbook model. Marginal utility of incomes are equated over time

with u1/[u2/(1+,5)] equal to (1+p). Investments are carried out to the point

where the marginal product of capital equals the world interest rate. (Note

that in the two—period model, this means FK(K2) =            1   +   p, rather than
FK(K2) =    r   +   d as in the three—period model.) When the credit ceiling binds, it

is as if the domestic interest, rate exceeds the world market rate. Less

investments are         undertaken,   since the marginal product of capital must now equal
the higher rate 1 + p + y.
                                      u1 (c1) rises relative to u2(C2) , meaning that the

consumption path is pushed into the future.

        As A (the default penalty) rises, D2 rises as well, and the credit is more

easily obtained. Utility rises, and investment and C1 increase as well. Thus,

in a world of certainty, borrowers prefer higher penalties for debt repudiation.

The higher the penalty, the easier are the credit conditions.

    Now let us modify the model by allowing the country to pre—comxnit to

I before D1 is selected. The borrower's problem becomes:

Borrowers now set I knowing that their choice influences the size of loans that
they can hope to arrange ,                     since creditors restrict (1+p)D2 to be less than or

that (1+p)(C1+11—Q1)                         XF[(1—d)K1 +     i1j.   The solution to the pre—cornrnitinent

Once again, when 0 =                    0,    we are back to an unconstrained optimum, with u1/u2

                                                                                                    is   that

  investment: higher second—period income, and a relaxation of the
                                                                   borrowing
  constraint. The first motive for
                                   investment (second—period consumption)
  generally leads the planner to equate
                                               FK with u1/[u2/(1+5)]. The second con-
  sideration raises investment, and thus lowers FK relative to

         In general, pre—commitment results in a higher level of
                                                                        I ,   greater

 and higher utility. The utility level must be greater than or
                                                                equal to utility
 in the "standard" case, since the
                                   policy—maker in (18) could choose to pre—cominit
        at the equilibrium level in the standard solution. We
                                                              see, then, that

                                                            profile is a method of enhancing
 credit—worthiness and raising social welfare.            Of course, we should not lose
 sight of the previous section's conclusion
                                                      that a weak public finance structure
 may militate against extensive foreign
                                               borrowing for investment purposes.
      A linear model offers a vivid illustration of the effects of
                                                                   repudiation
 risk, and of investment pre-colnmjtment. Let:


 (20)        Q1 =

                 =
                     + (i+y)i      ,   i   I


            U   = C1 + C2/(1+rS)

            6>1>
Thus, there we assume a quantity I of
                                           investment projects with a rate of return
y exceeding the world interest rate
                                    p. The rate of time discount 6 is also
assumed to be greater than the world interest rate. In the textbook
                                                                      model, the
borrowing equilibrium involves I =
                                      (eli. investment projects undertaken)), with

consumption shifted entirely to the first period, and no consumption in the
                                                      —27—




second (since 6 > p with linear utility). In sum:


(21) The Textbook Case:


          Cl
               =            +           + (i+y)!j/(l+p)

          02 = 0



          D2
               =
                       C1
                                +
                                    I    —




     Now, we turn to the "standard" repudiation model.                      For any given D2,

I will be chosen to equal zero, since 6 > .                        Therefore Q2 = Q, and the debt

ceiling is given by D2 = AQ/(1+p).                    The complete solution is:


(22) The Standard Repudiation Case

          C1 =              + A(1+p)

               =0
          Ii


               =            -
          C2


          D2
                   =    A/(1+p)

Thus, the risk of repudiation reduces D2, I , and C , and raises C2.

     Finally, we have the pre—commitiuent case. In this model, the borrowing

country will choose to pre—coinniit to I. =                  I   when -y is close to 6, and when 6 is

much greater than p. Specifically we find:


 (23) The Pre—Coinmitment Repudiation Case
                                            -28-



               C1 = Q +       —
                          D       Ii
               I = 0    for (ô—p)x(1+-y) < (6—y)(1+p)

               I =      for (-p)x(1+y) > (ó-'y)(l+p)

               C2 =     — AQ

               D2     AQ2/(1+p)


        Thus, the pre—commitrnent case        be the same   as   the no—pre—coinmjtrnent case

 but   might   (and generally will) result in an equilibrium somewhere between the

 textbook model and the standard repudiation model. Pre—commitment allows greater

borrowing, greater investment in profitable projects, and higher first—period

consumption.



B.     The Debt Repudiation Model Under Uncertainty

       So far, an actual default never occurs in the model, though the threat of

default has a profound effect on economic welfare and the nature of macroeconomic

equilibrium. Once uncertainty is introduced into the model, debt repudiations
will   actually occur as random events. The presence of uncertainty has

several   effects. First, the loan supply schedule becomes upward sloping, rather

than perfectly elastic up to a maximum debt level 15.            Second, and even more

important, the incentive structure for macroeconomic management may become

perverse, in ways soon to be described. A more complete treatment of debt

repudiation under uncertainty may be found in L6i and            [17j.   Here, we will

discuss some simple yet revealing examples.

       Consider the linear model just described, but with I =            0 and Q2 a random

variable, equal to        with probability II and OQ (o < 1) with probability (i—n).
                                              -29-


We assume II > 8, which proves convenient below. Creditors are assumed to be

risk—neutral, charging an interest rate r2 that yields an expected rate of

return equal to p (we relax the assumption of risk neutrality in the next

section). Debtors are assumed to repudiate debt whenever (1+r2)D2 > AQ, and to

repay debt otherwise.

       Let us specify the loan supply schedule. Let a be the probability of a

debt repudiation. The interest rate r2 will be set so that (1+r2)(1—a) = (1+p)

assuming risk neutral creditors. By using the relations (1+r2)(1—a) = (1+p) and

a =
       Pr[(1+r2)D2 > AQj   we may    easily   derive the following loan schedule.




(24)
                     =   Afl/(1+p)
            D2

            with interest rates:

            r = p for D2


            r =   (p+fl)/(1—fl) for e2D2 < D

The supply schedule is shown in Figure 2, where we see an important point.

Though the loan supply is upward sloping (in this case a step function) ,                  there

5 still a    point 2 above which higher risk-premia do not compensate for

repudiation risk. Creditors will not extend loans beyond D2, at                  interest

rate. Thus , even in more general models, there tend to be credit ceilings,

rather than ever-higher risk premia, as a property of the loan supply schedule.

        Now, suppose that the social welfare function is U =       C1
                                                                        +
                                                                            C2/(1+6)   ,   and the

goal of the government is to maximize expected utility, E(U). Since we are

ignoring investment, the only issue is how much to borrow, with C1 =                   + D2,   and
                                                  -30-


           max        —
     C2                   (i+r2)D2,   (1—A)Q2). A little algebra yields the following rules:

     (25) For      < p, the country lends D2 =
                                                    —Q1


           For p < S < [0(1—ri) +
                                       rrp(1—o)J/(ri_e), the country borrows

           D2 =   AO/(1+fl)   at interest rate II, and with zero probability of

           debt repudiation.


           For c < Le(i—n)+ri(i_o)j <      ,   the country borrows     =    at   interest
           rate r =   (p+rr)/(1—ri), and   with probability (i—ri) of debt repudiation.

 Thus, the more "impatient" the country, i.e., the greater is 5, the higher is

 the borrowing, which comes at a greater cost and a greater risk of default.

          There is a simple, yet important lesson in (25).           The probability of debt
repudiation does not depend on A but rather on comparisons of and p. Higher

penalties (A) do not necessarily reduce the
                                                          frequency of debt repudiation. In a
more general model, a rise in A might actually raise that frequency! The reason

is that while higher A makes default more costly, it also makes lenders willing

to extend more credit. Thus, when A rises both the costs and benefits of debt

repudiation increase, and in the example, the probability of debt repudiation

remains unchanged.



C.        Debt Repudiation and Macroeconomic Incentives

          A recent theme of financial economics is that the various claimants on a

firm's income stream (e.g., the
                                           shareholders, bondholders, workers) have

differing interests regarding the firm's policies because alternative policies

  affect the relative valuation of the
                                         different claims. Thus, the shareholders
  may urge policies that raise shareholder wealth at
                                                          the expense of bondholder
 wealth, as described in [7], [13], and [ia].        Or coalitions of the shareholders
 and banks may engage in policies at the expense of bondholders,
                                                                 especially in
 the context of bankruptcy actions (see [4]).       A notable feature of these
 examples is that the firm may pursue inefficient
                                                       policies that reduce the
 overall value of the firm, because
                                       some groups will benefit even though other
 groups will be hurt more.

      A related theme is that all
                                    groups are generally left better off, exante,
 if the firm can be constrained from
                                       pursuing inefficient policies. As an
 example, consider the case of risky investments.       it is well known that
 shareholders can sometimes devalue the claims of bondholders on the firm
                                                                          by
 selecting overly risky investment projects. (A bond is an option on the firm's

income stream; an increase in variance of
                                                an income stream reduces the value of
the related option.) Since bondholders
                                           know this, exante, they may charge a
high risk premium in anticipation of the
                                            investment policy. This high risk
premium reduces shareholder wealth while it allows the bondholder to earn the

expected market rate of return. After the loan is made and the risky investment

selected, the bond claim is reduced in value (relative
                                                            to the hypothetical value
if a safe investment is instead                 but the initial risk premium has
                                  selected) ,

already compensated for that effect. If the shareholders could have somehow

committed themselves to choose safe
                                      investments, the initial high risk premium
could have been avoided, to their own advantage.

     Several direct analogies can be made to macroeconomic behavior by the
                                                -32—


borrowing    country. Like a firm, the country also has various claimants on the

income stream, including the government, domestic citizens, and international

creditors. And like the firm, the country may be led to select inefficient

policies to transfer income from the creditors to the "shareholders" (the

government and domestic private sector). Generally, the country would like to

foreswear these policies ex ante but may find it difficult to do so.

       Let us consider an example in the linear stochastic framework, also

involving the riskiness of investment projects. Suppose that there are two
                                                                         =
options for an investment project. Option A yields Q2                        (1+1A)11 with
                                                                     0 with
certain. Option B yields Q2 = (1+1B)11 with probability TI, and Q2 =
probability 1—fl. The yield on A is             /,      and the expected yield on B is

               We will assume that             is   greater   than 11(1+1B)_1. The government

borrows     to finance I. ,   so   that D2 =        .    Second—period   consumption equals
                                                                       there is a default.
   —
       (1+r)D if there is no default, and (1—x)Q2                 if

Default occurs if and only if (1+r2)D2 > XQ. We also assume that (1+r2) is
less   than X(i+YA) and

       Now suppose that social welfare is simply the expected value of C2, E(C2).

Which investment project should be selected? If the investment project is

selected before the loan is made, it is easy to check that option A is

preferred. Under option A, the borrowing rate is simply p, since there is

zero probability of default. E(C) is simply (l÷yA)11 — (1+p)11.                         Under option B,

default occurs with the "bad" outcome, which occurs with probability (1—n). The
                                                                                —              By

assumption, 11(1+B) < (i+yA)          , so   EC < EC.
       If   the loan is made before the investment project is selected, the country
                                             —33-


 may well choose B instead of A! To see the problem, suppose that the banks

 lend       =
                I   at rate p in anticipation that option A will be selected.           At rate

 p, EC (_p)i1 , as before, while EC now equals 11(1B_)1 As long as
     > n(i+) > (i+) - (1+p)(1-), EC > EC. Since the creditors will

 recognize the country's expost incentive to choose B, the loan will in fact

 carry the interest rate r2 such that ll(1+r2) =        1   +   p,   and project B will again
 be preferred.

         The problem here is as follows. When the investment project is chosen

 first, the borrower must consider the effect of his investment choice on the

terms of the loan. When the loan is arranged first, the borrower does not

consider this effect, since the terms        of   the loan are       already   set. The borrower
would like to promise the creditor that the safe project will be pursued, but

such a promise will look unconvincing given the incentive to renege on it once

the loan agreement is set.

     There are several other areas of behavior in which timing and default risk

interact to produce bad macroeconomic choices. The earlier discussion of

investment pre-commitment can be thought of precisely in these terms. From an

ex ante point of view it is beet      for   the country to choose a high level of

investment, because high      investment   relaxes credit ceilings. However, once a

loan package is arranged, the country prefers to raise first-period consumption

at the expense of investment. Since creditors understand this, they will tend

to discount initial promises of high investment plans, and indeed they will be

right.

     A similar phenomenon occurs when countries borrow with long-term debt.
                                     -34-


When a country owes long-term debt, each new amount of borrowing tends to reduce

the expected value of the original debt by making eventual its repudiation more

likely. In many cases, the borrowing country would like to be able to promise a

potential long—term creditor that it will not over—borrow once the long—term

debt is arranged. Such a promise would reduce the risk premium on the long—term

debt. However, there will generally be strong incentives, ex post, to do

precisely the contrary. The result is, in general, that long—term debt will

command a high risk premium and that, as expected, over-borrowing will occur.

    Market participants search for ways to reduce these deleterious incentives.

It may be the case that countries can establish reputations for maintaining

macroeconomic policies in line with announced plans. There is a growing

economics literature on establishing a reputation (e.g., [ii]) that may well

give some insights in this direction. Other specific actions, such as relying

on short-term borrowing rather than long-term borrowing, may reduce some of the

incentive problems. In domestic capital markets, and to a much smaller extent

in international lending, bond covenants can be used to pre—coinmit the borrower

to a future line of action. Smith and Warner [18] provide an excellent survey

of such covenants, which indicate how they help to enforce an efficient

borrowing and investment plan by corporate borrowers. For example, covenants

often directly restrict dividend payments, which may be tantamount to requiring

the shareholders to invest rather than "consume" their loans. Other types of

provisions include restrictions on new borrowing, maintenance of the firm's

existing assets, financial disclosure requirements, and restrictions on merger

activity. Such provisions are typically unenforceable with foreign sovereign
                                        —35.-



 borrowers and thus are not part of the most syndicated loan agreements.



 V.    Collective Action Problems in Syndicated Lending

       The problems with the textbook model have so far all involved the borrower

 (whether in its tax system, or its incentive to repudiate debt). Problems at

 least as serious can arise on the creditor side, especially when credit market

 imperfections interact with the problems already identified. We have so far

 treated the creditor side as a "black box" operation, extending loans that yield

 the appropriate rate of return. In fact, on a typical loan, the creditor side

 tends to be composed of a large number of financial intermediaries who join

 together as a syndicate on an ad hoc basis. While the
                                                          syndication process helps
in risk diversification, it leads to several other problems of great

significance.

       Our amended model of the supply side posits a very large number of banks,

each with an upward sloping schedule of loan supplies to the borrowing country.

Let Er be the expected return on a loan made to the country by bank
                                                                         (the
expectation takes account of risks of debt repudiation, insolvency, etc.). Let

L be the amount of the bank's total lending to the country, and B be total

bank capital. The main hypothesis is that the inverse loan supply schedule

takes the form:




(26)       Er =   p +   F(L./B.)        f(O) = 0

                                        f'(.) >


According to (26), banks demand an expected return close to p when the country
                                           —36—




loans constitute a small fraction of bank capital but demand a higher expected
return as the loans constitute a growing fraction of bank capital.           There may

even be a cut-off point ). such that L./B         2..   According to American banking

law, for example, no bank may allocate more than 10 percent of bank capital to

a single borrower. While there are many technical ways around such ceilings,

these ceilings seem also to be self—imposed by banks.

     The loan supply schedule in (26) provides a powerful incentive for loan

diversification among a large number of creditors. If a single bank makes a
                                                                        +
loan of size L =
                       L/B,   the country pays expected return E(r) = p

If the same loan is equally divided among N banks, the rate is
E(rT) = p + f(9../N) < p +    f(2).   Indeed, as N +    , the   cost of borrowing

approaches p, and the loan supply schedule mimics that of the risk-neutral

creditors of earlier models.

     A loan supply schedule like (26) can be derived from the utility

maximization of risk-averse banks, via a CAPM approach. Suppose, for example,

that expected utility (to bank-managers) of the bank portfolio is given by

E(r) —   2(r')     ,   where r is the return on the overall bank portfolio. It is

simple to show that the expected return on the country loan must satisfy
                       LP      In general, as L/B increases, the covariance of
Er) —    p   =
                 cov(r,r).
   and r also rises, so that the bank requires a higher risk premium on its

loans.

     The assumption of risk—averse banks requires some justification.               Standard

finance theory holds that under certain conditions firms should ignore own-risk

in choosing policies, since shareholders can diversify whatever specific risk
                                            —37-


 the firm undertakes. However, these conditions are extremely restrictive and

 more general conditions lead to risk—averse behavior. For example, serial costs

 of bankruptcy mean that firm valuation will depend on own risk. Also with

 imperfect monitoring of managerial decisions by the shareholders, firm decisions

 will tend to involve risk—averse behavior. And in the context of commercial

banks, bank regulators impose portfolio requirements limiting risk. Such

policies are necessary in light of the moral hazards engendered by official

deposit insurance programs in the U.S. ,Western Europe, and Japan.



A.    The Possibility of Panics

      The same drive towards diversification also gives rise to the possibility

of liquidity crisis or panic in international lending. Consider the following

example. Suppose that a country has debt obligations due in the first period

equal to (1+r1)D1; current income Q1        less   than (1+r1)D1; and stochastic second—

period income given by Q2    = Q with   probability 11 and      = 0 with probability

1 — IT.    We assume further that the existing debt D1 is held by a large number of

creditors who do not act as a unified group engaged in negotiation with the

debtor country (more on this below)     ,   and whose individual holdings are too small

to give rise to any individual bargaining with the debtor country.

     There are a number of possibilities at hand. Consider first the standard

assumption that all debt is highly diversified among the creditors, so that

E(r) =     p for all banks i, and for all periods. Since the country cannot

feasibly repay (i + r1 )D1 out of current income, it must borrow

D2    (1+r1)D1 —   Q1. New loans must be at least at interest rate r2 such that
            1 + p in order to satisfy the new creditors. Thus,
II(1+r2)                                                       (1+r2) =        (1+p)/ll.
                                             -38-


Now,



(27) If     < (1+p)I.(1+r1 )D1—Q1 i/Ti

       the country will be forced into default on grounds of negative net

       worth (insolvency);


       If X < (1+p)[(1+r1)D1 —               the country will be forced into
                                   Q1j/fl,
       default on the grounds that repudiation risk precludes new loans

       in spite of overall solvency;



                                   Q1]/iI, the
       If X > (1+p)(1+r1)D1 —                       country can obtain new loans on a

       competitive basis.

       A liquidity crisis, as distinct from a solveny or repudiation crisis

occurs when the last condition in (27) is satisfied but the country is

nevertheless unable to obtain the requisite loans. The surprising result is

that such an outcome can occur in competitive equilibrium. Assume that all

banks lend according to (26) , and take as given the amount of loans extended by

the other banks. If all banks suddenly expect all other banks to stop

lending to the country, it will be rational for certain parameter values for

each bank to stop lending as well on the basis of that expectation, with the

result that it becomes self—confirming. To see this, consider a single bank

planning its loans under the assumption of no loans from other banks. The bank

knows that unless it loans D2 = (1+r1)D1 —            Q1   ,   the country will default.

According to (26) , a loan of size D2 requires an expected rate of return

E(r) =     p +   f(D2/B).   Since the debtor can only hope to be paid off with

probability II in the second period, the interest rate r2 on the loan must at
                                                        —39—


least be such that ll(l+r2) =                  + p +
                                       1
                                                       f(D2/B).
       A liquidity crisis can arise when the following condition holds:



(28)         Li + p +                          > A > (l+p)D2/rI
                          f(D2/B)jD2/fl
             where D2 =                    —
                            (1+r1)D1           Q1



In this case, it is safe for many banks to lend D2, but not safe for any single

bank to lend at all. The risk premium required for single-bank lending is

enough to push the country to debt repudiation in the next period, with

(i+r2)D2 > AQ. If all banks believe that all other banks will stop lending,

that outcome will in therefore occur.

       Note that a panic requires a fairly high level of initial debt. Let

r (D2) be the loan supply schedule for a single debt. Then, a panic requires
Li +
       r(D2)jD2 > XQ. Clearly, there exists a Dn, for which D2 D1 a
panic is impossible and D2 >                        a panic can occur. Since D2 equals

(1+r1)D1 —   Q1   ,   there is similarly a condition for (1+r1)D1. Figure 3 shows the
individual banks loan supply schedule; forD2 > D1T', r is such that

(1r2)D2 > Q. It is precisely because panics occur only at high levels of debt

that they are so difficult to distinguish from other forms of default. In every

true liquidity crisis, it will seem to some observers that the problem really

lies with the risk of debt repudiation or insolvency, rather than with the

supply of credit.

       A good historical candidate for a liquidity crisis is cited in L15i (also
                                         -40•-



see Iioj). In mid—1930, the international bond markets "shut down" to the

developing countries. While about $411 million of non—Canadian debt was floated

from January to July, 1930, only $5 million was floated during the rest of the

year. It was six months after the bond market collapsed that the first country

(Bolivia) defaulted. Remarkably, much of the panic can be traced to a single

week when a military coup in Brazil caused bond prices to plummet. Some

representative bond prices for that week are shown in the table below.

B.   Other Collective Action Problems

     A financial panic is not the only case in which cooperation among creditors

can improve the efficiency of the international loan markets. In general, loan
                                                —41—


 contracts can be made more efficient if the creditors are able to act

 collectively under certain contingencies. For example, an efficient loan

 contract may require that existing creditors re—schedule the debts of the

borrower at below—market rates in order to avoid a default. If the creditors

are widely dispersed, without an institutional structure to enforce collective

action, it may be impossible to arrange the re-scheduling. No creditor alone

has incentive to re-schedule at below—market rates, while each creditor has an

incentive to free ride (by demanding full repayment of his claims) if the others

re—schedule. This seems to be the historical experience with international

lending in the bond market.

     When creditors are better organized, as in syndicated bank loans, there is

at least the possibility that mutually advantageous collective action can be

arranged. We will cite evidence below, however, that even in bank syndicates

significant free—rider problems remain.

     Let us illustrate the role for collective action by considering a simple

numerical example in the three—period borrowing model. We will assume that

   is fixed at Q,   while   Q2
                                 and
                                       Q3 may   equal   Q   (probability       or   zero

(probability         Q2 and        are assumed to be independently distributed. We

assume that the country defaults only when it runs out of cash (i.e. it never

voluntarily repudiates its debt). The safe interest rate is 0.10, and creditors are

are risk-neutral.

     The borrower is interested in maximizing C1              ,   which equals Q1   + D,   so that

equivalently, he is interested in maximizing first—period loans. Now, we

compare two types of loan contracts. In the first case, the loan D2 is made by
                                                                     —42-


a large number of creditors without organizational cohesion. If                                             =   0,   the

borrower must try                 to    borrow again on market terms, in order to repay (1r2)D2.

If he cannot attract new loans, he defaults. In the second case, a cohesive

                                                      =
syndicate is formed. If                                    0,   the borrower must first try to borrow again on

market terms. If he cannot attract new loans, the syndicate guarantees that the

borrower can roll—over the credit at the initial interest rate.

        The borrower will be able to borrow more, at better terms, under the

syndicate arrangement. First, we calculate the loan supply schedule in the case

without syndication. It turns out that for 0 ( D2                                         /2.42, the lenders can

lend at the safe interest rate of 10 percent. If                                          turns out to equal zero,

borrowers will be able to attract the necessary new loans to pay off the

existing debt. The new loan D3 will equal 1.1 D2, with interest rate

    =    1.2     (   = (1.1/2)              —   1).       For Q/2.42 < D Q/2.2, the interest rate r2 is

1.2. If Q2 =             0,   the country will default, since it will not be able to attract

new loans at market terms. /2.2 is the loan ceiling.

        In the syndicate, loans 0 'Z D2                              Q/2.42 will also be made at the 10 percent

rate, for the reasons above. For /2.42 < D2                                        Q/1 .85, the interest rate will

equal 0.36. The syndicate will not loan D2 > Q/1.85. To find the syndicate

interest rate(0.36) ,                   note that the syndicated loan is an asset that pays (1+r2)
in the second period with probability II, and (1+r2)2 in the third period with

probability (1—it) •                   it   (i.e. ,       with   prob (Q2 =   0,   Q3 =   Q)).     Thus, (1+p) =     it

               it    .
                         (1—it)    •                               with It    1/2 and p =        0.1.   The solution to
(1+r2) +                                 (1+r2)2/(1+p),
this equation is r2                         0.36. The loan ceiling is found by solving (1 .36)2D2 = Q.

        Thus, we find that a syndicate will loan more (/1.85 versus /2.2) at a

better interest rate (0.36 versus 1.2). But the syndicate depends on the

ability to make a second—period loans at 36 percent when new creditors would

offer nothing at that rate. The risk for the syndicate is that an informal

bargain among creditors to re-lend may break down in the second period, leading

to a default rather than a re—scheduling. Recent experience with commercial

bank re-scheduling points up the tensions with re—lending. Banks with small

participation in a loan agreement try to escape with their credit intact,

relying on the larger banks to forestall default. Figure 4 on the next page

shows this vividly with respect to the current Brazilian re-scheduling package,

where the U.S. regional banks are contributing new short-term credits at

systematically far less than their existing shares in Brazilian debt.

     Other types of collective action that a syndicate might engage in include:

monitoring existing loans for compliance; enforcement of loan agreements; and

retaliatory actions in the event of non—compliance. In each of these cases, a

free-rider problem potentially exists, with resulting inefficiencies in loan

supply. Cline L5i has reported the difficulty of the commercial bank syndicates

to Peru in exercising all three of these functions, and their ultimate resort to

the IMF as a way to escape from this problem:

     In March 1976 the Bermudez government sought a large balance-of-payments
     loan from major U.S. banks, without a prior IMP standby agreement. The
     government felt that agreeing to IMP conditions would be unacceptable
     politically, although in its discussion with the banks, the government
     proposed a program very much like that which might have secured IMF
     support. Partly out of fear of a more leftist coup if Bermudez lost power,
     the banks eventually agreed, but only after the regime demonstrated
     willingness to take unpopular stabilization measures....
          The program called for an initial $200 million in loans with a second
     $200 million to follow after several months, contingent on government
     adherence to the policy purchase. Signed only by the end of 1976, the
     package soon demonstrated the frailty of such direct intervention by banks;
     for reasons of data availability, technical capacity, and political
     sensitivity, it proved impossible for the banks to enforce their lending
     conditions, and adverse publicity for the intervention (plus its
     ineffectiveness) caused the leading banks to resolve that they would not
     become entangled in similar packages in the future but would rely on the

VI. Conclusions and Extensions

    This paper has suggested three areas in which the standard model of

international borrowing requires major revision. In the typical planning or

project—analysis framework, too little attention is generally given to the
                                                           We have seen that in an
domestic budgetary implications of foreign borrowing.

economy with limitations on the government's ability to raise revenues, official

foreign borrowing is often less attractive than standard calculations might

suggest. Since the shadow cost of tax revenues is greater than 1.0, claims on
                                                         borrowing) must also given a
tax revenues (like amortization payments on foreign

cost greater than 1.0.

     The second area of focus was on the effects of default risk, particularly

repudiation risk, on the nature of international loans. We found two phenomena

of great importance: the loan supply schedule becomes upward sloping, with

eventual credit rationing, where the position of the supply schedule depends on
                                                          introduced that lead to
the penalties of default; and various incentives are

inefficient borrowing and investment behavior by the debtor country.

     The final area of concern involved the supply side of the credit market.

Liquidity crises were shown to result from the risk averse behavior of

 individual lenders. Thus, we identified situations where the credit markets in

 the aggregate would be willing to lend but in which each individual bank

 withholds loans because of the fear that other banks will do so as well. No

 individual bank will break the credit squeeze, but a coalition of banks acting
                                       -45-


cooperatively might well be able to restore the flow of lending. In general,

the ability to form binding coalitions among creditors allows for more

sophisticated, and ultimately more efficient loan packages. A particularly

important example is a loan agreement which guarantees a debt-rescheduling at

below—market rates in the event of an output shortfall (or other real income

loss) in the borrowing country.

       Further research should explore the role of international organizations

(such as the IMF and IBRD) in light of the market imperfections we have

identified. Without doubt the IMF has an important function to play with

respect to each of the three categories of market breakdown. Its standard

country consultations already involve the review of the domestic financial

structure of borrowing countries, where a constant theme has been the intricate

connection of budget financing and foreign borrowing.

      The more novel Fund involvement in recent years has come in the second and

third categories. To an increasing extent, IMF conditionality involves the

application of loan covenants to borrowing packages, for the purposes analyzed

in Section IV. In this regard Fund programs might do better to emphasize the

distribution of spending between investment and consumption rather than the

overall level of spending in the borrowing country.

      The most visible role of the Fund in recent months has come in the third

category, wherein Fund cajolery has been useful in overcoming a classic panic in

the   international loan markets. One of the great conceptual weaknesses in that
role, however, has come from the inability of analysts to distinguish
convincingly   among the three forms of default risk discussed in Section V

(solvency risk, repudiation risk, panic risk). Better, empirically oriented

dynamic models of international lending are still needed to identify the

middle—term prospects for developing country debts.
