                        Optimal Wage Re—Negotiation




                                 ABSTRACT




     This paper investigates an economy in which there are short—term wage

contracts that are re—negotiated under certain conditions. This paper

determines the optimal frequency of wage re—negotiation and shows that it

depends positively on asures of aggregate variability and Phillips curve

slope. The role of optimal wage re—negotiation is to mitigate the output

effects of various shocks. In the context of an open economy, it is shown

that the desirable exchange rate regime in an economy with optimal wage

re—negotiation depends on the stochastic structure of the economy.

 I. Introduction

     Recent analyses, such as those by FIsher (1977) and Gray (1976), have

 focused attention on the role of wage contracts in explaining short—term

dynamics. A wage contract builds a short—term rigidity into the system,

 fixing the money wage in the short run. To analyze the influence exerted by

the limited flexibility of such contracts some authors have investigated the

role of partial indexation. 1   In these studies, the analysis has been

shifted to more normative aspects, and attention has been given to the

"optimal" flexibility of wage contracts, i.e., to the optimal degree of wage

indexation. One criterion used in these analyses has been to consider as a

benchmark the output in a fully flexible economy, and to derive as optimal the

indexation scheme that would bring actual output "closest" to the fully

flexible economy output. Such a procedure Implicitly assumes the existence of

costs that prevent the instantaneous adjustment of the labor market In order

to regain its equilibrium. However the analysis does not treat the effects of

those costs on the optimal contracting scheme. This paper attempts to model

the role of adjustment costs in the wage scheme by focusing attention on the

possibility of contract re—negotiation. We expect to observe re—contracting

if its benefit exceeds its costs. The analysis will consider the optimal

degree of wage re-contracting, and will contrast it with the optimal degree of

wage indexation.

     In a recent contribution, Flood and Marion demonstrated that in an open

economy under optimal wage indexation, In a world of one good, floating rates

are preferred to fixed rates, regardless of the stochastic structure of the

economy. This paper will consider how this conclusion is modified if the

limited wage flexibility is due to optimal wage re—negotiation instead of

optimal wage indexaion. We find that the two wage adjustment schemes differ



                                     —2—
considerably, in the closed as well as in the open economy.

          Section LI determines optimai wage re—negotiation in a closed economy.

Section III extends the discussion to an open economy, under both fixed and

floating rates, and investigates the desirable exchange rate regime under

optimal wage re—negotiation. Section IV closes the paper by discussing the

implications of the findings.



II. Optimal Re—contracting in a Closed Economy

          Consider a closed economy characterized by the existence of short—term

labor contracts that pre—set the wage. Such contracts occur because the

transaction costs of wage negotiation make them beneficial. This argument

implies, however, that in some circumstances we expect the benefit from re—

contracting to exceed the costs, making re—negotiation desirable. Thus, there

is a cost benefit element in assessing the desirability of wage re-

negotiation. The purpose of this section is to model this case in order to

arrive at an optimal re—contracting scheme.

          Consider an economy in which nominal wage contracts for period t are

negotiated in period t—1, before current prices are known, so as to equate

expected labor demand to expected labor supply. Such a contract contains two

parts. First, it pre—sets the wage. Second, it specifies the conditions

under which re—contracting will occur. These conditions exist when the real

wage resulting from the co.ntract deviates too much" from the market clearing

wage in a flexible economy.

          More formally, consider an economy where the labor supply (la) is given
      2
by



(1)            l =   (w   —




                                          —3—
where w and t are the money wage and money prices, expressed in logarithms.

       The production function is given by:



 (2)              = hsl +v; 0 < h < 1



where       is a white noise technology shock. In a fully flexible economy, the

 labor market clears at a real wage



                   (log h +v)/[1 + (1—h)ôj



Let us denote actual wage, prices, and output by (we,                For each
period, there are two subcases. Let us consider first the case in which the

contract wage is binding. We denote wages, prices and output in this case by

(we, p,
              .    Next,   let us consider the case in which re—contracting

occurs. In such a case we denote wages, prices and output by (,
                                                                        'j, ) .
       Suppose that the contract money wage is set such as to equate the

expected real wage resulting from the contract to the expected real wage in a

flexible economy (tn)        , i.e.

(4)        w =                + Et_I(PtIPt =



Et....i(XtIY) is the expected value of      at period t—1, conditional on

information Y. It is assumed that the information set includes all

contemporaneous shocks, as well as knowledge of the model.




                                           —4—
        The analysis assumes also that in case of re—contracting the real wage is

set at its market clearing level,        .   A possible measure describing the

pressure in the labor market working towards re—contracting is the discrepancy

between the real wages in the two situations, i.e.



                           —    =    —




where        denotes real wage if the contract binds.          describes the

discrepancy in the real wage between the case where the contract binds (Tfl)

and the case of a fully flexible economy (tn)            Assume that the contract

agreement allows for re—negotiation if the real wage pressure            exceeds a

threshold value k.

Thus:



                                w, Y) if
(6)              w,
                                ' y)         if   II>k
        The policy question addressed in this section is the optimal value of
k. Another possible version of such a model allows for partial wage

indexation as part of the contract agreement. This possibility has been

analyzed by previous authors; the purpose of the current analysis is to

consider the difference between optimal indexation and optimal re—negotiation

schemes. Thus, the analysis will assume the absence of wage indexation and

will contrast the different natures of the two schemes at a later point. We

assume that contracts are made because there are real output costs associated



                                          —5—
with re—negotiation, making a continuous market clearing a second best

possibility. If those costs are C, the output in case of re—negotiation is

given by y — C (where y is the output in a fully flexible economy).3 Thus,

actual output              is given by:



(7)
                       — C
                               if ktI>k
                                if


      The notion here is that the cost of pre—setting the wage ahead of time (a

wage contract) is negligible relative to the costs of last—minute wage

revision (given by C).4

      Next, following Gray, it is also assumed that there are costs associated

with the divergence from the flexible equilibrium output. A possible loss

function to describe these costs is:


                                 2
(8)       L           E(y—y)

      The money market equilibrium is given in a log—linear form:



(9)           —        =
                  Pt


where m is the logarithm of the money supply in period t.       is the nominal

interest rate, given by



              =   r   + Etpt+l —
                                     Pt


where r is the real interest rate, assumed to be exogenously given. Assuming

that in the short run, employment is demand determined when the contract binds



                                          —6—
 (1        < k) we find that the contract output is:




(10)         y = d + d1 v + d2 (p — Eti(ptIIlPtI             < k))



where d = (S.h.log h) I ((1—h)+1), d1 = 1/(1—h),d2                   = h/(1—h)




       The existence of wage contracts implies that unexpected price increases

reduce real wages, increasing employment and output. In such a case, the

price level is given by:


                           ÷
(11)        1'   =             EP÷i) _do_dlvt+d2Et_l(ptl         kI<k)
                           1+c+d2

       If the wage pressure is strong enough (I              j
                                                                 >   k), re—contracting will

occur. Realized output in such a case is given by



(12)                 [v(l+6) + h'5•     log   hi I [1+(1—h)dj — C.



       Notice that in case of re—contracting the Phillips curve effect is nil,

and realized output is equal to frictionless output (the first term in eq. 12)

minus the cost of re—contracting. Price level is given in such a case by:


                        + a(r +               —

(13)        Pt =                1   ÷


       A comparison of eq. 11 and 13 reveals that if the contract binds (eq.

11), the effect of the Phillips curve is to mitigate the price effect of a

given monetary shock because of the induced output effect.



                                                  —7—
       To simplify notation, let us assume a simple stochastic framework,

neglecting trends in the variables and assuming zero correlation between the

random shocks:


                      —                       2                2

                               u;   u - N(O,ci);          N(O,a)


   is the monetary shock, and                is the real one. With the help of eq.1O—13

we find that


                               —C if
(15)         y —y =
                               t         t


                  =
where:
             ot       d(p — Et_i(ptIItI<k)          +
                                                         1+(1—h)5



       If   re—negotiation occurs (I>k) , output will deviate from the flexible

equilibrium output by the real cost of re—negotiation (C). If the contract is

binding, output will deviate by O. from the flexible equilibrium.

       Using eq.3,4 and 5 we find that



(16)              =
                               — Eti(PtfttI<k)vt          1+(1—h)


Notice that



(17)              =   —d


If the contract binds, actual output (y) deviates from the frictionless

equilibrium level                   in proportion to the labor market pressure      The

factor of proportionality is the Phillips curve slope (d2). Thus, we can



                                                   —8—

that          and       are normally distributed. It can be shown that:

distribution and density function. Using the properties of a normal

               L =

        We can use L to derive the optimal value of k, which minimizes L. It is

given by

(20)           k =      —e
                         d2


        Inspecting eq. 20 reveals that a higher cost of re—negotiation will

reduce the use of re—contracting (a higher k*). A larger slope of the



                                                      —9—
Phillips curve will magnify deviations from the output target, encouraging re-

negotiation (a lower k*). Notice that if the transaction costs associated

with re—contracting are zero, k* = 0, implying that the labor market clears

continuously, nullifying the role of wage contracts. For the optimal k, the

frequency of wage re—negotiation is measured by

 2 cD(—z), where z = k
                                 d2/a0
       Suppose that we increase uniformly the volatility of all the shocks

affecting the economy, without affecting the relative importance of the

underlying shocks (i.e. holding V,!Vu given). In such a case we find from

eq.20 that



(21)                                 <0
               0 Vu/V     given


(22)         0<                           <1.
                   dV0 Vv/Vu given


       Higher volatility of the shocks will increase the desirability of re—

contracting, because more frequently the labor market pressure is enough to

justify it. The effect of this adjustment is to increase output volatility

(relative to       ,   i.e.   L) by less than the increase in the volatility of the

underlying shocks. In this sense, optimal re—contracting mitigates the

effects of higher aggregate volatility on output variability.

       Comparing an optimal re—contracting policy to an optimal indexation7

reveals that the optimal frequency of re—contracting depends on aggregate

volatility (V0) whereas optimal indexation depends only on the relative

importance of the real and monetary shocks (i.e. on Vv/Vu) As a result,

optimal indexation is homogenous of degree zero and output volatility under

optimal indexation is homogenous of degree one with respect to aggregate



                                            —10--
volatility. In contrast we have just demonstrated that a given increase in

aggregate volatility will increase output volatility at a lower rate under the

re—contracting         .


       The Appendix considers the case in which we allow for optimal wage

indexation as well as optimal wage re—contracting. It turns out that the

characteristics of possible wage schemes described above stay intact in a

system that allows for both adjustment possibilities. Adding optimal wage

indexation has the effect of reducing aggregate volatility, reducing in turn

the use of re—contracting (dz* > 0). Optimal indexation, however, proves to

be independent of optimal re—contracting.



III.      Optimal Re—contracting in an Open Economy

       The purpose of this section is to analyze how optimal re—contracting

works in an open economy. This will enable us to evaluate the desirability of

different exchange rate regimes. A recent contribution by Flood and Marion

has demonstrated that under optimal wage indexation, in a world of one good,

floating rates are preferred over fixed rates, regardless of the stochastic

structure of the shocks affecting the economy.8 As Section II concluded,

optimal wage indexation differs considerably from optimal wage re—contracting.

This section shows that this difference manifests itself also in the choice of

optimal exchange rate regimes. It turns out that under optimal wage re—

contracting regimes, the ranking   of   exchange rate regimes depends on the

stochastic structure of the shocks. Thus, unlike the case under optimal wage

indexation, we cannot rank exchange rate regimes under optimal wage re—

contracting without further information regarding the relative magnitude of

the shocks affecting the economy. This circumstance also suggests that the

ranking of exchange rate regimes might depend on the labor market structure.



                                         —11—
       Consider the case of a small, open economy under perfect capital

 mobility, in a world of one traded good. The labor market has the structure

 described in Section II (eq.1—7).

       The small country is linked to the world by interest rate parity and the

 law of one price. Thus, eq.               9'       is replaced by



                   = 1    +
                              E    e+1 —


where i is the foreign interest rate, and
                                          e is the exchange rate, expressed
in logarithm. The money market equilibrium becomes



(23)
            flit
                   — Pt =     y—   (i   ÷ E e+1 —           e)

       Goods prices are assumed to be linked by the law of one price:



(24)        Pt =         +    et



III.a.    The floating exchange rate regime

       Under the floating exchange rate regime the money supply is exogenously

given, and the exchange rate is free to adjust to money market pressure. Let

us assume zero correlation between the random shocks, which are normally

distributed:9



(25)
                    —                           2     *           2   *       2
           m =      m    + u; u N (O,o);p N (O,                           N (O,a)
                                                                 p            L



using eq.1—7 and the money market equilibrium condition, we find that prices
are given by:



                                                     —12—
                 —

                                                             + h.S•log h]/[1+(1—h)S1 — C)
            Pt                                              1+a

where,   as in Section II, p represents prices if the labor contract is

binding, and Pt represents prices if there is re—contracting. Comparing eq.

26 to eq. 11—12 reveals that the only difference between the closed and open

economies is that cL(E                +   r)   is replaced by a (p + Ee+i + i)         Thus,

all the conclusions of Section II hold for an open economy under floating

III.b.      The fixed exchang rate regime

        Under a fixed exchange rate regime, eq. 23 and 24 hold for the given,

pre—set exchange rate. To simplify notation, assume that e = 0

Equilibrium      in the money market is achieved via the balance of payments

mechanism; thus, the money supply is now endogenous, and Pt                        As a

 eq.19). Thus, the exchange rate regime with a lower V0 has a more stable

 output relative to y .            The fixed exchange rate regime is preferred over

 floating rates, therefore, if

        Floating       rates become more desirable as the volatility of foreign prices

and real shocks increases because under floating rates the exchange rate

adjustment mitigates the effect of those shocks. The relative desirability of

a fixed exchange rate goes up with the volatility of the domestic money supply

and of foreign Interest rates because fixed exchange rates isolate domestic

output from the volatility of foreign interest rates and the domestic money
          10
supply.



IV.            Implications

        The existence of wage contracts introduces wage rigidity Into the economy

because it limits the capacity of wages to adjust to contemporaneous shocks.

Two possible channels that allow limited wage flexibility are partial wage

indexation and the possibility of wage re—contracting. This paper has focused



                                                 —14—
on the properties of optimal wage re—contracting, contrasting wage re—

contracting with wage indexation. The main difference between the two is that

the optimal frequency of wage re—contracting depends on measures of aggregate

volatility and not on the relative importance of various shocks. In contrast,

optimal wage indexation depends on the relative importance of various shocks,

and not on measures of absolute volatility. The paper shows that the optimal

frequency of wage re—contracting depends positively on aggregate volatility

and the Phillips curve slope. The role of optimal re—contracting is to

mitigate the output effects of various shocks. In the context of an open

economy the difference between optimal wage indexation and optimal wage re—

contracting is manifested in the fact that the desirability of various

exchange rate regimes under optimal wage re—contracting depends on the

stochastic structure of the economy, whereas under optimal wage indexation

Flood and Marion(1982) have shown that in a world of one good floating rates

are preferred, regardless of the stochastic structure. The paper shows that

under optimal wage re—contracting floating rates become more desirable when

the volatility of foreign prices and real supply shocks increases and when the

volatility of the domestic money supply and of foreign interest rates

slackens.

                                                Appendix



       The purpose of this Appendix is to consider how the analysis in the paper

 is affected if we allow also for wage indexation.11 It turns out that adding

 the possibility of optimal wage indexation to a system with optimal wage re—

contracting has the effect of reducing the frequency of re—contracting. The

value of optimal indexation, however, is independent of optimal re—contracting

 (k*), and it is equal to optimal indexation in an economy without re—

contracting. This is a result of the fact that optimal indexation depends on

relative variances in the underlying shocks and not on measures of aggregate

volatility, whereas optimal use of re—contracting depends on aggregate

volatility. Because allowing optimal re—contracting does not affect the

relative importance of the underlying shocks, it does not affect the value of

optimal indexation.

       Allowing for a partial indexation in a framework with wage re—contracting

implies that the wage equation (eq. 4) is modified to:



       w =   E1      (Tn)   + Et_l                  + b(p —                =



where b is the degree of wage indexation. This in turn implies that the

Phillip's curve       slope   is now



(A2)             =        (1—b) =       (1—b)
                     d2



The analysis in eq. 1—3, 5—14 stays intact, where now d., replaces              d2. Notice
that the Phillips curve slope is proportional to the degree to which price

changes are not indexed (1—b) . The new values of                    and   (denoted by

           Notice that optimal wage re—contracting (A7) is equal to eq. 20 in the

volatility (V/V) and not on aggregate volatility. It turns       out   that under

optimal wage re—contracting deriving b is equivalent to minimizing V_ . Thus,
                                                                         e
the value of optimal indexation is equal to the same value derived in a system

without re—contracting (Ic    o). The   effect of allowing optimal wage indexation

1.   See, for example, Flood and Marion(1982) and Gray(1976).

2.   This model modifies the framework used by Gray(1976) and
     Fischer( 1977).

3.   The fixed cost of re—negotiation is, assumed not to affect the
     marginal product of labor. Thus, y — C is a logarithmic
     approximation of the output around tie non—stochastic equilibrium.

4.   The assumption of an asymmetric cost of negotiation structure is
     crucial for the explanation of the wage contract advanced in this
     paper. It states that negotiation for setting the current wage
      (we) within the period is costly relative to a negotiation which
     sets the current wage ahead of time (at the end of t—1). Notice that
     because of the stochastic structure used in the paper the contract
     wage is time—independent, therefore the above assumption of cost—
     asymmetry is natural. In general, the wage contract might be time—
     dependent, and the above asymmetry can be the result of the costs of
     collecting and processing current information (cost of survey, etc. )
     needed for re—contracting. In contrast, pre—setting the wage ahead
     of time requires only well—known, costless information. If all
     negotiations were equallly expensive, then we would observe no wage
     stickiness. The modeling of the nature of the cost asymmetry is left
     for future research.  I am indebted to an anonymous referee for
     raising this issue.

5    This loss function is also used by Gray(1976) and Flood and
     Marion(1982). An alternative loss function is L':

         =
              E[a1(Yt
                        —
                            y)   •       x + a2 C (1k)]
     where a1, a2 are positive constants, and x is zero if       > k , and
     one if I I < k. L' distinguishes between the deadweight loss in the
     labor tnaret and the transaction cost. It can be shown that the main
     results of the paper remain intacat if we adapt L' instead of L.

6.   To derive eq.19 we use the fact that
        _...1           2            2        ——'z        2           2

      = 1—2(—z)—24(z)z.

7.   Optimal wage indexation is derived in Gray(1976) and Flood and
     Marion( 1982).

8.   This result was a special case in Flood and Marion's paper. So as to
     demonstrate the difference between the various wage adjustment
     schemes, this section contrasts their result with the case of an
     economy under optimal wage indexation. For an analysis of wage
     indexation in an open economy, see also Marston (1982).

9.    To simplify notation the analysis takes the case of zero correlation
      between the various shocks. The case of non—zero correlation can be
      treated in a similar way (see Flood and Marion).

10. For studies that emphasize the dependence of the optimal exchange
     rate regime on the stochastic structure see, for example Boyer(1978),
     Flood(1979), Turnovsky(1976). For a good survey, see Tower and
    Willett. The contribution of this section lies in its analysis of
     optimal exchange rate regimes under optimal wage re—negotiation.

11.   It is assumed that the transaction costs of implementing a known
      partial wage—price indexation scheme are nil
