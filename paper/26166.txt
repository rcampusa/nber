Towards an Unstable Hook: The Evolution of Stock Market Integration Since 1913

                                          ABSTRACT

We examine equity market integration for 17 countries from 1913-2018. We use network analysis
to measure the evolution of global stock market integration as well as stock market integration
between and across countries. The empirical results suggest that long-run stock market
integration looks like an unstable hook. Equity market integration first peaked in 1913 during the
first era of globalization (1870-1913) when unfettered markets ruled the day. Integration declined
over the next 60 years as countries experienced the Great Depression and shunned international
capital markets. The end of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s ushered in the second
period of globalization. Our empirical analysis suggests that stock market integration in the recent
period of globalization has surpassed the first era of globalization in the last 10 years and
currently has the highest level of equity market integration and network instability in world
history.

   1. Introduction
   There are many studies of long-run financial and economic globalization. Taylor (2002)

studied the evolution of purchasing power parity since the late 19th century. Jacks et al. (2008,

2011) examined the evolution of bilateral trade costs from 1870 to the modern period. Obstfeld

and Taylor (2004) looked at several different measures of market globalization including short-

term interest rates, real interest parity, covered interest parity, and the policy trilemma from the

classical gold standard to the recent era of globalization. Bordo et al. (1998) compared financial

market globalization of the classical gold standard period with the modern period since the

collapse of Bretton Woods era. Many of these studies have found that financial globalization has

followed a U-shaped pattern since the late nineteenth century. Economic and financial market

globalization was very high just prior to the outbreak of World War I. This was followed by the

interwar and Bretton Woods periods where globalization declined. Financial integration then

rebounded during the recent period of globalization that started in the early 1970s following the

collapse of the Bretton Woods system. Only in the last 20 years have markets experienced the

high levels of economic and financial globalization seen during the classical gold standard period

(Bekaert and Mehl, 2017).

       We break new ground and provide one of the first long-run studies of the evolution of

global equity market integration since the early 1900s. Using a new monthly database of country

stock market indices for 17 countries, we employ a network analysis to examine financial market

integration (Mantegna, 1999; Bonnano et al., 2001; Tumminello et al., 2007). Network

representations have the advantage of allowing a scholar to differentiate between two crucial

aspects of globalization: the degree of globalization on the one hand, which is measured in this

study by distance indicators; and the links between the countries of the sample on the other hand,




                                                                                                       2
which are studied using connectivity indicators. We use shortest distance from one stock market

to another as one of our baseline measures. This is called the nearest neighbor indicator of

distance. The average distance to the nearest neighbor accounts for the distance from a given

stock market to other markets that it is connected with. We also use two path length measures,

which account for the distance to all other stock markets within the network. Distances should

fall as markets become more integrated. With respect to connectivity, we use indicators of

connectivity in level and standard deviation. Connectivity in level captures the structure of the

network that is defined by the average degree (number of neighbors) of the nearest neighbors of a

given stock market for a given period. Connectivity in standard deviation measures the dispersion

of the number of links by which the stock markets are connected to the network. Connectivity

increases in level and standard deviation as global stock markets become more integrated.

        The empirical results reveal several insights about the evolution of equity market

integration since the early 1900s. First, stock market integration looks like an unstable hook as

opposed to an inverted U-shape that has been observed in many other markets. Two results from

the empirical analysis point to this interpretation. The network indicators show that stock market

integration is significantly higher now than in 1913 at the end of the gold standard period. A

significant portion of the increase in stock market integration can be attributed to the large rise in

financial market integration in the European Union, especially during the 1980s. Second, the

empirical results also suggest that the global network of equity markets is becoming increasingly

unstable. Both the US and the UK are major contributors to the growing level of financial

instability.

        The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the database and

network methodology, consisting in building financial networks and in particular price networks



                                                                                                     3
of stock markets. Section 3 is devoted to the cliometric discussion of the network structures and

network indicators derived from our database. In Section 4 we present some additional outcomes

regarding country specific effects. In Section 5 we highlight the contribution of the network

approach to the literature on financial globalization.

The monthly database is composed of 17 equity market indices belonging to some of the largest

and most important markets. The country stock indices included in the study are: Australia,

Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands,

Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States.1 The data are

taken from Global Financial Database that chain links historical stock market indices with

overlapping sample periods to construct long-run equity market data. Table 1 reports the

descriptive statistics for each of the exchanges as well as different subperiods of financial

globalization in Figures 1 and 2. Financial globalization is typically divided into four distinct

periods: 1) the classical gold standard period (1870-1913); 2) the interwar-period (1914-1939); 3)

Bretton Woods (1945-early 1970s); and the recent era of globalization (early 1970s-present). All

stock indices are normalized such that January 1922 is set equal to 100. Figure 1 shows that the

indices are characterized by a slow increase until the beginning of the 1980s. Then they exhibit a

sharply increasing trend which is also strongly cyclical. This increase is also highly

differentiated: for example, final values are close to 45,000 for Switzerland and Sweden, 25,000

to 30,000 for the United States and Finland, 11,000 or less for the other countries. Germany is a

special case since the index is divided by 100 between 1911 and 1917.

  Emerging economies, and in particular China, are not in our sample. Indeed, emerging markets equity markets
indices are only available over a recent period. Integrating them would imply that the composition of the sample
would not be stable.

          For the classical gold standard period, we use the year 1913 as a benchmark given that it
is only at the end of the first era of globalization that we have sufficient stock market coverage to
apply the network analysis. The interwar period exhibits a large decline in stock market prices
with the outbreak of World War I. This is followed by the bull market runup of the 1920s and the
large decline in global equity prices after the Great Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great
Depression. The dispersion of the country stock market indices falls during the first part of the
1930s only to increase as markets began to recover from the Great Depression. The early Bretton
Woods period, shown in Figure 2b, is characterized by both a globally increasing trend and a
strong divergence. For example, the end of period stock indices are 130 for Italy, 1,300 for the
United States and Canada, and almost 3,000 for Switzerland. The recent period of globalization
reported in Figure 2d also exhibits significant divergence. Despite the rising dispersion, the
country stock market indices increase much faster during the recent period (up to a factor 20


                                                                                                          6
against 9 previously) and appear to be affected by major crises. These crises, however, do not
affect the obviously upward trend of the indices over the whole sub-period.2


2.2. Stock Market Networks
         We study global stock market networks using equity price data. The literature on asset
price networks describes topological graphs obtained from the correlations matrix of the time
series of equities prices (Mantegna, 1999; Bonnano et al., 2001; Tumminello et al., 2007). The
most commonly used representations are minimal spanning trees (Held, 1970) and hierarchical
trees. Minimal spanning trees are network representations strictly speaking since they are
composed of nodes and edges. Hierarchical trees are classification methods allowing us to
compare distances within the minimal spanning tree network representation. As detailed in
Section 3.2. below, this network representation is obtained by selecting the most economically
meaningful relationships between the nodes. In topological terms, the relevant edges of the
subgraph (network representation) are determined by the underlying network model, which in the
case of the minimal spanning tree is the sub-dominant ultrametric of the complete graph derived
from the full database (Mantegna, 1999). An interesting property of topological graphs is that, by
analogy with ecosystems, their structure changes depending on the environment in a broad sense,
in particular in the event of multiple equilibria (May, 2008, Johnson, 2013). 3

         Our network analysis of country stock market indices makes two contributions to the
literature on financial market integration. First, we characterize the price dynamics of the
different country stock market indices in our sample using topological graphs. Then we compare
the price dynamics of the country stock market indices. The common component of global stock
prices should become more similar as financial globalization increases. Second, this study is the
first long-run analysis of price networks for stock markets dating back to the first era of
globalization.

  All equity markets indices in the database are general indices. Some sectoral indices, in particular in the field of
new technologies, have recently emerged as being also reference indices (NASDAQ). However, with the exception
of the Dotcom bubble of 2001 rise and burst, these technological indices remain very highly correlated with general
indices. In addition, using general indices insures comparability over the sample.
3
  It has to be noted that MSTs are also used as a representations of food webs (from the microbian level to large
ecosystems), as optimization tools of power distribution webs, in the analysis of the structure of particles systems,
etc.


                                                                                                                         7
2.3. Price networks of stock markets
        The methodology of the minimal spanning tree is as follows. The first step consists in
calculating a time series correlation matrix. All time series are log-differentiated. We are using
Pearson correlations, as in a majority of the econophysics literature.4 The times series of log-
differentiated indices being denoted by  and  for assets (countries) i and j, the corresponding
crossed correlation is given by:

                                                 ( ,  )
                                          =                                                                  (1)
                                                  . 



        In a second step, the correlations matrix is transformed into a distances matrix validating
the conditions of an Euclidean metric (equation (2)), which is required to run the topological
algorithms generating network representations.


                                      (,) = ( -  )

                                                                                                             (2)
                                  (,) =       = 
                                        (,) = (,)
                                    (,) < (,) + (,)


        The first condition states that the distance between two nodes can be zero if and only if
they coincide. The second condition states that the distance between two nodes does not depend
on the starting point. Finally, the third condition ("triangle inequality") states that there is no
shorter path between two nodes than the path going directly from the first to the second node.

        The last step of the minimal spanning tree method consists in implementing the
topological algorithms of construction of the minimal spanning trees in order to select the
relevant edges within the full distance matrix. To this end, we use the Kruskal's algorithm and


4
  Topological representations of assets portfolios necessarily rely on price correlations. The main argument against
Pearson linear correlations is that they would be biased in times of high volatility. However we are using monthly
data, which show attenuated volatility episodes. In addition, correlations are calculated with sliding windows of 100
datapoints which corresponds to more than 8 years. Finally, all our results have been double checked using Spearman
rank correlations. The results are available upon request.


                                                                                                                   8
the Prim's algorithm as a robustness test. The minimal spanning tree which is associated to a
given distance matrix is unique. It is associated with a hierarchical tree of identical branching
which displays the hierarchy of distances within the network. We construct this hierarchical tree
using the nearest neighbor method.

3. Network structures and network indicators

3.1. Network structure of the database
       In this section, we explain how the minimal spanning tree network representation is
dervied which will be used to calculate time series of network indicators. We use the interwar
period as an example to illustrate the methodology. First, equation (2) is used to construct the full
distance matrix which is shown in Figure 3. This corresponds to a complete network in which all
the relationships between the nodes appear, either strong (short distance, wider edge) or weak
(long distance, thinner edges). The minimal spanning tree is obtained by isolating within this
complex set of relationships the ones which are the most economically meaningful. Figures 4-6
show different representations of the minimal spanning tree. Figure 4 combines in a 2-layer
representation the full distance matrix represented in Figure 3 (1st layer, in blue), and the
minimal spanning tree (2nd layer, in grey). In Figure 5, the 1st layer is removed to represent the
sole relationships belonging to the minimal spanning tree. Finally, the same relationships are
shown so that the edges do not cross in Figure 6. The last method provides an easily readable
network representation.

       Globalization is measured by the importance of the common component of the country
stock market indices. The MST is a network representation based on the importance of this
common component. The common component can generally be classified into three different
groups: 1) the absence of an edge (relatively low common component); 2) the existence of an
edge with a long distance (mid-level common component); 3) or the existence of an edge with a
short distance (relatively high common component). For example, consider the stock market
index for the United Kingdom during the interwar period. The UK equity market index has three
edges which indicates a high level of integration. This is also the case for Canada, which shows
strong relations both with the United States, United Kingdom, and the continental Europe
subtree.

3.2. Network indicators of distance and connectivity derived from the
minimal spanning tree
       One of the advantages of our network analysis is that it enables us to describe different
aspects of the process of financial globalization, for a given market segment. In particular, it is
possible to calculate several types of distance and connectivity indicators. The purpose of this
section is to show how these indicators are calculated and interpreted. We will again use an
example from the interwar period.




                                                                                                      11
In this example the UK has three nearest neighbors: Canada, Australia and Norway. In the case of the UK the
distance to the nearest neighbors is given by the average of the distances of the corresponding edges (0.96). The
average distance to the nearest neighbors at the network level is given by the average of node level measures (1.06).

          Figure 7 Average distance to the nearest neighbors (distance indicator). MST, interwar,
                       distances on the edges, nearest neighbors of the UK
         We use three types of distance indicators. Our first distance indicator is the average
distance to the nearest neighbors (Figure 7). The average distance to the nearest neighbors is
considered the most basic distance indicator. The nearest neighbor measures allow us to
characterize local vs. global integration. The average distance to the nearest neighbors is expected
to decrease when integration to the close neighborhood rises. We also use two path length
measures taking into account distances to the whole network. The average path length is one of
the most commonly used distance indicators. It takes into account for each node the total path
length to each of the other nodes in the network. In other words, the average path length from a
given node takes into account both local and global integration. The average path length is
expected to decrease when financial globalization rises. Finally, eccentricity is the largest
possible path length within the network for a given node (country stock market index). The
dynamics of eccentricity also measures convergence within the sample since for each node it
represents integration with the node with which it is the less integrated, and at the network level it
represents the weakest link within the sample. The eccentricity is expected to decrease when
integration to the furthest part of the world rises.




                                                                                                                   12
The example shows that the path from the UK to Denmark is composed of two steps: from the UK to Norway, and
from Norway to Denmark. The total path length between the UK and Denmark is then 0.94 + 0.86 = 1.8. In the case
of the UK the average path length is given by the average of all possible paths starting from the UK (2.58). The
average path length at the network level is given by the average of node level measures (3.59).

          Figure 8 Average path length (distance indicator). MST, interwar, path from the UK to
                                            Denmark




          The example shows the path from the UK to Belgium, which is the longest possible path starting from the
 UK in this network. In the case of the UK the eccentricity is given by the total length (sum of distances) within this
      path (4.72). The eccentricity at the network level is given by the average of node level measures (7.99).

 The example shows the degrees (number of nearest neighbors) of the nearest neighbors of the UK. In green: degree
of Canada (3), in light blue: degree of Australia (1), in pink: degree of Norway (3). In the case of the UK the average
   degree of the nearest neighbors is given by the average of 3, 1 and 3. The degree of the nearest neighbors at the
                             network level is given by the average of node level measures.

              Figure 10 Average degree of the nearest neighbors (connectivity indicator). MST,
                     interwar, degrees of the nearest neighbors (NN) of the UK.
        In addition, we also use two types of connectivity indicators. The first connectivity
indicator is the average degree (number of neighbors) of the nearest neighbors. It tends to rise
when the structure of the network evolves from a basic and merely linear structure to multi-star
and finally a star structure. In network terms, the reason why a star structure is considered as
more integrated is that the path between any two nodes will be shorter because the number of
steps is shorter (in comparison with a merely linear structure). The average degree of the nearest
neighbors is expected to increase when globalization increases. In the case of the UK the high
degree of the nearest neighbors likely reflects the role of London as a global financial center and
as a propagator of the common shock of the 1929 Wall Street Crash.




                                                                                                                    14
The example shows the degree (nearest neighbors) of the UK. In the case of the UK the degree, or number of nearest
neighbors, is 3 (Canada, Australia, Norway). The standard deviation of the degree of the nodes at the network level is
                               given by the standard deviation of node level measures.

           Figure 11 Standard deviation of the degree of the nodes (connectivity indicator). MST,
                                    interwar, degree of the UK
Finally, the standard deviation of the degree of the nodes measures the dispersion of the network
nodes connectivity. It is also increasing when the structure of the network becomes less linear
(where all nodes have one or two connections) and closer to a star network (where a single node
has a high number of connections and the remainder of the sample one or two connections only).
Thus, the standard deviation of the degree of the nodes is expected to increase when globalization
increases.

4. Results

4.1. Time series of network indicators
         We analyze long-run stock market integration by computing rolling windows of the
distance and network indicators. The integration measures are calculated by replicating the
construction of minimal spanning trees over rolling periods of 100 data points, starting from the
beginning of the sample period in 1913 (Abry et al., 2019). The method produces time series of
network indicators, where each point corresponds to the structure of the network over the

connectivity measures.6

         The end of the 1st era of globalization (1913)7 is characterized by high nearest neighbor
distances which would indicate a low level of financial integration. On the other hand, the path
length measures (average distance to the nearest neighbors, eccentricity) are relatively low.
Connectivity measures are also relatively high, which combined with the previous observation of
low path length measures suggest that the end of the 1st era is a high point of globalization in
stock market networks.8

         Moving forward, we find that the interwar period is a period of disintegration. However,
the 1920s witnessed integration with the common rise in stock markets following the US lead.
This was followed by a common response of the global stock market network to the 1929 crash.
The large decline in stock prices in 1929 that ushered in a global bear market was accompanied
by decreasing distances and increasing connectivity in the global network of the major stock
exchanges. The reduction in distances likely reflected enhanced contagion of assets prices in the
aftermath of the crisis of 1929 (Maveyraud and Parent, 2017). However, between 1935 and 1940,
distance measures increase again and reach pre-1929 levels, possibly as a consequence of the rise
in protectionism during this period. Connectivity measures display the same pattern as distance
measures during the interwar period. The 1920s and the second half of the 1930s are
characterized by increasing distances and declining connectivity. The five-year period after the
1929 stock market crash shows increasing connectivity likely reflecting contagion or a common

  As a robustness check, in order to ensure comparability with Bekaert and Mehl (2017) who use 12 months rolling
windows, all time series of network indicators were double-checked with 12 data points windows. The trend and
break dates are robust for all indicators. However the short 12 data points window results in volatile and thus less
legible time series. This version of network indicators is available upon request.

  The break in the time series of network indicators during the 1910s and the interwar reflects missing data for 9
countries because their stock markets were closed. For 4 countries the markets were closed for the duration of the
conflict. These were Austria, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. By contrast during World War II the data is
missing for only 3 countries and only for a few months. The superimposed U-shaped pattern in sub-figures a) and b)
is obtained by a quadratic regression.

  The methodology is robust with regards to the increase in the size of the sample (10 countries in 1913, full
coverage since 1922). Indeed, the average nearest neighbors distance and the connectivity measures we are using do
not depend in any case on the size of the underlying network. As regards path lengths measures a strong robustness
check is that working on the same database as Bekaert & Mehl (2017) we get time series which are very close to
their global betas (calculated as the ratio between the covariance between the returns of a given asset and the market
portfolio, and the variance of the return of the market portfolio) obtained with a CAPM. For more details see Figure
6 p.47 in Bekaert & Mehl, 2017.

Great Depression shock. Overall, the interwar period is an era of disintegration, which is
expressed in terms of network indicators by an increase in distances and a reduction in
connectivity.

       The Bretton Woods period (1950-early 1970s) is characterized by large, but stable
distances between country stock markets based on the distance to nearest neighbor indicator.
There is also a decline in the average path length and eccentricity that indicates increasing
integration. In contrast, the connectivity indicators are clearly on the rise and increasingly
volatile. This may reflect the role of capital controls. The early Bretton Woods era seems to
share the (high) distance characteristics of the classical gold standard and interwar periods, and
the (increasing) connectivity dynamics of the recent period of globalization. On balance, financial
globalization of stock markets in the Bretton Woods period is probably not higher than in the
classical gold standard based on 1913 levels of integration. This likely reflects the presence of
binding capital controls under Bretton Woods.

       The second period of financial globalization is characterized by unprecedented levels of
all distance and connectivity indicators. Connectivity indicators are also characterized by
unprecedented volatility, meaning that the structure of the network is less stable than ever. The
major stylized fact is the drastic reduction in distances and increase in connectivity in the
aftermath of the 2008 crisis. It is also interesting to note that the stock market crash which
accompanied a major financial crisis in 2008 affects network characteristics much more than the
stock market crash of 2001. The decrease in the distance measures accelerates. Connectivity
indicators begin rising again, while they are temporarily decreasing between 1995 and 2008. At
the end of the period, distance measures fall outside their historical range. For example, the
average path length ranges from about 2.5 to 5.5 between 1930 and the end of the 1990s. Its value
is about 1.3 in 2017. Connectivity indicators also reach unprecedented levels and volatility. The
post 1980 is historically atypical from the point of view of all network indicators.

       Overall, the nearest neighbor measure indicates that integration is much higher during the
recent period of globalization than any other period. With respect to the path length indicators
reported in Figures 12b and 12c, the distance indicators show that stock market integration is
considerably higher during the recent period of globalization than any other period in modern
financial history. Indeed, the distance indicators suggest that equity market integration is best


                                                                                                     17
described as a hook rather than a U-shape as many studies have found for other economic and
financial markets. Integration was high during the first era of globalization followed by 60 years
of decreasing integration. Since the early 1970s, integration has dramatically increased to a point
which is significantly greater than the high levels of integration seen during the pre-1913 period.

        In this section, we discuss some additional results at the country level. One of the
advantages of our network method is that it allows us to characterize both the dynamics of
financial globalization at the network level, and the dynamic of any given country stock market
(node) within the network. To this end, the most commonly used representation is the
hierarchical tree, which is discussed below. The hierarchical tree displays the hierarchy of
distances within the network. We also propose histograms of distance matrices, which enable us
to observe how the distribution of distances changes over time; and time series of network
indicators at the node level for a selection of countries (France, Germany, Japan, UK, USA),
which enable us to observe country specific declinations of the global pattern.

        As discussed in Section 3.3, the minimal spanning tree displays the structure of the
network. The nodes correspond to stock markets, and the edges that connect the nodes represent
the most significant relationships extracted from the distance matrix. By definition, the minimal
spanning tree is connected (all nodes are connected to the network by at least one edge) and is
cycleless (no path starting from a node of the network returns to this node). The hierarchical tree
(Figure 13) displays in a hierarchical way the distances by which the nodes of the minimal
spanning tree are connected to the network. That is, the lowest the value on the x-axis of the
hierarchical tree, the shortest the distance.

        Figure 13 shows the hierarchical trees by sub-periods. As expected, the USA always
belongs to the shortest edge, with the exception of the recent period of globalization where they
remain among the shortest but are less integrated than a small cluster of European economies.
Interestingly, the UK is among the most integrated in the recent period, but less so in the interwar
and Bretton Woods period. This may reflect the 1931 devaluation of the pound and the binding
capital controls and exchange controls under Bretton Woods and the general relative weakening
of the UK economy and the declining role of sterling as a global currency. Regarding the less


                                                                                                  19
integrated nodes, Japan and Spain are always characterized by distances which are among the
highest in the global stock market network. Japan had extensive capital controls and exchange
controls in Bretton Woods. Spain was an emerging country until the 1980s and was not well
connected to the rest of Europe. It was engulfed by the Civil War in the 1930s. It also had capital
and exchange controls throughout this period. Germany, is an interesting case study. The German
equity market was among the least integrated markets during the interwar and Bretton Woods
periods. This reflected the chaos of the hyperinflation in the 1920s and the extensive exchange
and capital controls in the Nazi regime as well as capital controls under Bretton Woods. Since
then, the German stock market has become one of the most integrated markets in the modern
period of globalization reflecting the rise of Germany as an export driven economic superpower
in the past five decades. The German experience highlights the rise of the European Union and
the Eurozone which has led to greater stock market integration in Europe as shown by the
hierarchical tree in Figure 13c where seven European stock markets have the smallest distance
measures in the recent period of financial globalization.

                                       skewed distribution



        The histograms of distance matrices (Figure 14) also enable us to highlight additional
features of the global hook since they display the distribution of distances within the network.
The most striking feature is the highly specific distribution of distances of the late 2nd era, that
supports the results of Section 5.1. While the distributions of distances in all previous sub-periods
are in the range of about 1 to 1.5, the distribution in the recent era is in the range of about 0.6 to
1.1. In addition, contrary to the previous distributions, it is not rightly skewed, i.e. it is not
distorted in the sense of the highest values. This may suggest that the return of financial



                                                                                                       22
globalization in the post World War II period was slow to appear. The histograms of distance
matrices also highlight the lasting divergence, within the atypically high integration in recent
period of globalization, of a small group of nodes (Spain, Japan). This likely reflects the huge
Japanese housing and stock market boom in the 1980s followed by the crash of 1990 from which
Japan has yet to fully recover. Spain experienced two serious house price booms and busts and
several stock market crashes in this period (Bordo and Landon Lane (2014)). The finding
highlights the growing instability of the global stock market network in the recent age of
globalization.

       Finally, time series of the network indicators at the country level also provide additional
findings. The average distance to the nearest neighbors is presented in Figure 15 and the
eccentricity is presented in Figure 16. Both sets of figures show the dramatic decrease in the
distance measures for the stock markets in the five countries. In all cases, the average path length
has fallen by more than 50 percent since their peak value that usually occurred in the 1950s or
1960s. The decline in the distance measures really shows the increase in financial integration of
the global stock market network over time. With respect to eccentricity (largest distance to
another market), we once again see large declines which is consistent with the interpretation that
the second era of globalization has the highest level of stock market integration in world history.




5. Conclusion
       We provide one of the first long-run studies of the evolution of stock market integration
since the early 1900s. We employ a network analysis of 17 markets to study the history of global
stock market integration as well as the integration between countries over time. The empirical
analysis suggests that stock market integration can be described as an unstable hook. Our findings
indicate that equity market integration was very high at the end of the gold standard period based
on the average distance between stock markets and the connectivity measures from the network

                                                                                                       24
analysis. It is important to note, however, that stock market integration during the first period of
globalization was not very high based on a nearest neighbor criteria. With the outbreak of World
War I, financial integration retreated as the global markets experienced the Great Crash of 1929
and the Great Depression. This led to protectionist measures as countries look inward. Stock
market integration declined.

       Following the end of World War II, the global stock market network largely remained
unchanged from the interwar period for almost the next 30 years as measured by the distance
indicators and connectivity measures of the network analysis. This most likely reflects the capital
and exchange controls under Bretton Woods as well as the presence of major controls on the
domestic financial markets and institutions of most countries until the 1980s and 1990s.

Only with the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the subsequent rise of the recent period
of globalization have we seen a dramatic rise in stock market integration. The nearest neighbor
and path length distance indicators show that the modern period of globalization has an
unparalleled level of financial integration. A significant portion of the increase in integration can
be attributed to the creation of the European Union and the Eurozone. This has led to increased
integration in trade and capital market. For example, Germany's stock market was poorly
integrated in the interwar and Bretton Woods period. Presently, it is one of the most integrated
stock markets in the world based on the distance measures. The high level of global financial
integration has also come with a cost. The connectivity measures indicate that the second era of
globalization not only has the highest level of stock market integration, but the global stock
market network also has the highest level of financial instability in world history as measured by
the network analysis.
