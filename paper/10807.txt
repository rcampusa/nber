                                           ABSTRACT

We argue that managerial overconfidence can account for corporate investment distortions.

Overconfident managers overestimate the returns to their investment projects and view external

funds as unduly costly. Thus, they overinvest when they have abundant internal funds, but curtail

investment when they require external financing. We test the overconfidence hypothesis, using panel

data on personal portfolio and corporate investment decisions of Forbes 500 CEOs. We classify

CEOs as overconfident if they persistently fail to reduce their personal exposure to company-specific

risk. We find that investment of overconfident CEOs is significantly more responsive to cash flow,

particularly in equity-dependent firms.

In this paper, we argue that personal characteristics of CEOs in large corporations lead to

distortions in corporate investment policies. In particular, we study the investment deci-

sions of CEOs who overestimate the future returns of their companies, measured by failure

to divest company-specific risk on their personal accounts. We find that overconfident CEOs

have a heightened sensitivity of corporate investment to cash flow, particularly among equity-

dependent firms.


The two traditional explanations for investment distortions are the misalignment of managerial

and shareholders interests (Jensen and Meckling (1976), Jensen (1986)) and asymmetric infor-

mation between corporate insiders and the capital market (Myers and Majluf (1984)). Both

cause investment to be sensitive to the amount of cash in the firm. Under the agency view,

managers overinvest to reap private benefits such as “perks,” large empires, and entrenchment.

Since the external capital market limits the extent to which managers can pursue self-interested

investment, an influx of cash flow enables the manager to invest more and increases investment

distortions. Under asymmetric information, the managers themselves (who act in the interest

of shareholders) restrict external financing in order to avoid diluting the (undervalued) shares

of their company. In this case, cash flow increases investment, but reduces the distortion.

The empirical literature, starting with Fazzari, Hubbard and Petersen (1988), confirms the

existence and robustness of investment-cash flow sensitivity after controlling for investment

opportunities. While most of the literature relates investment-cash flow sensitivity to imper-

fections in the capital market, this interpretation remains controversial (Kaplan and Zingales,

(1997), (2000); Fazzari, Hubbard and Petersen, (2000)).


We propose an alternative explanation for investment-cash flow sensitivity and suboptimal

                                               1
investment behavior. Rather than focusing on firm-level characteristics, we relate corporate

investment decisions to personal characteristics of the top decision-maker inside the firm. Build-

ing on Roll (1986) and Heaton (2002), we argue that one important link between investment

levels and cash flow is the tension between the beliefs of the CEO and the market about the

value of the firm. Overconfident CEOs systematically overestimate the return to their invest-

ment projects. If they have suﬃcient internal funds for investment and are not disciplined by

the capital market or corporate governance mechanisms, they overinvest relative to the first

best. If they do not have suﬃcient internal funds, however, they are reluctant to issue new

equity because they perceive the stock of their company to be undervalued by the market. As

a result, they curb their investment. Additional cash flow provides an opportunity to invest

closer to their desired level.


Our overconfidence story builds upon a prominent stylized fact from the social psychology

literature, the “better than average” eﬀect. When individuals assess their relative skill, they

tend to overstate their acumen relative to the average (Larwood and Whittaker, (1977); Sven-

son, (1981); Alicke, (1985)). This eﬀect extends to economic decision-making in experiments

(Camerer and Lovallo (1999)). It also aﬀects the attribution of causality. Because individuals

expect their behavior to produce success, they are more likely to attribute good outcomes to

their actions, but bad outcomes to (bad) luck (Miller and Ross (1975)). Executives appear to be

particularly prone to display overconfidence, both in terms of the “better-than-average eﬀect”

and in terms of “narrow confidence intervals” (Larwood and Whittaker, (1977); Kidd, (1970);

Moore, (1977)).1 This finding is attributed to three main factors, which trigger overconfidence:

the illusion of control, a high degree of commitment to good outcomes, and abstract reference


                                                2
points that make it hard to compare performance across individuals (Weinstein (1980); Alicke

et al. (1995)). All three factors are pertinent in the context of corporate investment. A CEO

who hand-picks an investment project is likely to believe he can control its outcome and to

underestimate the likelihood of failure (March and Shapira (1987); Langer, (1975)). The typi-

cal CEO is also highly committed to good company performance since his personal wealth and

the value of his human capital fluctuate with the company’s stock price. And finally, assessing

relative managerial skill or, specifically, the ability to pick profitable investment projects is

diﬃcult — even ex post — due to other factors that influence overall firm performance.


Heaton (2002) first showed that common distortions in corporate investment may be the result

of managers overestimating the returns to their investment. We expand on Heaton’s insight in

two ways. First, we model how the pre-existing capital structure aﬀects the role of overconfi-

dence. Second, we empirically test the predictions of the model.


To construct measures of overconfidence, we exploit the over-exposure of typical CEOs to their

firms’ idiosyncratic risk. CEOs receive large grants of stock and options as compensation. They

cannot trade their options or hedge the risk by short-selling company stock, and the value of

their human capital is intimately linked to the firm’s performance. Because of this under-

diversification, risk-averse CEOs should exercise their options early given a suﬃciently high

stock price (Lambert, Larcker and Verrechia (1991); Meulbroek, (2001); Hall and Murphy,

(2000), (2002)). We take two main approaches to translate this logic into overconfidence

measures. First, we identify a benchmark for the minimum percentage in the money at which

CEOs should exercise their options for a given year immediately following the vesting period.

If a CEO persistently exercises options later than suggested by the benchmark, we infer that he

                                               3
is overconfident in his ability to keep the company’s stock price rising and wants to profit from

expected price increases by holding the options. Second, we look at the end of the option’s

duration. If a CEO is optimistic enough about his firm’s future performance that he holds

options all the way to expiration (typically ten years), we classify him as overconfident. Finally,

since under-diversified CEOs should also avoid acquiring additional equity, we classify CEOs

who habitually increase their holdings of company stock as overconfident.


We apply these measures to a panel data set on the options and stock holdings of CEOs of 477

large U.S. companies between 1980 and 1994. As a first test of the classifications, we find that

CEOs who excessively hold company stock options do not earn significant abnormal returns

over the S&P 500 on average. This result helps to rule out alternative explanations of “late

exercise” based on inside information. We also explicitly address other potential explanations

of our overconfidence measures. In the second step of the analysis, we show that investment-

cash flow sensitivity is significantly higher for “late exercisers” or “stock purchasers” than for

their peers. As predicted by the model, overconfident CEOs invest more when they have more

cash at hand. Further, the sensitivity of investment to cash flow is strongest for CEOs of equity

dependent firms, for whom perceived financing constraints are most binding.


We provide complementary evidence that CEO characteristics other than overconfidence have

explanatory power for corporate decision-making. CEOs with an engineering (or scientific) ed-

ucation or employment background display higher investment-cash flow sensitivity, while CEOs

with a financial education or employment background exhibit lower sensitivity. Furthermore,

the sensitivity is higher for “depression babies” born in the 1930s and CEOs who assume multi-

ple positions in their company (president, chairman of the board). These findings lend further

                                                4
support to the view that not only firm-level, but also personal characteristics are important

for a better understanding of corporate decision-making.2 However, overconfidence matters for

investment-cash flow sensitivity beyond the eﬀects of these observable CEO characteristics.


One caveat to our results is the issue of endogeneity. Observable personal characteristics like

employment background or birth cohort could be selection criteria for the CEO. Boards may

even take overconfidence into account in choosing a CEO — though this seems harder to identify

ex ante. We are able to alleviate some endogeneity concerns with additional controls. We show

that our results are not driven by industry eﬀects, firm eﬀects (where possible), or tangible

firm characteristics like size and degree of financial constraint. Most importantly, however,

endogeneity does not aﬀect our main conclusion. If the board chooses a CEO because of his

overconfidence, it should be aware of the “dark sides” of this personality feature (such as

distorted investment behavior) and take steps to explicitly address them.


The overconfidence-based explanation for investment distortions has a number of novel policy

implications. Traditional theories, which link investment-cash flow sensitivity to capital market

imperfections or misaligned incentives, propose timely disclosure of corporate accounts or high-

powered incentives as potential remedies. Our findings suggest that these provisions may not

suﬃce to address managerial discretion. A manager whose incentives are perfectly aligned

and who does not face any informational asymmetries may still invest suboptimally if he is

overconfident. He believes that he is acting in the best interest of shareholders. Thus, refined

corporate governance structures, involving a more active board of directors or constraints on

the use of internal funds, may be necessary to achieve first best investment levels.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section I we present a simple model

that develops the prediction that managerial overconfidence leads to positive investment-cash

flow sensitivity. In Section II we introduce the data used in our analysis. Section III describes

the construction of our overconfidence measures and discusses alternative explanations. Sec-

tion IV provides evidence that overconfidence increases the sensitivity of investment to cash

flow. Section V provides evidence that CEO overconfidence matters more in equity-dependent

firms. Section VI assesses the robustness of the overconfidence eﬀect to the inclusion of other

observable CEO characteristics. Section VII concludes.




I    Model


We propose a simple two-period model that demonstrates the eﬀect of managerial overconfi-

dence on corporate investment in an eﬃcient capital market. Since our goal is to demonstrate

the distortionary power of overconfidence, we abstract from informational asymmetries and

agency problems and assume that the manager maximizes current shareholder value.3 The

only friction in the model comes from the manager’s inflated perception of the firm’s invest-

ment opportunities.


Consider a firm with existing assets A and s shares outstanding. At time 1, cash flow C is

realized. The CEO chooses the level of investment I ∈ [0, ∞) and a means of financing. The

investment generates a (weakly positive) stochastic future return, realized at time 2. We denote

the expected return to investment I as R(I), with R0 > 0 and R00 < 0 for all I. To guarantee

interior solutions, we also assume that R0 (I) > 1 for some I. The interest rate is normalized


                                               6
to zero. An overconfident CEO overestimates future returns by percentage ∆. Hence, for all

levels of investment I, the CEO perceives the expected return to be R(I) · (1 + ∆), with ∆ = 0

in the benchmark case of a rational CEO.


To finance I, the CEO can either use internal funds or raise external finance (debt or equity).

We consider the choice among cash, risk-free debt, and equity. In this setting, equity is the only

financial instrument where the CEO’s overestimation of future returns results in disagreement

about the appropriate price.4 We assume that the firm has an exogenous capacity for riskless

debt D determined by the collateral value of the existing assets and, thus, strictly smaller

than the going-concern value (A > D). This condition ensures repayment in all states of the

world and arises endogenously if there is a positive probability of investment failure (i.e. zero

returns) for all I. The maximization problem of the CEO is thus:


                                     s
                            max           [A + C + R(I)(1 + ∆) − c − d]                        (1)
                                   s + s0

                                  s0
                           s.t.        (A + C + R(I) − c − d) = I − c − d                      (2)
                                s + s0

                                  c ≤ C,   d ≤ D,       c+d≤I                                  (3)

                                  c ≥ 0,   d ≥ 0,       I≥0                                    (4)



where c is the amount of cash financing, d the amount of debt financing, and s0 the number of

new shares. New shareholders demand an equity stake equal in value to the amount of capital

they provide to the firm, I − c − d. Let (I ∗ , c∗ , d∗ ) be the solution to the CEO’s maximization

                                                                           ˆ =
problem (1)-(4). Further, let Iˆ be the level of investment satisfying R0 (I)        1
                                                                                    1+∆   and IF B

be the (first-best) level of investment satisfying R0 (IF B ) = 1. Then, the following lemma


                                                    7
characterizes the eﬃciency of the CEO’s investment decision.


Lemma 1. (i) If the CEO is rational (∆ = 0), I ∗ = IF B for all C, D. (ii) If the CEO is

overconfident (∆ > 0), I ∗ = Iˆ > IF B for all C, D such that C + D ≥ I,
                                                                      ˆ and Iˆ > I ∗ > IF B for

                           ˆ
all C, D such that C + D < I.


Proof. See Appendix.


Not surprisingly, the rational CEO invests at the first-best level regardless of the availability

of internal funds. The overconfident CEO, instead, overinvests. Perceived financing costs,

however, mitigate overinvestment if the CEO is cash-constrained, implying sensitivity to cash

flow as summarized in the following proposition.



Proposition 1 (i) If the CEO is rational (∆ = 0), I ∗ is independent of internal cash flow C

for all C, D. (ii) If the CEO is overconfident (∆ > 0), I ∗ is independent of C for all C, D such

that C + D ≥ Iˆ and strictly increasing in C for all C, D such that C + D < I.
                                                                            ˆ



Proof. See Appendix.


An overconfident CEO believes (incorrectly) that the market is understating the present value

of investment returns and that issuing shares will dilute the claims of current sharehold-

ers. Thus, he is unwilling to issue shares to finance his desired investment level, generating

investment-cash flow sensitivity when internal resources are scarce. Proposition 1 also illumi-

nates the importance of a firm’s debt capacity. The higher is D the more likely are cash and

                                                                                ˆ Thus, we
debt financing to be suﬃcient for any desired level of investment, i.e. C + D ≥ I.

expect to observe investment-cash flow sensitivity more often in equity-dependent firms (with

                                               8
overconfident CEOs) than in firms with untapped debt capacity.


While the overinvestment result depends on the specification of overconfidence, the finding

of investment-cash flow sensitivity does not. For instance, suppose that the CEO is also

overconfident about the value of existing assets, A. Some of these assets could be his own prior

investments so that he also overestimates future cash flows generated by A. We can capture

this overestimation as an upward bias in the valuation of A, which may be smaller or larger

                                                                              s
than the overestimation of the return flow R. The CEO then maximizes         s+s0 [A (1 + ∆A )   +

R(I)(1 + ∆R ) + C − c − d]. In this setting, the overconfident CEO displays investment-cash

flow sensitivity, both for ∆A > ∆R and for ∆A < ∆R . However, the CEO underinvests when

∆A > ∆R and overinvests when ∆A < ∆R .


Assuming that other factors which influence investment cash-flow sensitivity do not vary sys-

tematically with overconfidence, we have the following two empirically testable predictions.


Prediction 1. The investment of overconfident CEOs is more sensitive to cash flow than the

investment of CEOs who are not overconfident.


Prediction 2. The investment-cash flow sensitivity of overconfident CEOs is more pronounced

in equity-dependent firms.


Whether investment-cash flow sensitivity increases in overconfidence depends on the specifi-

cation of the return function and, more generally, of the overconfidence model.5 Therefore,

we will not attempt to construct a continuous measure of overconfidence but rather compare

the investment behavior of “overconfident” versus “non-overconfident” CEOs. Even taking this

approach, however, measurement error might weaken or hide the diﬀerence between investment-


                                               9
cash flow sensitivity in the overconfident and non-overconfident groups if the relationship is

not monotonic. Therefore, the success of the empirical analysis depends on the precision of

our measure of overconfidence.


In the following Sections, we test these two predictions. The empirical analysis consists of two

steps. The first step is the construction of an empirical overconfidence measure. The second

step is the analysis of the relationship between overconfidence and the sensitivity of investment

to cash flow (Prediction 1) and the change in this relationship as equity-dependence increases

(Prediction 2).




II     Data


We analyze a sample of 477 large publicly-traded United States firms from the years 1980 to

1994. To be included in the sample, a firm must appear at least four times on one of the lists

of largest US companies compiled by Forbes magazine in the period from 1984 to 1994.6


The core of the data set is described in detail in Hall and Liebman (1998) and Yermack

(1995). Here, we will simply highlight some of the more important features of the data for our

purposes. The virtue of this data set is that it provides us with detailed information on the

stock ownership and set of option packages — including exercise price, remaining duration, and

number of underlying shares — for the CEO of each company year by year. From this data

we obtain a fairly detailed picture of the CEO’s portfolio rebalancing over his tenure. What

we cannot deduce is the exact stock price at which the exercise of a particular option package

occurred in a given year. Thus, whenever this information is required, we check the robustness


                                               10
of our results to three diﬀerent assumptions on the CEO’s ability to time the market in the

short run: first, that exercise occurs at the maximum price during the fiscal year, second, that

it occurs at the median price, and, third, that it occurs at the mean price.


In order to examine the relationship between a CEO’s transactions on his personal account and

on corporate accounts, we supplement the data set with various items from the COMPUSTAT

database. We measure investment as capital expenditures (item 128), cash flow as earnings

before extraordinary items (item 18) plus depreciation (item 14), and capital as property,

plants and equipment (item 8). We normalize investment and cash flow with beginning-of-the-

year capital. Given that our sample is not limited to manufacturing firms (though it mainly

consists of large, nonfinancial firms), we check the robustness of our results to normalization

by assets (item 6). We measure Q as the ratio of market value of assets to book value of assets.

Market value of assets is defined as total assets (item6) plus market equity minus book equity.

Market equity is defined as common shares outstanding (item 25) times fiscal year closing

price (item 199). Book equity is calculated as stockholders’ equity (item 216) [or the first

available of common equity (item 60) plus preferred stock par value (item 130) or total assets

(item 6) minus total liabilities (item 181)] minus preferred stock liquidating value (item 10)

[or the first available of redemption value (item 56) or par value (item 130)] plus balance sheet

deferred taxes and investment tax credit (item 35) when available minus post retirement assets

(item 336) when available. Book value of assets is total assets (item 6).7 The data contains

a few severe outliers, e.g. observations of capital normalized cash flow that are more than 50

standard deviations away from the mean. To ensure that these outliers do not contaminate

our results, we trim cash flow at the one percent level.8


                                               11
In addition, we supplement the data with personal information about the CEOs’ employment

histories and educational backgrounds, using Dun and Bradstreet and Who’s Who in Finance

and Industry. We classify CEOs into three groups based on their field of study: CEOs with

finance education (undergraduate or graduate degrees in accounting, finance, business, and

economics), CEOs with technical education (degree in engineering or the natural sciences),

and CEOs with other degrees (law, literature, etc.)9 We also classify CEOs into three groups

based on their employment experience: CEOs with a career in finance if they previously worked

in a financial institution, as a CFO, treasurer, accountant or in other finance-related positions;

CEOs with a technical career if they are individual patent-holders, previously worked as an

engineer or in other technically-oriented positions; and CEOs with a general management

career. Finally, we use CRSP to gather stock prices for the companies in our sample. The left

columns of Table I (“Full Sample”) present the summary statistics of the data.10

III     Overconfidence Measures


A     Definitions


We construct three measures of overconfidence, or proxies for ∆, based on the personal portfolio

decisions of CEOs: Holder 67, Longholder, and Net Buyer. The first two measures, Holder

67 and Longholder, use the timing of option exercises to identify overconfidence. The third

measure, Net Buyer, uses the habitual acquisition of company stock. Our measures exploit the


                                               12
underdiversification of CEOs. CEO compensation contracts regularly contain large quantities

of stock and option grants. To maximize the incentive eﬀects of these holdings, the options

cannot be traded and the sale of stock may be restricted. Further, firms prohibit CEOs from

perfectly hedging against the risk by short-selling company stock. Most importantly, CEOs’

human capital is invested in their firms, so that a bad outcome in the firm will not only

negatively impact their personal portfolios, but also reduce their outside options. All of these

eﬀects leave CEOs highly exposed to the idiosyncratic risk of their company.


Unlike perfectly hedged outside investors, then, CEOs must trade oﬀ the option-value of hold-

ing stock options against the costs of underdiversification. Though the optimal schedule for

exercise depends on their individual wealth, degree of risk-aversion and diversification (Hall and

Murphy (2002)), it is generally true that risk aversion and underdiversification predict early

exercise of executive options. Similarly, underdiversified CEOs, in order to divest themselves of

idiosyncratic risk, should minimize their holdings of company stock. Overconfidence, however,

may lead CEOs to overestimate the future returns of their investment projects. Therefore,

they believe that the stock prices of their companies will continue to rise under their leader-

ship more than they objectively should expect. As a result, overconfidence induces them to

postpone option exercise or even buy additional company stock in order to benefit personally

from the expected future gains.


These arguments may not hold for CEOs who display overoptimism about exogenous variables

or overestimate the precision of their beliefs. Overoptimism about the general economic en-

vironment need not induce investment in the CEOs’ own companies. Miscalibration reduces

the expected volatility of the stock and thus the value of holding options. The key aspects of

                                               13
overconfidence for our results are overestimation of skill and self-attribution by the CEO.


Holder 67. For our first measure, we consider the status of each individual option package in

our sample at the end of the vesting period. To maintain comparability across packages with

vesting periods of diﬀerent duration, we examine the first year in which all of the packages

in the sample are at least partially exercisable, year five. We then compute the percentage

in the money for each package. Risk aversion and underdiversification predict that CEOs

should exercise options immediately after the vesting period if the amount in the money is

beyond a rational benchmark. We use the Hall and Murphy (2002) framework as a theoretical

guide in choosing a reasonable benchmark for the percentage in the money at or above which

CEOs should exercise newly-vested options. We also follow their calibrations to proxy for

(unobserved) CEO wealth, diversification, and risk-aversion. We apply the resulting threshold

for early exercise to the full sample of CEOs (rather than attempting to calibrate individually)

and check the robustness of our results to a wide range of reasonable parameter values.


To begin, we take 67 percent in the money during the fifth year as our threshold. If an

option is more than 67 percent in the money at some point in year five, the CEO should have

exercised at least some portion of the package during or before the fifth year. This threshold

corresponds to a risk aversion of three in a CRRA utility specification and to a percentage of

wealth in company equity equal to 66. We then construct Holder 67 as follows. We consider

the subsample of CEOs who at least twice during the sample period had options that were

valued above the threshold during the fifth year. We then identify the first instance (if any)

at which the CEO failed to exercise such an option during or before the fifth year. From this




                                              14
point in time onward, we classify the CEO as overconfident if he subsequently exhibits the

same behavior at least one more time during his tenure as CEO. As we are interested in a

“permanent” rather than “transitory” overconfidence eﬀect, our measure targets CEOs who

“habitually” exercise options late. We repeat this exercise starting at 50 percent in the money

and incrementing by five up to 150 percent in the money to verify the robustness of our results

to variations in the parameters (e.g., 100 percent corresponds to ρ = 3; 50 percent of wealth

in stock).


Whenever we use these Holder measures in an estimation, we restrict the sample to CEOs

who at least twice during the sample period had options that were valued above the threshold

during the fifth year. This restriction guarantees that every CEO in the subsample had the

“opportunity” to be classified as overconfident and, thus, limits the degree of unobserved

overconfidence in the control group. It also guarantees that we are not overproportionally

identifying CEOs as overconfident when the stock of their firm is doing well. On the other

hand, our restriction considerably limits the number of observations; for Holder 67, it declines

from 3728 to 1058.


Longholder. To construct our second measure, Longholder, we focus on the expiration date of

option packages rather than the end of the vesting period. We classify a CEO as overconfident

(for all of his years in the sample) if he ever holds an option until the last year of its duration.

As the typical option in the sample has 10 years duration and is fully vested (at the latest)

by year five, the CEO chooses to hold, rather than exercise, the option for at least five years.

Thus, again, our measure targets “habitual” failure to diversify, or a “personality,” rather than




                                                15
“time-varying,” overconfidence eﬀect. Further, over 85 percent of options that are held until

their final year are in the money and the median percentage in the money for such options is

253 percent. Thus the CEO could have profitably exercised these options before their last year.

Indeed, failure to exercise these options prior to expiration is diﬃcult to reconcile with any

reasonable calibration of the Hall and Murphy framework. Therefore, the Longholder measure

alleviates the dependence on calibrated thresholds for rational exercise. It also enables us to

circumvent the sample restriction (and potential loss of power) of the Holder measures. It is

thus best suited for tests where we must reduce or split the sample (e.g. Prediction 2).


Net Buyer. To construct our third measure, Net Buyer, we exploit the tendency of some CEOs

to purchase additional company stock despite their already high exposure to company risk.

Specifically, we consider the subsample of CEOs who keep their position as CEO for at least

10 of the 15 years in our sample. We identify CEOs as overconfident if they were “net buyers”

of company equity during their first five years in our sample,11 i.e. bought stock on net in

more years than they sold on net during their first five sample years.12 Whenever we use

this measure in an estimation, we exclude the first five years of the CEOs’ tenures. Thus, we

use disjoint subsamples of CEO years to establish overconfidence and to measure its potential

eﬀects on investment. This approach ameliorates endogeneity concerns, but at the cost of

(again) reducing sample size substantially — here to 842.




                                              16
B    Discussion


In the middle and right columns of Table I, we show firm and CEO summary statistics for

subsamples of firm years determined by overconfidence sample restrictions and measured over-

confidence. For brevity, we use only Holder 67 in these comparisons. Thus, all firm years

included in either subsample are from firms with CEOs who meet the selection criterion of

having at least two options that exceeded the 67 percent threshold in year five. The patterns

are similar for the other overconfidence measures.13


Note that of the 113 CEOs who meet the selection criterion, 58 display overconfidence in

their personal portfolio decisions. By comparison, 85 of 661 CEOs are overconfident using the

Longholder measure and 97 of 158 using Net Buyer. Thus, the measure ensuring the largest

sample size, Longholder, is also the most conservative measure of overconfidence. There are no

significant diﬀerences in observable firm or CEO characteristics across the overconfident and

control samples. In particular, the distribution of firms across Fama-French industry groups is

virtually identical in the overall sample, the subsample satisfying the selection criterion, and

the overconfident subsample. Thus, our overconfidence measure appears orthogonal to firm

characteristics, at least as measured at the industry level.


In Table II, we present the pairwise correlations among the three overconfidence measures

and CEO and firm characteristics. We consider the overconfidence measures two at a time

due to diﬀerences in the subsamples on which we will apply them. Sample A presents the

correlations for Longholder and Holder 67 on the Holder 67 subsample; Sample B presents the

correlations for Longholder and Net Buyer on the Net Buyer subsample; Sample C presents


                                               17
the correlations for Net Buyer and Holder 67 on the intersection of the Net Buyer and Holder

67 subsamples. The correlation between Longholder and Holder 67 is strong and highly sig-

nificant (0.2472). The correlation between Net Buyer and Holder 67 is also positive, though

weaker (0.0628). There is only a small positive correlation between Net Buyer and Longholder.

Overall, these relationships suggest that our measures are capturing the same eﬀect. We find

few reliable correlations between our overconfidence measures and firm or CEO characteris-

tics. The relationships often reverse for diﬀerent overconfidence measures or for the same

measure on diﬀerent subsamples of data, suggesting that overconfidence is not proxying for

firm characteristics or observable CEO characteristics.



                                  [INSERT TABLE II HERE]



Of particular interest are the relationships among stock ownership, vested options and our

overconfidence measures. Mechanistically, an overconfident CEO who delays option exercise

or purchases additional company stock will increase his holdings. However, other factors — like

firm size, firm age, corporate governance, and tenure — are substantially more important in

determining the level of ownership. Overall, then, it is not surprising that there is no consistent

correlation between stock or option ownership and the overconfidence measures. Further, the

board typically grants stock and options to confer incentives on the CEO. But, traditional

agency theory suggests that the incentive eﬀect of stock and options will reduce investment-cash

flow sensitivity, the opposite prediction of our overconfidence model. Thus, simple measures

of stock and option ownership are not adequate to capture CEO overconfidence, particularly

in this context.


                                                18
Before turning to the eﬀects of overconfidence on investment, we briefly consider some alter-

native explanations of the measures.


1. Inside information. A CEO may decide not to decrease exposure to company risk because

of private information about future stock prices that makes holding options or buying stock

attractive. Inside information also predicts investment-cash flow sensitivity. Since the infor-

mation has not been incorporated into the market price, the firm’s stock is undervalued and

investment may be sensitive to cash flow for the usual Myers-Majluf reasons.


One of the key distinctions between overconfidence and information is persistence. Positive

information is most naturally viewed as a transitory, rather than fixed eﬀect. Information with

enough precision to justify increasing exposure to company risk is likely to be short term, and

it is unlikely that the same CEO would repeatedly receive positive draws. Our overconfidence

measures, instead, target a habitual tendency to hold too much company risk (or a fixed

overconfidence eﬀect). Holder 67 requires that a CEO fail to exercise options that are beyond

the threshold at least twice. Longholder requires that a CEO fail to exercise options for at

least five years. Net Buyer requires that the factor leading the CEO to purchase additional

company stock still aﬀects investment decisions in a disjoint future time period.


Still, Holder 67 places no restriction on how long the CEO must hold the option beyond

the fifth year and, thus, could potentially capture short term delays in option exercise. To

distinguish the two stories for this measure, we analyze the exercise behavior of CEOs over

time. Under the inside information hypothesis, we would expect a CEO to sometimes hold his

options (when he has positive inside information) and to sometimes exercise them early (when



                                              19
he has negative inside information). To test this, we run a random eﬀects probit regression of

the probability that a CEO holds an option that is at least 67 percent in the money in the

fifth year on the number of times that CEO has held such an option in the past.14 The sample

consists of the 759 firm years in which a CEO had options beyond the 67 percent threshold in

the fifth year after the grant date. The dependent variable is equal to one whenever the CEO

did not exercise any portion of those options prior to that year. Panel A of Table III presents

the regression results. In Column (1), the coeﬃcient of “past late exercises” is positive (0.2493)

and highly significant (z = 4.40). This implies that the typical CEO, rather than varying his

exercise behavior over time, either persistently holds options beyond the 67 percent threshold

or persistently exercises early. The results are robust to the inclusion of Q (Column 2) and the

firm’s earnings-price ratio (Column 3) as controls. Consistent with Jenter (2002), high values

of Q — perhaps, in this context, a proxy for market overvaluation — appear to decrease the

probability of late exercise. The earnings-price ratio eﬀect, on the other hand, appears to go

the wrong direction for an overvaluation story (though it is statistically insignificant). Panel

B of Table III shows the percentage of CEOs who hold an option that is 67 percent in the

money divided into categories based on the number of past late exercises. Overall, the results

suggest that the number of times a CEO has held a 67 percent-in-the-money option in the

past is considerably more important in determining the CEO’s future exercise behavior than

any information about current or future stock price performance — an indication of a personal

fixed eﬀect on option exercise decisions.



                                 [INSERT TABLE III HERE]



                                               20
The second key distinction between overconfidence and information is performance. If positive

information is the true reason for not diversifying the personal portfolio, then CEOs who

exhibit this behavior should earn positive abnormal returns over a strategy of diversification.

We calculate the distribution of returns among all CEOs who had options beyond the 67 percent

threshold, but did not exercise. We compare those returns to the (hypothetical) returns from

exercising the options during the fifth year and investing the proceeds in the S&P 500. As we

do not know the exact price at which CEOs exercised their options, we calculate the returns

under three alternative assumptions. First, we assume that CEOs are able to perfectly time

the market in the short run and exercise at the maximum price during the fiscal year of their

actual and hypothetical exercise. Then, as alternatives, we consider exercise at the mean or

median price during the year. Table IV shows that CEOs do not beat the market by holding

options beyond the threshold. The return diﬀerential is not positive and statistically diﬀerent

from zero under any assumption about exercise behavior. Viewed diﬀerently, the average

CEO does not consistently beat the market by holding options: the average CEO who holds

beyond the 67 percent threshold beats the S&P 500 only 45.86 percent of the time. The results

are similar for the Longholder measure. We find that CEOs whose options were at least 40

percent in the money in year nine (i.e. past the relevant Hall and Murphy threshold for that

year) and who did not exercise would have been better oﬀ on average had they exercised and

invested in the S&P 500 (though the mean is not significant). This result also holds when we

consider the alternative strategies of exercising in the eighth, seventh, sixth, or fifth years with

appropriate adjustments to the threshold (Malmendier and Tate (2003)). Thus, there is no

evidence that positive information, on average, motivates CEOs who hold options beyond the



                                                21
theoretically-motivated thresholds.



                                  [INSERT TABLE IV HERE]



2. Signalling. Another reason why CEOs may want to hold company risk is to convey a

(potentially) costly signal to the capital market that their firm’s prospects are better than the

prospects of similar firms. However, the most natural version of the signalling story would have

the opposite prediction for investment. Signalling should alleviate informational asymmetries

and, thus, lead to less investment-cash flow sensitivity among the firms where CEOs hold

their options. Thus, the tests of our investment predictions themselves will help to dispel this

alternative explanation.


Moreover, the usefulness of option exercises as a signalling device is doubtful. Financial services

firms and the financial press, while following stock purchases and sales of insiders closely,

generally discount option exercises as signals of future stock prices. They point to vesting

and expiration times as the main determinants of exercise.15 Our only stock-based proxy for

overconfidence, Net Buyer, measures overconfidence and investment-cash flow sensitivity for

two disjoint time periods to specifically eliminate the influence of signalling.


The same arguments address the hypothesis that CEOs use their insider trades opportunisti-

cally to raise the capital market valuation of their firms.


3. Risk tolerance. Alternatively, one might want to interpret our measures of overconfidence as

measures of risk attitude. A CEO may hold his options beyond the threshold simply because

he is less risk-averse and, therefore, less aﬀected by underdiversification. If anything, however,

                                                22
lower risk aversion should predict lower investment-cash flow sensitivity since less risk averse

managers should be more willing to lever up the firm. Thus, once again, the tests of the

empirical predictions of our model will provide evidence against this story. Moreover, while

higher risk-tolerance induces option holders to exercise their options later, it does not imply

that the CEO should habitually buy additional stock of his company. Indeed, to explain the

Net Buyer measure, CEOs would need to be risk-seeking on average.


4. Tax reasons. An option holder may postpone exercise to delay the payment of taxes on

his profits. Personal income tax deferral, however, would not predict higher sensitivity of

investment to cash flow among holders, nor does it apply to additional stock purchases.


5. Procrastination. Finally, CEOs might hold options until expiration if they are “inertial” in

the sense of O’Donoghue and Rabin (2001). This inertia on their personal account may carry

over to the firms’ corporate account in a reluctance to conduct equity issues, or generally a

preference for the “quiet life” (Bertrand and Mullainathan, (2003)). We find, however, that

more than 68 percent of the CEOs classified as overconfident under the Longholder measure

conduct other transactions on their personal portfolios in the two years prior to the year their

“longheld” option expires. We also find in Malmendier and Tate (2003) that Longholder CEOs

are significantly more likely to conduct acquisitions than their peers and, thus, do not appear

to procrastinate on the corporate account. Finally, an inertial CEO should not habitually

purchase company equity and, so, should not be classified as overconfident under the Net

Buyer measure.16


We will take further steps to distinguish overconfidence from alternative explanations (partic-



                                              23
ularly information) in the context of the investment regressions that follow.




IV       Test 1: Overconfidence and Investment


A    Empirical Specification


To test the model’s prediction that the sensitivity of investment to cash flow increases in

overconfidence (Prediction 1), we use the following general regression specification:



 Iit = β 1 + β 2 Qit−1 + β 3 Cit + Xit0 B4 + β 5 ∆it + β 6 Cit · Qit−1 + Cit · Xit0 B7 + β 8 Cit · ∆it + εit (5)




where C stands for cash flow, Q is market value of assets over book value of assets, X is the set

of additional controls used in the regression, and ∆ is the overconfidence measure. X usually

includes corporate governance, stock ownership (as a percentage of total shares outstanding),

and total number of vested options (normalized by total number of shares outstanding).17 Our

measure of corporate governance is the number of outside directors who are currently CEOs

in other companies.18 We also include year- and firm-fixed eﬀects as well as (year)*(cash flow)

interactions. Where relevant, we include interactions of industry dummies and cash-flow. We

use Fama and French’s specification of twelve industry groups.19 The null hypothesis is that

β 8 , the coeﬃcient on the interaction of cash flow and overconfidence, is equal to zero.


One alternative to controlling for industry eﬀects on investment-cash flow sensitivity would be

to remove all cross-sectional variation by including firm fixed eﬀects interacted with cash flow




                                                      24
in the analysis. Because our measures require a long tenure within the firm in order to identify

a CEO as overconfident, identifying the eﬀect only from time series variation within the firm

is typically not feasible. That is, there are an insuﬃcient number of cases of overconfident and

non-overconfident CEOs in the same firm to draw robust inference from any estimations. The

lack of identifiable cases points to a potentially severe sample selection bias from including

fixed eﬀects in panel regressions and identifying solely out of somewhat anomalous firms with

multiple short-tenured CEOs. Nevertheless, where there is enough within-firm variation in

CEO overconfidence to interact firm fixed eﬀects with cash flow, we report the results.


In order to account for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity, we estimate (5) in two diﬀerent

ways. First we run an OLS regression so that our results can be compared with the earlier

investment to cash flow sensitivity literature. Then we recompute the standard errors by

clustering the observations within each firm. This process treats the time series of observations

within the firm as a single observation, eﬀectively eliminating any serial correlation.



B    Holder 67


First we estimate (5) using Holder 67 and its variants as our overconfidence measures. We run

a set of three baseline regressions to demonstrate the eﬀects of Q and cash flow on investment:

first with no additional controls, then including firm-fixed eﬀects, and finally including firm-

fixed eﬀects as well as controls for CEO stock ownership, CEO option holdings, firm size,

corporate governance and their interactions with cash flow. The results are presented in Table

V for the 67 percent threshold. The first two regressions confirm the stylized facts of the



                                               25
investment-cash flow sensitivity literature — namely that cash flow has a large amount of

explanatory power beyond Q for investment. Among the control variables, we find that CEOs

who own a higher percentage of their company — both in company stock and in options — display

a smaller investment to cash flow sensitivity. Thus, high ownership may indeed mitigate agency

problems, especially among a subsample of successful firms with high stock price appreciation.

We also find that Q has more impact on investment for higher levels of cash flow (although

this eﬀect is not consistently significant). If current cash flow measures the success of past

investment decisions, this result suggests that more successful companies are more responsive

to investment opportunities in determining the level of their investment. Corporate governance,

measured by outside CEOs on the board, slightly increases investment-cash flow sensitivity.

This eﬀect, however, appears to be linked to the subsample of relatively successful firms in these

regressions. In Table VII, for example, we find a weak negative eﬀect of corporate governance

on investment-cash flow sensitivity for the entire sample of firms. Finally, larger firms have

significantly less sensitivity of investment to cash flow than smaller firms. One interpretation

of this result is that size captures the eﬀects traditionally attributed to financing constraints

in the investment-cash flow sensitivity literature.



                                  [INSERT TABLE V HERE]



Then, given a baseline for comparison, we estimate Equation (5) using our benchmarked holder

measure (“Holder 67”) as a proxy for ∆. Columns (4) to (7) in Table V present the results. The

coeﬃcient on the interaction of the holder indicator with cash flow is positive (0.2339 in the

OLS specification with controls) and highly significant. The result is robust to clustering the


                                               26
standard errors by firm and including industry eﬀects interacted with cash flow. As predicted

by our model, CEOs who demonstrate a higher level of overconfidence than their peers in

their personal portfolio decisions also exhibit a higher sensitivity of corporate investment to

cash flow. Figure 1 presents the regression results varying the threshold for rational exercise

between 50 percent and 150 percent (along with the sample restriction). The results are the

same. We also examine the eﬀect of holding options that are between zero and 50 percent in

the money and find an insignificant negative eﬀect on investment-cash flow sensitivity. Thus,

as predicted, increased investment-cash flow sensitivity comes only from holding highly in-the-

money options.



                                 [INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE]



To further distinguish the overconfidence eﬀect on investment decisions from insider trading,

we split Holder 67 into late exercisers who lose money on at least one of the options they hold

beyond the threshold and late exercisers who always profit. If information contaminates our

Holder 67 measure, then much of the eﬀect should be isolated in the winner portion of the split.

Thus, we test whether the investment eﬀects we have attributed to overconfidence are present

among the “loser” subgroup, given their demonstrated lack of favorable insider knowledge.


First, we diagnose whether our (other) overconfidence measures are more associated with the

“loser” subgroup (who are most likely to be overconfident) or the “winner” subgroup (who

may have positive private information). We find that the correlation between Longholder

and the “loser” variable constructed from Holder 67 is 0.2699, while the correlation between

Longholder and the “winner” portion is −0.0138. Similarly, the correlation between the Net

                                              27
Buyer variable and the “loser” variable is 0.1263 and the correlation between Net Buyer variable

and the “winner” variable is −0.1402.20 Thus, our overconfidence measures are most associated

with the CEOs who appear to be overconfident rather than well-informed.


Next, we repeat the regressions of Tables V, splitting Holder 67 into “losers” and “winners.”. If

the investment-cash flow sensitivity were driven by (highly persistent) inside information, then

we should not be able to replicate the results for the “losers.” Table VI shows the estimates of

Equation (5). We find that the estimated coeﬃcient of the “loser” indicator (Hold and Lose 67)

interacted with cash flow is positive, significant, and similar to the coeﬃcient on Holder 67 in

Table V (the coeﬃcient on Hold and Lose 67 is 0.2366 in the OLS with controls specification).

We also find a positive eﬀect of the “winner” indicator (Hold and Win 67) on investment-cash

flow sensitivity, which may indeed reflect positive inside information. The key result, then,

is that the eﬀect of Holder 67 remains when we remove the eﬀect of these CEOs from the

estimate. Finally, as there is only a small number of CEOs (10) in the “winner” subgroup, we

test the robustness of the result to weaker assumptions. We find that the results are virtually

identical if we instead classify CEOs as “winners” if they more often outperform the S&P 500

when they hold beyond the threshold than underperform. Overall, then, inside information

does not appear to drive our results.



                                 [INSERT TABLE VI HERE]




                                               28
C    Longholder


Table VII gives the results of estimating Equation (5) using the Longholder variable as our

proxy for ∆.21 As in Table V, Q appears to positively impact the sensitivity of investment

to cash flow. Also, as before, equity ownership and firm size are negatively associated with

investment-cash flow sensitivity. Vested options now positively impact investment-cash flow

sensitivity. This positive correlation may indicate that CEOs with high ownership in vested

options are more reluctant to dilute existing shares.22 It could also arise if the cumulative

eﬀect of overconfidence in option exercise decisions outweighs the impact of new grants and

provisions of the compensation contract in determining the level of vested options. Most im-

portantly, Longholder CEOs have higher sensitivity of investment to cash flow. The eﬀect

is robust to controlling for diﬀerential sensitivities among the twelve Fama-French industries.

Further, there is enough within-firm variation in Longholder to identify the Longholder ef-

fect on investment-cash flow sensitivity including firm fixed eﬀects interacted with cash flow.

This specification eliminates any alternative explanation of our results that relies on fixed

cross-sectional diﬀerences across firms with and without overconfident CEOs. Although these

estimates are not robust to clustering the observations by firm, they are robust to alternative

methods of controlling for serial correlation. The coeﬃcients in Prais-Winsten regressions as-

suming a common first order autoregressive structure on the errors across panels are 0.2385

with a t-statistic of 2.73, 0.2043 with a t-statistic of 2.80, and 0.1324 with a t-statistic of 2.76

without industry or firm fixed eﬀects interacted with cash flow, with industry eﬀects inter-

acted with cash flow, and with firm fixed eﬀects interacted with cash flow, respectively. All

estimates are significant at the 1 percent level. Again, we conclude that an overconfident CEO

                                                29
will increase investment more when cash flow increases than his less confident peers.



                                  [INSERT TABLE VII HERE]



D    Net Buyer


Table VII also presents the results from estimating Equation (5) using Net Buyer to capture

overconfidence. CEOs are classified as overconfident based on their stock purchase decisions

during their first five years in the sample. Equation (5) is estimated using only the remaining

years of the CEOs’ tenure. Most of the control variables in these regressions behave as in our

prior estimations. The eﬀect of Q interacted with cash flow is now negative and marginally

significant. Though this result is diﬃcult to interpret, it is not relevant for our results (see

Column 4). The most important finding is that being a Net Buyer increases the sensitivity

of investment to cash flow. The result is robust to the inclusion of industry eﬀects on cash

flow sensitivity. Though the result without industry interactions is not quite significant in the

cluster specification (p-value = 0.118), the estimate controlling for industry eﬀects on cash

flow sensitivities is significant (p-value = 0.057).


As described in Section III, identifying overconfidence and measuring its eﬀect on investment-

cash flow sensitivities in disjoint time periods allow us to distinguish managerial overconfidence

from other explanations (like positive information or signalling motives) that would cause

simultaneous failure to diversify and cash flow sensitivity. To further check the robustness of

the results, we reestimate the regression with a one year gap between the two sample periods.

The results are similar.


                                                 30
Overall, overconfidence increases the sensitivity of investment to cash flow under any measure.




V     Test 2: Overconfidence and Financial Constraints


In Section I, we show that overconfidence should matter most for firms that are equity-

dependent (Prediction 2). If a firm has a suﬃcient amount of cash or untapped debt capacity

to finance all of the CEO’s desired investment projects, then cash flow may not aﬀect the

level of investment. If a firm must instead access the equity market for additional finance,

overconfidence should have an impact on the sensitivity of investment to cash flow.


We take several approaches to test this prediction. First, we construct the Kaplan-Zingales

index of financial constraint — used by Lamont, Polk and Saá-Requejo (2001), Malmendier

and Tate (2003) and Baker, Stein, and Wurgler (2003) — for our sample of firms. Kaplan and

Zingales (1997) generate direct measures of financing constraints, using annual reports and

even information gleaned from the company’s executives, to classify their sample of firms as

either constrained or unconstrained. They then estimate an ordered logit of this classification

on five accounting ratios meant to quantify these financial constraints: cash flow to total

capital, Q, debt to total capital, dividends to total capital, and cash holdings to capital. We

apply the estimates of this ordered logit regression to our sample and construct an index of

financial constraints (or equity dependence) as follows:


                                  CFit
           KZit = −1.001909 ∗           + 0.2826389 ∗ Qit + 3.139193 ∗ Leverageit
                                  Kit−1
                                 Dividendit                Cit
                      −39.3678 ∗            − 1.314759 ∗
                                   Kit−1                 Kit−1


                                              31
Higher values of the linear combination of the five ratios imply a higher degree of financial

constraint.23 We separate our sample into quintiles based on the lagged value of the Kaplan-

Zingales index and estimate Equation (5) separately on each quintile. We use Longholder as

the proxy for overconfidence, since the sample restrictions necessary to use Holder 67 or Net

Buyer would severely limit the number of observations in each of the five subsamples. We find,

as predicted, that the eﬀect of overconfidence on the sensitivity of investment to cash flow is

significant only for the top quintile of the Kaplan-Zingales index (Table VIII). This eﬀect is

strong (the coeﬃcient estimate is 0.4990) and highly statistically significant (t = 3.52), where

standard errors are clustered by firm. Though we cannot include the interaction of firm eﬀects

with cash flow in these regressions since some quintiles would be left with too few identifiable

observations, the results are robust to the inclusion of industry eﬀects on cash flow sensitivity.



                                [INSERT TABLE VIII HERE]



As a further robustness check on the results, we apply several other measures of equity depen-

dence as substitutes for the Kaplan-Zingales index. We consider the following measures: firm

age, defined as the number of years since Compustat first reported a non-missing market value

of equity for the firm; firm size; dividend payment (common plus preferrred); and S&P long

term debt ratings. As above, we split the sample into quintiles based on the value of each of

our alternative measures at the end of the prior fiscal year. In the case of credit ratings, data

unavailability leaves us with roughly 60% fewer observations. So, we instead split the sample

into firms with ratings of BBB or lower and firm with ratings of A, AA, or AAA. In all cases,

the strongest positive eﬀect of overconfidence on investment-cash flow sensitivity is among the


                                               32
most equity-dependent firms: the quintile of the youngest firms, the smallest firms, the firms

that pay the fewest dividends, and the sample of firms with debt ratings of BBB or lower.

In two cases, firm size and credit ratings, this eﬀect is not statistically signigicant; however,

the coeﬃcients are remarkably stable across the alternative measures (ranging from 0.28 to

0.36).24


Since the mechanism by which overconfidence increases the sensitivity of investment to cash

flow is perceived undervaluation and reluctance to issue equity, we also consider the diﬀerences

in financing decisions between overconfident and non-overconfident CEOs. Using the financing

deficit as defined by Frank and Goyal (2003), we find that overconfident CEOs are more likely

than other CEOs to raise debt (rather than equity) to cover financing needs.25


Thus, both predictions of our simple model of overconfidence are confirmed in the data.




VI     Other Personal Characteristics


In this section we examine the relationship between overconfidence and other observable execu-

tive characteristics: educational and employment background, birth cohort, and accumulation

of titles within the company. We analyze their eﬀects on investment-cash flow sensitivity and

ask whether CEO overconfidence aﬀects investment decisions independently. First, we estimate

Equation (5) including each of these characteristics (in lieu of a proxy for ∆) and industry ef-

fects interacted with cash flow. As Columns (1)-(4) of Table IX show, CEOs with technical

education have more investment-cash flow sensitivity than CEOs with general education while

CEOs with financial education have less. The results are similar replacing educational back-


                                               33
ground with employment background (untabulated). CEOs who belong to the Great Depres-

sion birth cohort also have more investment-cash flow sensitivity. Donaldson (1990) provides

a nice description of the psychology underlying this eﬀect26 :



         “. . . the reader should bear in mind the organizational context of the time

     [at General Mills in the late 1960s/mid 1970s]. The corporate leaders of this pe-

     riod were young adults in the 1930s whose early business and personal lives were

     profoundly aﬀected by the collapse of the capital markets during the Great Depres-

     sion. This led them to be deeply skeptical of the public capital markets as a reliable

     source of personal or corporate funding, to avoid financial risk wherever possible,

     and to have an instinctive aﬃnity for a strategy of self-suﬃciency” (p. 125).



In addition, CEOs who have accumulated additional titles (President and Chairman of the

Board) display heightened sensitivity of investment to cash flow. Finally, we include all of

the characteristics and Longholder as a proxy for overconfidence (Column 6). Longholder still

strongly predicts higher investment-cash flow sensitivity. The 1930s cohort eﬀect and finance

education eﬀect also remain significant. We conclude that more conventional “style” eﬀects,

rooted in the CEO’s background, may be important for determining investment policy.27 How-

ever, overconfidence is distinct from these observable CEO characteristics.

VII      Conclusion


The main goal of this paper is to establish the relationship between managerial overconfidence

and corporate investment decisions. Our analysis consists of three main steps. First, we derive,

in a simple model of the corporate investment decision, the prediction that the sensitivity of

investment to cash flow is strongest in the presence of overconfidence. We then construct

three measures of overconfidence, using data on personal portfolio decisions of the CEO: (1)

Does the CEO hold his options beyond a theoretically-calibrated benchmark for exercise? (2)

Does the CEO hold his options even until the last year before expiration? (3) Did the CEO

habitually buy stock of his company during the first five sample years? Whenever the answer

to one of these questions is yes, we classify a CEO as overconfident. Additional tests on the

persistence of such behavior and on the CEO’s gains and losses from option exercise strengthen

the interpretation of these measures as proxies for overconfidence.


We then regress investment on cash flow, the overconfidence measure and the interaction of

overconfidence and cash flow. We find a strong positive relationship between the sensitivity

of investment to cash flow and executive overconfidence. The coeﬃcients of the interaction

term of overconfidence and cash flow are highly significant for all of our measures. We also

find that overconfidence matters more in firms that are equity dependent, as predicted by the

overconfidence model.


These results have important implications for contracting practices and organizational design.

Specifically, standard incentives such as stock- and option-based compensation are unlikely

to mitigate the detrimental eﬀects of managerial overconfidence. As a result, the board of


                                              35
directors may need to employ alternative disciplinary measures, such as debt overhang, which

can suﬃce to constrain overconfident CEOs. In addition, the results confirm the need for

independent and vigilant directors.

        s.t. c ≤ C,      d ≤ D,   c+d≤I                                                             (A2)

Our assumptions on R(·) ensure I ∗ > 0. For simplicity, we ignore the non-negativity constraints
c ≥ 0 and d ≥ 0 and show instead that the optimal solution to the unconstrained problem
satisfies them. Let λ, µ, and ν be the Lagrange multipliers on the constraints c ≤ C, d ≤ D,
and c + d ≤ I respectively. Then, the following conditions determine the optimal investment
and financing plan:

       λ ≥ 0,      µ ≥ 0,   ν≥0

(i) Suppose ∆ = 0. Then conditions (A4)-(A6) simplify to:

                                           R0 (I ∗ ) − 1 + ν = 0                                               (A8)
                                                      −λ − ν = 0                                               (A9)
                                                      −µ − ν = 0                                              (A10)

From (A9) and (A10), we must have λ = µ = −ν. But, since the multipliers must be non-
negative, we conclude that λ = µ = ν = 0. Thus, from (A8), R0 (I ∗ ) = 1 and I ∗ = IF B .
Further, all financing plans (c∗ , d∗ ) satisfying (A2) and (A3) at I ∗ are optimal.
(ii) Suppose ∆ > 0. We consider separately the cases ν = 0 and ν > 0.
If ν = 0, the constraint c + d ≤ I does not bind at I ∗ . Thus, this case includes all optimal
plans in which the CEO issues shares (s0 > 0). From conditions (A5) and (A6)

                    (A + C + R(I ∗ ) − c∗ − d∗ )2 + ∆R(I ∗ )(A + C + R(I ∗ ) − I ∗ )
       λ=µ=                                                                          −1                       (A11)
                                     (A + C + R(I ∗ ) − c∗ − d∗ )2

Then, since A + R(I ∗ ) > I ∗ − C, λ = µ > 0. Thus, c∗ = C and d∗ = D from (A7), and (A3)


                                                          37
is satisfied.29 From condition (A4)
                                                                1
                        R0 (I ∗ ) =                               A+C+R(I ∗ )−I ∗

                                      1 + ∆ A+R(I ∗ )+C−c∗ −d∗ A+R(I ∗ )(1+∆)+C−c∗ −d∗


and, substituting c∗ = C and d∗ = D,
                                                                1
                               R0 (I ∗ ) =                      A+C+R(I ∗ )−I ∗
                                                                                                           (A12)
                                                     A−D
                                             1 + ∆ A+R(I ∗ )−D A+R(I ∗ )(1+∆)−D



Notice that c∗ = C, d∗ = D, and c∗ + d∗ ≤ I ∗ imply C + D ≤ I ∗ . With R(I ∗ ) ≥ 0, ∆ ≥ 0,
                                                       1
C + D ≤ I ∗ , A > D and A + R(I ∗ ) > I ∗ − C we have 1+∆ < R0 (I ∗ ) < 1. Thus, as R00 < 0,
I ∗ < Iˆ and, by implication, C + D < I.
                                      ˆ

Now suppose ν > 0. Then, c∗ + d∗ = I ∗ and the optimal financing plan does not include equity
(s0 = 0). Then, using (A5) and (A6)

                                        A + C + R(I ∗ )(1 + ∆) − c∗ − d∗
                           λ=µ=                                          −1−ν                              (A13)
                                           A + C + R(I ∗ ) − c∗ − d∗

Solving for ν and substituting in (A4) gives

                                          R0 (I ∗ )(1 + ∆) − 1 − λ = 0                                     (A14)
                                               1
First, consider λ = µ = 0. Then, R0 (I ∗ ) = 1+∆    which implies I ∗ = Iˆ > IF B . Further, as
c∗ ≤ C and d∗ ≤ D, we have C +D ≥ I.  ˆ And, all financing plans (c∗ , d∗ ) satisfying 0 ≤ c∗ ≤ C,
0 ≤ d∗ ≤ D, and c∗ + d∗ = I ∗ are optimal.
Next, consider λ = µ > 0. Then, from (A7), c∗ = C and d∗ = D and (A3) is satisfied. Further,
            1+λ
R0 (I ∗ ) = 1+∆    1
                > 1+∆       ˆ Thus, as R00 < 0, I ∗ < Iˆ and, by implication, C + D < I.
                      = R0 (I).                                                           ˆ
                                                        ∆R(I ∗ )
Finally, using ν > 0, (A13) and (A14), 1 +            A+R(I ∗ )−D      > R0 (I ∗ ) (1 + ∆) implying R0 (I ∗ ) < 1
and IF B < I ∗ . Q.E.D.
Proof of Proposition 1. (i) For ∆ = 0, R0 (I ∗ ) = 1 implies that I ∗ is independent of C.
(ii) For ∆ > 0 and ν = 0, (A12) gives
                                                            0   ∗

                                                                      )−I ∗ )]+2R0 (I ∗ )(R0 (I ∗ )−1)(1+∆)(A+R(I ∗ )−D)

                                                                dI ∗                         ˆ
A > D, A + R(I ∗ ) > I ∗ − C, and R0 (I ∗ ) < 1 imply           dC     > 0. Further, C + D < I.

For ∆ > 0 and ν > 0, I ∗ = Iˆ and is thus independent of C over the subset C + D ≥ I.
                                                                                   ˆ For
        ˆ                    ∗                   dI ∗
C + D < I, we have instead I = C + D and thus dC = 1 > 0. Q.E.D.

Notes
   1
       Upward bias in the assessment of future outcomes is sometimes referred to as “overoptimism” rather than
“overconfidence.” We follow the literature on self-serving attribution and choose the label “overconfidence” in
order to distinguish the overestimation of one’s own abilities (such as IQ or managerial skills) and outcomes
relating to one’s own personal situation from the general overestimation of exogenous outcomes (such as the
growth of the US economy).
   2
       See also Bertrand and Schoar (2003) on the impact of managerial style on firm policy.
   3
       A manager who is not self-interested does not necessarily act in the interest of current shareholders since
eﬃcient investment implies maximizing the total value of the firm (see Hart, (1993) and (2001)). To conform
with the previous literature, we assume that the manager maximizes current shareholder value. Moreover, in
the case of overconfident managers, it is not clear whether value maximization leads to more eﬃcient outcomes
than the maximization of current shareholder value since managers and shareholders will not agree on the
value-maximizing course of action even without managerial self-interest.
   4
       The investment-cash flow sensitivity result replicates in any setting with at least one financial security that
is not risk-free and thus induces disagreement about its price.
   5
       See Kaplan-Zingales (1997) for a similarly posed theoretical problem.
   6
       Note that this criterion limits the number of IPOs in our sample (and, thus, the relevance of the more
stringent restrictions on insider trading associated with such firms, such as lockup periods).
   7
       Definitions of Q and its components as in Fama and French (2002).
   8
       The results are similar if we instead winsorize cash flow at one percent.
   9
       The few CEOs with degrees belonging to more than one group are classified in multiple categories.
  10
       We lose 130 (financial) firms when we merge in the accounting data necessary to construct cash flow,
investment, and Q due to missing data. Additionally, our treatment of cash flow and the requirement that
options and stock holdings data be present for a firm year to be included in the regressions brings the total
number of firms to 337.
  11
       We exclude CEOs for whom data on stock purchases is not present for more than one of these five years.
  12
       Note that some of the increase in share-holdings may arise due to new stock grants. This component is
unlikely to be the driving factor behind our classification, however. Indeed, we find that there are no restricted
stock grants in the CEO-years we use to construct this measure.
  13
       See Malmendier and Tate (2003) for a similar split of summary statistics using the Longholder measure.
  14
       The results are the same if we look only at CEOs who had an option reach the 67 percent threshold at least


                                                          43
twice.
  15
       Financial advisory firms that track insider trades often report only the purchases and sales of stocks, not
the exercise of options (see for instance the websites of Investar, Quicken; also EDGAR). Other websites make it
explicit that option exercise should be understood as “noise” with respect to insider knowledge, see for instance
http://www.winninginvesting.com/insider.htm (“The employees consider the options part of their salary..”) or
http://invest-faq.com/articles/trade-insider.html (“same-day exercise of a stock option and selling the resulting
stock ... rarely means very much”); similarly, the weekly column “Insider Trading Spotlight” in the Wall Street
Journal, the weekly coverage of insider-trading information in the Financial Times.
  16
       This conclusion is somewhat clouded by the possibility that new grants contaminate the Net Buyer measure.
  17
       Stock ownership and vested options, like Q, are taken at the beginning of the fiscal year. Also, we multiply
vested options by 10 in the regressions so that its mean is comparable to the mean of stock ownership.
  18
       Among others, Brickley, Coles, and Terry (1994) suggest that the number of outside executives are an
improvement on previous measures of corporate governance; see also Byrd and Hickman (1992). An alternative
measure available in our data set is board size. Employing an indicator of eﬃcient board size (fewer than 12
members) as a measure of governance gives similar results.
  19
       See French’s website (http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html) for de-
finitions. The results are typically robust to larger numbers of industry classifications with the results on the
largest samples (e.g., the personal characteristic results in Section VI) robust to even the full set of 48 Fama
and French groups.
  20
       The correlations between the “loser” and “winner” variables and Longholder are calculated using the Holder
67 sample restriction; the correlations between the “loser” and “winner” variables and Net Buyer are calculated
using the intersection of the Holder 67 and Net Buyer sample restrictions. All correlations except Longholder
and “winner” are statistically significant at the one percent level.
  21
       Because of space considerations, Table VII does not display the benchmark regressions of investment on
only cash flow and Q, including and excluding fixed eﬀects. However, the results of those regressions are similar
to the results in Table V for the Holder 67 subsample.
  22
       See Hadlock (1998).
  23
       To construct the index, we use the definition of Q as in Kaplan and Zingales (1997). The ratios composed
from COMPUSTAT data items are: cash flow to capital = (item 18 + item 14) / item 8 ; Q = [item 6 + (item24
* item 25) - item 60 - item 74] / item 6 ; debt to capital (leverage) = (item 9 + item 34) / (item 9 + item 34
+ item 216) ; dividends to capital = item21 + item 19) / item 8 ; cash to capital = item 1 / item 8. Item 8,
capital, is always taken at the beginning of the year.

  28
       Notice that we need A + R(I ∗ ) > I ∗ − C for this problem to be well-defined. A + R(I ∗ ) = I ∗ − C implies
that the CEO cannot raise funds from the equity markets (and thus I ∗ = c∗ + d∗ ). Thus, cash flow sensitivity
                                                                                         ˆ
arises if and only if internal funds are insuﬃcient to cover desired investment (C + D < I).
  29
       Notice that all cash and debt capacity is exhausted before the CEO will issue equity.

The sample with "Holder67 Sample Restriction" contains all CEO years of CEOs who had options more than 67% in the money in the fifth year at least two times during their sample tenure.
The "Holder67 Sample" contains all CEO years after the CEO fails to exercise a five-year-old option that is at least 67% in the money, provided that he subsequently does it again at least
once.

                                       Persistence of Exercising Behavior
In Panel A, the dependent variable is a dummy variable taking the value one if the CEO fails to exercise a five-year-old option that
reaches at least 67% in the money in the current period. Past Late Exercises is the number of times that the CEO has exercised such
options late in the past. Q is the market value of assets over the book value of assets at the beginning of the year. Earnings/Price
ratio is the minimal earnings to price ratio during the fiscal year. Panel B presents statistics on late exercises of stock options
partitioned by the number of past late exercises by the CEO in question.

fourth columns present the returns (in %) relative to exercising the options during year five and investing instead in the S&P500, assuming exercise
at the maximum, mean, and median stock prices during the fiscal year respectively. We also present the last percentile for which the return is
negative under each price assumption. All returns are annualized.
Sample: CEOs who have option packages at least 67% in the money in the 5th year after the option grant and who have not exercised the options
before the 5th year.

                                  Regression of Investment on Cash Flow and Exercise Behavior
The dependent variable in the regressions is Investment, defined as firm capital expenditures and normalized by capital at the beginning of the year. Cash flow is
earnings before extraordinary items plus depreciation and is normalized by capital at the beginning of the year. Q is the market value of assets over the book value of
assets at the beginning of the year. Stock ownership is the fraction of company stock owned by the CEO and his immediate family at the beginning of the year. Vested
options are the CEO's holdings of options that are exercisable within 6 months of the beginning of the year, as a fraction of common shares outstanding. Vested
options are multiplied by 10 so that the mean is comparable to stock ownership. Size is the natural logarithm of assets at the beginning of the year. Corporate
governance is the number of outside directors who currently serve as CEOs of other companies.
Holder 67 is a dummy variable equal to 1 for all CEO-years after the CEO holds a five-year-old option that is more than 67% in the money, provided that he
subsequently does it again at least once. Industries are defined as the twelve Fama-French industry groups. In Columns 6 and 7, standard errors are robust to
heteroskedasticity and arbitrary within-firm serial correlation.
Sample: CEOs with options more than 67% in the money in the fifth year at least two times

Figure 1 presents the results of reestimating the regression specified in Column 6 of Table V using different percentages in the money as thresholds for rational exercise in the classification of CEOs as
overconfident. More specifically, Holder 67 is replaced in the regression by Holder "x" where Holder "x" is a dummy variable equal to 1 for all CEO-years after the CEO holds a five-year-old option that
is more than "x"% in the money, provided that he subsequently does it again at least once. In addition, the sample is restricted in each regression to the subsample of CEOs who at least twice had options
that reached at least "x"% in the money after five years. The number of CEOs meeting this restriction for each "x" is presented below along with the subset of those CEOs who are classified as
overconfident using the Holder "x" measure. Coefficients on Holder "x" interacted with cash flow are significant at the 5% level for all x except x = 50, 80, and 85 which are significant at 1%, where
standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity and arbitrary within-firm serial correlation.

                                  Regression of Investment on Cash Flow and Exercise Behavior
The dependent variable in the regressions is Investment, defined as firm capital expenditures and normalized by capital at the beginning of the fiscal year. Cash flow is
earnings before extraordinary items plus depreciation and is normalized by capital at the beginning of the year. Q is the market value of assets over the book value of
assets at the beginning of the year. Stock ownership is the fraction of company stock owned by the CEO and his immediate family at the beginning of the year. Vested
options are the CEO's holdings of options that are exercisable within 6 months of the beginning of the year, as a fraction of common shares outstanding. Vested options
are multiplied by 10 so that the mean is comparable to stock ownership. Size is the natural logarithm of assets at the beginning of the fiscal year. Corporate governance
is the number of outside directors who currently serve as CEOs of other companies.
Hold and Win 67 is a dummy variable equal to 1 for all CEO-years after the CEO holds a five-year-old option that is more than 67% in the money, provided that he
subsequently does it again at least once and that he earns excess returns by holding the options (relative to exercising in the fifth year and investing the proceeds in the
S&P 500) each time. Hold and Lose 67 is a dummy variable equal to 1 for all CEO-years after the CEO holds a five-year-old option that is more than 67% in the money,
provided that he subsequently does it again at least once and that he loses money by holding such an option (relative to exercising in the fifth year and investing the
proceeds in the S&P 500) at least once. Returns are calculated using the maximum stock price during the fiscal year. Industries are defined as the twelve Fama-French
industry groups. In Columns 6 and 7, standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity and arbitrary within-firm serial correlation.

                                Regression of Investment on Cash Flow and Longholder or Net Buyer
The dependent variable in the regressions is Investment, defined as firm capital expenditures and normalized by capital at the beginning of the year. Cash flow is earnings
before extraordinary items plus depreciation and is normalized by capital at the beginning of the year. Q is the market value of assets over the book value of assets at the
beginning of the year. Stock ownership is the fraction of company stock owned by the CEO and his immediate family at the beginning of the year. Vested options are the
CEO's holdings of options that are exercisable within 6 months of the beginning of the year, as a fraction of common shares outstanding. Vested options are multiplied by 10
so that the mean is comparable to stock ownership. Size is the natural logarithm of assets at the beginning of the year. Corporate governance is the number of outside directors
who currently serve as CEOs of other companies.
Longholder is a dummy variable equal to one if the CEO ever held an option until the last year prior to expiration. N Buyer is a dummy variable equal to one if the CEO was
a net buyer of stock more years than he was a net seller in his first five years in the sample. Columns 5 - 8 includes only CEOs with at least 10 years in the sample and
excludes their first five years. Industries are defined as the twelve Fama-French industry groups. Standard errors in columns 3, 4, 7, and 8 are robust to heteroskedasticity and
arbitrary within-firm serial correlation.

       Regression of Investment on Cash Flow and Overconfidence by Equity Dependence
The dependent variable in the regressions is Investment, defined as firm capital expenditures and normalized by capital at the beginning of the
year. Cash flow is earnings before extraordinary items plus depreciation and is normalized by capital at the beginning of the year. Q is the market
value of assets over the book value of assets and is taken at the beginning of the year. Stock ownership is the fraction of company stock owned
by the CEO and his immediate family at the beginning of the year. Vested options are the CEO's holdings of options that are exercisable within 6
months of the beginning of the year, as a fraction of common shares outstanding. Vested options are multiplied by 10 so that the mean is
comparable to stock ownership. Size is the natural logarithm of assets at the beginning of the year. Corporate governance is the number of
outside directors who currently serve as CEOs of other companies. Longholder is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the CEO ever held an option
until the last year prior to expiration.
Firms are classified according to quintiles of the Kaplan-Zingales index, where the highest quintile contains the most constrained subsample. All
standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity and arbitrary within-firm serial correlation.

The dependent variable in the regressions is Investment, defined as firm capital expenditures and normalized by capital at the beginning of the year. Cash
flow (CF) is earnings before extraordinary items plus depreciation and is normalized by capital at the beginning of the year. Q is the market value of assets
over the book value of assets at the beginning of the year. Titles is a dummy variable equal to one for all CEO-years if the CEO is also president and
chairman of the board. Tenure is the number of years the CEO has held that position. "Depression baby" is a dummy variable equal to one if the CEO was
born in the 1930s. Finance Education is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the CEO had "financial education." Financial education includes undergraduate
and graduate degrees in accounting, finance, business (incl. MBA), and economics. Technical Education is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the CEO had
"technical education." Technical education includes undergraduate and graduate degrees in engineering, physics, operations research, chemistry,
mathematics, biology, pharmacy, and other applied sciences.
Longholder is a dummy variable equal to one if the CEO ever held an option until the last year prior to expiration. Industries are defined as the twelve
Fama-French industry groups. All standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity and arbitrary within-firm serial correlation.
