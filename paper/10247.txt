This study examines trends in labor force involvement, household structure, and some activities that may

complicate the efforts of parents with young children to balance work and family life. Next I consider whether

employer policies mitigate or exacerbate these difficulties and, since the policies adopted in the United States

diverge dramatically from those in many other industrialized countries, provide some international

       How Well Do Parents With Young Children Combine Work and Family Life?

       The first years of life are a particularly important period for children (Carnegie Task
Force on Meeting the Needs of Young Children, 1994; Council of Economic Advisers, 1997).
Recent research emphasizes the effects of early influences on brain development (Shore, 1997)
and investments during young childhood are likely to be significant for the growth of learning
skills, self-esteem and emotional security (Heckman, 2000).1 Many parents face particular
demands in the workplace during these same years as they attempt to establish or advance
careers and meet the financial needs of their growing families. These pressures may be
aggravated by job insecurity, increases in the pace of work, and other burdens such as the need to
care for aging relatives.
       This study examines trends in labor force involvement, household structure, and some
parental activities that may complicate efforts to balance work and family life. Next I consider
whether employer policies mitigate or exacerbate these difficulties and, since the policies
adopted in the United States diverge dramatically from those in many other industrialized
countries, provide some international comparisons before speculating on possible sources and
effects of the differences.
        1. Changes in Labor Supply, Household Composition, and Time Investments
       The rapidly increasing involvement of women in the workplace in recent decades
represents a well-known but nevertheless striking change. The labor force participation rate
(LFPR) of females aged 16 and over rose from 43.3 to 60.1 percent between 1970 and 2001;
conversely participation of males declined slightly during the same period (mainly due to earlier
retirement), falling from 79.7 to 74.4 percent (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2002).
       The overall rise in female participation masks still larger increases among mothers. As
shown in Figure 1, the LFPR of mothers with non-adult children rose 54 percent between 1975
and 2001, from 47.4 to 73.1 percent (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics,
1988; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2002). The implication that most children now have working


1
 However, the mechanisms for these effects are poorly understood and the relationship between early
brain development and future outcomes remains controversial (Bruer, 1999).

mothers suggests that tradeoffs between work and family responsibilities may have become more
difficult for many households. The issue is even more salient for parents with young children.
Labor force participation rates for women with children under 6 years of age grew 66 percent
over the same time span (from 39.0 to 64.9 percent), while the LFPR of mothers with infants
increased 78 percent, from 31.0 to 55.2 percent, between 1976 and 2000 (Bachu and O’Connell,
2001).
         Women with young children are also much less likely to have a spouse available to help
with household responsibilities. In 1960, just 8 percent of children lived only with their mother
and fully 88 percent were in two-parent households; the corresponding figures in 2002 were 23
and 69 percent (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2003).2 Single-parent households are likely to have a
far more difficult time balancing the conflicting demands of work and family.
         Government policies may have exacerbated these challenges. Employment used to be
uncommon for married mothers with young children but has become the norm. (Single mothers
have always had higher rates of participation.) As shown in Figure 2, the LFPR of married
mothers with children under 6 grew 70 percent (from 36.7 to 62.5 percent), compared to a 40
percent increase (from 51.3 to 72.0 percent) for corresponding single mothers.3 Even more
striking is that the participation of single mothers remained essentially constant between 1975
and 1992 and then began to rise very rapidly. A comprehensive analysis by Meyer and
Rosenbaum (2001) indicates that this increase can largely be attributed to changes in the Earned
Income Tax Credit (EITC) and other tax policies, as well as welfare reform.4
         Increases in the market employment by mothers and children in single-parent households
suggest that families may find it increasingly difficult to balance conflicts between
responsibilities at home and in the workplace. However, there are two mitigating factors. First,
women are not having as many children as they used to – the total fertility rate fell from 3.65 to


2
  The percentage of children living only with fathers also rose (from 1.1 to 4.6 percent) between 1960 and
2002, while the share living with non-parent relatives changed little (from 2.5 to 2.9 percent).
3
  Married couples are defined here to include cases where the spouse is living in the household; single
parents refer to adults who are divorced, separated, widowed, or have never married.
4
  Conversely, Eissa and Hoynes (1998) estimate that the EITC slightly reduced (by about one percentage
point) the employment rates of married women.

                                                 Page 2
2.08 children between 1960 and 1999 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2001, Table 1-7) – implying
ceteris paribus that more time is available for each child. Second, mothers have significantly
decreased the time spent on housework, in part because of increased contributions by fathers:
between 1965 and 2000 mothers reduced housework from 32 to 19 hours per week while the
time spent by fathers rose from 4 to 10 hours weekly (Bianchi and Raley, 2003).
        The decrease in housework represents one of a variety of efforts by mothers to protect
their investments in children.5 Nevertheless, evidence from time-diaries confirms that working
mothers spend less time with children than nonemployed women (Bryan and Zick, 1996; Zick
and Bryan, 1996; Bianchi, 2000; Gershuny, 2000; Hofferth, 2001; Sandberg and Hofferth, 2001).
And long work hours are likely to have other costs. For instance, parents may be more tired or
stressed, and they are likely to cut back on valued activities such as sleep, leisure pursuits, and
personal care (Bianchi, 2000).6
                                        2. Employer Benefits
        Are private employers in the United States “family-friendly”? While there are many
dimensions to this question, one obvious aspect to consider are the types of benefits offered by
companies. Towards this end, Tables 1 and 2 document the availability of employer-provided
benefits to full-time workers that might help with balancing responsibilities at home and in the
workplace. Table 1 provides information on medium and large establishments; Table 2 offers
corresponding data for small employers.7
        Over 90 percent of full-time employees at medium and large companies receive (often
brief) paid holidays and vacation. However, even these have become somewhat more limited
over time: the share of full-time workers supplied with holidays and vacations has drifted down
from 96 and 98 percent in 1988 to 92 and 95 percent in 2000. The majority of full-time


5
  Increased involvement by fathers may be another response, as are efforts to synchronize work schedules.
6
  For example, working mothers sleep 6 hours (10 percent) less per week than their nonemployed
counterparts. The Council of Economic Advisers (1999) estimated that parents had 22 hours (14 percent)
less time available for children in 1969 than in 1999; however, Sandberg and Hofferth (2001) find that,
since the early 1980s, parents have changed their behavior so as to avoid reducing the time devoted to
children.
7
  Medium and large establishments are defined as those employing more than 100 workers after 1986. In
earlier years, the size threshold was set between 50 and 250 workers, depending on the industry.

                                                 Page 3
employees can also take paid sick leave, although there is again some suggestion of a downward
trend. Other paid benefits are rare. Between 20 and 25 percent receive paid personal leave; less
than one-tenth obtain employer assistance for child care; and fewer than one in twenty works for
an employer offering either on-site or off-site child care. By contrast, unpaid family leave is
more common – it was available to one-third of women and one-sixth of men working full-time
for medium or large employers in 1988 and was almost universally offered to them by the late
1990s. This change reflects the enactment of federal legislation that is discussed below.
       Although corresponding information for small employers has been available for a shorter
period, there is no doubt that such companies supply family-friendly benefits less often than their
larger counterparts.8 Fewer than 90 percent of full-time employees at small firms received paid
holidays or vacations and sick leave was provided to roughly half of them. Paid personal leave
was available to just one in eight full-time employees in the early and mid-1990s and paid family
leave or child care was almost never provided. Unpaid family leave increased sharply over time,
just as for larger companies, but was still offered to less than half of full-time employees in 1996.
       Firms are even less likely to offer the aforementioned benefits to part-time and less-
skilled workers, who will often have the fewest resources available to mitigate work-family
conflicts. For instance, 90 and 87 percent of full-time employees of private firms (of all sizes)
received paid vacations and holidays in 1999, compared to 43 and 36 percent of part-time
workers (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2001). Similarly, 88, 89, and 12
percent of managerial, technical, and professional employees were offered paid vacations, paid
holidays, and child care assistance versus 75, 69, and 4 percent of blue-collar or service
employees.
                                    3. Family Leave Policies
       As noted, one benefit that has expanded markedly in recent years is in the availability of
unpaid family leave. Where just one-third of females and one-sixth of males employed full-time
at medium or large establishments were able to take unpaid family leave in 1990, over 90 percent



8
 However, small employers might be more likely to make accommodations to employees on an informal
basis.

                                               Page 4
of both sexes could do so in 1997. This largely resulted from the 1993 enactment of the federal
Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).
        Key provisions of the FMLA are detailed in Table 3. Briefly, the law requires public
agencies and sufficiently large private establishments to offer 12 weeks of leave during a one-
year period to employees caring for newborn or adopted children, relatives with serious medical
conditions, or for their own health problems. The entitlement is limited in several ways. Most
importantly, the leave is unpaid and workers may be required to first use accrued sick leave or
vacation time. However health insurance is continued. Small employers (those with fewer than
50 employees in a 75-mile radius) are exempt and, under specified conditions, firms are not
required to offer job reinstatement (at the end of the leave) to certain “key” employees.
        The exemption of small firms, exclusion of key employees, and work history
requirements limit the scope of FMLA coverage. In earlier work (Ruhm, 1997), I estimated that
approximately half of all workers are covered by the law. Also, while this legislation is often
viewed as providing parental leave to care for newborns, the FMLA is primarily used for other
purposes. For instance, in 1995 just 14.3 percent of employees taking FMLA leave did so to care
for a newborn or newly adopted child; in 2000, 17.9 percent of leaves were for this purpose
(Waldfogel, 2001).9 One reason for this is that many women eligible for maternity leave under
the FMLA already had the rights to job absences under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA)
of 1978, temporary disability insurance programs in some states (that extend beyond the PDA),
and state leave laws covering private and public employees.10
        The situation in the United States contrasts sharply with that in most other nations. In
1999 more than 125 countries, including virtually all industrialized nations, provided some form
of paid job-protected maternity leave, most entitling women to at least two or three months of
paid leave during the period surrounding childbirth (Kamerman, 2000). To illustrate, Table 4
details the paid leave entitlements, rate of pay, source of funds, and conditions for eligibility in
2002 for 15 European nations. Each provides at least 12 weeks of leave, usually at between 50


9
  By far the most common reason for taking leave is for one’s own health problem – accounting for 61.4
percent of FMLA absences in 1995 and 47.2 percent in 2000.
10
   Ruhm (1997) provides a more detailed discussion of this issue.

                                                Page 5
and 100 percent of pay, and many provide rights to much longer job absences. Moreover, the
leave durations are often extended in cases of complicated pregnancy or child birth, sick
children, or for other reasons (such as multiple births). A portion of the leave is sometimes
available to fathers and additional lengthy unpaid job absences with guaranteed reemployment
are frequently permitted after the end of the paid leave period.
                            4. Maternal Employment and Child Care
        Due in part to the limited availability of paid parental leave, most women in the United
States quickly return to work after giving birth. Figures 3 details employment rates following
pregnancy for mothers having babies during the early 1980s through mid-1990s.11 One-fourth
were absent from jobs less than one week after delivery, although a small fraction of these may
have initially been on brief maternity leaves. The “conditional” estimates show employment
rates for women taking some time off work after birth; the “unconditional” probabilities refer to
all mothers. Weekly employment hazard rates (displayed in percentages and multiplied by 10)
averaged 4 to 8 percent for the first 10 weeks of the child’s life, declined rapidly to 1 to 2 percent
in the fourth through sixth months, and were less than 1 percent during the remainder of the first
year.12 The hazard rates typically ranged between 0.2 and 0.6 percent per week in the child’s
second year and 0.1 to 0.2 percent in the third. Sixty-five, 77, and 84 percent of women returned
to jobs prior to their child's first, second, and third birthday, as did 53, 70, and 79 percent of
those taking some time off work after delivery.
        Since most mothers work in their children’s early years, the majority of families use non-
parental day care. The cost of this care sometimes presents difficulties and necessitates a variety
of adjustments. In recent research, Dan Rosenbaum and I have attempted to measure the “cost
burden” of child care (Rosenbaum and Ruhm, 2003), defined as day care expenses for children
aged five and under divided by disposable income (earnings plus non-earned income minus
taxes). Table 5 summarizes some of our estimates. The average pre-school aged child lives in a
family spending 4.9 percent of their disposable income on day care. This average, however,
11
   These data are from the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Ruhm
(forthcoming) provides additional detail on the sample and results.
12
   The hazard rate is the probability of working in a given week conditional on the mother not being
employed the previous week.

                                                 Page 6
conceals enormous diversity. Fully 63 percent of children live in families with no child care
costs. Conversely, families in the upper 10 percent of the cost burden distribution spend nearly
30 percent of disposable income on child care.13
           The concentration of child care costs is remarkable. Families in the top decile of the cost
burden distribution average $624 per month for child care, versus only $80 per month for the
other 90 percent of families, yet have monthly disposable incomes averaging just $2,268, which
is less than the $3,150 mean monthly income of the other 90 percent. One reason is that working
single parents account for 40 percent of the highest cost burden group. However, zero costs need
not imply an absence of nonparental day care as 23 percent of young children are in families that
utilize only free sources of care. These households are disproportionately disadvantaged, as
measured by the predicted earnings of the primary caregiver based on characteristics such as
education, age of the parent, and race/ethnicity.
           Table 6 provides further information on the sources and costs of day care. Children
under 6 reside in families where an average of 25 hours per week of care is provided by persons
other than parents or siblings. Sixty percent are in families using some external sources of day
care, two-fifths of which is provided free of charge (mostly by grandparents and other relatives).
The quantity and cost of care varies substantially across types of families. Rosenbaum and
Ruhm (2003) estimate that single-parent families use 50 percent more hours than married parents
(33 vs. 22 hours per week) but also utilize cheaper sources ($0.80 vs. $1.50 per hour on average)
and as a result spend 20 percent less on child care ($114 vs. $143 per week). Families where the
primary caregiver is a non-Hispanic white use slightly fewer hours of outside day care than
minorities (24 vs. 27 hours per week) but pay more per hour ($1.49 vs. $0.87) and per month
($155 vs. $100) for these services. Highly educated parents use large amounts and expensive
sources of day care, resulting in relatively high expenditures.
                                                 5. Implications
           Balancing employer and family responsibilities presents particular challenges to parents
with young children in the United States, probably more so than in many other industrialized

13
     The 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles of the cost burden distribution are 5.9, 16.3, and 25.3 percent.


                                                      Page 7
countries. The U.S. labor market can reasonably be characterized as one with long work hours,
short vacations, limited availability of parental leave, and restricted state or employer support for
child care.14 Grandparents and other relatives often help supervise young children, raising the
possibility that workplace-family concerns span generations.
       That said, considerable caution is needed before assuming that the more “family-
friendly” institutional arrangements present in other nations would be desirable for the United
States. There is good reason to believe that many Americans willingly tradeoff higher labor
supply and reduced workplace flexibility for increased incomes. The U.S. is also characterized
by a particularly high reliance on market-based solutions and distrust of government regulations
or interventions. In the absence of significant sources of market failure, public goods, or
externalities, privately negotiated labor market arrangements lead to economically efficient
(although not necessarily equitable) solutions and regulations impose net costs on society. Thus,
one interpretation of the findings is that employers provide and the government mandates few
family-friendly benefits because the public prefers it that way.
       These points notwithstanding, my suspicion is that the work-family arrangements
common in the United States are suboptimal. There is increasing evidence that paid parental
leave that is not too lengthy improves the labor market outcomes of women (Ruhm, 1998; Baum,
2003a), enhances child health (Ruhm, 2000), and raises the quality of mother-infant interactions
(Clark et al., 1997). Recent research on maternal employment, that contains better controls and
more sophisticated strategies for accounting for heterogeneity than earlier studies, finds that
labor supply during the child’s infancy period has a deleterious impact on cognitive development
(e.g. Han et al., 2001; Brooks-Gunn et al., 2002; Baum, 2003b; Ruhm, 2003; Ruhm, 2004).
There is also evidence that high quality formal day care in the year prior to kindergarten
increases school readiness (Shonkoff & Phillips, 2001; Magnuson, et al., forthcoming). Taken as
a group, these results seem at odds with limited rights to parental leave, elevated levels of market



14
  Altonji and Oldham (2003) provide evidence linking long annual work hours in the United States to the
absence of legislation mandating minimum paid time off work, in sharp contrast to all Western European
countries (other than the United Kingdom) where employees are generally entitled to lengthy vacations.

                                                Page 8
employment by parents with young children, and the high cost of (frequently poor quality)
formal child care arrangements.
        Moreover, there are several reasons why voluntarily negotiated private arrangements may
fail to yield efficient or desirable solutions. Adverse selection under asymmetric information
provides a potential source of market failure. For example, companies voluntarily offering
extensive paid parental leave may attract a disproportionate number of employees likely to use
the costly benefit. If these expenses are financed by lower earnings, persons with small
probabilities of using leave will avoid such firms and so do without even socially optimal job
absences.15 Conversely, if the employers are unable to sufficiently reduce wages to offset costs
of the leave, profits will fall and economic viability may be threatened. A government mandate
eliminates the incentive for this type of sorting behavior and has the potential to raise welfare.
        Privately negotiated arrangements might also fail to provide first-best outcomes if parents
lack information on the results of their decisions. For instance, they may not be sufficiently
informed about the quality of alternative child care options or the consequences of different
choices. Similarly, if parents are liquidity constrained and capital markets are imperfect, they
may be unable to finance desired expenditures on high quality but costly day care. Another
reason families might underinvest in children is if some of the benefits represent “public goods”.
For instance, high quality child care could increase school readiness which, in turn, subsequently
leads to lower the crime rates during adolescence. Certain types of medical care may similarly
reduce health risks to other children (e.g. by decreasing communicable diseases). However,
many of these benefits will not be directly observed by the parents (or employers) paying the
additional costs, reducing incentives to undertake the expenditures. That said, it is often not
obvious how (if at all) these sources of market failure can best be remedied.



15
  This is analogous to Rothschild and Stiglitz's [1976] argument for market failure in insurance markets.
Aghion and Hermalin [1990] suggest that in some situations socially optimal parental leave might not be
voluntarily provided to any workers. This might occur because low-risk individuals signal their status to
employers by agreeing to contracts providing for little or no leave. High-risk workers sometimes do
better mimicking their counterparts, by taking positions without leave, than by revealing their propensity
towards absenteeism. The inefficiency of privately negotiated labor contracts under asymmetric
information has been demonstrated across a variety of contexts.

                                                  Page 9
       Government policies that have desirable aims may nevertheless make it more difficult for
parents with young children to balance their joint work-family responsibilities. Most obviously,
reforms to the welfare system have placed pressure on recipients (particularly single mothers) to
quickly enter or resume employment, possibly increasing time constraints and the difficulties in
caring for children. More generous tax treatment under the Earned Income Tax Credit has
similarly raised the labor supply of single mothers with young children. The higher levels of
employment represent voluntary (and presumably largely desirable) responses to increases in the
returns to work but may nevertheless place stresses on some families. The proposed elimination
of the “marriage penalty” could also create incentives for married individuals (especially
mothers) with young children to increase employment hours, again highlighting issues of work-
family balance.
       The aforementioned government policies all operate to raise employment, earnings, and
presumably national income. However, they have generally not been accompanied by aggressive
efforts to facilitate combining increasing job responsibilities with the needs of families. As
discussed, paid parental leave is a rarity in the United States, child care options are limited, and
vacations are short. Changing these or related family-friendly policies through government
programs, regulations, or direct employer actions is likely to be expensive and controversial.
Discussion of what courses of action might best assist families with young children is worthy of
future debate.
