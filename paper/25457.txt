                                          ABSTRACT

We estimate local fiscal multipliers and spillovers for the United States using a rich dataset based
on U.S. Department of Defense contracts and a variety of outcome variables relating to income
and employment. We find strong positive spillovers across locations and industries. Both
backward linkages and general equilibrium effects (e.g., income multipliers) contribute to the
positive spillovers. Geographical spillovers appear to dissipate fairly quickly with distance. Our
evidence points to the relevance of Keynesian-type models that feature excess capacity.

1. Introduction

The strength of fiscal multipliers and spillovers have been the subject of intense debate and
considerable empirical research in recent years. An important part of this literature has provided
estimates of “local” fiscal multipliers, based on the effects of differential fiscal shocks at lower
levels of aggregation within larger entities, e.g., states within the United States or countries within
the European Union or the OECD. But the translation of local multipliers into national ones is not
straightforward, in part because of the potential for large fiscal spillovers, especially among entities
that are strongly integrated economically. In this paper, we contribute to the literature on local
fiscal multipliers while also providing estimates of the strength of fiscal spillovers, both geographic
and across industries, taking advantage of unique, detailed microdata on local defense spending.
       Local multipliers inform estimates of national multiplier and are of independent interest to
localities that experience fiscal shocks and to neighbors of those localities. Defense spending in a
locality could crowd out private-sector output in that locality (e.g., through increased demand and
prices for local inputs, notably labor) or increase private-sector output through income multiplier
effects and upstream input-output linkages. Likewise, neighboring localities could experience an
increase in their employment/output through positive multiplier effects or they could decline as
labor inputs flow to the neighbor to accommodate the increase in demand there. An important
empirical question, which we address in this paper, is how an autonomous increase in demand in
a location/industry (a) affects employment in other industries in that location; and (b) affects
employment in nearby locations.
       Understanding these spillover effects from government spending on private activity is a
fundamental and largely unresolved task in macroeconomics. While many would agree that there
are potential direct benefits from productive government spending, such as infrastructure, there is
little consensus on whether defense spending, which generally does not deliver direct local
productivity benefits, has any indirect local benefit. The lack of consensus is due in part to a dearth
of evidence. It is simply very difficult to identify and isolate exogenous changes in local
government spending. Even when such exogenous variation exists, researchers typically cannot
reject the null hypothesis that government spending crowds out the private sector (as would be
implied by aggregate closed-economy multipliers less than 1).
        A recent influential paper by Cohen, Coval, and Malloy (2011) finds that an influx of federal
funds into a congressional district, attributable to likely exogenous political shifts, causes a reduction
in private-sector investment in that location. They propose a mechanism whereby the local spending
reduces labor available to the private sector, which drives down investment. It remains to be
determined whether an influx of federal funds (such as defense contracts) indeed crowds out local
labor supply faced by the private sector (either in other industries or nearby locations). 1
        We exploit a detailed dataset on U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) contracts that allows
us to shed considerable light on the relationship between government spending and local economic
activity. The dataset contains information on the zip code and industry of the contractor and the
zip code of primary place of work performance. Using information on the amount and duration of
each contract, we construct contract-level, time-specific measures of DOD outlays. We aggregate
these contracts to construct city-level measures of DOD spending available since 1997 and
combine this information with disaggregate data on output, earnings, and employment to examine
the effects of DOD spending and spillovers across industries and geographies.
        Our baseline estimates imply that a dollar of DOD spending in a city increases GDP in that
city by a dollar and labor earnings by $0.35, and that an increase of DOD spending equal to a
percent of local earnings increases employment by 0.2 percent. These estimates are close to the
city-level multiplier estimates from Demyanyk et al. (2018), which focuses on a purely cross-
sectional setting. We argue in the paper that these estimates imply substantial within-location
positive spillovers.
        The spending shocks also have positive effects on nearby localities, increasing earnings in
proximate cities by about half of the own-city effect and increasing GDP in other cities across the
same state by between half and a whole of the own-city effect. The positive geographic spillovers
imply that any negative spillover effects that operate through factor markets (e.g., pulling in labor
from nearby locations) are outweighed by positive demand spillovers (e.g., input-output linkages
or induced consumer spending). These findings imply that the increase in local demand is not
accommodated by a net reallocation of labor from nearby locations.




1
 There also is some ambiguity regarding their finding that government spending causes a reduction in local investment
(Snyder and Welch 2017). Therefore, the effect of government spending on local private activity remains a very open
question.

                                                                                                                   2
        Rather than pulling in labor from nearby locations, it is possible that defense spending
pulls in labor from other local industries. To understand how defense spending spills over across
local industries, we compute three distinct industry-location-specific measures. The first measure
is direct spending from the DOD on goods produced by an industry. The second measure is indirect
DOD spending on that industry based on input requirements of other industries in that location
that receive DOD spending. The third measure is total DOD spending in other industries, net of
input requirements for the observed industry. Using these measures, we examine industry-level
output multipliers. The first measure yields an estimate of the value added by the local industry’s
workers (if using the earnings measure) and capital (when examining GDP). The second measure
yields an estimate of the local sourcing for DOD contracts and is analogous to estimates of
backward linkages previously explored in the context of foreign direct investment (e.g.,
Gorodnichenko, Svejnar, and Terrell 2014). An estimate of zero would imply that industries
source intermediate inputs almost exclusively from other locations, as would be expected in a
world with no trade costs, while positive estimates signal the importance of local sourcing. The
third measure yields an estimate of what we interpret as general equilibrium effects, which include
indirect effects such as reallocation of production factors or positive demand externalities other
than through direct backward linkages.
       We find that local industries benefit from all three forms of spending. DOD spending has
positive direct effects on recipient industries, positive effects on other local industries that supply
intermediate inputs, and positive effects on industries that are not directly linked to the recipient
industry. Perhaps most surprisingly, net general equilibrium effects are positive. A given industry
with no direct production linkages does not (on average) experience a decline in labor when the
DOD purchases goods or services from other industries. We also examine the effects of each form
of industry-level spending on industries in nearby locations and find similarly positive effects. In
summary, we find no evidence that average spillovers are negative, either across industries or
within industries across nearby geographies.
       Taken in isolation, each piece of evidence we provide is consistent with demand-induced
spillovers that operate either through input linkages, consumer spending, or even reductions in
borrowing costs (perhaps due to perceptions of lower default risk). But taken together and placed
within a general equilibrium framework, the body of evidence is quite puzzling in that net
employment effects (across industries and locations) are all positive. Increased production

                                                                                                     3
(induced by DOD spending) in an industry and location does not require (on average) an outflow
of labor from other industries or locations.
        What sort of general equilibrium framework is consistent with our findings? Most theories,
including those with search frictions and/or sticky wages, imply that additional production requires
additional labor resources from somewhere. Assuming transportation is costly, that labor will be
predicted to be provided locally, either by reallocation across local geographies or across industries
in the location. We find no such evidence that this occurs. The remaining possibility is that there
exists excess capacity, either in labor markets or at the firm level. Such results would be consistent
with the theory provided by Murphy (2017), in which producers (firms or workers) face fixed
rather than marginal production costs, or Michaillat and Saez (2015), who propose a model of
matching frictions and sticky prices that implies that higher demand reduces idle time for workers.
        Our estimates suggest that a dollar of local defense spending in a city increases GDP in
that city by a dollar and GDP in other cities in the state by $0.50, for a state-level multiplier effect
of 1.5, consistent with the state-level estimates in Nakamura and Steinsson (2014). What does this
imply for national multipliers? As discussed in detail in Chodorow-Reich (2018), mechanisms
that can reduce national multipliers relative to state-level multipliers include factor market
clearing, interest rate rises in response to government spending, and negative wealth effects
associated with perceived taxes. Our empirical evidence speaks directly to crowding out through
factor markets, for which we find no empirical support (much less any crowding out of quantitative
significance). Our evidence also points indirectly to the likely strength of crowding out through
interest rates, as theories of excess capacity that are consistent with our spillover evidence also
imply that in a closed economy, government spending can have a net-zero (or even negative) effect
on interest rates, consistent with some empirical evidence (Murphy and Walsh 2017).
        While our evidence suggests that two mechanisms that might reduce the national multiplier
relative to local multipliers may be unimportant, our evidence is silent with respect to other factors,
such as the potential importance of negative wealth effects operating through increases in
perceived tax liabilities. However, it should be noted that in models of excess capacity, the
effective (present-value) tax burden of additional spending can be quite small. For example,
Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2017) find, for a panel of OECD countries, that fiscal stimulus
during periods of economic weakness leads to reduced debt-GDP ratios. Furthermore, empirical
evidence suggests that aggregate consumption increases or at least does not fall significantly in

                                                                                                      4
response to government spending, suggesting that negative wealth effects are offset by positive
demand externalities (e.g., Murphy 2015).
        While our analysis covers behavior at the U.S. local level and thus has clear implications
for other federal settings where such data are not available, our work can shed new light on
international spillovers. Indeed, previous analyses of local government spending multipliers
emphasize that one can interpret these multipliers as if they are estimated on small open economies
with fixed exchange rates. By focusing on the U.S. data, we exploit the fact that U.S. cities (or other
geographical units) have notably strong production and trade linkages, limited trade barriers, high
labor mobility across industries and locations, and, of course, a common currency. As a result, we
can abstract from a variety of frictions that make identification of shocks as well as their propagation
mechanisms a challenge. Given this combination of characteristics, estimates based on the U.S.
data likely provide upper bounds for spillovers that one may observe in international contexts.
However, these estimates can be informative for groups of countries in some cases, notably the
Euro area, and thus provide inputs for analyses in spirit of Blanchard, Erceg and Linde (2016).



2. Literature Review

Our paper adds to an expansive set of research that uses regional variation in government spending
and taxation to estimate fiscal effects in the United States. Chodorow-Reich (2018) provides a
review and summary of this literature. While many of these papers focus on variation in transfer
programs such as Medicaid or American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, a much smaller
subset focuses on direct measures of current (or anticipated) government spending such as defense
contracts, which arguably are more likely to provide exogenous variation.              Nakamura and
Steinsson (2014) initially used DOD contracts to estimate state-level local spending multipliers.
More recent work has used cross-sectional variation in DOD contracts across cities to examine the
relationship between spending multipliers and consumer debt (Demyanyk, Loutskina, and Murphy
2018). We add to this line of research by examining industry and location spillovers in addition
to local multipliers.
        Our focus on spillovers adds to a body of evidence that finds positive effects of fiscal
stimulus, both across local labor markets (e.g., Dupor and McCrory 2018) and across national
borders (e.g., Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2013). These papers have documented substantial


                                                                                                      5
spillovers, although other work based on variation in state balanced-budget rules (Clemens and
Miran 2012) or transfer programs in response to revisions of population counts after census years
(Suarez-Serrato and Wingender 2014) finds negligible spillovers. A unique feature of our
empirical setting is that we can jointly examine spillovers across industries and across geographies
at great detail and thus inform the debate on whether government spending crowds out local
private-sector activity (e.g., Cohen, Coval, Malloy 2011).
       We also contribute to several strands of research in international economics. First, we
build on earlier papers utilizing input-output linkages to study the effects of foreign direct
investment (e.g., Javorcik 2004; see Demena and van Bergeijk (2017) for a recent survey of this
literature). Specifically, we consider backward linkages as a source of cross-industry spillovers
for government spending shocks. Note that while foreign direct investment is likely a combination
of supply and demand forces (e.g., technology transfer and demand for inputs), our analysis
concentrates on demand shocks and we also investigate geographical spillovers. Second, our work
is related to the literature studying how trade shocks influence local labor markets. Perhaps, the
most famous example of such a shock is the opening of China to trade with the U.S. (Autor, Dorn,
and Hanson (2016) provide a survey). This shock led to a strong contraction of employment by
U.S. manufacturing firms that directly compete with Chinese producers. Similar to this literature,
we study a demand shock, but we estimate not only local effects on geographical locations
experiencing the shock but also how this shock propagates across locations and industries.
       More broadly, we combine tools from several literatures to provide an integrated treatment
of spillovers and thus to inform academics and policymakers about magnitudes and mechanisms
of responses to demand shocks. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to study
spillovers jointly over geography and industry.



3. Data

A considerable reason for the growing literature on local multipliers is that subnational or multi-
country data provide much more variation over relatively short time periods. Also, such data are
potentially useful for studying spillovers across jurisdictions that are economically linked, for
which observations for large countries are less appropriate. But a problem in evaluating the
importance of spillovers using subnational data is that such data typically are available only at


                                                                                                  6
lower frequencies, offer little if any detail on industrial composition, and may not offer credible
independent, exogenous variation in fiscal policy.
           Our data offer unique advantages in this context. First, they are available at potentially
very high frequencies. For example, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2016) use similar data at the
daily frequency. In contrast, analyses of local fiscal multipliers typically use annual (e.g.,
Chodorow-Reich et al. 2012) or even decennial (e.g., Suarez-Serrato and Wingender 2016)
frequency. While our main results are provided at an annual frequency to take advantage of the
largest range of outcome data available and to address some econometric challenges, we have
performed some analysis at a monthly frequency. Second, we have extensive information on
spending shocks by location and industry at a very disaggregate level: we observe military
spending at the 5-digit NAICS/zipcode level. For comparison, Miyamoto, Nguyen, and
Sheremirov (2016) study the effects of military spending shocks for a broad panel of countries but
they have only total annual military spending at the country level. Finally, our spending shocks,
drawn from the awarding of defense contracts, are both large and less dependent on local
conditions than spending shocks potentially measured in other ways. Specifically, the contracts
amount to approximately two percent of GDP annually in the United States and, as discussed in
Ramey (2011), military spending in the U.S. is much more likely to provide large, exogenous
variation than other types of government spending.


A. Government Spending Data

Our measure of government spending is based on data on DOD contracts available at
USAspending.gov. 2 This data source contains detailed information on contracts signed since
2000, including the name and location (zip code) of the primary contractor, the total contracted
amount (obligated funds), and the duration of the contract. In most cases, we also observe the
primary zip code in which contracted work was performed.
           We complement this source with the data from the Federal Procurement Data System
(FPDS; www.fpds.gov) to have longer time series for government spending. The FPDS is the
underlying source of data for USAspending.gov; that is, USAspending.gov builds data from the
FPDS and presents it in a user-friendly way. We found high consistency across the sources for

2
    Our data set is an updated version of the data used in Demyanyk, Loutskina, and Murphy (2018).

                                                                                                     7
overlapping observations. The FPDS data allow us to extend government spending to 1997. While
FPDS contains information for earlier years, we observe that the pre-1997 period has a sharply
lower number of contracts relative to the post-1997 period which likely reflects changes in the
reporting standards rather than changes in government spending.
       In addition to new contract obligations, the dataset also contains modifications to existing
contracts, including downward revisions to contract amounts (de-obligations) that appear as
negative entries. Many of these de-obligations are very large and occur subsequent to large
obligations of similar magnitude.       When we observe obligations and de-obligations with
magnitudes within 0.5 percent of each other, we consider both contracts to be null and void. This
restriction removes 4.7 percent of contracts from the sample.
       These data offer a number of advantages relative to the DOD data in Nakamura and
Steinsson (2014), used to estimate state-level local fiscal multipliers. First, the detailed location
data permit us to estimate multipliers at smaller levels of economic geography. This increases the
cross-sectional dimension of our study and allows us to examine localized outcome variables for
which data is available for only a limited, more recent, period of time. It also allows us to measure
spillovers more effectively, to the extent that spillovers occur most strongly in locations that are
relatively close in physical terms to the location of the fiscal shock.
       Second, the information on the duration of each contract allows us to construct a proxy for
outlays associated with each contract. This proxy captures the component of DOD contracts that
directly affects output contemporaneously (and is thus relevant for studying crowding in and
crowding out effects). Also, some of the spending is based on pre-determined contracts, which
helps mitigate concerns about endogeneity.
       To construct this spending/outlay measure by location, we derive a flow spending measure
for each contract by allocating the contracted amount equally over the duration of the contract.
For example, for a contract for $1 million that lasts eight quarters we assign $125 thousand in
spending for each quarter of the contract. We then aggregate spending across contracts in a
location (at each point in time) to construct local measures of DOD spending.
       Figure 1 shows our annual spending and obligation measures aggregated to the national
level alongside the national defense spending on purchases of intermediate goods and services that
are reported in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). We find that out measure of
spending aggregated to the national level closely tracks NIPA estimates. Specifically, our series

                                                                                                   8
captures stable spending in the pre-9/11 period, then a massive military buildup, and subsequent
(after year 2010) cuts in military spending. Note that national defense spending on intermediate
goods and services is highly persistent.
         Table 1 shows average annual spending by industry for select industries. DOD spending is
distributed widely across industries, including services. For example, the second largest receipt of
DOD contracts is “Miscellaneous professional, scientific, and technical services” which includes
“Scientific research and development services.” Construction is also a large recipient ($11
bn/year). Thus, although manufacturing accounts for a large share of military spending, other
sectors also receive substantial amounts.


B. Outcome/Economic Data

We use a range of outcome measures. One output measure is employee income (pre-tax earnings)3
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). The
QCEW data are available at the county level, permitting us to compare multiplier estimates across
different levels of economic geography and industry. Our main unit of analysis is core-based
statistical area (CBSA), to which we refer simply as “city” but which may also be thought of as a
metropolitan area. 4 We seasonally adjust each county’s earnings series using the X-13 seasonal
adjustment program produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. We also examine industry-level
measures of employment and earnings from the QCEW. Consistent QCEW data are available since
1984, considerably before the beginning of our currently available series on defense spending.
         To examine additional economic outcomes of interest, we supplement the QCEW data with
annual city-level data. In particular, we use measures of city-and-industry-level GDP from the
BEA. GDP data are available for 383 of the largest cities in the sample. BEA data are available
since 2001.




3
 Apart of salaries and wages, the earnings include bonuses, stock options, profit distributions, and some fringe benefits
such as cash value of meals and lodging.
4
  According to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, a core-based statistical area (CBSA) is one or more
counties (or equivalents) with an urban center of at least 10,000 people. Counties adjacent to the urban central are
tied to the urban center by commuting.

                                                                                                                       9
C. Data filters

We apply several filters to ensure that our estimates are not driven by outliers, influential
observations, and other noise in the data. We exclude industries/locations with incomplete
histories. 5 We also exclude industries/locations with large swings (more than 100 percent increase
or more than 50 percent decline in a year) in employment or earnings. 6 In addition, we exclude
industry/locations that exhibit episodes of spending considerably in excess of measured output
(imposing a conservative upper limit of spending-to-output of 1.5) under the assumption that either
income or spending is mismeasured during those episodes. Finally, we exclude geographical
locations with zero DOD spending because these locations likely provide a poor control group.



4. Case Study: Spending Shocks in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan Area

Studying the effects of government spending shocks is a challenge along many dimensions. How
can one identify unanticipated shocks? How can one establish the timing of these shocks? How
can one find a control group for a location receiving a government spending boost? How do these
shocks propagate across locations and industries? To motivate our econometric analysis, we start
with a case study of Dallas and Ft. Worth. We use this case study to highlight the challenges,
provide a narrative to various estimates of multipliers, and reach some tentative conclusions.


A. Background

Dallas and Ft. Worth are part of the fourth largest metropolitan area in the United States (see Figure
2). Unlike many other large metropolitan areas, the Dallas-Ft. Worth-Arlington metropolitan area
is not dominated by one large city and instead has two large cities approximately equal in size: Ft.
Worth and Dallas have each about 1 million in population. The local infrastructure is aimed to




5
  For confidentiality reasons, QCEW does not report employment and earnings for an industry/location/period cell
that may reveal information for specific firms. As a result, some of these series may be interrupted by spells of missing
values.
6
 For example, county or city borders and industry definitions are occasionally revised, which can result in large
variation of, e.g., industry-level employment that is not related to any kind of fundamental variation in local economic
conditions.

                                                                                                                     10
integrate the cities, which have broadly similar growth trajectories and industrial composition.
Thus, the two cities provide a potentially good match of treatment and control groups.


B. The Shock

In 2001, Ft. Worth received a huge government defense spending shock. On October 26, 2001,
the U.S. DOD announced the award to Lockheed Martin of a $200 billion contract to build a new
fighter jet. It had been a tight race between Lockheed Martin (with production facilities in Ft.
Worth and a few other locations) and Boeing (with production facilities in Washington state at the
time). 7 The announcement indicated the first tranche of obligations and the main place of
performance, with 66 percent of work planned to be done in Ft. Worth:


        Lockheed Martin Corp., Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co., Fort Worth, Texas, is being
        awarded an $18,981,928,201 cost-plus-award-fee contract for the Joint Strike Fighter Air
        System Engineering and Manufacturing Development Program. The principal objectives
        of this phase are to develop an affordable family of strike aircraft and an autonomic
        logistics support and training system. This family of strike aircraft consists of three
        variants: conventional takeoff and landing, aircraft carrier suitable, and short takeoff and
        vertical landing. Under this contract, the contractor will be required to develop and verify
        a production-ready system design that addresses the needs of the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air
        Force, U.S. Marine Corps and the United Kingdom. Work will be performed in Fort Worth,
        Texas (66%); El Segundo, Calif. (20%); and Warton/Samlesbury, United Kingdom (14%),
        and is expected to be completed in April 2012. Contract funds will not expire at the end of
        the current fiscal year. This contract was competitively procured through a limited
        competition; two offers were received. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River,
        Md., is the contracting activity (N00019-02-C-3002).


This announcement was followed by a string of other announcements stating further DOD
obligations.
        Figure 3, Panel A, shows that before this contact was awarded, Dallas and Ft. Worth
received similar DOD funding. After 2001, there is a sharp divergence in military funding with

 Interestingly, stock prices started to move before the announcement: there were a sharp decline of Boeing’s stock
price and a sharp increase in Lockheed Martin’s in mid-September 2001. The average stock price for Boeing in
November 2001 was 35 percent lower than it was in September 2001, while the average stock price for Lockheed
Martin increased by 23 percent over the same period.

                                                                                                               11
Ft. Worth receiving approximately $100 billion (in 2001 prices) cumulatively between 2001 and
2015. In contrast, Dallas received approximately $40 billion over the same period.
        There are several notable elements in the contract. First, the size of the shock was large.
To put the magnitude into perspective, we note that GDP of the Dallas-Ft. Worth-Arlington metro
area was $260 billion in 2001 and so the contact corresponded to roughly one year of the area’s
GDP. Second, the payment schedule was stretched over many years and so this was a “permanent”
shock. Third, nearly all the contract’s funding went to one industry (NAICS 3364 “Aerospace
product and parts manufacturing”), letting us trace the shock’s propagation with high precision.


C. Outcomes

Panel B of Figure 3 plots the dynamics of employment (in logs, normalized to zero in year 2001).
The pre-contract trends were similar for Dallas and Ft. Worth, which strengthens our confidence
that Dallas is a good control location. After 2001, a large gap in employment opens across the two
cities. We observe similar dynamics for normalized log earnings (Panel C). Since no other major
shock hit the cities differentially, we can attribute these differential dynamics to the government
spending shock. In other words, these dynamics are consistent with a positive effect of government
spending on the economy of the location receiving the spending shock.
        To assess more broadly the extent of potential geographical spillovers, we examine the
dynamics for the same series in other counties of the metro area (Figure 4). We observe that the
amount of government spending was small in other counties 8 and, hence, we can maintain our
premise that the only “local” shock was the 2001 fighter jet contract that landed in Ft. Worth. The
interpretation of employment effects, however, is more challenging for these counties because
their employment grew faster than Dallas or Ft. Worth before the shock: 3.6 vs. 2.1 percent per
year. With this caveat in mind, we examine how the growth rate (rather than the level) of
employment changed in 2001.              The post-2001 growth rate of employment declined by
approximately 1.5 percentage points for Dallas and by 0.9 percentage points for other non-Ft.
Worth counties in the metro area. Interestingly, the growth rate for counties bordering Ft. Worth
(e.g., Denton County) fell by 0.7 percentage points while the growth rate for counties bordering


8
  Denton County had the same per-worker spending as Dallas. Other counties have negligible amounts of contracts
awarded by the Department of Defense

                                                                                                            12
Dallas (and not bordering Ft. Worth; e.g. Collin county) declined by 1.3 percentage points. By
comparison, the growth rate of employment in Ft. Worth declined by 0.9 percentage points. Thus,
the whole metro area experienced a slowdown after 2001 but there is variation in the responses
across locations; the deceleration was the strongest in Dallas and counties bordering Dallas.
       The richness of QCEW data allows us to examine how the shock spread across industries
and locations. Figure 5 shows the evolution of employment for selected industries in Ft. Worth
and Dallas. After the end of the Cold War with the Soviet Union in 1991, the aerospace industry
has been declining in both Ft. Worth and Dallas. The fighter jet contract in 2001 reversed the trend
for Ft. Worth, while the industry continued to decline in Dallas. Although there is heterogeneity
in post-2001 trends across industries, aggregate non-aerospace manufacturing (NAICS 30-33)
exhibits a similar pattern: pre-2001 trends are alike for Ft. Worth and Dallas but the trends diverge
after 2001. These dynamics are consistent with the aerospace industry sourcing inputs from other
industries in Ft. Worth and with the absence of a similar force in Dallas. In other words, the
observed dynamics are consistent with strong direct localized backward linkage effects.
       We also find similar dynamics for the construction sector (NAICS 23), trade (NAICS 42-
45), finance/insurance/real estate/professional services (NAICS 51-54), and hotel/restaurant/misc.
service (NAICS 72 and 81): comparable pre-trends and sharp divergence after the shock. These
dynamics are interesting because the aerospace industry sources a small share of its inputs from
construction and services. Hence, we can rule out a direct backward linkage effect. But the strong
divergence across locations for these sectors is consistent with strong positive general equilibrium
effects. Importantly, because these sectors produce nontradable goods, the effects appear to be
rather localized.
       While this preliminary analysis of Ft. Worth vs. Dallas is informative and provides a strong
motivation for our empirical approach, it has limitations. For example, we cannot “causally”
interpret the levels of employment: the decline of employment in Dallas could be a result of
negative spillovers from Ft. Worth or a result of adverse macroeconomic shocks. Indeed, 2001
was a time of a recession, which could have hit the Dallas-Ft. Worth metro area more strongly than
other parts of the country given the area’s strength in the cyclically-sensitive manufacturing sector
and the IT sector particularly affected by the contemporaneous dot-com bust. It is also possible
that increased employment in Ft. Worth came at the expense of Dallas, as firms located in Ft.



                                                                                                  13
Worth could poach workers from firms located in Dallas. Hence, we need to explore employment
dynamics of other cities similar to Dallas/Ft. Worth to get a sense of the “aggregate” effect.
        To this end, we plot employment and DOD spending time series for Houston and San
Antonio, two large cities in other regions of Texas. The figure demonstrates that the Dallas-Ft.
Worth metro area received much more in military contract funding than either Houston or San
Antonio. At the same time, there is no apparent divergence in employment across the metro areas.
One interpretation of this result is that spillover effects are very strong (that is, the Dallas-Ft. Worth
area lifted Houston and San Antonio) and this is why all three metropolitan areas comoved.
Alternatively, aggregate employment multipliers for government spending could be small. That
is, there was simply a reallocation of jobs from Dallas to Ft. Worth. But it is also possible that
neither Houston nor San Antonio are good cities to serve as a control group. There could be
potentially confounding factors that attenuate differences and result in understated multipliers. For
example, Houston benefited from the post-2001 era of high oil prices while San Antonio could
have grown faster because it was a smaller city. In this case, Dallas-Ft.Worth would have declined
without the shock and the comovement with Houston and San Antonio could be consistent with
strong localized multipliers.
        This case study highlights that DOD spending shocks have positive multipliers but the
effects are heterogeneous across space and industries. We observe that places proximate to the
location with the shock tend to do better than more distance places. Industries connected to the
“shocked” industry likely experience stronger growth via backward linkages and other industries
can grow faster via general equilibrium effects. It is also clear that finding a proper control group
for large cities is challenging, making a more systematic econometric methodology necessary. We
thus move on to describe our approach to taking advantage of this rich source of spending variation
and outcomes.



5. Empirical Specification and Methodology

Our baseline econometric specification builds on the approach in Auerbach and Gorodnichenko
(2013) and Nakamura and Steinsson (2014). In particular, we start with the following specification

        𝑌𝑌ℓ,𝑡𝑡+ℎ − 𝑌𝑌ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1      𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡+ℎ − 𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1
                            = 𝛽𝛽                     + 𝛼𝛼ℓ + 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖ℓ𝑡𝑡 ,                          (1)
               𝑌𝑌ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1                 𝑌𝑌ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1

                                                                                                       14
where ℓ, t and ℎ index locations (cities), time, and horizon, 𝑌𝑌 is an outcome variable (output,
employment, etc.), G is military spending, and 𝛼𝛼ℓ and 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 are location and time fixed effects.
Normalization of government spending changes will vary depending on the outcome variable. The
coefficient of interest, 𝛽𝛽, represents the local DOD spending multiplier: the dollar amount of output
produced by a dollar of local DOD spending.
            We augment specification (1) in several dimensions. First, we examine spillover effects
of aggregate government spending in one location on aggregate outcomes in other locations.
Second, we consider local and spillover outcomes across industries as well. In this most detailed
analysis, the augmented specification is

            𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡+ℎ − 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1      𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡+ℎ − 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1      𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡+ℎ − 𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1
                                      = 𝛽𝛽                           + 𝛾𝛾                             + 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖,ℓ + 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 ,   (2)
                     𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1                    𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1                     𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1

where 𝑖𝑖 indexes industries, 𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 is a measure of spending in other industries/locations, and 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖,ℓ is
the industry×location fixed effect.
             To quantify the size of spillovers, we construct several measures of 𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 . First, when we
examine cross-industry spillovers in a given location, we consider two measures of 𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 :

                           (1)
                       𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 = � 𝜔𝜔𝑗𝑗→𝑖𝑖 × 𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗,ℓ,𝑡𝑡
                                       𝑗𝑗

                           (2)
                       𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 = � (1 − 𝜔𝜔𝑗𝑗→𝑖𝑖 ) × 𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗,ℓ,𝑡𝑡
                                       𝑗𝑗


                                                                                    (1)
where 𝜔𝜔𝑗𝑗→𝑖𝑖 is the direct input requirement of industry 𝑖𝑖 for industry 𝑗𝑗. 9 𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 captures direct
                                    (2)
backward linkage effects, while 𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 captures “general equilibrium” effects. Direct input
requirements come from BEA’s 2016 Input-Output tables (75 industries).
            Second, when we investigate geographical spillovers, we consider:

                          (3)
                       𝐺𝐺�ℓ,𝑡𝑡 = � 𝑑𝑑(ℓ′ , ℓ) × 𝐺𝐺ℓ′ ,𝑡𝑡
                                       ℓ′




                            (2)
9
    When we calculate 𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 , we set 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖→𝑖𝑖 = 1 because we include 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 as a separate regressor to isolate GE effects.

                                                                                                                                        15
where 𝑑𝑑(ℓ′ , ℓ) is a weight that depends on the distance between locations ℓ′ and ℓ. We explore
several functional forms for 𝑑𝑑(ℓ′ , ℓ). For instance, we consider 𝑑𝑑(ℓ′ , ℓ) = [𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(ℓ′ , ℓ)]−1
and 𝑑𝑑(ℓ′ , ℓ) = 1 if ℓ′ is the nearest-neighbor city to city ℓ and zero otherwise.
             Third, when we analyze cross-industry/location spillovers, we utilize:

                               (4)
                           𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 = � � 𝜔𝜔𝑗𝑗→𝑖𝑖 × 𝑑𝑑(ℓ′ , ℓ) × 𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗,ℓ′ ,𝑡𝑡
                                        𝑗𝑗    ℓ′

                               (5)
                           𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 = � � (1 − 𝜔𝜔𝑗𝑗→𝑖𝑖 ) × 𝑑𝑑(ℓ′ , ℓ) × 𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗,ℓ′ ,𝑡𝑡
                                        𝑗𝑗    ℓ′


          (4)            (5)
where 𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 and 𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 have the same “backward linkage” and “general equilibrium” interpretations
                                                             (1)            (2)
as those for the local industry spillovers 𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 and 𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 .
             Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) estimate specification (1) and its variants using an
instrumental variable (IV) approach where the instrument is constructed as in Bartik (1994). That
      𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡+ℎ −𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1                               𝑠𝑠ℓ ×(𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡+ℎ −𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡−1 )
is,                         is instrumented with                                where 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 is aggregate government spending
           𝑌𝑌ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1                                           𝑌𝑌ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1

and 𝑠𝑠ℓ is the average share of location ℓ in total government spending over a relevant time period.
Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) use this instrument to address potential endogeneity of
government spending due to political factors in determining military spending and measurement
error. While these sources of endogeneity are certainly possible in our more disaggregate setting,
we use the Bartik instrument chiefly for another reason.
             We are interested in the effects of government spending – that is, new goods and services
provided by contractors to the government. Many contracts, however, represent not only payment
for new production but also payment for production that would have occurred anyway, either
because the specific contract was anticipated or because firms smooth production over lumpy
contracts. For example, assume that Boeing correctly forecasts the average airplane orders over
the next three years. The timing of a contract simply represents the moment they receive cash (or
promises of future cash payments) but does not correspond to actual new production. For Boeing,
the contract represents a “wealth transfer” rather than an exchange for a new service. 10 Such a
contract should have little or no effect on income/employment/production.


10
   The term “wealth transfer” here is the government-to-firm analog of the county-to-country use of the term in the
international context (e.g., Gourinchas, Rey, and Truempler 2012). An alternative term with similar meaning is “non-

                                                                                                                        16
                                                                  𝑊𝑊        𝑃𝑃              𝑊𝑊
         More formally, consider Δ𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡 ≡ 𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡 − 𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1 = Δ𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡 + Δ𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡 , where Δ𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡 is a “wealth”
transfer (i.e., the “timing” component in the Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2016) classification)
       𝑃𝑃                                                                                      𝑊𝑊
and Δ𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡 induces new production (i.e., the “level” and “identity” components). By mixing Δ𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡
       𝑃𝑃
and Δ𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡 , we are likely to have a downward bias in the size of the multiplier to government
spending shocks. One strategy to remove this bias is to use information about contracts to
                        𝑊𝑊          𝑃𝑃
narratively separate Δ𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡 and Δ𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡 , which is a big task given the sheer volume and heterogeneity
                                                                                𝑃𝑃
of contracts. Another strategy is to find a variable that is correlated with Δ𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡 and uncorrelated
        𝑊𝑊
with Δ𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡 and use this variable as an instrument for Δ𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡 .
         The Bartik instrument effectively provides such a filter: aggregate DOD spending
                                                                         𝑠𝑠ℓ ×(𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 +ℎ−𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡−1 )
represents new production of goods and services and thus                                          picks up only spending-
                                                                                𝑌𝑌ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1
                      𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡+ℎ −𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1
related changes in                         and filters out the wealth transfers (including anticipated contracts).
                           𝑌𝑌ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1

In other words, the Bartik instrument helps us to isolate the component of contracts that
corresponds to new production by relating location-specific contracts to changes in aggregate
production/spending. Figure 1 demonstrates that national DOD spending changes correspond to
changes in new production of goods and services as measured by the NIPA. As to the geography
variation that the instrument provides, Table 2 shows the average shares of defense spending for
the cities that receive the largest shares of military spending, in absolute terms and as a share of
local income. Intuitively, 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 is largely driven by “level” shocks while 𝑠𝑠ℓ captures the “identity”
component. In summary, the Bartik instrument is the predicted change in local spending based on
changes in national spending and therefore isolates new production from wealth transfers.
         An alternative to using a Bartik instrument is to examine local spending changes over
longer time horizons. Persistent long-term changes in government spending are more likely to
represent new orders for goods and services than are temporary or short-term changes. Consider
again the Boeing example. A six-year increase in contract allocations will likely induce additional
production over that time period, while a quarterly increase could easily be offset by decrease in
contracts in subsequent quarters, which Boeing likely anticipates and smooths production over.




flow adjustments” (Obstfeld 2012). More generally, we use the term to refer to any exchange or transfer of assets that
is not associated with additional production.

                                                                                                                      17
An advantage of the Bartik approach over using long-horizon spending changes is that Bartik
approach preserves a longer time series dimension of the data.
              It is straightforward to tailor this instrument to specification (2).                                           Specifically,
𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡+ℎ −𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1                           𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖,ℓ ×(𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡+ℎ −𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡−1 )
                           is instrumented with                                where 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖,ℓ is the average share of industry 𝑖𝑖
      𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1                                          𝑌𝑌ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1

                                                                                          𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡+ℎ −𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1
location ℓ in total government spending. In a similar spirit,                                                          is instrumented with
                                                                                                 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1

𝑠𝑠̃ 𝑖𝑖,ℓ ×(𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡+ℎ −𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡−1 )
                              where 𝑠𝑠̃𝑖𝑖,ℓ is heuristically the average share of aggregate government spending in
        𝑌𝑌ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1

industries/locations, appropriately weighted, e.g., by (1 − 𝜔𝜔𝑗𝑗→𝑖𝑖 ) and 𝑑𝑑(ℓ′ , ℓ)) that are connected
to industry 𝑖𝑖 in location ℓ.
              Note that because the error term in specifications (1) and (2) is likely to be correlated across
industries and locations, we cluster standard errors by state. We experimented with alternative
approaches to compute sampling uncertainty in the estimated multipliers and found that clustering
by state provides conservative standard errors.



6. Effects of Local Defense Spending

We now present our results, examining the effects of defense spending on city-level total and
industry-level output and on neighboring regions’ output, in the aggregate and by industry. To
build a perspective, we start with the analysis of local multipliers and then investigate spillover
effects. Our baseline specification employs the instrumental variable approach described in the
previous section.



A. Employment, Earnings, and GDP Multipliers

In a first pass at the data, we use specification (1) to estimate fiscal multipliers at the city level for
employment, earnings and GDP. Using our instrumental variable approach, we find (Panel B,
Table 3) that an increase in DOD spending by a percent of local earnings causes local employment
to increase by 0.19 percent 11 and earnings to increase by 0.32 percent on impact. And while

11
   To estimate responses of employment to military spending shocks, we use percent change of employment growth
as the dependent variable in specification (1) and change in military spending normalized by earnings as the regressor
in specification (1).

                                                                                                                                        18
earnings for workers (both new hires and incumbents) increase by 32 cents for every dollar of
DOD spending, total value added in the city increases by roughly a dollar. The estimates are
similar whether based on one-year multipliers or the multiplier effects of longer-horizon changes
in DOD spending on long-horizon output (rows labeled 2-year multiplier and 4-year multiplier).
Note that these estimates (and all other estimates in the tables) are based on (instrumented) changes
in DOD spending through horizon ℎ (0 or 2 or 4 in the table), so the denominator for the multiplier
estimates includes changes in DOD spending over the full horizon. 12 Given the stability of
estimates across different horizons, we will focus on one-year (“impact”) multipliers in the
remainder of the paper. We also observe that the instruments are generally strong with the first-
stage F-statistic being comfortably well above 10.
         To put these figures in context, the employee compensation share of each dollar of
industry-level output is approximately $0.30 (based on averages over industries of compensation
shares provided in the BEA input-output tables). The remainder is allocated to intermediate inputs
($0.50) and gross operating surplus ($0.20). Therefore, in the absence of any spillovers or general
equilibrium effects, one would expect a highly localized value-added (GDP) multiplier of
approximately $0.50. The fact that the point estimate of the city-level multiplier exceeds unity
implies potentially substantial within-location positive spillovers. The city-level GDP multiplier
is smaller than state-level estimates (e.g., Nakamura and Steinsson), which is suggestive of positive
geographic spillovers as well.
         The OLS estimates (Panel A) are uniformly lower than the IV estimates, potentially
reflecting endogeneity of government spending but also potentially demonstrating the importance
of the Bartik instrument in capturing the component of local contracts that corresponds to ramp-
ups and ramp-downs in actual spending. Consistent with the notion that longer-horizon spending
changes contain a larger share of actual production increases (rather than wealth transfers), the
OLS coefficients are increasing with the time horizon.
         We view these results as largely consistent with the results reported in previous studies.
For example, our estimates imply that $100,000 in Department of Defense contracts generates 0.84
(s.e. 0.24) year-jobs. This magnitude is in line with Chodorow-Reich (2018) reporting a range


12
   Recall that we distribute outlays over the length of contracts, so that, even if a locality receives only one contract
during a period of several quarters or years, there will typically be a change in measured spending over several periods
after the initial contract date.

                                                                                                                     19
from 0.76 to 3.80 year-jobs estimated on variation due to the 2009 American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act (ARRA). While comparing these figures, one should bear in mind that our
sample covers many years of economic expansion in the United States and that the ARRA
spending happened during one of the worst recessions which, according to the logic in Auerbach
and Gorodnichenko (2012), likely resulted in higher job growth per a given amount of government
spending during the period when ARRA was implemented. The size of the GDP multiplier is also
broadly in agreement with estimates provided in earlier studies, although our estimate tends to be
on the lower side of the available estimates which are typically close to 1.5. However, it should
be kept in mind that, in estimating city-level GDP multipliers, we are not yet incorporating the
spillover effects in nearby locations, which, as reported below, increase estimated multipliers over
larger geographical areas consistent with those used in other studies.


B. Geographic Spillovers

How does DOD spending spill out geographically to neighboring cities? We address this question
first by examining fiscal effects across cities within states. 13 To determine the effect of spending
on output in surrounding cities, we estimate “outflow” effects:

         𝑌𝑌�ℓ,𝑡𝑡 − 𝑌𝑌�ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1             𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡 − 𝐺𝐺ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1
                             = 𝛽𝛽 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜                   + 𝛼𝛼ℓ + 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖ℓ,𝑡𝑡                            (3)
                𝑌𝑌�ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1                      𝑌𝑌�ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1

where 𝑌𝑌�ℓ,𝑡𝑡 is output in other cities in the same state as city 𝑙𝑙. We find that a dollar of spending in
a city increases earnings and GDP in other cities in the state (the “outflow” effect) by between
$0.42 and $0.60 (Table 4, columns 3 and 4); that is, the outflow effect is between a half and a
whole of the within-city effect. Combining the local and outflow effects of DOD spending on
GDP (1.05 plus 0.42) yields a total within-state effect of approximately 1.5, which is similar to
state-level multiplier estimates from the literature (see, e.g., Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) for
DOD spending effects and Chodorow-Reich (2018) for a metastudy of state-level effects of other
forms of fiscal stimulus). Therefore, net effects on nearby localities are quite substantial.


13
  While we consider neighboring cities only within states, our findings that the magnitude of spillovers decline sharply
with distance suggests that extending the analysis to include cross-state spillovers would have little impact on the
pattern.

                                                                                                                    20
         Of course, these benefits are spread out across localities, and the outflow effect may be
uninformative to residents of a locality that are interested in how they will be affected by spending
elsewhere in the state. To this end, we also estimate what we refer to as “inflow” effects: the effect
of a dollar of spending in other cities in the state on an observed city:

         𝑌𝑌ℓ,𝑡𝑡 − 𝑌𝑌ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1           𝐺𝐺�ℓ,𝑡𝑡 − 𝐺𝐺�ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1
                           = 𝛾𝛾 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                     + 𝛼𝛼ℓ + 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖ℓ,𝑡𝑡 .                          (4)
               𝑌𝑌ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1                     𝑌𝑌ℓ,𝑡𝑡−1

Table 4 (columns 1 and 2) suggests that inflow effects are meaningful but not particularly large,
with larger point estimates of inflow effects on GDP (0.020) than point estimates of inflow effects
on earnings (0.007). 14
         To what extent do spillover effects depend on distance? To address this question, for each
city in our sample and for different distance categories (less than 50 miles, between 50 and 100
miles, etc.) we identify a “neighbor” city that is of roughly equal size (within 10 percent) and,
more specifically, the closest to the city in terms of size and distance within that distance category.
We then estimate how spending in the observation city affects earnings in neighbor cities. A
neighbor city within 50 miles of the source city receives a substantial benefit of approximately half
of the benefit of the home city (a multiplier of 0.136 in column 2 of Table 5 compared to a
multiplier of 0.306 in column 1 of Table 5). These spillover effects dissipate rather rapidly. Point
estimates of multipliers reach zero for neighbors that are over 50 miles from the source city
(columns 3, 4 and 5). 15
         These estimates suggest that DOD spending positively affects nearby locations,
particularly those that are closest in proximity. There is no evidence that DOD spending in a city
systematically reduces output in other localities. This finding is consistent with extant evidence
of positive fiscal spillovers across geographies (e.g., Dupor and McCrory 2018) and motivates an
exploration of cross-industry spillovers to determine whether there are any local crowding-out
effects of DOD spending.


14
   Note that there is no necessary relationship between the sizes of estimated inflow and outflow effects. For example,
if spending shocks occur in a small number of cities, the average outflow effect of these shocks may be large but the
inflow effects for the typical city may be small. This may be especially true if spillovers occur over a very small
geographic area, affecting only a small number of other locations.
15
   The number of observations in each sample varies based on the number of identifiable neighbor cities for each
distance category.

                                                                                                                   21
C. Multipliers by Size and Gravity

The positive estimates of geographic spillovers suggest that fiscal multipliers are increasing in the
size of the geographical unit of observation. Consistent with this notion, Demyanyk et al. (2018)
find that city-level multipliers 16 are larger than county-level multipliers (and smaller than estimates
of state-level multipliers from the literature). Here we directly examine how fiscal multipliers vary
with city size. To do so, we assign size based on cities’ average income over the sample. The size
distribution is heavily right-tailed (skewness is 8.5), reflecting a small number (approximately
10%) of exceptionally large cities with size between 10 and 300 times the median size. 17
           We find that among cities in the mass of the distribution, there is little detectable
relationship between city size and fiscal multipliers. However, cities at the upper end of the size
distribution have much larger multipliers than other cities (Table 6). The estimated multiplier for
cities in the top decile of the distribution is 0.75 (column 2), and the multiplier for cities in the top
5% of the distribution is 1.35 (column 3). 18



D. Industry Spillovers and Crowding Out

To what extent does local industry-level spending affect output, both for industries that receive the
spending and for other local industries? To address this question we turn to city-industry-level




16
     Recall that cities encompass metropolitan areas, not simply the central cities themselves.
17
 Median income of cities in the bottom decile of the size distribution is roughly 1/4 of median income for the sample,
while median income of cities in the top size decile is 21 times the sample median.
18
   The evidence of positive spillovers and size-dependent multipliers implies that locations benefit from proximity to
locations that receive DOD spending. An open question is whether the inverse is true. Does a recipient city benefit
from proximity to other cities? In other words, are multipliers higher in cities that are isolated or in cities surrounded
by economic activity? Proximity could be expected to lead to higher or lower multipliers. Subcontractors in nearby
cities may compete with subcontractors in locations that receive the DOD spending, thereby dampening local income
effects. But nearby cities may also provide necessary inputs into production of local contractors, especially when
recipient locations do not produce such inputs locally. Nearby cities may also increase local multipliers through
consumption effects, with DOD spending in a recipient location inducing higher spending in a nearby city, which may
have a second-round positive effect on the recipient location. To explore the effects of proximity, we derived a city-
specific measure of nearby economic activity by summing income (discounted by distance) across other cities. We
found that, conditional on city size, multipliers appear to be slightly larger in the presence of nearby economic activity.
We conjecture that a more detailed exploration of this issue would be a fruitful avenue for future research.

                                                                                                                       22
data on spending and income. To disentangle direct effect from spillover effects, we create three
measures of DOD spending.
         The first measure is direct spending from the DOD on goods produced by an industry. This
measure yields an estimate of the value added by the local industry’s workers (if using the earnings
measure) and capital (when examining GDP). Estimates of multipliers from this measure are
comparable to the impact multipliers in Table 3, the differences being due to the use of industry-
city observations rather than city observations aggregated across industries.
         The second measure is indirect DOD spending on that industry based on input requirements
                                                                                              (1)
of other industries in that location that receive DOD spending (i.e., measure 𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 ). This measure
yields an estimate of the local sourcing for DOD contracts and is analogous to estimates of
backward linkages previously explored in the context of foreign direct investment (e.g.,
Gorodnichenko, Svejnar, and Terrell 2014). An estimate of zero would imply that industries
source intermediate inputs almost exclusively from other locations, as would be expected in a
world with no trade costs, while positive estimates signal the importance of local sourcing.
         The third measure is total DOD spending in other industries, net of input requirements for
                                         (2)
the observed industry (i.e., measure 𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 ). This measure yields an estimate of what we interpret
as general equilibrium effects, which include indirect effects such as reallocation of production
factors or positive demand externalities other than through direct backward linkages. 19
         We report results in Table 7 for labor income and GDP. All estimates are for one-year (i.e.,
impact) multipliers. Direct effects of industry-level spending are strong (columns 1 and 5 of Table
7) yet slightly lower than city-level effects (Table 3), consistent with positive spillovers across
industries within a city. Columns 2 and 6 yield direct estimates of spillovers through intermediate
input backward linkages. These estimates are of similar magnitudes to the direct effect, indicating
strong local sourcing. The large positive estimate indicates that local backward linkages is an
important source of positive across-industry spillovers.
         While backward linkages are by definition associated with non-negative spillovers,
production in one industry can have negative effects on other industries through general

19
   Although there is no obvious scaling to use in computing general equilibrium effects, this lack of scaling for the
variable should be kept in mind when comparing the coefficients for this spillover effect and the one based on
backward production linkages. A one-dollar shock to the production linkage variable would have a one-dollar spillover
if the affected industry satisfies all of the increased input demand of the shocked industry. But a one-dollar shock’s
effect on other industries simply depends on the shock’s overall general equilibrium effects.

                                                                                                                  23
equilibrium effects, including through the reallocation of local factors of production. The third
spending measure, spending in other industries net of backward linkages, allows us to estimate the
sign and magnitude of these general equilibrium effects. The results indicate (column 3) that such
effects are on average positive for income (perhaps operating through income multipliers) although
small in magnitude. The GDP estimates (column 7), which are based on far fewer observations
(given the limited coverage of city-level GDP data), are too noisy to detect general equilibrium
effects. Overall, we find no evidence of DOD spending crowding out non-recipient industries.
Rather, we detect crowding in of earnings, both through input linkages and through general
equilibrium effects.


E. Industry/Geography Spillovers

As a final attempt to uncover effects of crowding out or crowding in, we examine industry-level
spillover effects across locations, combining the two spillover dimensions already considered. To
do so, we construct a summary measure of industry-level spending in nearby cities within a
specified distance from the observation city. Specifically, for each city, we examine total industry-
level spending within a 50-mile radius, between 50 and 100 miles, and between 100 and 150 miles
respectively. Using the industry-level measures of nearby spending, we then construct measures
                                        (4)
of backward linkages (i.e., measure 𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 ) and spending in other industries net backward linkages
                  (5)
(i.e., measure 𝐺𝐺�𝑖𝑖,ℓ,𝑡𝑡 ) in the same manner as we did for the within-city industry-level analysis.
        First consider the direct effects of nearby same-industry spending (column 1 of Table 8).
One would a priori expect such spending to be the most likely avenue for crowding out, since
factors of production are likely strong substitutes across short distances within industries. We find
that the effects of nearby spending on same-industry local income is generally positive, although
small as expected. 20
        Spending in other nearby industries that is associated with backward linkages also has
positive local effects. Consistent with the presence of transportation costs, these effects dissipate
with distance (estimates fall from Panel A to Panel B to Panel C in column 2 of Table 8). The
GDP estimates are too noisy (on account of far fewer data points) to identify precise effects.

20
   The only evidence of negative spillovers is in the effect of spending 100 to 150 miles away on local same-industry
GDP (column 5, Panel B).

                                                                                                                 24
         Finally, general equilibrium effects appear to be positive if anything. Nearby spending in
other unrelated industries positively affects a local industry (columns 3 and 7 of Table 8). In general,
these effects also dissipate with distance, consistent with the presence of transportation costs.
         To summarize the industry-level evidence, we find that DOD spending in an industry in a
location exhibits positive spillovers to other industries in that location. These spillovers include
both demand for intermediate inputs (backward linkages) and general equilibrium spillovers such
as through income multipliers. There is no evidence of a net crowding out of other local industries.
That is, we do not find support for the hypothesis in Cohen, Coval, and Malloy (2011) that
government spending crowds out local employment. Even when we isolate the component of
spending that has no direct benefits to other local industries, we detect crowding-in rather than
crowding-out of employment in other local industries.
         Turning to industry-level income in other locations, we again find little evidence that local
spending in an industry crowds out production, either in the same industry in nearby locations or
in other industries. Both the same industry and other industries in nearby locations appear to
benefit, although these benefits are small in magnitude. The same-industry year-on-year benefits
are potentially due to agglomeration effects, which are typically assumed to operate over longer
time horizons. The benefits across industries across space are due to backward linkages and
general equilibrium effects that are likely similar to the forces that benefit other industries in the
same location. 21




21
   Our body of evidence suggests that the economy features slack (and hence private activity is not crowded out by
public purchases) on average over the business cycle. A natural follow-up question is whether multipliers are higher
during periods of higher slack. Even if multipliers are slack-dependent, detecting this dependence in our setting is
challenging due to the fact that slack is endogenous to government spending, especially at the annual frequency: if
government spending is effective, then measured slack is low. The literature using subnational variation generally
finds state-dependent multiplies although there is variation across studies (see Chodorow-Reich, 2018). Consistent
with this literature, we found that multipliers are substantially higher for cities experiencing unemployment above the
25th percentile level. We did not find evidence that the strength of multipliers increases much as slack increases
beyond the 25th percentile (Appendix Table 1). One interpretation of these results is that multipliers are high when
there is some slack, but beyond that the amount of slack doesn’t matter (perhaps short-run aggregate supply curves
are relatively flat and rapidly steepen only as the economy approaches capacity). The fact that the threshold level of
unemployment is around the 25th percentile suggests that multipliers on average are high and don’t lead to crowding
out. This is consistent with our industry-level results that, on average (across the business cycle) there is no systematic
evidence of crowding out.

                                                                                                                       25
7. Interpretation and Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we have estimated local fiscal multipliers and spillovers for the United States using
a rich dataset based on U.S. Department of Defense contracts and a variety of outcome variables
relating to income and employment. Such data are especially useful for estimating the effects of
fiscal policy, because defense spending is a large component of government spending and likely
independent at the national level from short-run economic conditions. We use an instrumental
variable approach to address potential identification issues with respect to the timing.
        Our evidence points to strong positive spillovers, both within and across locations. For
example, a dollar of government spending in a city increases income in neighboring cities by as
much as half of the extent to which it increases own-city income. These benefits, while large, appear
to dissipate fairly quickly with distance. By summing over within-city and rest-of-state effects, we
obtain a state-level multiplier of approximately 1.5. This estimate is similar in magnitude to prior
estimates of state-level multipliers (e.g., Nakamura and Steinsson 2014) but is obtained by estimating
the state-wide effect of a city-level shock rather than the effect of a state-wide shock.
        A unique feature of our study is that, by examining demand shocks at the detailed industry-
location level, we are able to examine spillover channels as well as magnitudes. Both backward
linkages and general equilibrium effects (e.g., income multipliers) contribute to the positive
spillovers. We find no evidence that government spending in an industry/location crowds out
income in other local industries or in other locations. These findings are contrary to conventional
wisdom and the predictions of neoclassical theory. On the other hand, our evidence points to the
relevance of Keynesian-type models that feature excess capacity, either at the firm level or the
level of individual workers. These models even appear relevant for low-frequency (annual)
demand shocks, suggesting that excess capacity could be more than a temporary phenomenon.
        Our evidence is corroborated by a number of indirect pieces of evidence. First, models of
excess capacity can explain the otherwise puzzling evidence that national government spending
shocks do not appear to cause interest rates to rise (Murphy and Walsh 2017). Second, our evidence
of positive general equilibrium effects is consistent with evidence that government spending either
increases consumption or does not decrease it in a meaningful way (e.g., Hall 2009). While some
models can explain rising consumption, they typically also predict rising interest rates in response
to government spending shocks (e.g., Leeper, Traum, and Walker 2017). Models of excess capacity
can simultaneously explain a negligible interest rate effect and rising consumption.

                                                                                                   26
         In addition to informing the strength of geographical spillovers, our evidence informs the
size of the closed-economy national multiplier. Channels through which national multipliers
decline relative to local multipliers include the reallocation of production factors, interest rate
channels, and negative wealth effects due to higher future taxes. We find no evidence that
employment falls in areas or industries that don’t directly receive the spending. This finding
suggests that interest rate channels and even tax channels are potentially weak. Therefore, our
evidence points to regional multipliers being lower bounds for national multipliers (see Chodorow-
Reich 2018 for further discussion).
         Our study points to a number of directions for future research. As detailed data on defense
spending across countries becomes available, researchers can examine the relevance of national
borders on spillovers. Of particular interest would be an understanding of how spending by one
country increases income in neighboring countries and effects the spending country’s net asset
position. To what extent is the additional debt required for the spending offset by increased by
improvements in the current account through net exports to neighboring countries? Do the effects
depend on the size or wealth of the spending country, as predicted by models of excess capacity
and heterogeneous households/countries? 22
         In the meantime, the detailed U.S. Department of Defense data can inform us about a
number of relevant questions in macroeconomics. Do government spending shocks reduce excess
capacity at the firm-level? Or are firms hiring more workers or for longer hours? In other words,
does the excess capacity reside at the firm level (through labor hoarding, for example) or at the
worker level (in the form of unemployment or labor force nonparticipation)? Answers to these
questions are relevant for guiding estimates of potential output.




22
   Murphy (2017), for example, predicts that in the presence of excess capacity, temporary spending shocks by a rich
trading partner can have persistent and large effects on income for both the rich agent and its poorer trading partners.

Notes: The figure shows annual time series of various measures of U.S. Department of Defense spending. The black
solid line is “Intermediate goods and services purchased” in the BEA’s NIPA Table 3.11.5, “National Defense
Consumption Expenditures and Gross Investment by Type.” The blue, dashed line is the annual value of contracts
awarded by the U.S. Department of Defense that we observe in two databases (USASpenging.gov and fpds.gov). The
red, dotted line is the spending flow constructed from the two contract databases. For each multi-year contract, this
measure allocates funds uniformly between initiation and completion dates.

   Notes: The table reports multipliers for different outcome variables indicated in the first row of the table. The estimates
   are for specification (1) estimated using an instrumental variable approach. Department of Defense spending at a local
   level is instrumented as in Bartik (1994). The unit of observations is city/year. Standard errors clustered at the state
   level are in parentheses below each estimate. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10 percent, 5 percent, and 1
   percent levels. The sample in each regression is limited to the 383 CBSAs with non-missing GDP data.

Notes: The table reports estimated effects of local defense spending on labor earnings depending on the state of the local economy. The
state of the economy is measured with a set of dummy variables equal to one if the local unemployment rate is greater than or equal to
a given cut-off. Column (1) uses the 25th percentile as the cut-off; that is, the unemployment rate for a given location has to be greater
than or equal to the 75th percentile of unemployment rates observed for the location in our sample. Columns (2) through (4) use the 35th,
50th, and 75th percentiles respectively. 1(UR≥X percentile) denotes the dummy variable that is equal to one if the local unemployment
rate is greater than or equal to the Xth percentile. The unit of observation is CBSA×year. Standard errors clustered at the state level are
in parentheses below each estimate. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.
