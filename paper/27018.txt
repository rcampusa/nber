                                         ABSTRACT

Using the 2012-13 American Time Use Survey, I find that both who people spend time with and
how they spend it affect their happiness, adjusted for numerous demographic and economic
variables. Satisfaction among married individuals increases most with additional time spent with
spouse. Among singles, satisfaction decreases most as more time is spent alone. Assuming that
lock-downs constrain married people to spend time solely with their spouses, simulations show
that their happiness may have been increased compared to before the lock-downs; but sufficiently
large losses of work time and income reverse this inference. Simulations demonstrate clearly that,
assuming lock-downs impose solitude on singles, their happiness was reduced, reductions that are
made more severe by income and work losses.

      I.       Introduction

            By mid-April 2020, due to the coronavirus (CV) crisis over 90 percent of Americans and

over 1/3 of the world’s population were locked down, spending nearly their entire day in their

dwellings with only a spouse (if they have no children at home) or alone (if they lacked both spouse

and children).1 We do not know how their well-being—their happiness—has been affected by the

constraint imposed upon them by government restrictions. We can, however, use existing data on

the link between well-being and the identity of those with whom people spend their time and how

they use their time to simulate the likely impacts of lockdowns on feelings of well-being.

            Research on the various impacts of the virus is unsurprisingly already burgeoning. Studies

of racial/ethnic differences in the incidence of the illness have been produced (Borjas, 2020), as

have estimates of its immediate effect on consumer spending (Baker et al., 2020). The most closely

related studies to this one examined the relation between lockdowns and the spread of the virus

(Fang et al., 2020, and Friedson et al., 2020) and their potential impact on GDP (Inoue and Todo,

2020); and on the potential magnitude of employment losses due to social distancing (Koren and

Peto, 2020). Here I examine the impacts on happiness by first in Section II linking the discussion

to consumer theory. Section III describes the data and samples used to study how different

relationships to the people with whom one spends time and what one does with time alter

happiness. Section IV presents sets of estimates based on these data. In Section V I report the

results of simulations of the likely impacts of lockdowns on well-being.

      II.      A Theoretical Consideration

            Neoclassical consumer theory has agents maximizing utility defined over goods/services.

Becker’s (1965) generalization of the theory re-defined the maximand as being over

                                                         1
“commodities”—home-produced combinations of purchased goods and the time inputs of

household members. The theory was extremely powerful, as differences in the price of time across

agents have allowed predictions about behavior that can be linked to observables.

       For many commodities one can also imagine that the consumer can choose with whom to

produce and consume the commodity. For example, the leisure activity, attending a sporting event,

could be produced alone, with one’s spouse/partner, with friend(s), or with a relative. Television-

watching similarly offers the choice of “who with.” In the category of home production, laundry

or house-cleaning are typically done alone or with one’s spouse/partner. Among other personal

activities, although information on whom they are accomplished with is not included in the data

set used here, sexual activity might be done alone, with spouse/partner or with a friend.

       These considerations suggest that an expansion of the theory might be useful, so that the

consumer’s maximand becomes:

           (1) U = U(Z1(X1, T1, W1), …, Zi(Xi, Ti, Wi),..., ZN(XN, TN, WN)),

where Zi is one of N commodities, Xi and Ti are the goods and time inputs into producing Zi, and

Wi is a vector of indicators of the identity(ies) of the individuals, if any, with whom Zi is produced.

I do not try to operationalize the theory here. To make it useful, one would need to identify “prices”

of the different choices of “who with” that vary across agents. Such “prices” might usefully be

related to some proxies for the closeness or lack thereof of relationships with people with whom

one might spend time. My only point here is that thinking about this extension is a reasonable

rationalization for the empirical work in this study. Like choices about spending time and

purchasing goods and services, “who with” is an outcome of consumer choice.

    III.       Data on “Who With” and Life Satisfaction

           The basic data used in what follows come from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS)

(produced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, discussed by Hofferth et al., 2018, with more

detail presented by Hamermesh et al., 2005). Respondents were individuals who had recently

(within 2-5 months, averaging 3 months) been included in the 8th wave of the monthly Current

Population Survey. In each year of its existence (beginning in 2003), in addition to tabulating the

amount of time that respondents had spent during the previous day in a very detailed classification

of activities (over 400), the ATUS asked people to record who they were with during many of the

activities. (Sleep was excluded from the “who-with” list, as were other personal activities and a

number of less frequent/lengthy activities.) While the quantities of time spent in various activities

in the ATUS have been analyzed many times (e.g., Hamermesh, 2019), the “who with” information

has received very little attention (with Flood and Genadek, 2016, being a rare exception).

           In 2012 and 2013 the ATUS fielded a Well-being Module, asking people questions about

their feelings, including for the purposes of this study a question asking them to “think about your

life in general” and rate their life satisfaction on a 10 (highest, “best possible life”) to 0 (lowest,

“worst possible life”) scale—a Cantril “well-being ladder”.2 The literature on life satisfaction is

immense, with Diener et al. (2010) a broad compendium of research, and Blanchflower and

Oswald (2018) a recent effort by economists. Various terms—life satisfaction, happiness and

subjective well-being—appear to be used more or less interchangeably in this literature. In much




2
 A Well-being Module was also included in the 2010 ATUS, which contained a happiness scale (as did the 2012 and
2013 modules) linked to 3 specific activities undertaken by each individual. That Module did not include the life-
satisfaction measure. I prefer to concentrate on life satisfaction, a broader measure based on general feelings, than on
happiness linked to single activities. The validity of the measures of "experiential well-being” was analyzed by Stone
et al. (2018). They were used by Connelly and Kimmel (2015) to examine how “who with”—time spent with
children—alters men’s and women’s happiness differently.


                                                           3
of this study, to save space I refer to this well-being measure as “happiness,” recognizing the

possible differences between life satisfaction and current happiness.

        We know (Abraham et al., 2006) that those included in the ATUS are not observationally

different from those who were asked to complete a diary (were in their 8th CPS month). In the 2012

and 2013 rounds of the ATUS 23,657 people kept time diaries. Of these, 21,589 completed the

well-being ladder. There is no statistically significant difference between the demographic

characteristics of the less than 10 percent of the samples used here who did not complete the well-

being ladder and those of the large majority who did.3

        I classify the usable observations by their marital status, distinguishing between those

listing themselves as married with spouse present, and singles—those who list themselves as

widow/ers, divorced or never married. Because time use and “who with” differ between those

people with children in the home (who may during the CV crisis be locked down with their

parents), I focus the analyses on married individuals with no children under age 18.4 I also restrict

the sample to single individuals with no children under 18 who are age 30 or over (to exclude

many of those who may be living with roommates or cohabiting, or who are single parents). With

these restrictions the married—no children group contains 4,710 respondents, and the singles

group includes 6,848 individuals. I am thus examining the behavior of slightly more than half the

available sample and implicitly in Section V simulating the average impacts of the lockdowns on

around half the U.S. adult population.




3
 This included the absence of any gender difference in this probability. The main, mechanical difference was that
completion rate of the well-being ladder was much lower among respondents in the January waves of the ATUS than
in other waves..
4
 Also having children present very likely alters feelings about spending time with a spouse, as
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5s433aTy98 suggests.

                                                       4
            The information on “who with” is collected in over 20 categories, ranging from spouse

through more distant relatives, friends, different types of other people standing in various

relationships to the respondent, and being alone. I aggregate this information into 5 categories:

Alone; with friends; with other people; with other (non-spouse) relatives, or with spouse, with the

last obviously not relevant in the sample of singles.

            The distributions of “who with” in the samples are reported in the upper part of Table 1,

for each sample and then for sub-samples distinguished by gender.5 For each category the table

lists the minutes spent on a representative day and its standard deviation. Also included is the total

amount of time per day for which “who with” is accounted and the age of respondents in each

group. In both samples the average respondent is in his/her 50s—among married respondents,

because I exclude those with young children, among singles because people under age 30 are

excluded. Married individuals classify whom they were with during about 51 percent of the day,

about one hour more than is classified by single individuals. In both samples, women classify

slightly less of their time as to whom they were with, a larger difference among singles than among

married respondents.

            Married individuals report about 4-1/2 daily hours together with a spouse (remembering

that time sleeping is not included in these reports). That the married men and women are from

separate couples (the ATUS includes only one respondent per household) explains the small (and

statistically insignificant) gender difference in reported time with spouse. The other major category

of “who with” is time spent alone, about 4-1/2 hours per day, with men reporting significantly

more such time (about 10 minutes/day) than women. The other categories account for much less




5
    These descriptive statistics and all the regression estimates use ATUS sampling weights.

                                                            5
time, about 1/2 hour with friends (no gender difference), 2-1/4 hours with other people

(significantly more by men) and about 1/2 hour with other relatives (significantly more by women).

          Among single individuals ages 30+ time spent alone accounts more than half of the over

11 daily hours for which respondents list with whom they are spending time, with men reporting

slightly less time alone. About 2-1/2 hours are spent with other people (more by men), 1-1/2 hours

with other relatives (more by women) and 1 hour with friends (more by men). All of these gender

differences are statistically significant.

          The bottom part of Table 1 displays the distributions of responses on the well-being ladder.

As is standard in the literature, the majority of respondents say they are quite satisfied with their

lives, with 33 percent (single men) being the largest fraction in any group reporting themselves as

being in the bottom part of the ladder (life satisfaction below 6). Married individuals report greater

well-being than singles, and within each sample women report greater well-being than men.

Neither difference is standardized for other demographic characteristics, and there is at least some

disagreement in the literature about the direction of any married-single difference in happiness

(e.g., Knabe et al., 2010; Gimenez-Nadal and Molina, 2015).

    IV.      Impacts of “Who With” and “How” of Time on Happiness
          There are major demographic differences within each sample and sub-sample that are

likely to relate to happiness and to how and with whom people spend time. If nothing else we know

that there is an inverse-U shaped relationship between age and time spent working for pay; well-

known gender and racial/ethnic differences in the allocation of time across activities; differences

by educational attainment, geography and day of the week and month of the year (Hamermesh,

2019). I begin to account for these differences by estimating for each sample linear regressions

describing the 0-1 variable Happy (score on the well-being ladder of 8 or above, which accounts

for 56 percent of the married sample and 42 percent of the sample of singles). Initially I include

                                                   6
only those control variables that were determined long before the day the diary was kept: Age,

educational attainment, immigrant status, race/ethnicity, state of residence, and day of the week,

month and year. Age is included as a vector of indicators of individual years; educational

attainment is specified as a vector of 21 different levels of education; race/ethnicity is divided into

five groups, and each state has its own indicator.6

         A. Main Results

         I present these initial estimates in Columns (1) and (4) of Table 2. In each case the

parameter estimates show the impact of an additional 100 minutes of time spent in the manner

indicated. In the married sample (Column 1) time spent alone or with other relatives reduces levels

of happiness, while time spent with friends, other people or one’s spouse increases happiness. The

positive effects of time with spouse are statistically significant; and the impact of time with friends

approaches statistical significance.7 Overall, holding these demographic, geographic and temporal

measures constant, people’s choices of “who with” are highly significantly related to their

happiness.

         In the sample of single individuals (Column (4) of Table 2) spending more time alone has

a strongly significant negative impact on happiness. Additional time spent with other relatives,

friends and other people, the other three possibilities, have positive, albeit not statistically

significant effects on happiness. Taken together, the indicators of “who with” significantly affect

the happiness of single individuals.




6
 The vector of single year of age indicators only runs up through 80; in the ATUS anyone older is classified as being
age 85, presumably for reasons of confidentiality. Including this large vector is crucial in describing the happiness-
age relationship (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2018).

7
 Remembering that total time reported as “who with” differs within each sample, I re-estimated this equation (and
subsequent ones) holding total “who with” time constant. This re-specification did not qualitatively alter the results.


                                                          7
       One’s choices about “who with” depend in part upon “how” one spends time. For

examples, with more time working for pay it is likely that one will spend less time with one’s

spouse; with more time in home production one is less likely to spend time with friends. Given

these relationships, however, even if choosing how to spend time precedes with whom to spend it,

the choices may still be somewhat independent. Recognizing the endogeneity of the choices about

“who with” with respect to spending time, I add the vector of the six aggregates of time use to the

equations shown in Columns (1) and (4) (five measures because of the fixed amount of time in the

day, treating time spent in other leisure activities as the excluded category). I also add each

respondent’s usual weekly workhours, the household’s annual gross income and a vector of

indicators of the person’s class of worker (private or public, employed or self-employed). Given

that these are decided simultaneously with “who with,” I would expect their addition to the

specifications to reduce the estimated impacts of “who with” on happiness.

       Column (2) of Table 2 presents re-estimates of the equations describing happiness among

married individuals. The central conclusion is how little the estimated impacts of “who with”

change from Column (1). Except for time spent with other people, the results are quantitatively

similar to those produced without these additional covariates: Time with spouse has significant

positive impacts on happiness, as (nearly) does time with friends. As a whole the vector of “who

with” measures remains highly significant statistically. The estimated impacts are not huge, but

not tiny: For example, switching 100 minutes (of an average 276 minutes) from time alone to time

with one’s spouse raises the probability that one is “happy” (well-being ladder at least 8) by 2.1

percentage points (on a mean of 56.1 percent), adjusting for all the demographic, time use and

economic control variables included here.




                                                8
        Column (5) presents the same expanded specifications for the sample of single individuals.

Again, the inclusion of all these other controls does not alter the inferences about the impacts of

the “who with” measures. Two that had been insignificantly positive (time with friends, or with

other people) become insignificantly negative. Time spent with other relatives remains

insignificantly positive. Time alone remains highly significantly negative. The overall impact of

the “who with” measures on happiness is statistically significant. If one were to shift 63 minutes

of time with friends (the average in this sample) to time alone, the likelihood that the respondent

would state that s/he is happy drops by 0.7 percentage points (on a mean of 41.8 percent).

        The largest and most statistically significant estimated effects on life satisfaction among

the “who with” measures are of time spent with spouse in the sample of married people, and of

time alone in the sample of singles. Adding a quadratic term in time spent with spouse to the model

underlying Column (2) of Table 2, shows, as presented in Column (3), that the estimated effect of

the linear term becomes larger, while the quadratic term is negative and nearly significant

statistically. While the marginal impact on happiness of an additional minute spent with a spouse

does decrease, only for 6 percent of the sample does it become negative.8

        In the sample of singles, adding a quadratic term in time spent alone increases the (absolute

value) of the linear effect, and the quadratic effect is positive but not statistically significant. The

maximum time alone in this sample is 720 minutes; but even if it were 1439 minutes, spending the

last minute of the day alone would still further reduce life satisfaction (albeit barely). Taken

together, these results provide some evidence that, as makes sense for the other arguments in the




8
 This result belies the greeting of the fictional economists’ Valentine’s Day card, “The marginal returns of spending
time with you will never diminish.”


                                                         9
Zi in (1), the second derivatives with respect to the Wi have signs opposite those of the first

derivatives; but the impacts of these nonlinearities on happiness are not large in these samples.

       I base the simulations in the next Section on the estimates that include the quadratic terms.

Because lockdowns may also alter how people spend time, probably reducing work time for some

people; and because they may also reduce some people’s incomes, in Columns (1) and (3) Table

3 presents the descriptive statistics of these measures that were also included in the equations. The

estimates of their impacts on happiness are shown in Columns (2) and (4). Sleep and TV-watching

account for exactly half of all time spent by the married individuals with no children, and over half

of the representative day among singles. The estimated impacts of these variables on happiness

show that additional time spent in these two activities reduces happiness (in most instances

statistically significantly) compared to the excluded activity, time spent in other leisure activities.

       While paid work on the diary day has small negative and statistically insignificant impacts

on happiness, having a longer usual workweek significantly increases happiness. Moreover, even

accounting for all the demographic control variables and for both how and with whom people

spend their time, people with higher incomes are significantly happier than those with lower

incomes. The estimated effects of differences in income are large: A two standard-deviation

increase in income raises the probability that a married person reports being happy by 8.9

percentage points, and it raises a single person’s likelihood of reporting being happy by 7.0

percentage points.

       Clearly, “with whom” has independent impacts on happiness that in important cases have

diminishing effects as more time is spent in the crucial category (“with spouse” among marrieds,

“alone” among singles). So too does “how” one allocates one’s time across activities; and so too

does one’s household income. Because all three of these sets of measures alter happiness, and



                                                  10
because each might be affected by a lockdown, I base the simulations in the next Section on the

equation for which the results are reported in Column (3) of Table 2 and Column (2) of Table 3

for marrieds, and on the equation described in Column (6) of Table 2 and Column (4) of Table 3

for singles.

        B. Robustness Checks

        Consider a number of restrictions on the samples for which Tables 2 and 3 list results.

People who work in retail trade or some services (e.g., restaurant workers) have faced more severe

losses of work time than others because of lockdowns. Using estimates of the relation of their

happiness to “who with” for them might be a poor indicator of how they would react to these

limitations, since their time allocations have been substantially altered. To examine this potential

difficulty, I re-estimate the models in Columns (2) and (5) of Table 2, adding indicators of industry

(4-digit SIC) to the estimating equations. These additions hardly change the estimates: In the

equation for childless married people the estimated coefficient on time with spouse declines

slightly (to 0.0123, s.e. = 0.0047), as does the absolute value of the impact of time alone among

singles (to -0.0111, s.e. = 0.0044). Similarly minute changes occur when the equations in Columns

(3) and (6) of Table 2 are re-estimated adding indicators of industry affiliation.

        In the sample of marrieds (singles), 1.9 (1.5) percent of the diaries were collected on

holidays, clearly atypical since the respondents’ choices about both time-use and “who with” are

constrained to differ from those on non-holidays. Excluding these small fractions of respondents

from the estimation hardly changes the results shown in Columns (3) and (6) of Table 2.

        One might also think that those individuals whose leisure time includes more time spent

emailing would be making different choices from those not spending (addicted to) time in this

way. The models that include how people spend time, and their incomes, almost certainly account



                                                 11
for any effects of internet access on “who with” and how time is spent, as they control for what

have been shown the be the major determinants of access to the internet: Income, education and

age (Chaudhuri et al., 2005). Nonetheless, examining this issue directly by adding measures of

daily time use spent emailing for non-work purposes barely alters the estimated impacts of choices

about “who with” or “how” on happiness. It may be that such people can mitigate the negative

effects of a lockdown on themselves through electronic contacts; but there is no evidence here that

such mitigation alters differences in the measured impacts of “who with” or “how.”

        The estimates are all based on collapsing the life satisfaction measure into two categories—

happy or not. To use all the information provided by the respondents in these ATUS modules, I

re-estimate the equations in Table 2 using ordered probit analysis describing all 11 choices

available on the Cantril ladder about the individual’s life satisfaction. Re-estimating the model in

Column (3) of Table 2 strengthens the results shown. The estimates on time alone and with friends

become statistically significantly negative and positive respectively; time with spouse remains

statistically significantly positive, its quadratic is nearly statistically significant and the overall

vector of “who with” measures remains highly significant. Re-estimating the model in Column (6)

of Table 2 yields similar inferences: Time alone remains significantly negative, its quadratic

remains negative but not statistically significant, time with other relatives becomes significantly

positive and the overall vector remains significant statistically. While in what follows I concentrate

on the bivariate results for expositional and computational simplicity, one should note that they

slightly understate the statistical significance of the findings.

        Roughly half of the time diaries in the ATUS are kept on Saturdays and Sundays. “How”

time is spent and “who with” differ between weekdays and weekends in both samples. Paid work

is much less on weekends, as is well known, while time spent in all other aggregates of time use



                                                  12
increases. Also unsurprisingly, married individuals spend more time with spouse and less time

alone on weekends. Singles’ “who with” behavior varies less from weekday to weekend, except

that they spend more time with friends on weekends. Despite these daily differences in the kinds

of activities undertaken and in “who with,” estimating the models underlying Table 2 separately

for weekdays and weekends produces remarkably similar results to those shown in Table 2.

        It is unlikely that reverse causation characterizes these estimates, as it is difficult to imagine

that individuals who are inherently happier are those who choose to spend more time with spouse,

or alone, or that they spend more time in paid work or home production. It is, however, reasonable

to be concerned that those individuals who have been married longer become happier as a result

and choose to spend more time with their spouse. The underlying effect may work through marital

duration. The ATUS does not measure the duration of respondents’ marriages; but assuming, as

the evidence shows, that most married individuals age 55+ have been married for many years, we

can at least hint at the importance of this potential difficulty by re-estimating the quadratic model

over these individuals (who account for 70 percent of the married sample).9 This reduction of the

sample hardly changes the results: Comparing the estimated impacts of “with spouse” to those

shown in Column (3) of Table 2, the linear effect becomes 0.0328 (s.e. = 0.0011), and the quadratic

term becomes -0.000019 (s.e. = 0.000013). This similarity suggests, but does not demonstrate, that

this particular problem of selectivity is minor.

        There are numerous other factors that might alter the impacts of a lockdown on happiness.

But unless they are also correlated with “who with” or “how” or with income, they will not affect

the simulations of a lockdown’s impacts. They need to be considered to infer how the impact of a

or more was 35 years; and only 7 percent of them had been married fewer than 10 years.

lockdown will differ across the population, but they will not alter the average impacts generated

by the simulations.10

         The samples remain usably large if we disaggregate the estimation by gender. Estimates of

the model with the “who with” variables entering linearly, separately for men and women, are

shown in Table 4. (The results for the quadratic models are similar.) Being alone bothers married

men more than married women, being with friends raises married women’s happiness more. Most

important, the positive impacts of additional time with spouse are nearly identical between men

and women; and there are no significant differences in the impacts of any of the other “who with”

measures by gender. That is not true among singles: The negative impact of time spent alone shown

in Table 2 results almost entirely from women being very much less satisfied with life as time

spent alone increases. This negative effect is significantly different from the small negative effect

among men. On the other hand, the small positive effect on life satisfaction among all singles of

time spent with other relatives arises because men’s satisfaction increases significantly while

women’s rises, but not significantly and much less than men’s.

     V. Simulating the Impact of a Lockdown on Happiness

          With lockdowns people lose whatever freedom they had to maximize (1). Because they

are confined to their residences during most of the day, they are limited to contact with many fewer

people than if they could choose freely. Among married individuals with no children, I assume

that the lockdown means that the only person with whom they associate face-to-face is their

spouse. Among singles I assume that a lockdown restricts them to remaining alone. While in both


10
  One possibility is that those who have access to open spaces and can freely exercise during a lockdown may be
happier as a result. The sample has no information on this kind of access. As a weak proxy, we can re-estimate the
model over the 21 percent of marrieds (31 percent of singles) living in central cities. While the standard errors of the
estimated impacts of “who with” increase using these sub-samples, the parameter estimates hardly change from those
shown in Tables 2 and 3. Another is that time spent traveling, likely to be zero under a lockdown, may be correlated
with the “who with” measures and may also affect happiness. Adding a measure of total travel time to the quadratic
models also hardly alters the estimated impacts of time with spouse (time alone) or how the “how” variables.

                                                          14
groups people might maintain electronic contacts with others (teleconferences, “skype dinners”

and the like), they have no face-to-face contact with other people: They are isolated.

         I undertake three groups of simulations. The assumption underlying Group I is that there

is no loss of work time and no loss of income. Those assumptions seem highly unrealistic. Many

people have lost their jobs, and others have seen reductions in their workhours. We cannot know

how large these losses are, but 1/3 of aggregate work time is probably an upper-bound estimate of

the time that is lost. Accordingly, in Group II of the simulations I assume that 1/3 of work time is

lost and that it is spent watching television.11 With the loss of work time, incomes will almost

certainly also drop. It seems unlikely that the average decrease in incomes will exceed 1/3, so in

Group III I assume that income decreases in each sample by 1/3. Moving from Simulations I to II

to III assumes increasingly negative effects of the lockdown on the real economy.

         Underlying the simulations in Sub-group A is the assumption that all the time that a married

person had previously spent with friends, other relatives, other people or alone is now spent with

his/her spouse. It similarly assumes that all of the time that a single person had previously spent

with others is now spent alone. The assumptions underlying the simulations in this Sub-group seem

reasonable, but it is possible that the total time for which a respondent would list who s/he was

with might increase when people must remain in one place. Simulations in Sub-group B thus

proceed on the assumption that each person, if asked about her/his time under a lockdown, would

report spending all non-sleep time with spouse (if married) or alone (if single) (remembering that

“who with” is not listed for time spent sleeping). Simulations in Sub-group C are extreme: They



11
  If I assume that the time lost was instead shifted in whole or in part to sleeping, the results from the simulations
would show larger negative effects on happiness, given the sizes of the estimates in Table 3. With a lockdown it seems
highly unlikely that this time could be shifted to other leisure; but it might in part go to increased time spent in home
production or to other personal care (as implied in a recent tweet: “Prediction: There will be a minor baby boom in 9
months, and then one day in 2033, we shall witness the rise of THE QUARANTEENS"
https://www.france24.com/en/20200318-viral-humour-helps-europe-deal-with-fear-boredom-of-lockdown).

                                                           15
take the maximum time anyone in the sample lists as being with spouse (alone), 1410 (720)

minutes, and impute that to all sample respondents.

         The results of these 9 simulations (3 sets of 3) are shown in Table 5. With sufficiently

extreme assumptions about the extent of lost work time and income, among married individuals

we do see a substantial drop in the probability of reporting being happy with one’s life. With more

moderate assumptions about losses in work time and income, and with all non-sleep time listed as

being with one’s spouse (Group II.B), the simulations suggest that the happiness of married

individuals could have been increased slightly by the lockdown. This is not true among singles:

Even under fairly conservative assumptions (Group IA), their happiness decreases; and with more

extreme assumptions the decrease is quite substantial. Taken together, the most likely impacts are

those in the simulation Group IIB—a small increase in happiness among marrieds, a larger

decrease in happiness among singles.

   VI.      Conclusions and Implications

         The results here use two years of data from the American Time Use Survey to demonstrate

that, after adjusting for numerous covariates including the activities on which people spend their

time, the identities of people with whom they associate affect their expressed life satisfaction.

Married people’s happiness rises with additional time spent with a spouse, while singles’ happiness

falls as they spend more time alone. In simulations I assume that lockdowns force married people

without young children to spend time solely with their spouse and force singles to spend time

alone. Based on the regression estimates, they show that imposing these spatial constraints might

have improved the well-being of married people, although sufficiently large losses of work time

and of income more than offset these gains. The results suggest that imposed isolation reduces the




                                                16
life satisfaction of singles, a loss that is exacerbated by any direct economic losses that they

experience.

       The simulations rely on the underlying notion that utility depends not only on goods and

services purchased and time spent, but also upon the identities of whom, if anyone, the time is

spent with. Given the assumption that people choose along these three dimensions, how can it be

that married people could be better off when they cannot make these choices freely because they

are locked down? A possible explanation is that when not locked down they are not totally free to

choose “who with,” because their favorite choice—their spouse—is for most of them unavailable

during time spent in paid work, a major chunk of time in the typical day. With lockdowns and

imposed work from home, married individuals are constrained to spend time with their most

utility-enhancing person. The constraint reduces the well-being of singles compared to the

unconstrained situation, because it imposes more time alone, their most utility-reducing “who

with” choice.

       The regression results make sense and show the importance of the utility-based approach

to the “who with” considerations that are implicit in Equation (1). They are quite robust to a variety

of changes in sample and specification with which I have experimented. One must stress, however,

that they apply only to the average individual. The effect of the CV crisis on the well-being of

different groups might differ for reasons other than the “who with” or “how” of time use. Work

time and income losses clearly are not homogeneous across the population, and similarly for the

risk of contracting and dying from the illness (Borjas, 2020). Results might differ between majority

and minority citizens for these reasons. All I have shown here is that average married couple’s

well-being might have increased because of the lockdown per se, while that of the average single

individual has clearly been reduced.
