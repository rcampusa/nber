Does Finance Cause Growth? Evidence from the Origins of Banking in Russia

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper examines the effect of banking on economic growth in modern Russia. To overcome simultaneity
and selection, we exploit regional banking variation induced by the creation of “specialized banks”
(spetsbanks) in the last years of the Soviet Union (1988-1991). Consistent with the qualitative work
of Joel Hellman [1993] and Juliet Johnson [2000], we show that these reforms generated an ideal natural
experiment in that the concentration of spetsbanks is jointly uncorrelated with 15 predictors of future
growth, including pre-banking income, education, anti-market sentiment, institutional quality, and
government interference in the economy. Results indicate that while the presence of one additional
spetsbank per million inhabitants increased total within-state lending to private firms and individuals
by 14 to 26 percent in the early 2000s, it had no effect on investment or per capita income. In contrast,
we find that spetsbanks increased employment. Additional results indicate that spetsbanks increased
growth in regions in which they were less connected to government and were generally more similar
to non-spetsbanks, as well as in regions that were better at protecting property rights. Our results thus
indicate that bank origins, political connections, and property rights are important determinants of
effective finance.

1. Introduction

        There is a large body of cross-country evidence showing that financial development

promotes economic growth.1 In their pioneering study of 77 countries during 1960-1989, King

and Levine [1993] show that increasing the size of the financial intermediary sector2 from the

mean of the slowest quartile of countries to the mean of the fast growing quartile would increase

per capita growth by almost 1 percent per year. However, as those and other researchers have

noted, cleanly identifying the impact of finance on growth is challenging because of the potential

for bias due to selection and simultaneity. For example, countries with developed financial

systems may also have strong enforcement of property rights and rule of law, making it difficult

to distinguish the effect of one factor versus another [La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and

Vishny et al., 1998]. Similarly, countries that grow quickly may also have ample savings

available for banks to lend, or may generate high demand for financing. While subsequent

studies have used instrumental variables and panel data methods in an attempt to overcome these

problems,3 there are lingering concerns that these approaches do not overcome the simultaneity

and selection biases. For example, within-country changes in financial systems may not be

exogenous to economic growth, and instruments such as legal origins may have their own

independent effect on economic growth.4

        In response to these concerns, several studies have exploited within-country variation in

bank regulation to identify the effect of finance on growth. Jayaratne and Strahan [1996] use the

variation in the state-level deregulation of intrastate bank branching in the USA that starts in the

1970s.5     Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales [2004] estimate effects using both OLS and an

instrumental variable strategy exploiting a 1936 bank regulation in Italy as a source of exogenous

variation in local financial development in the 1990s. These within-country studies largely

support the findings of the cross-country literature: for example, Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales

[2004] find that between 1989 and 1997, moving from the least to most financially developed

region would boost GDP per capita by 1.2 percentage points per year.

          This paper uses an approach similar to these papers to study the effect of finance on

growth, albeit in a much less financially developed country.                   Specifically, it exploits the

plausibly exogenous variation in banking across regions within Russia induced by the top-down

creation of “specialized” banks, herein denoted “spetsbanks”, in the last years of the former

Soviet Union (1988-1991). According to Soviet reform documents, these banks were supposed

to provide external finance to state owned enterprises. The decision to create spetsbanks was

made by high level Soviet administrators on the basis of their own preferences, as was the typical

approach to decision-making in the now defunct Soviet System. Because the preferences of

Soviet administrators were largely divorced from forces shaping organizations in market

economies, reforms of economic organizations in the classic Soviet system were “exogenous” to

market forces (see Kornai [1992] chapter 7 and Ickes [1990]), an assertion that we will carefully

document with both qualitative and empirical evidence.6 In a study of banking in Soviet Union

and Russia, Hellman [1993] describes how the creation of spetsbanks in 1988 was yet another

case of top down institutional tinkering.

  Deheja and Lleras Muney [2007] conduct a similar analysis of branching and deposit insurance in the American
states during 1900-1940.
6
  One powerful explanation for organizational reform is that would serve to increase the number of privileged
administrative and managerial positions. Another explanation is the spetsbanks were created as part of a bank war
between powerful administrators in the former Soviet Union and the former Russian Socialist Republic (which
became subsequently became Russia). Regardless, one advantage of this variation in banking capacity is that it is
less susceptible to concerns regarding endogeneity than variation in state- or region-level banking policy.


                                                       2
        “Like previous reform efforts in the Soviet Union, the reorganization of the banking
        system was a true exogenous reform. The new banking institutions were not designed by
        bankers or other economic actors in response to the problems and incentives of the
        centrally planned financial system. Instead, a small group of so-called economic
        reformers crafted an entirely new institutional structure based on external models,
        political interests, and their beliefs about economic efficiency. The new structure was
        imposed on the banking system in a series of decrees and internal instructions that caught
        most Soviet bankers by surprise… ” [Hellman [1993], p.101]


        Importantly, we find powerful empirical support backing up the argument that the

locations of spetsbanks were exogenous to economic factors. Specifically, we show that the

concentration of spetsbanks that were created between 1988 and 1991 and survived till at least

October of 1995 is jointly uncorrelated with 15 variables one might expect to be correlated with

future economic growth, including per capita income in 1996, education and other

demographics, anti-market sentiment, the quality of economic and political institutions, and

government interference in the economy.

        The spetsbanks created between 1988 and 1991 began to function as commercial banks

for state owned enterprises circa 1991. During 1991 many of the spetsbanks were informally and

spontaneously privatized.7 After the breakup of the USSR the formal privatization of spetsbanks

successors was part of the broad package of large-scale market reforms. While many of their

spetsbank successors went bankrupt during the financial crisis of 1998—as did many other

banks—their presence did have a lasting impact on the regional banking market. By the end of

1999, when banks were beginning to make loans to firms and households,8 130 of the 1351

registered banks in Russia were spetsbank successors, and they accounted for roughly 11.4% of

loans to firms and households.

                                                     3
         Moreover, this increased regional bank capacity caused by spetsbank successors resulted

in a significant net increase in regional loans. Results indicate that regions that have one more

spetsbank per million population—approximately a ½ standard deviation increase—have a 14 to

26 percent increase in lending to private firms and individuals during the period 2002-2006.

This result is robust to the inclusion or exclusion of controls, consistent with exogenous

spetsbank location.

         However, our results indicate that this increase in banking did not cause economic

growth. Specifically, we find that this additional lending did not increase investment in 2007 or

per capita income or GNP growth from 1996 to 2007. In contrast, the additional lending induced

by spetsbanks did significantly increase employment in the regions. Consistent with this finding,

we show that despite being privately owned, on average spetsbanks appear to act like

government-owned banks in that they remained significantly more connected to government and

government-owned firms than their non-spetsbank counterparts (see La Porta et al. [2002]).9

Furthermore, we find substantial heterogeneity in the effectiveness of spetsbanks in causing

economic growth based on both the behavior of the spetsbanks, as well as the institutional

environment in which they operated. Specifically, we show that spetsbanks did cause positive

regional economic growth when they had a weaker relationship with the federal government and

when they operated in a region with a recent history of good protection of property rights. More

generally, spetsbanks promote growth in regions where they are similar to non-spetsbanks in

terms of lending and deposit behavior.


9
  One reason why the spetsbanks likely continued to behave like government owned banks long after the fall of the
Soviet Union and long after they were privatized is that former Soviet managers remained on their boards. Using
personnel data, we find that four to five years after the creation of the Soviet spetsbanks and after their privatization,
the boards of directors at spetsbanks successors contained significantly more former managers at the Soviet
spetsbanks than did the boards of directors at non-spetsbanks.

           Collectively, our findings suggest that banking origins (history) matters for finance.

Moreover, our results highlight the importance of breaking political connections between banks

and governments, and establishing good property rights in regions where banks operate.

           The next section contains a brief description of Soviet banking and spetsbanks. Section 3

describes the identification strategy, and section 4 describes the data. Section 5 documents that

the location of spetsbanks at the end of 1995 is as good as random, and is a strong predictor of

regional bank capacity during 2002-2006. Section 6 presents contains our mains results on the

impact of regional bank capacity on growth and other economic outcomes in 2007; section 7

interprets our findings and section 8 concludes.



2. Banking in the former Soviet Union and in Russia

           Before 1990, physical plans set by central administrators were more important than

financial constraints in the socialist economies in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

In the former Soviet Union, the mono-bank Gosbank issued credits to state owned enterprises so

that they could fulfill administered plan targets. State owned enterprises typically had “soft”

financial budget constraints, which meant they could get credits from the bank for fulfilling plan

targets even if their projects were unprofitable and served no particular consumer or firm need.10

Banks collected taxes from state owned firms and monitored the extent to which these firms

were fulfilling centrally administered plan targets.11

           During 1987-1991, the Soviet banking system underwent significant changes. On the one

hand, after the passage of a law on state owned enterprises in 1987 that was designed to harden

their budget constraints, commercial banks spontaneously and informally emerged. These new

     See Garvy [1997].


                                                    5
commercial banks took advantage of profit opportunities created by the breakdown of the system

of enforced planning quotas, the large spreads between state and market prices, and the ability to

set up cooperative ventures in state-owned enterprises. Many of these commercial banks

flourished and continued their activities after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

        The Gosbank mono-bank system that had previously been the only source of banking in

the Soviet Union also underwent significant changes from 1987 to 1991, though we note that

these changes were driven entirely by the Soviet authorities rather than market forces. In 1987 a

working group with representatives from Gosbank and Stroibank (the Construction Bank which

was a subsidiary of Gosbank) divided the Soviet banking system into a central bank and five

kinds of spetsbanks. This division went into effect January of 1988. The old Soviet foreign trade

bank and the old Soviet savings bank were renamed, but they remained under the control of the

Gosbank and no substantial changes were made in their personnel or organizational structure or

assets. The rest of Gosbank and its subsidiary Stroikank (the Soviet bank for construction),

however, was divvied up into three spetsbanks including the Agromprombank (agricultural-

industrial banks), Zhilsotsbank (the banks for housing and social development) and

Promstroibank (the banks for industrial-construction). These three kinds of spetsbanks were

supposed to provide finance to the reforming state-owned enterprises on the basis of criteria that

were more market-based than under the previous system. However, while Gosbank transferred

assets and cash reserves, control over the interbank clearing system, and control over personnel

policy to these three spetsbanks, initially Gosbank did not give these spetsbanks control over

their credit and interest rate policies.

        There are several explanations for why the Gosbank system was transformed in this way.

One is that spetsbanks were created in order to increase the number of privileged management



                                                 6
positions within the old Soviet command system. A complementary explanation is the

spetsbanks were established as part of a bank war between powerful administrators in the former

Soviet Union and the former Russian Socialist Republic (which subsequently became Russia).

After Soviet leaders created spetsbanks and the Soviet Union Central Bank in 1987, in an effort

to be independent of the former Soviet Union and its central bank, the leaders of the Russian

Republic subsequently created the Central Bank of Russia (CBR), which then gave spetsbanks

additional autonomy from the Soviet Central Bank to serve as commercial banks for state owned

enterprises. Specifically, the CBR worked to transfer all of the assets and liabilities of the

spetsbanks to its local branches, and then gave the bank managers in each branch the power to

form a small bank or join with other branches in a larger bank (Abarbanell and Meyendorff

[1997], p.70). Many regional branches did separate from these three banks and established new

regional banks within the regional branches of the Central Bank of Russia (Schoors [2003]).

This informal and spontaneous privatization of spetsbanks deprived the Soviet Union Central

Bank control over Russian bank branch managers. Thus, while the Agprombank, Zhilsotbank

and Promstroibank and their successors initially “had few incentives to operate in a market-

oriented way” (Johnson [2000], p.30) in time and, in particular, after the disintegration of the

former Soviet Union, they learned to behave like commercial banks.     We consider these three

banks and their successors as spetsbanks.

       Importantly for our research design, while these spetsbanks were given additional

autonomy by the Central Bank of Russia, the location of the banks themselves was based on pre-

existing Soviet Banking capacity.     And as discussed above, that capacity had been built

according to the preferences of Soviet bureaucrats, independent of economic conditions one

might expect to affect future economic growth.



                                                 7
        The former Soviet Union officially ceased to exist on December 25, 1991, and the

Russian Federation emerged as a new country the next day. The Russian government instituted

market reforms in January 1992 when it released price controls on a broad set of goods and then

subsequently instituted several sweeping programs that formally privatized state owned

enterprises. Spetsbanks that operated as private banks in the former Soviet Union were formally

privatized when the Soviet Union was dissolved and large scale privatization was implemented.

        From 1992 to 1998 the successors of the spetsbanks and the other commercial banks

continued to perform many tasks that they performed under socialism, including providing credit

to state firms, financing state-related programs, and financing government debt (see Tompson

[1997]). Spetsbanks and commercial banks made substantial profits transferring central bank

credits to state owned enterprises and exploiting negative real interest rates on bank deposits up

till 1995, and invested in foreign currencies and precious metals in a variety of ways throughout

the 1990s. Similarly, banks made a great deal of money issuing high-interest bearing government

bonds known as GKOs starting around 1995 (Johnson [2000] and Shleifer and Treisman [2001],

chapter 4). Because banks made so few loans, private firms had to finance projects with either

internal funds or funds raised from internal sources, even though they could earn an unusually

high return on their capital (see Johnson, McMillan and Woodruff [2002]). In return for

providing finance to the government, some commercial banks were able to buy up state assets at

very low prices.12

        Overall, from August of 1992 through 1998 spetsbanks and commercial banks were

profitable without serving as a source of finance to private firms and households. And, as Juliet

Johnson argues, they were profitable largely because of their political connections.

12
   The most famous case is the “loans for shares” deal in 1995 in which the Yeltsin government effectively sold
interests in lucrative nickel, oil and steel companies to bankers.


                                                      8
           “These banks could be profitable without being productive by relying on central bank
           credits at negative real interest rates, conducting foreign exchange operations, facilitating
           export-import operations and capital flight, handling government monies, developing the
           interbank credit market, and granting expensive short-term loans. All of these activities
           exploited their ties to government ministries, the CBR13, and state-run enterprises”.
           [Johnson [2000], p.8]


The dysfunctional behavior of the banks, along with falling world oil prices and the Asian crisis

likely contributed to the near collapse of the Russian financial system in August of 1998.

Following the crisis the Russian government defaulted on its domestic and international debts,

GDP fell almost 5%, there was a massive outflow of capital from Russia, and hundreds of

Russian banks went bankrupt.

           After the financial crisis, there was a large increase in growth of exports due in part to the

massive devaluation of the ruble and in part to the large increase in world oil prices. It was

during this period that banks began making loans to private firms and households: between 1999

and 2007 bank-issued loans to firms as a share of GDP went from 10.5% to 37.3%. Moreover,

during this period real income overall grew rapidly and there was also substantial variation in the

growth in bank finance and income across the regions (see Berkowitz and DeJong [2011]). Thus,

the period after the financial crisis is a good testing ground for whether or not bank finance

matters for growth and other indicators of economic welfare.



3. Identification Strategy and Methodology

           The purpose of this study is to determine whether increased banking capacity leads to

higher economic growth. However, estimating the causal impact of banking on growth is

difficult because of the potential for simultaneity and selection biases. That is, one might worry


13
     CBR stands for the Central Bank of Russia.


                                                     9
that countries that grow quickly may have more capital available for lending, or that fast-

growing countries have more demand for loans, which may lead one to infer incorrectly that

additional lending causes growth. Similarly, selection bias may arise if those countries or

regions that have well-developed banking sectors are also those that have better legal and judicial

institutions to protect property rights, in which case one may misattribute higher income or

growth to better banking rather than to better institutions generally.

       To overcome these identification problems, we exploit the variation in the number of

spetsbanks per million inhabitants across the Russian regions in 1995.            The identifying

assumption is that regions with many spetsbanks would have grown at the same rate as regions

with few spetsbanks in the absence of the additional banking. This assumption appears broadly

consistent with the existing views of the reforms discussed in the previous section, in which the

location of the spetsbanks was determined largely on the basis of bureaucratic reasons, rather

than economic ones.

       Nonetheless, we test this identifying assumption empirically in two ways. As a starting

point, we ask whether the concentration of spetsbanks predicts either the log of per capita income

in 1996 or the annual growth rate in personal income from 1993 to 1996, both of which were

prior to modern banking in Russia. In addition, to compare the exogeneity of spetsbanks to that

of non-spetsbanks that did not have their origins in the Soviet Union, we also examine whether

the number of non-spetsbanks predict income or growth in 1996. Formally, we estimate the

following:

    (1) preBanking Outcome i   0   1 LnPop 1996 i   2 Spetsbank              i   
     3 NonSpetsba nk i   i




                                                 10
       where i denotes the ith region, PreBankingOutcome measures either log income per

capita in 1996 or the growth rate in real income per capita from 1993 to 1996, LnPop1996 is the

log of the regional population in 1996, Spetsbank is the number of spetsbanks per million

population in 1995, and Non-Spetsbank is the number of non-spetsbank banks per million

population operating in 1995. The coefficient of interest is θ2, though we also expect that θ2

should be smaller in absolute value than θ3, as non-spetsbanks arose in an endogenous fashion.

       In addition, we test whether spetsbank concentration was uncorrelated with a host of

other exogenous pre-banking variables that one would expect to predict economic growth. Thus,

we examine whether the concentration of spetsbanks in 1995 is conditionally correlated with

other variables expected to cause economic growth, such as income and demographics, anti-

market sentiment, quality of institutions, and government interference in the economy circa

1996. We do so by estimating the following:



  (2) Spetsbanki   0  1LnPop1996i   2 LnRinc1996i   3 X i   i



where subscript i denotes the ith region, LnRinc1996i is the log of real income in 1996, and Xi is

a vector of covariates measured circa 1996 including demographics, the political environment

and preferences, institutional quality, and government interference in the economy, and εi is a

stochastic error term.

       We test the null hypothesis that log of real income in 1996 is insignificant, and we also

test the null that log of real income in 1996 and the vector of covariates Xi, are jointly

insignificant. These are powerful tests of whether regional spetsbank concentration is orthogonal

to other observed factors known to predict growth. To the extent that we fail to reject these


                                               11
nulls, it provides some assurance that our measure of bank capacity is also uncorrelated with

unobserved determinants of economic growth.

        After empirically assessing the exogeneity of the spetsbank variation, we turn to whether

additional spetsbanks increased the banking capacity in the 2000s. That is, we examine whether

regions with higher concentrations of spetsbanks in October of 1995—a period when there was

almost no lending in Russia—have more lending in the 2000s than regions with lower

concentrations of spetsbanks in 1995. Formally, we estimate the following:



( 3) Bank Outcome i   0   1 LnPop 1996 i   2 LnRinc 1996 i   3 X i
  4 Spetsbank i  u i



where the variable Bank Outcomei can denote log of lending per capita by region of lender, log

of lending per capita by region of borrower, log of the bank Herfindahl index, and the interest

rate charged. Bank outcomes are measured from 2002 to 2006.

        Finally, we examine whether the increased lending caused by having a higher

concentration of spetsbanks in 1995 leads to differences in regional economic outcomes

including investment, per capita income, unemployment, and the share of small business activity

years later in 2007. To do this we replace the variable Bank Outcomei in equation (3) with

variables measuring regional economic outcomes in 2007.14

         We estimate all models controlling for real income and population in 1996, and each

specification is estimated with and without controls for the vector of covariates, Xi. To the


14
  Here we are using a reduced form instrumental variables approach. This estimation strategy is more flexible than
a two-stage least squares approach in which the spetsbanks concentration in 1995 must influence economic
outcomes in 2007 exclusively through one particular measure of bank outcomes.


                                                       12
extent that our estimates are unaffected by the inclusion of covariates Xi that predict growth in a

significant way, we gain some confidence that including unobserved determinants of investment

and economic growth would also not matter.

          One important implication of our research design is that the coefficient of interest is a

local average treatment effect that captures the effect of the increased lending induced by

successors to the old spetsbanks (Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin [1996]). Thus, while these results

are informative regarding the impact of additional banking capacity induced by the top-down

creation of spetsbanks in the final years of the Soviet Union, they may be less informative of the

causal impact of other types of banking on growth. We return to this question of interpretation

later in the paper.



4. Data

          Data on spetsbank status come from “A Guide to Russian Bank Data” (Karas and

Schoors [2010]), as collected from various publications from the Central Bank of Russia. This

source contains the registration records of all Russian banks from August 1988 through April

2007. Banks are classified as old spetsbanks if they were registered as an Agprombank and/or a

Zhilsotbank and/or a Promstroibank no later than December 30, 1991, as Russia instituted

market reforms shortly after this date. These old spetsbanks are measured in each region of

Russia per million inhabitants of a region at the beginning of 1992. The average region has

almost 2 spetsbanks per million inhabitants; 6 regions have no spetsbanks, and the Altai Krai has

more than 15. We report data on spetsbanks for 78 of Russia’s 83 regions.15


15
  We drop three small regions for which data is limited including the Jewish Autonomous oblast, the Komi-Perm
Autonomous oblast and Taimyr Autonomous district; and, we drop the war-torn Chechen Republic and Ingush
Republic for which data are also limited.


                                                     13
       The bank registry contains records only for those banks that survived until October 1,

1995. Some spetsbanks that registered before December 30, 1991 subsequently were absorbed

primarily by the agricultural spetsbanks (Agprombank) and some may have gone out of business.

Of the 250 spetsbanks that were in operation on October 1, 1995, 236 spetsbanks were registered

before December 30, 1991 and an additional 14 spetsbank were registered after December 30,

1991. Thus, our measure of old spetsbanks is conditional on survival as a spetsbank through

October 1, 1995. This is reasonable since there was little bank lending activity to private firms

and households as of October 1, 1995. Moreover, we show in the next section that the location

of these spetsbanks that survive until October 1, 1995 is orthogonal to a host of covariates that

predict future economic growth.

       We use four measures of regional bank capacity including lending per capita by the

region of the lender, lending per capita by the region of the borrower, the concentration of

regional banks, and the loan interest rate charged by the banks. These variables are measured

during the period 2002 through 2006, and allow us to test whether having additional spetsbanks

increases lending or bank competition in the years preceding 2007, when we measure economic

outcomes of interest.    All lending variables are deflated by a regional consumer price index

(April 2007=100) acquired from Roskomstat (Web site: www.gks.ru) and expressed in thousands

of deflated rubles per capita.

       The source for lending per capita by region of lender, bank concentration and loan

interest rate charged by the regional banks is “A Guide to Russian Bank Data” (Karas and

Schoors [2010]), as meticulously collected from quarterly reports put out by a Moscow-based

information agency “Interfax” (www.interfax.ru). Interfax publishes quarterly an extensive list

of items from the financial statements and regulatory ratios of all Russian banks. Loan interest



                                               14
rate is calculated as the volume-weighted annualized rate charged to firms and individuals. Bank

concentration is computed using a weighted average of the Herfindahl indices for the firm and

consumer markets.16         Lending per capita by region of lender is computed as the total stock of

loans to private firms and households made by the banks in a region during the period 2002

through 2006. While the advantage of these data is that they include the entire population of

banks, the downside is that they may capture lending to firms and individuals in other states.

This is a problem primarily for Moscow and St. Petersburg, because banks registered in these

cities often make loans throughout Russia. Consequently, we complement these data with data

on aggregate lending per capita by region of the borrower during the period 2003-2006, the

source of which is the Bulletin of Banking Statistics: Regional Supplement (Central Bank of

Russia, various years).17

        Our primary economic outcomes of interest include per capita income growth from 1996

to 2007, per capita GNP growth from 1996 to 2007, and investment, employment and

unemployment rates, and the number of small and medium enterprises per capita in 2007. All

measures were collected by the Russian official statistical agency (Sources: Goskomstat Rossii,

1996, 2001, 2008a, 2008b, 2010)

        Our data allow for the inclusion of many important control variables, which we use both

to show the exogeneity of the concentration of spetsbanks as of 1995 as well to test the

robustness of the main results. We measure these variables in 1996 or earlier, which is well

before the period when bank finance emerges. Education in a region is taken from 1994 Russia

micro-census and is measured as the share of the population that is at least fifteen years old as of

16
   The Herfindahl Index is calculated as the sum of squared market shares (in percent) for all firms in a market, and
thus can theoretically range from 0 (least concentrated) to 10,000 (monopolist).
17
   We measure 2003 loans as the average of the stock of loans held by private firms and households in October 2002
and October 2003, and in 2006 average the stock of loans for October 2005 and October 2006.


                                                         15
1994, completed secondary school, and has at least some post-secondary education (source:

Goskomstat [1995]).              Another important potential determinant of future growth is ethno-

linguistic fractionalization, which is related to levels of trust, corruption and financial depth (see,

for example, Alesina et al [2003]).             We use the standard measure18 using data from the All

Union Census of 1989 (Goskomstat RSFSR [1990]), where higher values represent more

ethnically fragmented regions. We also have data on urban population share and migration

inflows per 10,000 inhabitants (source: Goskomstat [2008a and 2010]). Finally, since Moscow

was and is the financial capital of the Former Soviet Union and Russia, respectively, we also

include distance to Moscow.

         We also have several political measures in order to capture popular sentiment regarding

market reform, as these preferences may well predict future growth after the fall of the Soviet

Union. One such measure is the urban Jewish population in areas occupied by the Nazis during

World War II measured just prior to their invasion. As argued by Acemoglu, Hasan, and

Robinson [2010], this variable predicts the extent of the destruction of the Soviet urban middle

class during World War II and the subsequent anti-market and pro-Communist sentiment that

persists long after the fall of the Soviet Union. In addition, our data also contain a measure of

the regional importance of powerful elites inherited from the Former Soviet Union, which we

proxy using voter participation rates in the Russian regions in 1989.19 In what was considered to

be the first open elections in Soviet history, Soviet citizens were allowed to vote for some

representatives to the national legislature. However, these elections for the first time allowed

Where gi,reg is the number people in ethnic group i in a region, POPreg is the total population of the region, and J is

   This argument is taken from Berezkin et al. [1989] and Berkowitz and DeJong [2011].

opposition candidates to compete with Communists for power. Thus, in regions where the

Communist Party remained strong and well organized, the Communists used their traditional

administrative structures to mobilize voter turnout from traditional bases of support including

state farms and state owned enterprises. Thus, high voter turnout in these elections is a

reasonable indicator of the strength of the old Communist party.

           Our last measures of the political environment are proxies for pro-reform sentiment

among the general population, in that they measure the share of the regional population that

voted for then President Yeltsin in the presidential election in June of 1991, and the share of the

regional population that supported Yeltsin again in June of 1996 in the first round of a

presidential runoff election.20 In both elections, Yeltsin stood for economic and political reform

and his opponents wanted a return to the socialist past; therefore, pro-market sentiment is

stronger when vote shares for Yeltsin are higher.

           To proxy for the quality of political institutions, we use an indicator variable that equals 1

if the appointed regional executive in 1991 was an insider and 0 if he/she was outsider (source:

Remington [2011]). This variable then picks up roughly the extent to which entrenched Soviet

elites could remain in power after the fall of the Soviet Union.

           Finally, our data include four direct measures of government involvement in market circa

1997 including the share of production subsidies in regional budget expenditures in 1995; the

share of agriculture subsidies in the regional budget in 1995; the share of enterprises in

commerce, public catering and public services owned as state or municipal property as of July 1,

1997 and the weighted average of goods and that had regulated prices in 1996 (source:

Remington [2011]).


20
     We obtain basically the same results if we use the second round of election in July of 1996.


                                                            17
         Summary statistics are shown in Table 1. Figures are shown in 1995-1996, when there

was very little banking in Russia. In addition, we show statistics separately for regions with

more and fewer than 1.4 spetsbanks per million, which is the median number of spetsbanks

across the regions. This was done to enable evaluation of the identifying assumption that these

groups should otherwise trend similarly over time.21

         As shown in Table 1, by construction these two groups have significantly different levels

of banking. This highlights the relatively high degree of variation in the full sample, where the

number of spetsbanks per million people ranges from 0 to 15, averages 2, and has a standard

deviation of approximately 2.22

         However, there are no other statistically distinguishable differences between regions with

high and low concentrations of spetsbanks. Even more, the similarities along most dimensions

are quite striking: the two groups have similar levels of education, urban population share,

political environment, institutional quality, and government involvement in the economy. While

this is somewhat surprising given that politics and institutions in particular have been shown to

be drivers of finance,23 it is consistent with what we would expect based on our understanding of

how spetsbanks were created by Soviet bureaucrats.

         There are only a few dimensions along which the two groups are less similar, though still

not statistically so. Regions with more spetsbanks per million inhabitants have somewhat lower

population.24 This makes some sense; one spetsbank might have been able to serve more state-


21
   In the main analysis, we exploit the continuous variation in spetsbank concentration. Here, for ease of illustration,
we simply categorize regions into two groups based on spetsbank concentration.
22
    None of the results in the paper are qualitatively different when excluding the region with 15 spetsbanks per
million population, which is substantially more than the next-highest region has (7.8).
23
   See Malmendier [2009].
24
    We note that this difference is not statistically significant, and that there is no such difference in the urban
population share. Moreover, the correlation between our spetsbanks measure and population is mechanical because
our spetsbank measure is calculated as the number of spetsbanks per million population. Thus, when we estimate


                                                          18
owned enterprises in an area with higher population density.                      Migration is also somewhat

different, although the difference of 35.5 migrants per population of 10,000 is small. Distance to

Moscow is also somewhat different, with high-concentration regions located an average of 900

kilometers further away than regions with fewer spetsbanks per million population.

         Table 2 also contains summary statistics for regions with low and high concentrations of

spetsbanks for variables available both circa 1996 and 2006. Thus, these results offer a glimpse

into the primary results of the paper on the impact, as well as a way to see whether other

plausibly exogenous covariates are changing systematically over time.

         As shown in Table 2, banking in Russia took off quickly between 1996 and 2007. While

real loans per capita were only 40 and 110 rubles for the two groups in 1996, this increased to

over 5,000 and 17,000 rubles per capita in 2007. This increase in banking, however, was not

accompanied by a systematic change in other plausibly exogenous variables such as percent

urban or population, which is consistent with the assumptions of our research design. It also

appears that the divergence in banking did not cause a divergence in real income per capita

growth. Specifically, while real per capita income went up by 96 percent on average in states

with below-median spetsbank concentration, it went up by only 66 percent in states with above-

median spetsbank concentration. These patterns are also apparent from Figures 1 and 2, where

Figure 1 shows the positive relationship between the log of per capita lending during 2002 - 2006

and the number of spetsbanks in 1995, and Figure 2 shows the lack of such a relationship

between the annualized increase in real income per capita from 1996 to 2007 and the number of

spetsbanks in 1995.



regressions we include population as a control to allow for flexible estimation, but we do not report or interpret the
population coefficient due to “division bias.”


                                                         19
       In contrast, the increased presence of spetsbanks did appear to increase the employment

rate, as shown in Table 2. This is intriguing, as it gives some indication of what the spetsbanks

might be doing with their private lending, if not funding productivity-enhancing projects.



5. Test of the Exogeneity of Spetsbank Concentration

       Before estimating the effect of spetsbanks on both banking capacity and economic

outcomes, we first test whether spetsbank concentration in October of 1995 is uncorrelated with

other variables (shown in Table 1) that predict future income. Specifically, we first ask whether

spetsbanks predict pre-banking per capita income in 1996 or annualized growth in per capita

income from 1993 to 1996. For comparison purposes, we also include the number of non-

spetsbanks per million population at the end of 1995.

       Results are shown in the first two columns of Table 3. Consistent with the qualitative

evidence described earlier, there is little correlation between spetsbank concentration and 1996

income: one more spetsbank per million population is associated with per capita income that is

0.3 percent lower. There is also little relationship between spetsbank concentration and the real

per capita income growth rate from 1993 to 1996; one more spetsbank is associated with a

growth rate that is a statistically insignificant 0.18 percentage points higher.

       It is not surprising that the concentration of non-spetsbanks in 1996 is more closely

correlated with these pre-banking economic outcomes, though estimates are imprecise. We

estimate that one more non-spetsbank per million is associated with income that is 2.9 percent

higher, and an annual growth rate that is 0.3 percentage points higher.

       Next, we ask whether spetsbank concentration is predicted by any of 15 covariates

measuring income and demographics, political environment, institutional quality, and



                                                  20
government involvement in markets. Results are shown in column 3 of Table 3. Of the 15

covariates included in the regression, only one is statistically significant at the 5 percent level,

which is consistent with a random process. Furthermore, at the 10 percent level we cannot reject

the null hypothesis that spetsbanks are uncorrelated with the income and demographic variables,

or with the political environment and institutions variables, or with the government involvement

in the economy variables. In fact, we also cannot reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients

on all 15 variables are equal to zero at the 5 percent level (F = 1.64). In short, the empirical

evidence is consistent with the qualitative evidence of Hellman (1993) and Johnson (2000) in

suggesting that the location of spetsbanks across Russian regions is exogenous to economic

factors.

           By comparison, column 4 shows results from similar regressions, except using instead

non-spetsbanks in October of 1995. As shown, this banking measure is highly correlated with

variables expected to predict future growth. Two of the 15 coefficients are significant at the 5

percent level (income and budget subsidies), and two more are significant at the 10 percent level.

This is also reflected in the F-tests shown at the bottom of the table, where at the 5 percent level

one can reject the null hypothesis that all the coefficients are jointly equal to zero. Thus, while

the concentration of non-spetsbanks is likely endogenous, the concentration of spetsbanks

appears to be orthogonal to other relevant determinants of finance and growth.



6. Results

The Effect of Spetsbanks on Banking Capacity in the Modern Banking Era

           We now examine whether the concentration spetsbanks in 1995 increases banking

capacity once modern banking takes hold in Russia. The raw data are shown in Figure 1, while



                                                21
the estimation results are shown in Table 4. There are three specifications corresponding to each

outcome. The first controls for log 1996 population, while the second additionally controls for

all other pre-banking characteristics from Table 1 to examine whether the spetsbank measure

appears to be orthogonal to other important determinants of banking and income. The third

column excludes the regions containing the capital cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, which

are outliers in terms of foreign investment, growth, and finance.

         The first three columns of table 4 estimate the effect of spetsbank concentration on the

log of per capita lending in 2002-2006, as measured by the state of the lender. As described

earlier, these are the most reliable data we have, as they come from banks’ administrative records

and include the entire population. Results indicate that having one more spetsbank per million

population—or about a ½ standard deviation increase in spetsbanks—causes between an 18 and

26 percent increase in per capita lending, with all estimates statistically significant at the 1

percent level.

         In columns 4 through 6 of Table 4, we show results using a second measure of regional

lending compiled by the Central Bank of Russia. While this measure falls somewhat short of the

gold standard of administrative data, the advantage is that regional lending is defined at the level

of the borrower. Results indicate that having one more spetsbank in a region increases lending

during 2003-2006 by 14 to 19 percent, all of which are statistically significant at the 1 percent

level.

         In columns 7 through 9, we ask whether having the presence of spetsbanks affects bank

competition, as measured by the Herfindahl Index. Results indicate that having more spetsbanks

reduces the Herfindahl Index by 6 to 9 percent, suggesting that their presence makes the banking

industry more competitive.



                                                22
       Finally, in columns 10 through 12 we estimate the effect of spetsbanks on the (volume-

weighted) average interest rate charged on loans in each region. Here, while point estimates are

negative—as one might expect given the results on loan quantity and bank competition—most

are economically small and only some are marginally significant. The largest estimate implies

that having one additional spetsbank per million population reduces the interest rate charged by

0.15 percentage points (s.e. = 0.13), which is relatively small relative to the average annual rate

in 2006 of 16.6 percent.



The Effect of Spetsbanks on Investment, Per Capita Income, Unemployment, and Small Business

Activity

       Next, we turn to whether the increase in private banking induced by spetsbanks affects

investment, per capita income growth, per capita GNP growth, employment rates, unemployment

rates, or the number of small and medium enterprises per capita. Results are shown in Table 5.

As shown in Panel A, there is no evidence that additional spetsbanks increase real per capita

income growth or real per capita GNP growth. For example, in our preferred specification in

column 2, results indicate that one additional spetsbank reduced annualized per capita income

growth from 1996 to 2007 by a statistically insignificant 0.11 percentage points, with a

corresponding 95 percent confidence interval of [-0.22, 0.11].    This is also clear from Figure 2,

which graphs the percent increase in real per capita income from 1996 to 2007 against spetsbank

concentration.

       In contrast, we do find evidence that additional banking increases employment rates and

reduces unemployment; results in column 5 of Panel B indicate that having one additional

spetsbank increases the employment rate by 0.54 percentage points.



                                                23
       Importantly, none of our estimates except for unemployment are sensitive to the inclusion

of controls, and none are affected by the exclusion of Moscow and St. Petersburg.



7. Interpretation and Discussion

       Our findings are somewhat surprising given the consensus in the literature that banking

increases economic growth. For example, Guiza, Sapienza, and Zingales (2004) estimate that

moving from the least to the most financially developed region in Italy (which was twice as

developed, by their measure) would increase growth by 1.2 percentage points per year. In

contrast, we show that while the presence of an additional spetsbank induced a 14 to 26 percent

increase in lending over the following 10 years, it did not increase growth in GNP or personal

income. Our estimates are also precise; even the upper bound of our largest estimate on annual

real per capita income growth implies an effect of no more than 0.18 percentage points, which is

small relative to the average of 5.8 percent.

       This pattern of results is intriguing, as it is appears more consistent with what one might

expect of a government owned bank, as opposed to banks that had been privatized and

competing in a market with other privately owned banks (see La Porta et al. [2002]). For

example, in governments such as the old Soviet regime, the role of the “banks” was often to help

traditional large firms retain workers, in part to build popular support for the regional political

elites and in part because these firms provided public goods such as health services and

education to the populace and thus helped maintain social stability (see Remington [2011]).

       We use two approaches in order to assess whether the Soviet origins and corresponding

connections to the federal government persisted after bank privatization.         First, we check

whether employees in the original spetsbanks tended to hold powerful positions in spetsbank



                                                24
successors.25 In 1996, for example, 77 percent of the membership of the board of directors of an

average spetsbank successor had worked in one of the original spetsbanks. At the same time, in

the non-spetsbanks only 25 percent of the board members had worked in an original spetsbank.

These findings suggest that political connections established in the original spetsbanks were

persistent through at least the mid-1990s.

         In our second approach for determining whether spetsbank successors appear to have

remained connected to the government, we perform two empirical exercises. We ask whether

spetsbank successors charge similar interest rates as non-spetsbanks of similar size who operate

in the same region. We also ask whether spetsbank successors generate a greater share of their

interest income from government and government owned firms than their non-spetsbank

counterparts. Specifically, using bank-level data, we regress the outcome of interest (interest rate

charged or share of income) on regional fixed effects, log of bank assets, and an indicator for

whether the bank had its origins as a spetsbank.

         Results are shown in Table 6. Using data from the period 1999-2006, we find that the

biggest difference between spetsbanks and non-spetsbanks is that spetsbanks receive

significantly more of their interest income from federal and sub-federal government (0.89

percentage points) and from firms owned by the government (1.39 percentage points). These are

large differences, representing 152 and 101 percent increases over the averages for all Russian

banks.26 Spetsbank successors also receive significantly less of their income (0.75 percentage

points, or 51 percent) from foreign banks, which is also consistent with what one might expect

25
   The sampling procedure is to use all of the banks for which the relevant personnel data is given. Thus, we obtain
data for 120 spetsbanks and 149 non-spetsbanks in 1996. We obtain similar findings with a similar sample size for
1995. We also obtain qualitatively similar findings when we calculate the number of general directors, vice
directors and accountants in 1995 and 1996 who had worked in the original spetsbanks during 1988-1991.
26
   We emphasize, however, that in previously showing that spetsbanks induced lending, we counted only lending to
private firms, as that is the lending likely to induce growth. In contrast, here we ask whether spetsbanks also make
more loans to government and government-owned firms than their non-spetsbank counterparts.


                                                         25
from a government bank, as these banks are outside the political sphere of government and the

banks. These differences are striking, as these banks and all other commercial banks had been

privatized since at least the early 1990s. Thus, in principle, the spetsbank successors should not

be receiving additional financial support from the government. Evidence consistent with this

assertion is that during 1999-2006 spetsbank successors do not hold significantly more

government deposits and do not reap significantly higher profits from government owned firms

than their counter-parts. Moreover, while spetsbank successors receive somewhat more transfers

from federal and regional governments 1999-2006, this difference is not statistically

significant.27

        In addition, we find evidence that spetsbanks charge individuals an interest rate that is 2

percentage points lower than non-spetsbanks, which is relative to an average rate of 16.5 percent.

This could suggest some form of insider or nepotist lending where the spetsbank successors lend

to friends at beneficial prices, though it is also consistent with spetsbanks making lower risk

loans than their non-spetsbank counterparts.

        Thus, we find considerable evidence that while spetsbanks do induce an increase in

private lending, they remain more connected to government than other banks. This relationship

exists despite the fact that spetsbank successors are operating in markets as private firms, and, to

our knowledge, free from any financial support from the government. The persistence of a

relationship with government may help explain why spetsbank lending does not increase growth;

perhaps spetsbanks are unable to develop the culture and capabilities necessary to make



27
   These numbers are available upon request. Our measure of profits from government owned firms is interest
payments received net of expenses paid to government owned firms. Our measure of transfers from the government
is interest payments from the government net of expenditures paid. In making these calculations we control for bank
assets and region fixed effects and quarter fixed effects during 1999-2006.


                                                        26
productivity-enhancing loans, or perhaps they are pursuing other objectives that have persisted

due to their origins, such as increasing employment.

        To the extent that spetsbank successors lend to inefficient firms—either intentionally to

increase employment,28 or unintentionally due to poor capital allocation skills29—it raises

questions about the impact of this lending on the private sector. For example, Caballero, Hoshi,

and Kashyap (2008) present compelling evidence that by keeping credit flowing to otherwise

insolvent borrowers nicknamed “zombies” by the authors, Japanese banks suppressed job

destruction and creation and lowered productivity.

        However, while poor capital allocation is one explanation for why spetsbank lending

does not cause positive growth, another explanation is that the institutional context in Russia

makes it difficult for any lending to lead to investment and economic growth. For example, if

firm owners do not believe their property rights will be protected after they take risks to expand

and grow their business, they may not be willing to invest.

        To test more directly for whether our finding of no growth on average is caused by

spetsbank behavior or regional institutional context, we exploit the heterogeneity of both across

the different regions of Russia. Specifically, we use measures of bank behavior taken prior to

2001, and ask whether different types of spetsbanks have different effects on economic growth

from 2001 to 2007.

        The first measure of bank behavior captures how closely spetsbanks are connected to the

federal government. Spetsbanks that are highly connected receive federal government transfers,

28
   We attempted to acquire data on employment at the regional level at firms that were formerly state-owned—that
is, firms known to be less efficient—in order to examine whether spetsbanks increased employment at those firms,
but we were unable to do so.
29
   We did compare the rate of non-performing loans across spetsbanks to non-spetsbanks as a way of measuring loan
quality. However, non-performing loan rates are small across all banks in Russia, which we suspect is due in large
part to loan restructurings that would make it hard for us to infer much from those data.


                                                       27
which are measured as interest income received from federally owned firms net of payments to

these firms as a share of total loans. In each region, then, we can compute these transfers to

spetsbanks during 1999-2001 and use banks assets as weights. However, one might worry that

the level of government involvement by spetsbanks within a region is endogenous to current and

future expected growth, or that there are region-specific differences that cause both high

government involvement by all banks as well as future growth. Consequently, we ask whether

regions in which spetsbanks are less connected to government than their non-spetsbank

counterparts in the same region experience higher growth as a result.30

         Our second measure captures spetsbank similarity to nonspetsbanks in their region more

directly. Specifically, we regress spetsbank status on a set of variables describing sources and

share of deposits and loan activity as well as log assets from 1997 to 2001, and then calculate an

F-statistic for each region testing whether the coefficients on the deposit and loan variables are

jointly equal to zero. We normalize the F-statistics to have mean zero and standard deviation

one. This variable thus measures the degree of to which spetsbanks deposit and loan behavior is

different from non-spetsbanks of similar size in their region that do not share the Soviet history

of the spetsbanks.

         To measure the institutional context of each region, we use a measure of property rights

protection constructed by experts at the Moscow Carnegie Center under the direction of Nikolai

Petrov and Alexei Titkov. It is measured on a scale of 1 to 5, where higher numbers mean that

greater protection of property rights.

         Results are shown in Table 7, where the first four rows contain coefficients, while the last

three rows use those coefficients to estimate the marginal effects of spetsbanks that have

30
  The analysis is thus necessarily limited to regions that have both spetsbank origins and successors and non-
spetsbank origins and successors.


                                                         28
different levels of government involvement, similarity with non-spetsbanks in their region, or

operate in regions with differing protection of property rights. Importantly, the marginal effect

of spetsbanks on lending does not vary significantly by these three factors, as shown in Appendix

Table A1. This means that any differential effects on economic outcomes are not due to

differences in the magnitude of the first stage on the quantity of lending. We examine three

outcomes: annual growth in real personal income from 2001 – 2007, annual real GNP growth

from 2001 – 2007, and log investment in 2007.

        Several patterns emerge. First, spetsbanks that operate in regions with better

institutions—namely, better protection of property rights—have a significantly more positive

effect on growth. For example, columns 7 – 10 indicate that operating in a region where

protection of property rights are classified as one point better (i.e., just over one standard

deviation) causes the marginal spetsbanks to increase growth by between 0.76 and 1.01

percentage points. This suggests that the institutional context of banking matters.

        There is less clear evidence that having connections to the federal government is bad for

growth. While these connections appear to lower growth in real personal income, there is no

evidence that it lowers real annual GNP growth, and it somewhat counter-intuitively appears to

increase investment.31 However, there is much stronger evidence to suggest that spetsbanks

most different from non-spetsbanks are bad for growth.

        The net impacts of these factors shown in the last three rows of Table 7 suggests that

while there is no effect of spetsbanks on economic growth or investment on average (see

columns 1, 6, and 11), there is substantial heterogeneity depending on both the behavior of the


31
  One potential explanation is that while spetsbanks with close connections to the federal government may induce
additional investment, it may be investment aimed primarily at increasing employment, rather than productivity
growth. This would be consistent with the findings of Caballero, Hoshi, and Kashyap (2008) in Japan.


                                                       29
spetsbank as well as the institutional environment.         For example, the marginal effect of

spetsbanks that are most connected to the federal government or are the least similar to non-

spetsbanks in their region is to reduce economic growth and investment, when they operate in a

region with bad institutions. For example, none of the twelve point estimates for the effect of

these banks are positive, while four are significant at the one percent level, two more are

significant at the five percent level, and one more is significant at the ten percent level. In

contrast, spetsbanks that are not connected to government, or that appear to behave similarly to

their non-spetsbank counterparts, increase economic growth by between 0.4 and 1.2 percentage

points. For example, the estimate in column 3 suggests that one additional spetsbank increases

growth by 1.1 percentage points when it has little relationship to the federal government and

operates in a region offering substantial protection of property rights.

       In summary, two interesting findings shed light on our result that lending by spetsbank

successors does not increase growth or investment, but does increase employment. We show

that despite having been privatized and subject to market competition, spetsbank successors have

retained some of their historical relationships with government.           This provides a potential

explanation for why spetsbanks lend to increase employment, rather than productivity.             In

addition, the impact of spetsbank-induced lending on economic growth depends on both the

behavior of the spetsbank and the institutional environment in which they operate.



8. Conclusions

       This paper examines whether additional banking capacity causes increases in per capita

income, investment, unemployment, and the share of small business activity. To overcome

biases due to selection and simultaneity, we exploit variation induced by the creation of old



                                                 30
banks created to function as clearinghouses under the former Soviet Union. Existing qualitative

research on these banks characterizes the locational decision as bureaucratic and exogenous to

economic factors, which we confirm by showing the concentration of spetsbanks is uncorrelated

with 15 covariates that predict economic growth. Despite their Soviet origins, however, these

banks have become an important source of lending in Russia: in 2006, privatized spetsbank

successors accounted for nearly 14 percent of all lending to firms and households in Russia.

       Results indicate that while having one additional spetsbank per million population

increases private lending up to 10 years later by 14 to 26 percent, this increase in lending does

not cause an economically meaningful increase in investment or per capita growth in real income

or GNP.    Rather, we find that spetsbank-induced lending increases employment.           This is

consistent with other findings that spetsbanks are significantly more connected to the federal

government than their non-spetsbank counterparts who lack the historic connections to the Soviet

financial and political system. This is also consistent with the finding that even after the

privatization of banks, employees of the original Soviet spetsbanks were much more likely to

hold powerful positions in spetsbank successor banks than in the non-spetsbanks.

       Furthermore, we find evidence that the effectiveness of spetsbanks in causing economic

growth was determined by both the behavior of the spetsbanks, as well as the institutional

environment in which they operated. Specifically, we find that a one standard deviation in the

regional index of protection of property rights increases the marginal effect of a spetsbank on

annual economic growth by nearly one percentage point. Similarly, our results suggest that

spetsbanks that are either less connected to government, or are more similar to their non-

spetsbank counterparts, subsequently increase economic growth.         These latter findings are




                                               31
roughly consistent with the conclusion of Jayaratne and Strahan [1996], who argue that lending

quality, rather than volume, is responsible for growth.

       Thus, on the one hand, we view our finding that the spetsbank-induced lending did not

cause growth as an important counterexample to the existing literature. On the other hand, we

emphasize that unlike the United States and Italy examined by previous researchers, our findings

are in the context of a country that lacked the long history of modern banking, and that attempted

to transform these banks relatively quickly through privatization and the corresponding

incentives.

       Consequently, our results indicate that the origins of financial institutions can have

persistent effects on behavior and growth years afterward. Additionally, our findings suggest

that the quality of institutions and the weakening of political connections between banks and

government are necessary for banking to cause economic growth.

shown in Table 1. Property rights protection is a measure constructed by experts at the Moscow Carnegie Center under the direction of Nikolai Petrov and Alexei Titkov and is measured on a
scale of 1 to 5. The difference in spetsbank and non-spetsbank relationship with the federal government is defined as the difference between the share of bank asset weighted federal transfers
to spetsbanks and non-spetsbanks, where the federal transfer is interest payments net of payments from federally owned firms paid to banks divided by the value of overall bank loans. The
within-region index of differences between spetsbanks and non-spetsbanks is calculated as the normalized F-statistic arising from a region-specific regressions in which an indicator for
spetsbank status is regressed on a set of variables describing sources and share of deposits and loan activity.
