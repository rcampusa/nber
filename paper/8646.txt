                                              ABSTRACT

        We study the organization of federations - or international unions - which decide together the
provision of certain public goods. The benefit of centralization depends on the internalization of the
spillovers, that of decentralization on the adaptability to local differences. We individuate as an optimal
institutional design a form of fiscal federalism based on decentralization of expenditures and a system
of subsidies and transfers between countries. Since this solution can be politically unfeasible, we study
institutional compromises between a centralized federation and a decentralized one. “Flexible unions”
and federal mandates in which both the state and federal levels are involved in providing public goods
are typically superior to complete centralization and politically feasible. Finally, we study the effects of
a qualified majority voting rule in a centralized system: we find that it can be a useful device to correct
a bias toward “excessive” union level activism.

1       Introduction

The European countries are engaged in a process of institution building that is

unprecedented in their history. After the introduction of a single currency in

1999, a Conference to be convened in 2004 is expected to open the door to 12 new

members and introduce a ”Constitutional Charter” for the European Union. Al-

though the word ”federation” does not belong to the EU institutional lexicon1 ,

the European Union seems to possess key features commonly attributed to fed-

erations; at least if one refers to the classic study by Riker (1964), where a

federation is defined as an arrangement in which individual states or countries

retain considerable sovereignty, while at the same time important prerogatives

are moved to a supranational entity.

     Despite its advanced institutional development, however, the European Union

still has some way to go to identify clear, systematic and agreed criteria for al-

locating policymaking prerogatives between national and European authorities.

This is indeed a central issue surrounding the current debate on the future Eu-

ropean Constitution. The building of European institutions originated, in the

early 1950s, from the aim of maintaining security and peace in a continent de-

stroyed by the war2 . Subsequently, the project developed into a broader one,

aiming at establishing a single internal market for goods, services, capital and
    1 The   use of this term was ruled out as it proved controversial during the negotiation of the

Treaty of Maascricht; see Padoa-Schioppa (2001).
    2 See   for example Jean Monnet (1976). According to Riker (1964), security and defence are

common motives at the origin of most if not all federations in history.

people. This was eventually completed in the early 1990s. However, in the

recent decades, as documented by Alesina, Angeloni and Schuknecht (2001),

European level institutions have been entrusted with an increasing range of

policy responsibilities.

   The question we address in this paper is how alternative institutional ar-

rangements lead to diﬀerent outcomes concerning the centralisation, or decen-

tralisation, of policy responsibilities in a federation, or international union. For

our purpose, we treat the terms ”federation” and ”union” as interchangeable;

in fact, most of our stylised conclusions can equally be applied to the European

Union and to explicitly federal structures, such as the US.

   To build our argument, we need a model which implies a need for unions to be

established in the first place. We believe that a main reason for which countries

delegate some power to a supernational institution is the need to coordinate

decisions which aﬀect each other. The element that in our view is central to

the political economy of all federations is a tension between the heterogeneity

between countries and the advantage of taking certain decisions in common. As

in Alesina, Angeloni and Etro (2001, AAE from now on), we define a union as a

heterogeneous collection of countries that decide together on the provision of a

certain common policy, that exerts positive spillovers on all of them. While we

focus on heterogeneity in preferences over policy, but heterogeneity in economic

fundamentals would have similar eﬀects.3 It is easier to think of this policy as

  3 See   also Alesina and Wacziarg (1999) on this point.




                                               4
the provision of a public good, like investment in infrastructures, environmental

quality or defense. However some of our arguments apply also when we interpret

national policies in broader terms (like fiscal, monetary or trade policy) or even

as a legal or regulatory framework.

   The institutional design of a federation is the fruit of a compromise between

two diﬀerent objectives: the internalization of externalities amongst countries

and the adaptability of policies to diﬀerent national preferences. The benefits

from internalization of externalities increase in the degree of interdependence

between countries, while the benefits from adaptability of the policy increase

with heterogeneity between countries. A union in which every country chooses

independently its policy maximizes the adaptability to local diﬀerences, but

minimizes the internalization of the spillovers, while a union with a uniform

policy for each country assures this internalization but does not take into account

heterogeneity between countries.

   In the present paper we investigate various alternative institutional arrange-

ments which are intermediate between these two extremes. In fact, the need for

intermediate institutions is well captured by Oates (1999) in his discussion of

federalism, when he writes that: “individual local governments are presumably

much closer to the people and geography of their respective jurisdictions; they

possess knowledge of both local preferences and cost conditions that a central

agency is unlikely to have. And, second, there are typically political pressures

(or perhaps even constitutional constraints) that limit the capacity of central



                                        5
governments to provide higher levels of public services in some jurisdictions than

others. These constraints tend to require a certain degree of uniformity in cen-

tral directives. There are thus important informational and political constraints

that are likely to prevent central programs from generating an optimal pattern

of local outputs”.

   Our first investigation concerns a form of redistributive mechanism which

is inspired to the way the European Union incentivates investment in national

policies with spillovers in the Community. We label this system as fiscal feder-

alism because it leaves complete decisional autonomy to the countries on what

to choose, but it induces them to make the “right” choices through a system of

taxes and subsidies between countries. This system is able to induce the first

best policies, but it may be diﬃcult to implement - because of administrative

or political constraints - and it may not be politically feasible.

   In the rest of the paper we depart from the rigid structure of the union which

was under study in AAE (2001). We define a “flexible” union one which is orga-

nized through a two step procedure in which first every country provides some

public good and than the federation decides at majority voting on a common

level of federal expenditure. This structure turns out to be an improvement over

the rigid structure. The adoption of federal mandates in which the union fixes

a minimum expenditure for all countries and these can subsequently bottom up

is an other example. Finally, we study the eﬀects of a qualified majority voting

rule in a centralized system: we find that it can be a useful device to correct a



                                         6
bias toward “excessive” union level activism.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the basic

model. Section 3 discusses three alternative institutional rules for the federation.

First we study a federal organization which decentralizes the policy choices at

the national level while constraining them with a system of transfers between

countries and subsidies l. Then we study two mixed systems in which decisions

are partially centralized and partially decentralized: the first one captures the

subsidiarity principle, the second one captures the federal mandates. Section

4 focuses on qualified majority voting and its eﬀects on decisions taken by the

union. Section 5 concludes. The proofs are in the Appendix.




2     The Model

The basic environment is the same as in AAE (2001), and we describe it below.

However, we use it for diﬀerent purposes: in the previous paper we investigated

the equilibrium size of the federation in a simple majority voting institutional

setting.   Here we hold the size of the federation constant and we investigate

alternative and realistic institutions.

    Consider a federation of N equally sized countries with the population size

normalized at 1. The generic country i has the following objective function:


                                                    N
                                                    X
                        Ui = ci + αi H(gi + β ·              gj )               (1)
                                                  j=1,j6=i




                                          7
   where gi is the per capita and total level of government spending in country

i, ci is private consumption which enters linearly in the utility function for sim-

plicity and Hg (·) > 0, Hgg (·) < 0. The parameter αi > 0 captures how much

the representative individual of country i values public expenditure relative to

private consumption: we will refer to αi as the preference of country i and,

without loss of generality, we will assume that countries are ordered such that

α1 ≤ α2 ≤ · · · ≤ αN−1 ≤ αN . We will assume that these preference parameters

are observable but unverifiable information at the federal level. The parameter

β ∈ [0, 1] captures the spillover eﬀects from other countries’ government spend-

ing on the “home” country. When β = 1(0) we are in the Samuelson case of a

pure public good at the federal (national) level (see Samuelson, 1955).

   We assume that income (y) is exogenously given and equal for everyone in

every country. Each country has a balanced budget, therefore gi = ti ∈ (0, y)

where ti are the lump sum taxes raised in country i.             Using the government

budget constraint, we then have


                                                     N
                                                     X
                      Ui = y − gi + αi H(gi + β ·              gj )               (2)
                                                    j=1,j6=i



2.1    The utilitarian first best

In principle a federation could internalize the spillovers and accommodate diﬀer-

ences in preferences by imposing diﬀerentiated policies for each member. Con-

sider in fact the “utilitarian” case, which seems reasonable since all countries



                                        8
have the same income and the same size. From now on we identify the “utili-

tarian first best” as simply the “first best.” Thus, the optimal choice implies

maximizing the following welfare function:

                          N
                          X                        X                     N
                                                                         X
                    W =          αi H(gi + β              gj ) + N y −          gi               (3)
                           i=1                     j6=i                   i=1


   The optimality condition for country i is the modified Samuelson rule:

                               X                 X                       X
               αi Hg (gi + β          gj ) + β          αj Hg (gj + β           gk ) = 1         (4)
                               j6=i              j6=i                    k6=j


which implies a system of N equations, with solution g ∗ (αi ) increasing in αi .
                                                                         g 1−θ
For instance, in the case of isoelastic utility H(g) =                   1−θ ,    solving the system

under the assumption of interior solutions for all countries we can obtain:

                 1/θ
                                                          PN       1/θ                     1−θ

         ∗      α [1 + β(N − 1)]1/θ   β                     i=1   αj [1 + β(N − 1)]         θ
       g (αi ) = i                  −
                     (1 − β)                                         (1 − β)

In this case ∂g ∗ (αi )/∂β is ambiguous while ∂g ∗ (αi )/∂αi > 0 and ∂ 2 g ∗ (αi )/∂αi2 S

0 iﬀ θ T 1.

   The “first best policy”, which implies a diﬀerent choice for each preference

parameter αi , is not directly achievable because the national preference pa-

rameter αi is not verifiable. We know that a complicated mechanism could

implement the first best - since preferences are observable - but we will restrict

our attention to simpler, and more realistic, institutional designs which are in-

spired by real world institutions. To establish a benchmark, we will start with

the two simplest arrangements: in the first, there is no federation, and every

country independently decides its own public expenditure (extreme decentral-

                                                  9
ization), in the second the federation decides the same level of expenditure for

all countries (extreme centralization).



2.2       Extreme decentralization: the Nash equilibrium

Consider a federation in which each country independently chooses its own

policy taking as given the policy of all the other countries. In this decentral-

ized equilibrium, assuming interior solutions, the first order conditions for a

maximum in country i imply:


                                                   X
                                  αi Hg (gi + β            gj ) = 1                       (5)
                                                    j6=i

    Let us call the solution of the system of N equations (5) as g n (αi ) where n

stands for Nash equilibrium. This decentralized equilibrium is characterized by

complete adaptability of policies to countries’ preferences, but it is ineﬃcient

because countries do not take into account the eﬀect of their choice abroad: while

the national marginal cost of their investment is unitary, the social marginal cost

is 1/[1 + β(N − 1)],4 which is decreasing in the spillover and in the number of

countries. Due to the free-riding problem, g n (αi ) is decreasing in the size of

the externality β and increasing in the preference parameter αi . Moreover, it is

lower than g ∗ (αi ) for each αi . For instance, under isoelastic utility and assuming
   4 To   verify this, notice that for one unit of expenditure in a country, the same country

obtains one unit of public good and each of the other N − 1 countries obtain β units of public

good. But if the social cost of 1 + β(N − 1) units of public good is 1, it must be that the
                                               1
social cost of 1 unit of public goods is   1+β(N −1)
                                                     .



                                                 10
interior solutions we have:

                                    1/θ
                                            PN     1/θ
                                  αi       β i=1 αj
                   g n (αi ) =           −             < g ∗ (αi )
                                 (1 − β)    (1 − β)

and notice that ∂g n (αi )/∂β < 0, ∂g n (αi )/∂αi > 0 and ∂ 2 g n (αi )/∂αi2 S 0 iﬀ

θ T 1.



2.3      Extreme centralization: the political equilibrium

At the opposite extreme of the options available to the federation is an insti-

tutional set up in which every country has to follow the policy rule chosen at

the federal level. The main cost of this centralized organization is the lack of

adaptability to the diﬀerences between countries, the main benefit is that the

spillovers between countries can now be internalized at the federal level. This

happens either if the federation acts to maximize its welfare in a utilitarian

fashion, or if countries vote on the federal policy.

   Consider first the case in which the federal policy is chosen to maximize

(3) under the constraint gj = g for each j. We would obtain the first order

condition:
                 PN
                   j=1   αj                                  1
                              Hg {g[1 + β(N − 1)]} =
                    N                                  1 + β(N − 1)

which equates the average of the marginal utilities from public expenditure to

its social marginal cost. Notice that implementation of this policy requires to

know the average preference parameter.



                                           11
2.3.1   Simple majority voting


In this section we will assume a simple majority voting rule; we study qualified

majority voting in section 4. Since preference are single-peaked, the median

voter theorem applies. If αm is the median of αi ’s, the chosen policy is gm such

that:



                                                         1
                  αm Hg {gm [1 + β(N − 1)]} =                                 (6)
                                                   1 + β(N − 1)

Note from (6) that gm is increasing in αm , since:
                                µ                           ¶
                    dgm   gm                  1
                        =                                       >0
                    dαm   αm        θ{gm [1 + β(N − 1)]}

where θ(g) = −Hgg (g)g/Hg (g) > 0 is the index of relative concavity.        The

comparative statics with respect to the size of the externality β, and the size of

the union N are ambiguous:
                                          µ                              ¶
              dgm            gm               1 − θ{gm [1 + β(N − 1)]}
                     =
           dβ(N − 1)   [1 + β(N − 1)]           θ{gm [1 + β(N − 1)]}

   Hence, the political equilibrium provision of public goods decreases (in-

creases) with the size of the union and of the spillovers if the elasticity of the

marginal utility of public goods is higher (lower) than unity, while, under uni-

tary elasticity we have size-independence. Indeed, under isoelastic utility we

have:

                                                      1−θ
                                1/θ
                          gm = αm   [1 + β(N − 1)]     θ

The ambiguous eﬀect of an increase in spillovers on the union policy choice is

due to the usual substitution and income eﬀects. But the same argument holds,

more surprisingly for an increase in the number of members. Even if a new

country is strictly in favor of a small government and it will increase votes in

this direction inside the union, its entry could end up determining a bigger size

government: this can happen if the concavity of the function H(·) is not too

strong. The intuition is that in this case the substitution eﬀect (more public

goods because they produce more spillovers) more than compensates the income

eﬀect (more consumption because we have already a lot of spillovers). Also the

opposite could happen: the increase in size of the union could end up reducing

the size of government if the concavity of H(·) is strong enough.5


2.3.2      Discussion


The median voter solution, by imposing the same policy to all countries gives

up to the flexibility of the decentralized equilibrium, but internalizes the ex-

ternalities. Given the trade-oﬀ between flexibility and internalization of the

externalities, this is a “corner” solution, in the sense that it does not allow for

any flexibility in tailoring policies to local preferences. Note that in the absence

of compensatory schemes, the first best policy characterized above is not neces-

sarily Pareto superior to the median voter solution. This is because the median

voter (and some members close to the median) may be better oﬀ with the policy
  5 This   result holds for any non separable utility function, but the cut-oﬀ is lower than unity

if public and private goods are complements.

that solves (6) than with the first best.6 More formally, note that:

                   X                                                    1
  αi Hg (gi∗ + β          gj∗ ) = αm Hg {gm [1 + β(N − 1)]} =                  for any i

                   j6=i

Hence, by concavity of H(·),
                                                        
                                                    X 
   αi S αm       ⇔ H {gm [1 + β(N − 1)]} T H gi∗ + β  gj∗ for any i                          (7)

Countries with low preference for the public good obtain more utility from

public expenditure under the political equilibrium. However, countries with

low enough preference for the public good, obtain less consumption under the

political equilibrium than in first best (they have to pay higher taxes in the

former). Some countries are better oﬀ under the political equilibrium than

the utilitarian “first best.” For instance, the median country obtains the same

utility form public expenditure in both cases - see (7), and it prefers the political

equilibrium if and only if:

                                    ∗   P                                PN

which happens when the median country favors a large expenditure compared

to the other members of the federation. In this case, the median country and, in

general, some countries around it, would favor the political equilibrium because

it forces other countries to spend more on public goods than in the utilitarian

first best case.7 It is also possible that a majority of countries would actually

    The disadvantage of the median voter solution for the union as a whole, is

that it forces all the union members to follow the most preferred policy by the

median, making those who are far from it much less satisfied than members

close to the median, if there are no compensations.        In the next section we

investigate better institutional arrangements to study when they are eﬃcient

and politically feasible.




3     Institutional design of a federation

In this section we will study diﬀerent institutional rules and compare their

properties. In many cases these institutions resemble procedures adopted in

some areas from the European Union.



3.1     Tax and subsidy schemes

Fiscal federalism is a system of decentralized decision making on public ex-

penditure financed both through local decentralized taxation and a net of in-

tergovernmental taxes and grants. In his classic book, Oates (1972) states a

Decentralization Theorem for which “in the absence of cost-savings from the

centralized provision of a good and of interjurisdictional externalities, the level

of welfare will always be at least as high (and typically higher) if Pareto-eﬃcient

country which is better oﬀ in the political equilibrium.




                                              15
levels of consumption are provided in each jurisdiction than if any single, uni-

form level of consumption is maintained across all jurisdictions”. Since in our

model there are externalities, the theorem does not apply, but we will show that

a form of fiscal federalism with redistribution between countries is still optimal

in our set up.8

    In this section we study a simple system of taxes and subsidies which is

inspired to the way the European Union incentivates certain regional investment.

Indeed, certain kinds of investment, especially those located in poorer regions,

aimed at their development or to environmental protection and characterized

by spillovers on the Community, is subsidized by the European Union:9 for each

Euro devoted to it, a supplementary fraction is added by the Union.

    Suppose that for every unit of income allocated by country i to public ex-

penditure, the union adds si units of public expenditure. These subsidies are

financed with taxes Tj for j = 1, ..., N . By assumption, both si and Ti must

be independent from the preference parameter of country i, αi , but they do

not need to be the same in all countries. In particular, they could depend on

each of the public expenditures, g1 ,...,gi ,...,gN , and we will assume that they
   8 Indeed,   Oates (1999) notes that “intergovernmental grants constitute a distinctive and

important policy instrument in fiscal federalism that can serve a number of diﬀerent functions.

The literature emphasizes three potential roles for such grants: the internalization of spillover

benefits to other jurisdictions, fiscal equalization across jurisdictions, and an improved overall

tax system” (italics added).
   9A   big part of the European Union budget, about 35% (see Nava, 2000) is devoted to these

“Structural Expenditures”.

are diﬀerentiable in these variables. Hence, we can write the problem of each

country i as the choice of gi to maximize:

where we assumed an interior solution for each country. Despite the complexity

of this diﬀerential system, we can derive the optimality of a very simple system

of taxes and subsidies.


    Proposition 1. The first best allocation of public expenditure can be achieved

if the federation complements national public expenditure by a fraction s∗ =

β(N − 1) for each country and finances these subsidies with taxes Ti∗ such that

    Proof: see the Appendix.


    The intuition for this result is quite simple. The additional expenditure

in the public good which is provided by the union distorts the incentives to

invest in the public good. These incentives are the same for every country as

in the first best if the marginal cost of public expenditure equates its social

marginal cost. But we know that this is the same for every country and given

by 1/[1 + β(N − 1)], hence this equality is trivially satisfied when                                ∂gi    = 0 while
                                                                                          ∂si
s is as specified in Proposition 1 for all countries, so that                             ∂gj   = 0 for any j: the

subsidy alone can be chosen so as to implement the right allocation of public

expenditure. Indeed, in the Appendix we show that:


                            gi [1 + β(N − 1)] = gi∗                     i = 1, ..., N


   However, we still need to check that these subsidies can be financed. Indeed,

we have:

       N
       X                                  N

                            X               β(N − 1)                X                                X

   One way to choose taxes so as to satisfy this revenue constraint is closely

related to the Clark-Grove-Vickrey mechanism studied in mechanism design
                                                                                                                ∂Ti
under a quasi-linear environment. Since we did not need to constraint                                           ∂gj   to

be zero for j 6= i, we can use the lump sum taxes like:

                                                            X
                                            Ti∗ = β                gj
                                                            j6=i


Clearly, the tax of each country is independent from its own expenditure and

the union revenue constraint is satisfied.10 Another simple way to solve the

                                                                                   

                                           N     ∗

                          1 + β(n − 1)      N

Since preferences are observable, this tax can be directly calcolated and it clearly

satisfies the revenue constraint.

   In every case, the optimal subsidy is independent from the utility functions

and the distribution of preference parameters: we can obtain the first best allo-

cation of public expenditure just by knowing what is the size of the spillovers.

The optimal subsidy is the product of this and the number of countries, inde-

pendently from the details of the model: all of them end up in transfers between

countries.



3.2    Discussion

An important feature of the optimal mechanisms we have just studied is that,

while they induce the optimal investment in public goods by each country, in

general, they do not replicate the exact allocation of consumption of the utili-

tarian first best. Given the linearity in consumption of our objective function,

this is consistent with optimality - the welfare function (3) is still maximized -,

but it is clear that departing from this quasi-linear environment we would loose

the optimality property of such a mechanism.

   In both the particular cases studied in the previous subsection, countries with

high public expenditure receive high subsidies but pay less than proportionally

for them (indeed, their taxes are independent from their own expenditure):

                                        19
borrowing the mechanism design jargon, this is the “rent” that we need to leave

to the players for whom the right action is more costly. The consequences of this

is that countries with high preference for public expenditure end up with higher

utility than in the utilitarian optimum: indeed, their expenditure is subsidized

by countries with low preferences for public expenditure.11 In theory, lump

sum transfers between countries could reestablish the utilitarian allocation of

consumption while preserving the one of the public goods, but unverifiability of

the preference parameters prevents this from being feasible.

    This is not just a technical problem for our mechanism. Countries with low

preference for the public good may end up being worse oﬀ than under the decen-

tralized Nash equilibrium, which would make pointless their same adhesion to

the union. Also, if income is low enough, some countries may not even be able

to pay their transfer, which would directly make unfeasible the all mechanism.

Typically, the imposition of individual rationality constraints would make im-

is lower than in the optimal utilitarian case if and only if:

that is, if its public expenditure is below the average in the union. It is easy to verify that

exactly the same condition emerges when taxes are equal for all countries.

possible the attainment of the first best with such a mechanism even under our

quasi-linear specification. But even if this was not the case, the implementation

of the redistributive mechanism we have just described, seems quite diﬃcult to

sustain from a political point of view, especially in a federation of otherwise

identical countries.

   Finally we need to remember that despite the first best could be achieved,

there may not be a majority in the federation which supports it (remember that

compensatory payments would not be feasible since they should be contingent

on the preference parameters).

   For these reasons we now return to political concerning issues. In the next

two sections we study two diﬀerent institutional arrangements based on majority

voting in the union which add flexibility to the political equilibrium previously

studied.



3.3    Flexible unions

In section 2.3 we have assumed that the political process in the federation decides

a unique level of the public good for all members. A potentially more eﬃcient

structure is to allow countries to choose and independently finance public ex-

penditure and to have an additional federal provision of the public good which

is decided by the union. This complementary role of the federation depicts a

well known feature of the European Community constitution, the subsidiarity

principle. For instance, as the Article 3b of the Maastricht Treaty says that “In



                                        21
areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall

take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and in so

far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be suﬃciently achieved by

the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or eﬀects of the

proposed action, be better achieved by the Community”. In other words, public

policies should be assigned to the lowest level of government which is capable

to succesfully achieve their objectives (see Inman and Rubenfeld, 1998). In our

model we have exactly a situation were each member’s policy does not inter-

nalize the eﬀects on the other members and so it cannot suﬃciently achieve

its objectives. Hence, the subsidiarity principle implies that the union should

complement countries’ expenditure in the public good with an additional ex-

penditure at the union level.

    We will refer to a union adopting this principle as to a “flexible union”

compared to the rigid one considered in the case of extreme centralization, in

which every country had to adopt the same policy. Formally we will describe

a flexible union with N countries and median αm , assuming that the median

                                      U 12
country chooses an union expenditure gm , while each country i chooses gin ∈
  12 We   focus on the natural case in which single-peakedness according to the α-ordering holds

in the second stage. We cannot exclude the existence of other subgame perfect equilibria in

which single peakedness does not hold. However, the nature of the equilibrium would be

qualitatively similar.

The timing assumption in our description of the principle of subsidiarity is that

the countries choose their individual public expenditure in a first stage, and the

union decides a complementary expenditure in a second stage.13 In particular,

  13 Our   modeling strategy on flexible unions may remind of the theory on budgetary proce-

dures and agenda setting rules in presence of common pool problems a la Persson, Roland and

Tabellini (1997, 2000). However, in that literature the multi-stage budgeting was separating

the problems of the size of the budget and its allocation, while in our model there is not an

overall budget to decide. Moreover, there, each player prefered a bigger share of public expen-

diture, here the opposite holds because of positive externalities between the players. Finally

our purpose is not to do comparative politics at a horizontal level - e.g. executive versus leg-

islative powers or presidential versus parliamentary systems -, but to do comparative politics

at a vertical level - national versus sovranational powers or state versus federal powers.

for any i ≤ m. We can summarize our findings as follows:


     Proposition 2. In a flexible union 1) the federal expenditure is lower than

the one adopted by a rigid union, 2) the median country and all countries with

weaker preferences for the public good do not add any individual expenditure

and 3) the countries with strongest preferences for the public good add individual

expenditure.


     Proposition 3. In a rigid union, the adoption of a flexible structure is

Pareto-eﬃcient and unanimously supported.

     Proof: see the Appendix.


     The outcome under the flexible union is a compromise between the decentral-

ized one and the rigid one. Countries with preferences for a small government

                                               24
will spend less then in a rigid union, while benefiting from the additional ex-

penditure of countries with opposite preferences: hence they are better oﬀ. The

median country must be better oﬀ because it is always able to replicate the

public expenditure of the rigid system (with the opportunity to be better oﬀ if

some countries provide further expenditure). Hence a strict majority is in favor

of the flexible system. The other countries on one side are worse oﬀ because

the union is providing less public good and on the other side they are better oﬀ

because to some extent they can individually repair to this. It turns out that

the second eﬀect is prevailing under any circumstances. Hence, everybody is

better oﬀ under the flexible union. Thus, even if in a rigid union a reform in

favor of the utilitarian optimum or fiscal federalism is not politically feasible,

we have found a Pareto-eﬃcient reform which is always politically feasible. An

important feature of this reform is that it does not rely on any information

about the preferences of the countries.

   The feasibility of flexible unions depends to a large extent on the nature

of the policy arena.   For certain cases this arrangement seems feasible; think

for instance of the provision of public goods such as infrastructures, defense,

research, etc.   The same applies to aspects of regulation, taxation and labor

market policies.   In other areas the nature of the policy may make a flexible

union impractical; it is hard to adopt “a little bit” of the common currency,

although Britain may be trying. The general point is, however, that by adopting

“minimum common denominator” approach, the combination of union level and



                                       25
national level policy choices can achieve Pareto improvements, relative to the

“rigid” union.



3.4     Federal Mandates

A related institution is one in which each country could choose and indepen-

dently finance public expenditure on top of the one decided by the federation.

We can think of the situation in which the federation moves first as a description

of federal mandates:14 the choice of the union will be the minimum amount of

public good that each country has to provide. In our context we prove in the

Appendix that the subgame-perfect equilibrium is characterized by the system:


                     gin = 0 for i = 1, 2, ..., m, ..., N − Ñ
                                               
                     X
      αi Hg gin + β    gjn + gm
                               U
                                 [1 + β(N − 1)] = 1 for i = N − Ñ , ..., N
                        j6=i
                                                             h             i
                      X                                         1 + β(Ñ − 1)
         αm Hg β            gjn + gm
                                    U
                                      [1 + β(N − 1)] =
                                                           [1 + β(N − 1)](1 − β)
                      j6=m

                                                                      U
so that Ñ countries add individual public expenditure to the amount gm decided

as the federal mandate. More precisely we can show:


    Proposition 4. The adoption of a federal mandate implies that 1) the federal

mandate is lower than the public expenditure adopted by the rigid union, 2) the
  14 Cremer   and Palfrey (2000) have studied this kind of federal mandates, however in their

model there are not externalities between countries. In our model, instead, the federal man-

date accomplishes an important role: it limits the free-riding of the decentralized equilibrium

internalizing to some extent the externalities produced in public good provision.


                                              26
median country and all countries with weaker preferences for the public good do

not add any individual expenditure and 3) the countries with strongest preference

for the public good add individual expenditure.

   Proof: see the Appendix.


   Even if the adoption of federal mandates in a rigid union may be Pareto-

eﬃcient and unanimously supported, as it was true for the flexible structure, it

may be the case that some country is made worse oﬀ. However we can prove

the following encouraging result:


   Proposition 5. In a rigid union there is always a majority in support of

federal mandates.

   Proof: see the Appendix.


   In subgame perfect equilibrium, the union requires every country to provide

a minimum amount of public expenditure, and some countries complement it

with further expenditure. Even if there is always a majority in support of federal

mandates, in this case we cannot exclude that some countries with stronger

preference for the public expenditure than the median are made worse oﬀ by

their adoption. The reason is that the advantage of the first move for the union

as represented by the median country induces an additional free riding (this

time at the union level) which may be deleterious for those countries.




                                       27
4     Qualified majority voting

Define “qualified majority voting” rule (QMV) a situation in which, in order to
                                                                          Q
change a predefined status quo, the union needs a majority Q, where 1 ≥   N   > 12 .

Unanimity is a special case of QMV in which Q = N . Simple majority voting

is again a special case of QMV, where Q approaches N/2. Hence, the results

we derived in previous sections under simple majoriry rule all obtain here as a

special case. But the implications of QMV are of particular importance in the

context of the European Union. The European Union Treaty stipulates that

unanimity in the EU Council is needed to entrust policy-making powers to the

EU in a certain number of key areas. In other areas, QMV is suﬃcient. A livey

debate has developed on the possibility of extending the range of areas where

QMV applies, correspondingly reducing the scope of unanimity.

    Under QMV, no single policy outcome unambiguously emerges from the

vote. The outcome is indeterminate within a set of policies each of which can-

not be defeated by QMV by any other. The ambiguity is resolved only by the

agenda setter, that decides which alternatives are put to vote. We can however

characterize this set. The following proposition highlights the policy implica-

tions of diﬀerent super majority rules; a more rigorous treatment is provided in

the Appendix.


    Proposition 6. Under a qualified majority voting rule with quorum Q, there

exists a “winning set” of public good provisions which cannot be defeated against



                                       28
an alternative option. This set collapses to the political equilibrium provision

under simple majority voting, gm , when Q = 1/2. Assume that the alternative

option is the maximum provision unanimously supported against no provision,

go : then, the lower bound of the winning set is decreasing in the required majority

from gm to go and the upper bound is increasing in the required majority for Q

small enough and decreasing for Q big enough.

   Proof: see the Appendix.


   The intuition behind this proposition is that moving from unanimity to less

binding forms of qualified voting tends to make the union more centralized,

i.e. the provision of public good by the union “is likely to” increase while the

amount of good provided individually (and the number of countries doing so)

“is likely to” decrease. As Q declines further towards N/2, beyond a certain

point the set of policies prevailing under QMV simply shrinks: as the quota

approaches simple majority, the dominant policy must converge to that chosen

by the median voter. The word “likely” above expresses the presumption that,

if both the lower and the upper bounds of the winning set move up, the outcome

will also move up (or vice versa).

   Moreover, the introduction of QMV would imply that the number of coun-

tries individually providing the public good and the total amount of public good

individually provided are increasing functions of Q, if and only if the QMV out-

come g U moves in the opposite direction to Q.




                                        29
4.1     Discussion

The discussion about voting rules and super majority becomes even more heavily

loaded if countries have diﬀerent size. In this case the question is which weight

should be given to each country. Obviously the resulting policy decision would

depend on the choice of weights.

    One possible rule is that the voting share of each country is proportional

to the share of the population. Since we are assuming that income per capita

is the same everywhere, population weights are identical to GDP weights. If

income per capita is diﬀerent, that would not be the case.

    Let’s continue to assume that individuals in each country have the same α,

so, trivially, αi represent the median preferences of members of country i. Then,

with population weights the median of the federation (αm ) coincide with the

median preference of the citizens members of the union. If, instead, the voting

scheme favors small countries (like the current EC voting system) than one has

a “bias” in favor of the preferred government size of small countries. Alesina

and Wacziarg (1998) find that the share of government over GDP is decreasing

with the size of the country measured by population or by total GDP.15 Thus,

voting schemes that favor small countries would produce an α for the union

government higher than the median α of the population of the union.

    Consider now the case in which within each country individuals have diﬀerent
  15 Note   however, that these results are drawn from independent countries, not from countries

in a union.




                                               30
preferences, i.e. there exists within each country a distribution of α such that

αi is the median of the distribution of α in country i. If each country in the

union is represented by its median voter, and if the union adopts population

weights, then the median of the union defined as the median of country medians,

coincides with the median preference of the citizen of the union.

    In practice, country representative in federation level institutions may not

represent the median of their population, particularly in non-proportional sys-

tems. In this case the median of the individual countries’ representative in the

union do not coincide with the median of the population of the union. Alesina

and Grilli (1992) using electoral result from the late eighties, show that the me-

dian of EU institutions (like the Council of Ministers) can deviate significantly

from the median of European voters.




5     Conclusions

In this paper we study how alternative institutional arrangements lead to dif-

ferent outcomes concerning the centralisation, or decentralisation, of policy re-

sponsibilities in a federation.

    We show three main results. The first one concerns the possibility of achiev-

ing the first best coordination of policies within a union. We have shown how

this is possible with a mechanism of transfers and taxes or subsidies. However

we also point out many political and administrative limitations of this solution.




                                       31
   The second result is that even in policy arena where externalities are high,

a “flexible” union in which both national and super national institutions are

involved in choosing policies is superior to a “rigid” one in which the union

level institutions have full control of policy decision.   We also investigate the

properties of alternative rules regulating the relationship between diﬀerent levels

of governments like the adoption of federal mandates.

   Finally, we analyse the implications of qualified majority voting (as opposed

to unanimity of simple majority rules) in our federal context. We show that

moving from unanimity to qualified majority voting tends to lead to greater

centralisation. Moreover, adopting qualified (as opposed to simple) majority

voting can correct against certain biases towards excessive centralisation that

arise in some cases. In AAE (2001), we point out one of such cases, which leads to

sub optimally small federations. The idea that once the union is formed, based

upon the expectation of a certain level of centralization, a majority of members

around the median have an incentive to centralize more. In anticipation of this

eﬀect, fewer countries will join to begin with, leading to federations that are

too small from the start. We show, in this paper, that qualified majority voting

poses limits on the policy involvement of the union. Hence, in the presence of

the bias discussed above, super majorities may be welfare improving.

6     Appendix


Proof of Proposition 1.


    The proof is composed of three steps. First, we rewrite the system of opti-

mality conditions, and than we show that the proposed mechanism induces an

identical equilibrium system. Finally we verify that the proposed mechanism

also satisfies budget balance.

    If we rewrite (4) as

                                                             PN                         P
                                  X                  1−β         j=1   αj Hg (gj∗ + β     k6=j    gk∗ )
              αi Hg (gi∗   +β            gj∗ )   =
                                                                         (1 − β)
                                  j6=i


and sum over all i’s, we obtain:

    N
                                                      "          PN                           P                   #
    X                      X                              1−β          j=1   αj Hg (gj∗ + β      k6=j     gk∗ )
          αi Hg (gi∗ + β          gj∗ ) = N                                    =
    j=1
                                                          (1 − β)
                           j6=i

                                                  βN        N            N
                                           =  1+                  =
                                                 1−β       1−β      1 + β(N − 1)

Substituting in the previous equation we obtain the equivalent expression:

                                                               N
                                   X                  1 − β 1+β(N−1)                     1
               αi Hg (gi∗ + β              gj∗ ) =                             =
                                                            (1 − β)                1 + β(N − 1)
                                   j6=i


Now, let us consider the system (9). Under the proposed mechanism, it becomes:
                                                      
                                  X                            1
     αi Hg gi [1 + β(N − 1)] + β      gj [1 + β(N − 1)] =
                                                       1 + β(N − 1)
                                                     j6=i


Since the two systems are identical they must have the same solutions:


                              gi [1 + β(N − 1)] = gi∗ i = 1, ..., N

                                                            33
Finally budget balance is satisfied because:
        N                N
                                                       ÃN          !                N
        X                X                β(N − 1)      X                           X
                   ∗
              gi · s =         Ti∗    =                      gi∗       = β(N − 1)         gi
        i=1              i=1
                                        1 + β(n − 1)   i=1                          i=1

hence the proposed mechanism is feasible and it implements the first best allo-

cation of public expenditure. Q.E.D.

union and under a rigid union:

gm [1 + β(N − 1)] = gm [1 + β(N − 1)]. Hence, for all countries i ≤ m and

the other countries for which gin = 0, it must be Φ(αi ) = gm − gm

The median country chooses gm      αm , E   j6=m gj    , where E    j6=m gj    is

the expectation of the sum of the individual expenditures of all the countries, to

maximize Um . Then, all the countries choose gin , i = 1, 2, ..., N , to maximize Ui .

Now, by totally diﬀerentiating the equilibrium first order condition for the in-

dividual contributions, we obtain:

                          dgin                       X dgjn
                            U
                               = −[1 + β(N − 1)] − β     U

                                       dg n
Subtracting from both sides          β dgUi   and simplifying we have:
                                         m

                                                          P      dgjn
                            dgin     [1 + β(N − 1)] +              U
                                                             j>b dgm
                              U

                            dgm                1−β

Summing over all j > b we get:
                                                   P                       
                                                                     dgjn

                                                                            

                    j>b

where Ñ is the number of countries with αj > αb , that is the number of countries

providing individual public expenditure, as previously determined. Solving, we

have:
                               X dgjn   Ñ [1 + β(N − 1)]
                                   U

                               j>b

Finally, substituting in the equilibrium condition for the federal choice of the

median country it follows that:
                                                             h              i
                 X                                              1 + β(Ñ − 1)

                      j>b


 18 Obviously,   if αb > αN , we are back to the equilibrium with a rigid union.

whose right hand side is strictly greater than   1+β(N −1)   as long as Ñ ≥ 1. Hence,

in this case, comparing the last equation with (6) we conclude that:

    gm [1 + β(N − 1)] < β         gjn + gm

         U
that is gm < gm . Q.E.D


   Proof of Proposition 5.


   Let us define the diﬀerence between utility from the equilibria under a union

adopting the federal mandate and under a rigid union as Φ̃(αi ). Consider the

median country; by revealed preferences it must be that:
             h n P                           o                      i
 Φ̃(αm ) = αm H β j>b gjn + gm
                             U
                               [1 + β(N − 1)] − H{gm [1 + β(N − 1)]} +
                                   ¡      U
                                            ¢
                                  + gm − gm   >0

which clearly implies Φ̃(αi ) ≥ 0 ∀ i ≤ m. Hence there is a strict majority in

favor of the union. Q.E.D


   Remark. With federal mandates we do not have necessarily unanimous

support for their adoption. Indeed for any j > b:

   Proposition 6.


   Suppose the provision of g U is decided by qualified majority, i.e., a majority

Q : N , where 1 ≥ Q/N > 1/2, is required to beat a given default option. Then:

   (i) For each Q : N , there is a corresponding ”Dominant Set” of options DQ

such that no option in this set can be beaten by Q : N by any other. DQ ≡

  U            U           U         U
{gN −Q ; ...; gQ }, where gN −Q and gQ are the options preferred respectively by

                                                                    U
the N − Qth and the Qth country (ranked in increasing order of α). gN −Q

               U
increases and gQ decreases as Q decreases between N (unanimity) and N/2

(simple majority). DQ collapses to the median option as Q approaches N/2.

   (ii) Let g0 be the maximum value of g U that is unamimously supported

against g U = 0. This “consensus option” under weak assumptions is strictly

positive (g0 > 0). Let this be the default option to be challenged by an alter-

native g U > g0 by a majority Q : N .       Then, for each Q : N , a compact

“g0 -Dominant” set ZQ ≡ {g0 ; ...; xU                         U
                                    Q } exisis for which all g ∈ ZQ beat g0 by a


majority Q : N . Moreover, xU
                            Q is a decreasing function of Q.


   (iii) Let WQ = DQ ∩ZQ . Then, WQ is the set of options that beat g0 and that

cannot be beaten by any other by a majority Q : N . We call this (intersection

of the Dominant and the g0 -Dominant sets) the ”Winning Set”. The Winning

Set includes all options that will emerge as winners if, starting from unanimity,

QMV is applied, one time or repeatedly, with the same quorum Q : N . The

winning option within WQ is indeterminate. Then:

   (a) For Q above a cutoﬀ Q, both the lower and upper bounds of the Winning

                                       38
Set increase as Q decreases.

   (b) For Q below the cutoﬀ Q, the lower (upper) bound of SQ increases (de-

creases) as Q decrease. The set WQ collapses to the median option as Q ap-

proaches N/2.

   (c) Q corresponds to the majority quorum for which max WQ = max ZQ .


   Proof. The properties of QMV have been first analysed by Black (1948), un-

der the assumption that preferences are single-peaked. Proposition 6(i) follows

directly from Black’s Lemma 5. Intuitively, under single-peaked preferences

only options located at the extremes can be beaten, because they can gather

suﬃcient opposition from voters located at the opposite extreme. Options lo-

cated around the center can never be beaten if the quorum is large enough.

Hence there is a compact Dominant Set DQ , located around the centre, that

can never be beaten by QMV by any alternative option. DQ tends to shrink as

the quorum declines from N to N/2. For Q → N/2, the median voter theorem

applies.

   Part 6(ii) follows from Black’s (1948) Theorem 13(b). The “g0 -Dominant”

set is given by ZQ ≡ {g0 ; ...; xU           U
                                 Q }, where xQ is defined as the option that is equiv-


alent to g0 for the “marginal country”, i.e. the country with lowest preference

for the public good within the qualified majority19 . Intuitively, all countries

that belong to that majority will support all options in ZQ against g0 . As Q

decreases, the marginal country will be characterised by a stronger preference

 19 Such   option must exist by assumption of single-peakedness of individual preferences.


                                              39
for the public good, hence shifting xU
                                     Q to the right.


   To prove Part 6(iii-a), we first show that WQ is not an empty set for Q

close to (and below) N . We need to show that around (and below) N , xU
                                                                      Q >

 U                    U
gN −Q . We know that gN −Q is the preferred option by the marginal country,


while xU
       Q is, for the same country, the option that is equivalent to g0 . Since

 U                      U                                      U    U
gN −Q > g0 (otherwise, gN −Q would be unanimously supported), xQ > gN −Q


by assumption of single peakedness, and WQ is non empty. Hence, for large

                 U            U
enough Q, WQ = {gN −Q ; ...; xQ }, and the rest of Proposition 6(iii-a) follows


directly from 6(i) and 6(ii).

                                                                    U
   So show Proposition 6(iii-b) it is suﬃcient to note that, since gQ decreases

with Q, there is a cutoﬀ point Q below which WQ = DQ . This cutoﬀ point is

defined by xU
            Q
                 U
              = gQ , or, equivalently, max WQ = max ZQ . QED.
