Resolving the Puzzle of the Underissuance of National Bank Notes

                                           ABSTRACT

The puzzle of underissuance of national bank notes disappears when one disaggregates data, takes

account of regulatory limits, and considers differences in opportunity costs. Banks with poor lending

opportunities maximized their issuance. Other banks chose to limit issuance. Redemption costs do

not explain cross-sectional variation in issuance and the observed relationship between note issuance

and excess reserves is inconsistent with the redemption risk hypothesis of underissuance. National

banks did not enter primarily to issue national bank notes, and a “pure arbitrage” strategy of

chartering a national bank only to issue national bank notes would not have been profitable. Indeed,

new entrants issued less while banks exiting were often maximum issuers. Economies of scope

between note issuing and deposit banking included shared overhead costs and the ability to reduce

costs of mandatory minimum reserve and capital requirements.

I. Introduction

       During the Civil War, the federal government began to charter national banks.

These banks enjoyed the privilege of being licensed to issue national bank notes, which

were default risk-free liabilities of the banks, backed 111% by U.S. Treasury bonds

deposited by issuing banks at the U.S. Treasury.1 The creation of these new banks,

combined with a 10% annual tax on state bank note issues, soon resulted in the

supplanting of state banks’ notes by the new national bank notes.

       Scholars have long puzzled over the observation that national banks did not take

greater advantage of the authority to issue notes. The aggregate supply of notes never

reached its maximum permissible level, despite calculations measuring the profitability

of allocating capital toward bank note supply collateralized by bonds (e.g., as derived by

Cagan 1965) indicating that national bank note issuance was more profitable than the

typical profit earned by allocating bank capital toward lending funded by a combination

of deposits and capital. Friedman and Schwartz (1963, p. 23) write:

       Before 1890 the amount outstanding ranged around 20 per cent of the possible
       maximum, by 1900 it had risen to about 28 per cent, and by World War I to about
       80 percent. The maximum was in fact approached only in the twenties, when for
       the first time U.S. bonds deposited to secure circulation and government deposits
       (which also required such security) nearly equaled the total of eligible bonds.
       Before 1905, the capital stock of national banks set narrower limits to their
       maximum possible note issue than did the total of eligible bonds, but the actual
       issue did not approach this lower limit either. Thereafter, the capital stock of
       national banks exceeded the total of eligible bonds and hence was not the
       effective limit on note issue. Yet, despite the failure to use fully the possibilities
       of note issue, the published market prices of government bonds bearing the
       circulation privilege were apparently always low enough to make note issue
       profitable except in the years 1884 to 1891. The fraction of the maximum issued
       fluctuated with the profitability of issue, but the fraction was throughout lower
       than might have been expected. We have no explanation for this puzzle.

 After 1874, banks also had to deposit a 5% minimum cash redemption fund at the Treasury in
addition to these bonds.


                                                                                              1
Friedman and Schwartz (1963) and Cagan (1965) argued that profits from note issue

were large on the margin, because bond issues to back note issues remained cheap and

because banks could easily leverage their capital devoted to those bond purchases.2 In

their discussions of potential constraints on bank note issues, they pointed to the more

than adequate aggregate supply of bonds, and while they recognized that regulations

constrained bank note issuing relative to bank capital, they argued that bank capital was

not a constraint because its aggregate amount exceeded the amount required for

increased note issues.

        The reasoning typically advanced to explain low national bank note issuance

posits hidden transacting costs, either in the form of physical note redemption costs or the

costs of maintaining cash balances in support of bank note issues. Authors like Bell

(1912), Cagan (1965), Goodhart (1965), Cagan and Schwartz (1991), Duggar and Rost

(1969), and Champ, Wallace, and Weber (1992) argue that redemption costs may have

been large enough to explain bankers’ reluctance to issue despite the seeming

profitability from expanding the supply of notes.

        James (1978) was the first to suggest that aggregate calculations, like those

provided by Cagan and Friedman and Schwartz, might be providing a misleading picture

of national bank note profitability. He showed that cross-sectional variation in the

regional supply of bank notes was large and consistent with regional variation in the

opportunity cost of note issuance (that is, regional variation in the profitability of bank


2
 Cagan and Schwartz (1991) point out that one can restate the puzzle of underissuance as the
puzzling absence of a large premium on U.S. Treasury bonds (i.e., lower bond yields). High
profits from note issuing should have led national banks to bid up the price of bonds (in order to
satisfy legal backing requirements for note issues), which should have raised the premium on
bonds, and thus eliminated allegedly excess profits.


                                                                                                     2
lending). In James’ view, at least some of the puzzle of low bank note issuance was

explicable by the high profitability of bank lending in the South and West, where note

issuance was relatively low. But James’ explanation was not a complete one. After

1874, there were no regional limits on note issuance, suggesting that banks in the East

(where loan profitability was relatively low) should have substantially increased their

outstanding notes. Why did the banks in the East not issue more notes?

       Hetherington (1990) showed that some of the time variation in the extent of note

issue could be explained by changes in rules governing note issues. But that approach

did not explain the puzzle posed by Friedman and Schwartz (1963) and Cagan (1965);

like James’ (1978) explanation of cross-state variation in note issuance, Hetherington’s

(1990) explanation of some of the variation in supply over time did not address the

persistent underissue of bank notes: the level of bank notes remained far below its

maximum despite the high profitability of note issuing.

       In this paper, we test the various theories of note underissuance with

microeconomic data. We are able to resolve much of the puzzle of note underissuance by

disaggregating data on national banks and analyzing individual banks’ note issuing

incentives and constraints. Friedman and Schwartz (1963) and Cagan (1965) compared

average profitability of note issuing and lending, and considered the aggregate supply of

bonds and the aggregate amount of bank capital. But that is not the correct way to take

account of regulatory constraints on note issues. It is possible that regulatory limits on

bank note issues were binding on many individual banks. If, as James argued, some

banks faced high opportunity costs (leading them to limit note issuing), and if other banks

earning lower profits from lending were issuing the maximum amount of notes that they




                                                                                             3
were permitted to issue by law, then it may be that there is no puzzle of “underissuance.”

We take account of the legal constraints facing individual banks that limited their

maximum (and minimum) permissible note issuance.

       In fact, we will show that many banks (61% of national banks in 1880 and 21% in

1900) were at a “corner solution” (issuing the maximum amount of notes that they could

legally issue), while other banks (which we are able to identify as banks with observably

higher opportunity costs) chose to issue less than their legal maxima. Thus, the puzzle of

national bank note issuance turns out to be largely an artifact of aggregation error.

       We develop a data set linking individual bank note issuing behavior, the specific

legal constraints on note issuing faced by each bank, and the profitability of bank lending.

Our dataset consists of individual bank data for all reporting national banks in 1880 and

1900. Our measures of the opportunities for lending include banks’ characteristics as well

as characteristics of the economic environment (county or state) in which banks operated.

       Section II models the equilibrium supply and demand for national bank notes, and

describes the legal limits on note supply. Section III reviews our data and summarizes the

note issuing behavior of national banks in 1880 and 1900. Section IV tests and rejects

Cagan’s (1965) redemption risk theory of underissuance. Section V documents and

explains the absence of pure note issuing “arbitrage” strategies by national banks; that is,

we show why national banks did not enter solely with the purpose of issuing notes.

Section VI provides Tobit regression analysis of the extent of individual bank note issues

relative to their maximum potential level in 1880 and 1900. The results lend support to

James’ opportunity cost theory of note issuing. Section VII analyzes patterns of entry and

exit by national banks between 1880 and 1900. Entry and exit patterns confirm the




                                                                                             4
findings in Sections V and VI, which indicate that note issuing was not a primary profit

center in U.S. banking. Section VIII concludes. Overall, we find that a combination of

legal restrictions on maximum note issuing and banks’ opportunity costs explain the

extent of bank note issuing in a manner consistent with bank profit maximization.



II. Supply and Demand for National Bank Notes

       The quantity of national bank notes in circulation should be determined by supply

and demand in the market for bank notes. While there were legislative limits placed on

the aggregate quantity of notes outstanding and on the geographic distribution of note

issuing, those aggregate limits were never binding constraints on individual bank

issuance. Prior to 1874, whenever the amount of notes came close to reaching the

maximum allowable supply, the law was changed to accommodate more note issues. In

1874, the law was changed to remove any aggregate limits on note issues, although the

limited supply of U.S. Treasury bonds (to serve as 111% collateral for note issues)

effectively placed a non-binding upper bound on the potential supply of notes.

       National bank notes were essentially perfect substitutes for transactions purposes

with U.S. notes (greenbacks) and coins, and traded at par with those alternative

transacting media (except briefly during 1873, when the special value to banks of holding

greenbacks, which were a legal reserve currency, led their value to temporarily exceed

that of bank notes – see Friedman and Schwartz 1963, pp. 21-2). National bank notes

and greenbacks were always inframarginal sources of transacting media whose quantity

was set by suppliers and who were unresponsive to shifts in the demand for transacting




                                                                                            5
media; increases in demand for transacting media on the margin were met by changes in

the supply of specie currency (see Calomiris 1988, 1994, Hetherington 1990).

       Equilibrium in international markets under the classical gold standard

simultaneously determined gold-denominated interest rates and specie flows to

equilibrate the markets for goods and money (Calomiris and Hubbard 1996). The supply

of national bank notes adjusted endogenously to the level of interest rates set in the

money market. Calomiris (1988, 1994) shows that (so long as the supply of Treasury

bonds to back national bank notes was greater than the amount demanded for that

purpose) the supply of national bank notes for banks that were not at a corner solution

should have been determined by (a) the yield on government bonds, (b) the profitability

of bank lending, and (c) the tax rate charged on national bank note issues. The supply of

notes, in this model, is set by the profit-maximizing choices of national banks about

whether to allocate marginal capital toward (a) the business of deposit taking and lending

or (b) the business of producing national bank notes, backed by government bond

purchases. In any empirical model of cross-sectional differences in note issuance (in

particular, for our sample of national banks in 1880) the profitability of lending is the

primary influence that should predict cross-sectional differences in the propensity to issue

notes, since the taxation rate and market yield on bonds are the same for all banks.

       Of course, this model does not apply on the margin to banks that are at a corner

solution, either because of legal limits on maximum issues that require them to issue less

than they would like, or legal limits on minimum issues that require them to issue more

than they would like. Among banks issuing the maximum permissible amount of notes,

cross-sectional variation in bank characteristics should have no explanatory power for




                                                                                            6
marginal note issuing, although those cross-sectional characteristics should help explain

which banks are at a corner solution. Thus, before applying the model to individual bank

data, one must take account of the various limits on note issuing that might constrain

banks to operate at a corner solution.

       Prior to 1882, the limits on note issues relating to capital for national banks were a

complex function of the capital levels and bond holdings of banks, and these limits varied

by the size of the bank and (due to grandfathering) by the date the bank was chartered.

These constraints are summarized in Table 1, and are based on National Monetary

Commission (1910). A bank chartered before March 1865 could not issue notes in

excess of 90% of the bank’s paid in capital. A bank chartered from March 1865 through

July 1870 was governed by the following limits on note issue relative to capital: A bank

with capital less than $500,000 could issue up to 90% of capital; a bank with capital of

between $500,000 and $1,000,000 could issue up to 80% of capital; a bank with capital

of between $1,000,000 and $3,000,000 could issue up to 75% of capital; and a bank with

capital in excess of $3,000,000 could issue up to 60% of capital. Banks chartered after

July 12, 1870 were governed by the following limits: No bank could issue more than

$500,000 in notes; banks with capital less than $500,000 could issue up to 90% of

capital; and banks with capital between $500,000 and $625,000 could issue up to 80% of

capital. In 1882, those requirements were supplanted by a single measure of maximum

note issue of 90% capital for all banks. In 1900 that restriction was raised to 100% of

capital. (The complexity of regulations on the maximum preceding 1882 is the primary

reason why previous literature has focused nearly exclusively on the period after that

year.) National banks that also had outstanding state bank issues (dating from the time




                                                                                            7
before they became national banks) had to include those notes in any measure of total

permissible note issues.

       All banks also faced an effective minimum note issuing requirement, since all

national banks were required to maintain government bond holdings of at least $30,000

or an amount equal to one third of bank capital, whichever was higher. (That requirement

was reduced to 25% of capital for banks with capital less than $150,000 in 1882.) To the

extent that a bank was constrained to hold the minimum amount of government bonds,

issuing notes backed by those bonds would have always been profitable (Hetherington

1990). As we shall show below, these ceilings and floors on permissible note issues were

often binding on individual banks.



III. Data on Individual Banks

       Our dataset consists of hand-collected information on 2,094 national banks in

1880, and 3,879 national banks in 1900. We also collected data about the states and

counties in which those banks resided. Data on counties are available only for decadal

census dates. We chose 1880 as a starting date for several reasons. First, by 1880, it is

reasonable to assume that banks had adjusted to the effects of the changes on note issuing

limits in 1874. Second, in January 1879 the U.S. resumed convertibility of dollars into

gold, an event that had been anticipated for several years prior to that time (Calomiris

1988). Analyzing note supply after resumption of convertibility simplifies the discussion

by permitting one to abstract from various complications associated with deflationary

expectations during the 1870s (Calomiris 1988). Third, as the above quotation from

Friedman and Schwartz (1963) shows, they regard the underissuance of national bank




                                                                                            8
notes during the periods before 1884 and after 1891 as especially puzzling. According to

Cagan (1965, p. 93), profitability on note issuing rose during the 1890s and accelerated as

the result of the Gold Standard Act of March 1900. Like 1880, 1900 was a time of

relatively high profitability from note issuing; both years have been viewed by previous

scholars as times of puzzling underissuance of profitable national bank notes.

        The dependent variable we analyze is the extent to which banks issued their

maximum permissible amount of national bank notes. Specifically, the dependent

variable, Issue Propensity (IP), is defined as:



IP =    (Actual Notes – Minimum Required Issuance) /

        (Maximum Permissible Notes – Minimum Required Issuance)



        Table 2 provides definitions of all the variables used in this study. Table 3

provides summary statistics. As shown in Table 3, in 1880 the median value of IP is

0.9889 and the mean is 0.8043. Fully 75% of national banks in 1880 have values of IP

greater than 0.7460. We assume that banks with IP greater than 98% are effectively at

their maximum amount of note issue (given potential rounding effects from the minimum

denomination of bond issues and random variation in outstanding notes associated with

redemptions). Thus, we assign all banks with a value of IP greater than or equal to 0.98 a

truncated value of IP equal to 0.98. Similarly, we assign banks with a value of IP less

than 0.02 a truncated value of IP equal to 0.02. Our truncated measure of IP, therefore,

varies between 0.02 and 0.98.3


3
 In 1880, 5 banks did not issue any notes at all. Another 117 banks issued fewer than supported by the
minimum required bond holdings. We classify all of these banks as minimum issuers. In 1900, 181 banks


                                                                                                         9
         Using 0.98 as our truncated measure of maximum note issuance, 61% of national

banks in 1880 were issuing the maximum amount of notes permitted. In other words,

61% of national banks were at a maximum corner solution in their issuing of national

bank notes. Another 7% of national banks in 1880 were at a minimum corner solution

(with a truncated value of IP equal to 0.02). The remaining 32% of national banks in

1880 had IP values between the truncated minimum and maximum values. Figure 1 plots

a histogram of the distribution of the truncated value of IP for all banks in 1880. Figure 2

plots a histogram of IP for the 32% of national banks that were neither at the maximum

nor at the minimum in 1880.

         Table 3 shows that the distribution of IP changed considerably by 1900. In 1900

the median value of IP is 0.0913 and the mean is 0.2919. Only 25% of national banks in

1900 have values of IP greater than 0.7600. Again using 0.02 as our truncated measure of

minimum note issuance, 49% of national banks in 1900 were issuing the minimum

amount of notes permitted. In other words, 49% of national banks were at a minimum

corner solution in their issuing of national bank notes. Another 21% of national banks in

1990 were at a maximum corner solution (with a truncated value of IP equal to 0.98). The

remaining 30% of national banks in 1900 had IP values between the truncated minimum

and maximum values. Figure 3 plots a histogram of the distribution of the truncated value

of IP for all banks in 1900. Figure 4 plots a histogram of IP for the 30% of national banks

that were neither at the maximum nor at the minimum in 1900.



did not issue any notes at all. Another 948 banks issued less than the minimum required bond holdings
suggest. We also classify these banks as minimum issuers. In 1880, 67 banks issue at levels slightly above
their statutory maximum. In 1900, 5 banks slightly exceeded the maximum issue allowed. We classify all
72 of these banks as maximum issuers. In most instances, exceptional cases are explicable in terms of some
combination of the following factors: small size, recent startup, or preexisting state bank note issues that
the regulators apparently chose to ignore.


                                                                                                         10
       Figure 5 plots the geographical distribution of national banks in 1880 and 1900

according to whether they were minimum issuers, maximum issuers, or other issuers

(which we call “discretionary” issuers). We divide the United States into six regions: the

Middle Atlantic (MIDATL), the Midwest (MIDWEST), the South (SOUTH), Appalachia

(APPAL), the West (WEST), and the Northeast (EAST). Given the high physical costs of

operating banks in cities, and potentially more profitable lending opportunities there, we

expected major cities’ national banks to display less propensity to issue bank notes.

Banks in New York City (NYC) are separately considered. We also consider the more

general category of urban (URBAN) banks (defined as banks located in the major cities

of New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, New Orleans, or San Francisco).

       Figure 5 shows that there were average differences across regions in IP in 1880,

and that those differences also appear in 1900. In each of these years, New England, the

Middle Atlantic, and Appalachia had higher proportions of banks at the maximum and

lower proportions at the minimum than banks in the corresponding year located in the

South, West, and Midwest. Interestingly, urban banks, and especially NYC banks, had

much lower proportions of maximum issuers, and much higher proportions of minimum

issuers than average banks in most regions of the country.

       The evidence on regional variation in note issuance is consistent with James’

(1978) opportunity cost explanation for cross-sectional differences in note issuance, but it

is conceivable that other factors (e.g., regional variation in redemption risks, and their

associated costs) could also explain these patterns. Thus, before returning to an empirical

investigation of the James hypothesis, we first investigate the extent to which redemption

risk might explain cross-sectional variation in note issuance.




                                                                                             11
IV. Cagan’s Redemption Risk Theory of Underissuance

        Cagan (1965, p. 95) specifically points to redemption risk as the most likely

explanation for the low issuance of national bank notes:

        The slow expansion [of national bank notes] suggests that national
        banks waited until it seemed certain that no reason to withdraw the notes
        would arise in the near future. Why a withdrawal need be feared, however,
        is not clear.

Cagan (p. 89) argued that the amount national banks held on deposit at the Treasury in

excess of the 5% minimum required redemption fund likely reflected, at least in part, a

form of precautionary reserve holdings, which should be included in the cost of issuing

notes. More generally, advocates of hidden redemption costs as the solution to the

national bank note issuance puzzle have focused on the risks of unpredictable

redemption.

        As Cagan recognized, it is not obvious that redemption risk should have been

significant in practice. National banks could pay out to the public each other’s notes

received from the public, and notes were default risk-free, thus, it is not clear why notes

would be presented at the Treasury or at any national bank, for redemption rather than

continue to circulate among banks and the public at par (except for reasons of wear and

tear).4 Furthermore, national banks could instruct the Treasury to sell bonds on deposit at

the Treasury to pay for redemption, or borrow in the interbank market (from a bank that

could take funds to the Treasury as needed) to finance redemption on short notice. To the

extent that transportation costs and idle notes may have represented hidden redemption

4
 Indeed, Cagan and Schwartz (1991) provide detailed criticisms of various arguments advanced
by other authors in support of the idea that redemption costs were significant. Cagan and
Schwartz also note (p. 303) that, circa 1900, notes were redeemed on average only once every 32
months.


                                                                                             12
costs, the Treasury routinely accepted notes for redemption at subtreasury offices located

in large reserve cities.5 Even if notes could not be reissued quickly after being returned

from the Treasury, banks could still invest them in the interbank deposit market, which

yielded about 2% throughout our period.

       Cagan’s discussion suggests a straightforward test of the proposition that the costs

of unpredictable redemption were important, and that the 5% minimum redemption fund

did not adequately eliminate the risk of redemption. If unpredictable redemption costs

were important, then national banks would have maintained excess reserves on deposit at

the Treasury (or perhaps in their vaults) to ensure their ability to redeem notes on

demand. Because the size of excess reserves maintained at the Treasury and in bank

vaults by each national bank is observable, one can test whether national banks held

precautionary balances against note issues, and whether the need for excess reserves to

mitigate the costs of redemption risk can explain regional differences in the propensity to

issue notes.

       The first thing to note about national banks’ excess balances at the Treasury is

that they were quite small. In 1880, total excess reserves at the Treasury were 0.61% of

total outstanding national bank notes. In 1900, they were 0.75% of national bank notes.

The cross sectional standard error of the ratio of excess treasury reserves to national bank

notes outstanding was 0.0010627 in 1880 and 0.0012327 in 1900. Clearly, the average

precautionary demand for excess reserves at the Treasury to mitigate the risk of sudden

redemption was small.




5
  Cagan and Schwartz (1991) cite estimates that some 85% to 90% of banks whose notes were
redeemed were located in those large reserve cities (p. 300).


                                                                                             13
       We employ regression analysis to test for a relationship between the scale of bank

note issue and the amount of excess reserves. If banks were concerned about redemption

risk, and if the desired excess reserve ratio is a constant fraction of notes outstanding

(after controlling for regional differences and other bank characteristics), then banks with

larger amounts of notes should hold larger amounts of excess reserves.

       Table 4 presents simple regression analysis of narrow reserves held at the

Treasury (since Cagan emphasized that component) as a ratio of total bank liabilities

(assets minus net worth), which we call TER, and the ratio of excess cash reserves

(including funds at the Treasury as well as those in the bank’s vault) relative to total bank

liabilities, which we call NER, for both 1880 and 1900. The model of the determinants of

reserve demand is taken from Calomiris and Mason (2004).

       The excess reserve demand regressions measure the relationship between excess

reserve holdings and various bank characteristics. Characteristics include bank balance

sheet characteristics and bank location characteristics. Location is captured both by

regional indicators, and by indicators that capture whether the bank is located in a

“reserve city” or a “central reserve city”. Banks located in reserve cities or central reserve

cities faced different regulatory requirements for deposits, and also different business

opportunities, which may have affected their demands for reserves.

       Bank balance sheet characteristics include bank leverage (total liabilities relative

to total assets, TLTA), the total amount of bank liabilities (log of total liabilities, LNTL),

and various measures of the mix of liabilities, the mix of assets, and the location of the

bank. Economies of scale in transactions demand for reserves is a common feature of all




                                                                                             14
empirical money demand models (Baumol 1952, Tobin 1956, Miller and Orr 1966) and

implies a negative relationship between total liabilities and the demand for reserves.

       Our measures of liability mix allow the demand for reserves to depend on liability

composition, which is likely to reflect differences in the volatility of withdrawals or

redemptions (as modeled in Miller and Orr 1966). These variables include the ratio of

bank notes relative to total liabilities (NTL), its square, NTLSQ (to allow for non-

linearity in this effect), and measures of deposit mix. Deposits are divided into three

categories: U.S. government deposits, interbank deposits, and deposits of the public. The

ratios of U.S. government deposits to total deposits is USDTD, and the ratio of interbank

deposits to total deposits is IBDTD. The ratio of public deposits to total deposits is the

omitted category of deposits.

       We also include the ratio of loans and discounts relative to securities (after

omitting U.S. government securities held as backing for bank notes), which we call

LOANRAT. LOANRAT can be thought of as a measure of the attractiveness of bank

lending opportunities as reflected in banks’ asset mix decisions. Calomiris and Wilson

(2004) show that superior lending opportunities result in lower reserve demand, ceteris

paribus.

       Our focus here is on the relationship between increases in bank notes and the

demand for excess reserves. Cagan’s precautionary reserve-demand hypothesis implies

that an increase in the total amount of national bank notes issued by the bank should

result in an increase in excess reserve holdings of the issuing bank.

       The regressions in Table 4 show that there is no statistically significant

relationship between the amount of national bank notes and the level of excess cash




                                                                                             15
reserves (measured either by TER or NER). Banks that issued larger amounts of notes,

ceteris paribus, did not hold larger amounts of excess cash reserves. Furthermore, with

the exception of the South, there is no evidence of regional variation in the target excess

reserve ratio of reserves held at the Treasury (TER). There is some evidence of regional

variation in NER, but that variation is not consistent over time, and it does not correspond

with the regional variation in note issuing described by James or by Figure 5. We

conclude that narrowly defined excess cash reserves (whether held at the Treasury or in

the bank vault) were generally unrelated to bank note issue. That evidence suggests that

banks believed that their 5% minimum redemption fund was more than adequate to

handle redemption risks from note issuance. Consequently, we conclude that the

hypothesized costly maintenance of cash balances to mitigate redemption risk cannot

explain the puzzle of underissuance of national bank notes.

        In Table 5, we broaden our definition of excess reserves to include total reserves

(specie, legal tender, deposits at the Treasury, plus deposits held at other banks) minus

the amount of required reserves (either at the bank or at the Treasury), relative to total

liabilities, which we call BER. We find that broadly defined reserve holdings are

negatively related to note issue, and that this relationship is statistically significant.

        It is important to remember that the relationship between notes and excess

reserves in Tables 4 and 5 is not univariate. As noted before, expanding the bank size to

increase note issuance implies not only an additional effect through NTLSQ, but also a

commensurate (111%) increase in assets and liabilities. Hence, Table 6 presents the total

marginal effects on excess reserves of a $100,000 increase in bank size brought about by

increasing note issuance accounting for the appropriate changes in TLTA, LNTL, NTL,




                                                                                             16
and NTLSQ at the variable means. The resulting marginal effect of increased note issue

is negative for all classes of reserves in Table 6, and is most negative for the broadest

class of reserves estimated in Table 5. Hence, it appears that note redemption was not a

risk that was magnified by increased note issue.

       The results in Table 5 not only contradict the redemption risk hypothesis, they

suggest a significant reduction in reserve management costs from issuing notes for the

average bank. We interpret this result as reflecting a complementarity (economy of

scope) between, on the one hand, note issuing, and on the other hand, deposit taking and

lending, which resulted from the fact that the 5% minimum cash reserve requirement on

notes was more than the amount warranted by actual redemption risk on notes. Under that

hypothesis, note-issuing banks could economize on the costs of maintaining desired

reserves associated with deposit taking and lending (motivated, for example, by portfolio

risk reduction) because the unwarranted high required reserves against notes could be

applied toward reducing the amount of excess reserves needed in the deposit taking and

lending arm of the bank. In other words, taken together, the results in Tables 4 and 5

indicate that redemption risks for notes were unusually low, and were more than

adequately dealt with by the minimum cash reserves held at the Treasury. Excessive

required reserves on note issues, however, reduced the demand for excess reserves for

other purposes. The economies of scope in reserve management also help to explain why

national banks combined deposit taking and note issuing, rather than specialize in note

issuing, since combining the two reduced the cost of note issuing (more on this point in

Section V below).




                                                                                            17
V. The Absence of Pure Arbitrage Strategies

       The fact that many banks issued the maximum permissible amount of notes in

1880 and 1900 presents one with two related puzzles of underissuance. First, one must

explain why some banks in existence did not issue the maximum amount of notes that

they could (we return to that question in Section VI below). Second, one must also

explain the lack of entry by pure “arbitragers” into the note issuing business. That second

question is addressed here.

       If note issuing were profitable, and if existing banks willing to issue notes had

already issued their legal maximum or had deployed their equity capital in the pursuit of

profitable alternative opportunities, one might still expect bank entry by new, purely note

issuing bankers. The scarcity of financial or human capital in the banking industry (which

was already being employed in other banks) would not constrain such investors, since

they had no need for knowledge of the businesses of lending and deposit taking. We term

entry by investors to establish a wholly note issuing national bank a “pure arbitrage”

strategy for issuing notes. In essence, such an arbitrage strategy would be a means of

taking advantage of an interest rate subsidy on “margin loans” from the government for

the purpose of purchasing government bonds.

       Interestingly, no national banks pursued this pure arbitrage strategy. As shown in

Table 7, which summarizes data on the ten banks in 1880 that had the lowest ratios of

assets other than government bonds relative to total assets (OTHASS) and the ten banks

in 1880 that had the lowest ratios of deposits to assets (DEPASS), all national banks were

involved in lending/investment and deposit taking to some degree. For example,

Montpelier National Bank, which maintained the lowest OTHASS ratio, had an OTHASS




                                                                                           18
ratio of 31.6% and a DEPASS ratio of 50.8%. Casco National Bank, which maintained

the lowest DEPASS ratio, had an OTHASS ratio of 97.2% and a DEPASS ratio of

33.2%. Results for 1900 (not reported here) are similar to those reported in Table 7,

although two banks in 1900 displayed low DEPASS ratios of 5.5% and 5.6%. But those

two banks displayed OTHASS ratios of 52.7% and 53.7%, respectively.

        When one considers the practical obstacles to pursuing a profitable pure arbitrage

strategy, it is not surprising that no national banks did so. A bank in 1880 establishing

itself solely to issue notes would have only pursued one of two strategies (summarized,

respectively, in Figures 6 and 7). The first strategy (illustrated in Figure 6) – to issue the

maximum amount of notes, equal to $500,000 – implied a required capital investment of

$625,000 in initial equity capital and an additional $125,000 in surplus capital, for a total

equity investment of $750,000.6 The bank would also have been required to maintain a

$25,000 redemption fund at the Treasury. The remaining $1,225,000 could be held in

government bonds. Long-term government bonds yielded roughly 3.5% in 1880.7 The

pre-tax annual earnings on these bonds would have been $42,875. The bank also had to

pay a tax equal to one percent of its outstanding national bank notes, or $5,000. Thus,

even if the bank faced no physical costs of operating, its after-tax earnings would equal

$37,875, implying a return on equity capital of 5.05%.

        A second possible strategy for 1880 is summarized in Figure 7. Here the bank

issues fewer notes ($449,999) in order to maintain paid in capital just below $500,000,

6
  The initial capital investment is necessary to satisfy the regulation that notes must be less than
80% of capital, if capital is above $500,000. The surplus capital requirement is set according to
the requirements of Sections 33 and 38 of the National Bank Act of June 3, 1864, which requires
that banks accumulate and retain surplus equal to 20% of paid in capital.
7
  According to Homer and Sylla (1991), p. 316, in 1880, U.S. government bonds maturing in
1891 had a yield to maturity of 3.45%, and U.S. government bonds maturing in 1907 had a yield
to maturity of 3.63%.


                                                                                                  19
and thus be able to issue 90% of its capital in notes (as opposed to only 80% of capital).

Assuming zero operating expenses, this bank has after-tax earnings of $31,463, and a

return on equity of 5.24%.

          In 1900, long-term Treasury bond yields were much lower, ranging from 1.7% to

2.12%, implying substantially lower returns on equity from a pure arbitrage strategy.8

Assuming a Treasury bond yield of 2% for 1900, and using the same methods for

computing profitability as in Figures 6 and 7, the banks issuing $500,000 and $449,999 in

notes, respectively, would earn returns on equity of 2.6% and 2.8%.

          This method for computing returns on equity results in values that are lower than

those described by Cagan or Friedman and Schwartz, but they are still unrealistically

high. A national bank would have undoubtedly had some minimal costs of operation,

even if it did not engage in lending or deposit taking. National banking law required at

least five members of the board of directors (who would have to meet and be

compensated for their time), and the hiring of employees (a president, vice president, and

cashier), the regular filing of accounts, the maintenance of a headquarters, and regular

bank examinations paid for by the national bank being examined. Section 54 of the Bank

Act of 1864 requires that examiners be compensated at the rate of $5 a day, plus $2 per

25 miles traveled on their way to the bank, all billed to the bank. We conservatively

estimate the physical costs of running a bare bones bank (rent, maintenance costs, wages,

examination fees, and accounting costs) at roughly $1,000 per year. That estimate

assumes that directors and officers serve at no cost, assumes a wage cost of $750 per year

(the estimated cost of employing a cashier to keep the bank’s premises, manage its

accounts, and meet with the examiner, assuming that the cashier is paid $2.50 per day),
8
    Homer and Sylla (1991), p. 343.


                                                                                           20
and rental, maintenance, and examination costs of an additional $250 per year. We add

to those costs the Comptroller’s initial redemption cost estimates in the range of $62.50

per $100,000 of notes, which Goodhart and others argued rose considerably due to

seasonal fluctuations in demand for monetary medium. Under these assumptions, total

operating costs for the banks operating in 1880, described in Figures 6 and 7, equal

$1,313 and $1,281, respectively. Those costs imply returns on equity of 4.87% and

5.03%, respectively. For the analogous banks operating in 1900, the implied returns on

equity would be 2.43% and 2.54%, respectively. Our estimates of physical costs are very

conservative, which may explain why the implied returns on equity are still above the

Comptroller’s miniscule estimates of returns to note issuance of 50-175 basis points in

1880 (Annual Report, p. 8). Nevertheless, these returns are quite modest, especially

considering the fact that note issuing did imply substantial interest rate risk.9

          Another way to think about the profit from the pure arbitrage strategy, which

takes into account interest rate risk, is to compare it to a similarly leveraged purchase of

government bonds. For example, assume that a state-chartered bank had established itself

purely with the intent of investing in government bonds, and had borrowed on the

interbank deposit market to fund that investment, and that it chose to maintain the same

balance sheet amounts as in Figures 6 and 7, but substituted interbank deposits for

national bank notes as a source of finance. That state-chartered bank would have been in

a somewhat inferior position to a national bank pursuing a pure arbitrage strategy for two

reasons: (1) the interest cost on interbank deposits is greater than the cost of finance from

bank notes (which is just the one percent tax on note issues), and (2) the national bank

does not bear as much interest rate risk as the state-chartered bank, since increases in
9
    For further discussion of interest rate risk, see Kuehlwein (1992).


                                                                                            21
interest rates have no effect on the required return paid on national bank notes (which are

always zero).

        Interbank deposit funding imposes an interest cost of roughly 2% during our time

period.10 Thus, abstracting from interest rate risk differences, the annual after-tax

national bank “subsidy” for its zero-interest margin loan from the government for

investing in government bonds would have been roughly one percent of the amount of

notes issued ($5,000 in the first example, and $4,500 in the second example).

        The difference in interest rate risk can be captured by considering the difference

in the sensitivity of bank equity to variation in the yields on long-term bonds for the two

hypothetical banks. For concreteness, assume that both the national and state-chartered

hypothetical banks had a Macaulay duration of assets of 10 years (reflecting their

holdings of government bonds with average maturities in excess of 10 years).

Alternatively, assume that the arbitragers expected to operate the banks for 10 years and

then liquidate them, implying a duration on bank notes of 10 years.11 Assume that

interbank deposits used to finance the state-chartered bank had a duration of ninety days

and assume (to be consistent with the examples in Figures 6 and 7) that the ratio of debt

to assets was 0.4. In a simple, one-factor model of interest rate risk, the sensitivity

(percentage decline) of bank equity value resulting from a one percent rise in interest

rates for the banks we consider is given by the following equation:

10
   John James (1976, p. 200) writes: “…explicit payment of interest was becoming a pervasive
practice in New York by the late 1880s, and at that time also the rate of interest stabilized at 2
percent…”
11
   Alternatively, one could assume an indefinite maturity of bank notes, if the founders of the
bank could have sold their stock in the bank to others upon their retirement. In the event, changes
in monetary regime rules brought an end to the license to issue national bank notes, and this was a
risk that arguably was known in advance. Thus, we think a 10-year expectation for the operation
of the national bank note issuing license is reasonable. Reasonable variation in that assumption
will not change our conclusions.


                                                                                                22
       DK = A/K [DA – (L/A) DL].

Under the above assumptions, the values of DK for the national and state-chartered banks

would be as follows: For the national bank, DK = 1.67 [10 - (0.4)10] = 10. For the state-

chartered bank, DK = 1.67 [10 – (0.4)(0.25)] = 16.53.

       How much would this difference in interest rate risk have mattered for the value

of the national bank? Judging from the small yield differences in 1880 on government

bonds with maturity dates of 1891 and 1907 (the first of which had a duration less than

10 years, and the second of which had a duration greater than 17 years), the market did

not view the added risk as very great. According to Homer and Sylla (1991, p. 316), in

1880, U.S. government bonds maturing in 1891 had a yield to maturity of 3.45%, and

U.S. government bonds maturing in 1907 had a yield to maturity of 3.63%, implying a

difference of 18 basis points.12 We conservatively estimate the value of the reduced risk

to the national bank at roughly 20 basis points of return on equity per year. In the

example in Figure 6, for 1880 that would amount to $1,500 of added annual value,

bringing the total subsidy to a pure arbitrager (before expenses) of $6,500 per year. In the

example in Figure 7, for 1880 the 20 basis point premium would add $1,200 of added

annual value, raising the total subsidy (before expenses) to $5,700 per year. The

analogous additions for 1900 would be smaller.

       Thus, around 1880, the annual gain (gross of physical expenses) from pursuing

the pure arbitrage strategy, taking into account the value from interest payments savings

and reduced interest rate risk, was roughly $6,500 on an equity investment of $750,000,

or $5,700 on an equity investment of $600,000 – in both cases, less than one percent of


12
  The difference for 1900 was even smaller. The Treasury bond maturing in 1907 had a yield of
1.70%, while the bond maturing in 1925 had a yield of 1.82% (Homer and Sylla 1991, p. 343).


                                                                                            23
equity invested. The gain from the subsidy net of physical expenses would have been

substantially lower, and possibly negative. In other words, the gain from using a national

bank charter as a vehicle for investing in U.S. government securities was nearly zero, and

perhaps negative, after one takes into account physical costs and the cost of risk. By

1900, that gain was even smaller.

       In summary, as an empirical matter, banks did not pursue the pure arbitrage

strategy. When one considers the limitations on leverage from the banking regulations,

the taxes on note issues, and the cost of operating even a “bare bones” national bank, it is

not surprising that pure arbitrage remained a hypothetical opportunity. Note issuance

was not profitable as a stand-alone strategy for a bank; note issuing was only profitable

when combined with lending and deposit taking. Note issuing was not the primary profit

center for a national bank. Note issuing, by itself, was not a viable business; it depended

for its profitability on economies of scope between note issuing and other banking

functions due to sharing physical costs of operating and diversifying risks. The empirical

work in Section VII further confirms that note issuing was of small and declining

profitability over time, as indicated by the low propensity to issue notes by banks

entering between 1880 and 1900.



VI. Regression Analysis

       We turn to regression analysis of our truncated measure of IP. We consider

whether observable differences in the attributes of issuers related to the opportunity cost

of issuing notes (i.e., lending profitability) explain their propensities to issue notes. As we

discussed above, and as James (1978) hypothesized, a bank’s opportunities other than




                                                                                            24
note issuing should have been important determinants of IP. Our measures of bank

opportunity costs, which we expect to be negatively associated with IP, take account of a

variety of those potentially relevant factors.

       First, as a measure of lending opportunities we include a measure of asset returns

– for assets other than U.S. Treasury securities held to secure note circulation – of banks

in the state in which the national bank is located, as one measure of bank profitability

(bank-level or county-level data on banks’ revenues and costs are not available). ROAL

is constructed by adjusting state-level ROA to remove the effect of interest earned on

U.S. Treasuries securing note circulation, using data on that year’s Treasury yields and

data on state-level note circulation to calculate the amount of Treasury securities backing

note issues. Of course, ROAL is a noisy indicator of lending opportunities for individual

banks because it is a state-level aggregate and also because it fails to capture dynamic

growth or contraction in expected loan opportunities, which would be relevant to bank

decisions about allocating capital between note production and lending. Thus, as

additional bank-level proxies, we also consider two other measures.

       We include the individual bank’s ratio of loans and discounts relative to its

holdings of securities (other than the U.S. Treasury bonds held to secure note circulation).

Banks with superior lending opportunities should maintain a higher LOANRAT. This

measure captures the portfolio allocation decisions of each bank, and takes into account

forward looking expectations of loan profitability.

       Finally, we include additional measures of opportunity cost related to the growth

and profitability of agriculture and manufacturing within the county (or counties) in

which the bank located, weighted by the importance of those sectors in the county




                                                                                           25
economy. For 1880 and 1900, both decadal census years, data on the amount of capital in

manufacturing, and on the amount of capital in agriculture, are available. These variables

can be used to measure the relative importance (weight) of each of the two sectors in the

local county economy, and also the growth rate of capital for the previous ten year period

prior to each of 1880 and 1900. The variables WDFK and WDMK measure the weighted

growth in farm and manufacturing capital within the county (or counties) in which the

bank is located, both for the 1880 and 1900. Additionally, for 1900, census data are also

available on the profitability of the manufacturing sector. For 1900, we include weighted

return on capital assets in manufacturing (WROAM) instead of WDMK as an alternative

measure of manufacturing profitability.

       We also include various control variables in our analysis related to the size, age,

and urban location of banks. Size is defined as asset size (SIZE) and bank age (AGE) is

defined as years since its national bank charter. The relationships between IP and bank

size and age are potentially complex. Ceteris paribus, because older banks were initially

allowed different maximum issue sizes, their IPs could be lower (because, ceteris paribus,

they are less likely to be constrained in their desired amounts of issues). Larger banks,

ceteris paribus, could have higher IP because they are more likely to be constrained by

the maximum issuance limit. But those implications about ceteris paribus associations

may not hold true in measured associations between IP and size and age variables

because size and age might be associated with marginal lending opportunities (more on

this point in Section VII below). Older and larger banks might have surplus capital

relative to new lending opportunities, for example, which could lead to a higher value of

IP. Thus, we include SIZE, AGE, and SIZExAGE as controls, since all three may be




                                                                                            26
relevant for predicting note issuing propensity, although we recognize that there are

multiple interpretations of the measured effects associated with these variables.

       We also include separate indicator variables to control for any special

characteristics of banks located in New York City (NYC), and for banks located in other

major cities listed above (URBAN).

       In Tables 8 and 9 (for national banks in 1880 and 1900, respectively) we report

Tobit regressions, which take into account the truncations that result from minimum and

maximum note issuing rules, and which measure the effects of opportunity cost and

control variables. For each year, we report specifications that alternately include or

exclude regional indicator variables. We begin with regressions that exclude all the

opportunity cost variables, but include regional indicators (a regression that is analogous

to James’s 1978 results). For 1880, we report three regressions – (1) with regional

indicators but without opportunity costs, (2) without regional indicators but with

opportunity costs, and (3) with both regional indicators and opportunity costs. For 1900,

we report four regressions, since we have two alternative measures of county-level

profitability of manufacturing (WDMK and WROAM).

       The results are broadly consistent with one another and with our hypothesized

opportunity cost effects. They indicate substantial variation in the propensity to issue

national bank notes that is traceable to county, state, and bank-specific characteristics

related to the profitability of lending. State-level ROAL enters negatively, but it is not

typically statistically significant. Bank-level LOANRAT enters negatively and

significantly. County-level WDFK enters negatively and significantly in 1880, but is less

significant in 1900. WDMK enters negatively and insignificantly for 1880 and 1900, but




                                                                                             27
the alternative measure of manufacturing profitability (WROAM) enters negatively and

significantly in 1900 (the only year for which these data are available).

       It is also interesting to note that the effect of the regional indicator variables for

MIDWEST, SOUTH, and WEST, remain negative and statistically significant in the

presence of the opportunity cost variables, which indicates that our measures of

opportunity cost still do not capture all of the important regional influences on note

issuing.

       Controls for SIZE, AGE, and SIZExAGE generally are significant and remain

significant in the presence of regional indicator variables. NYC and URBAN enter

negatively and sometimes significantly. Those effects may also indicate an opportunity

cost effect, since banks in cities may have had special lending opportunities that reduced

their propensity to issue notes.

       Our results provide support for James’ (1978) view that opportunity costs of

lending varied across banks and explain variation in the propensity to issue notes. Many

banks (with low lending opportunity costs) were at a corner solution with respect to note

issuing. Other banks (with high lending opportunity costs) issued less than the maximum

permissible amount of notes.



VII. Entry, Exit, and Bank Note Issuance

       The declining propensity to issue notes over time was reinforced by the exit of

high note issuers and the entry of low note issuers. Furthermore, the tendency for banks

in the MIDWEST, SOUTH, and WEST to issue fewer bank notes in 1880 and 1900 was




                                                                                                28
true of banks that survived the entire period, as well as those that entered between 1880

and 1900.

       Figure 8a illustrates that of the many national banks that entered the industry

between 1880 and 1900, only 17% of those that entered (411 of 2,381 entering banks)

chose a maximum note issue strategy while a full 55% (1,300 of 2,381) chose to issue at

the minimum. Furthermore, Figure 8b shows that 59% of those exiting the industry

during the period (275 out of 470 exiting banks) were maximum issuers, while only 10%

(46 of 470) were minimum issuers. Figure 5 illustrates that the majority of entry was in

the regions of low note issue – the MIDWEST, SOUTH, and WEST – where issuance

was already low. Because entering banks predominantly issued at the minimum possible

level, it appears (consistent with the discussion in section V) that those banks were

interested in opportunities other than note issuance. Hence, despite 118% growth in the

number of banks in the MIDWEST, 360% in the SOUTH, and 437% in the WEST, note

issuance remained suppressed in those regions.

       Figure 8c illustrates that, of banks that survived the period 1880-1900, 36% (546

of 1,508) were minimum issuers and a roughly equal amount, 26% (397 of 1,508), were

maximum issuers. Figure 8d shows that among those surviving banks, 26% maintained a

constant IP (despite changes in the method for computing IP in 1882) and 67% reduced

their IP across the period. Hence, only around 26% (397 banks) of banks that survived

the period and 17% (411 banks) of entering banks, for a total of 808 banks out of 3,492,

showed an interest in maximizing their note issuance in the period of 1880-1900.

       The fact that exiting banks tended to rely more on note issuing than average and

that entering banks focused less on note issuing than average while remaining banks




                                                                                            29
reduced their issuance over our period provides further evidence that note issuing was not

the primary profit center for national banks during our period. The regional patterns of

entry, and the fact that new entrants in the low-issuing regions were especially low note

issuers corroborates the James (1978) hypothesis that opportunities other than note

issuing were particularly high in those regions.



VIII. Conclusion

       The longstanding puzzle of underissuance of national bank notes disappears when

one disaggregates the data to the level of individual banks, takes account of the limits

banks faced on their maximum permissible note issues, and considers differences in

opportunity costs of note issuing across banks. Sixty-one percent of national banks in

1880 and twenty-one percent of national banks in 1900 were maximum note issuers.

Banks with low lending opportunities maximized their ability to issue notes, but could

not issue more than a certain amount. Other banks, with high lending opportunities,

rationally chose not to issue more notes.

       Models of redemption costs do not explain the substantial cross-sectional

variation in the extent to which national banks chose to issue national bank notes. The

theory that redemption risk explains underissuance of bank notes is inconsistent with the

observed lack of any relationship between bank note issuance and excess reserve

holdings.

       Furthermore, there seem to have been substantial economies of scope between

note issuing, on the one hand, and deposit taking and lending, on the other hand. Those

economies of scope probably included shared overhead costs as well as the ability to




                                                                                           30
economize on the costs of maintaining mandatory minimum levels of reserves and capital

when issuing notes. Combining deposit taking and note issuing allowed banks to make

full use of capital and reserves that were legally required in support of note issuing but

which exceeded warranted levels.

       National banks did not enter solely to issue national bank notes (what we call the

pure “arbitrage” strategy), and once one takes proper account of the regulatory limits on

issuance, and of the costs and benefits of entering purely to issue notes, that fact is not

surprising. Indeed, over the period 1880 to 1900, new entrants focused less on note

issuing, while banks exiting were more likely to be maximum issuers. Note issuing was

only profitable when combined with lending and deposit taking, and note issuing seems

to have been a relatively unprofitable line of business for successful bankers.

       The puzzle of underissuance of national bank notes appears in large part to be an

object lesson in the importance of disaggregating data, and thus avoiding misleading

“representative bank” analysis relating average bank behavior and average bank

opportunities.

Assuming that government bonds earn 3.5% and taking into account the 1% tax on notes
issued:

   Profits = 3.5% * 1,225 - 1% * 500

Dividing profits by capital and surplus yields:

Table 1: National Banking Laws Specifically Constraining Note Issue
 Constraints on Maximum Note Issue:

 1. If bank chartered before end of 1864, can issue up to 90% market value of bonds (not to exceed 90% of
 par if bonds pay greater than 5% interest), though not exceeding 100% capital. (p. 340 Act of March 3,
 1863) [coded the effective constraint as 90% of capital]

 2. If bank chartered from beginning of 1865 to July 1870 (p. 364 Act of March 3, 1865):
 • Banks with capital less than $500,000, can issue up to 90% capital;
 • Banks with capital more than $500,000 and less than $1,000,000 can issue up to 80% capital;
 • Banks with capital more than $1,000,000 and less than $3,000,000 can issue up to 75% capital;
 • Banks with capital greater than $3,000,000 can issue up to 60% capital.

 3. If bank chartered after 1870 then (p. 370 Act of July 12, 1870):
 • No bank chartered after July 12, 1870 may issue more than $500,000 total.
     -- Banks with capital less than $500,000, can issue up to 90% capital (previous provision unaltered);
     -- Banks with capital more than $500,000 and less than $625,000 can issue up to 80% capital
       (previous provision unaltered and 0.80*625,000=500,000);

 4. After July 12, 1882, all banks may issue up to 90% of the par value of bonds backing the note issue, not
 exceeding 90% of capital. On March 14, 1900, the requirement was further relaxed to 100% of the par value
 of the bonds, not exceeding 100% of capital.

 State bank notes not yet redeemed subsequent to conversion count as national bank notes in calculations of
 maxima.


 Constraints on Minimum Note Issue:

 Banks must hold bonds to back circulation amounting to the maximum of $30,000 or 33% of capital. Since
 banks must hold 111% of notes in bonds to back the circulation, these note constraints mean that banks may
 issue notes amounting to the greater of $30,000*(1/1.11)=$27,027 or 33%*Capital*(1/1.11). After July 12,
 1882, the minimum bond requirement was revised to 25% of capital for banks with capital less than
 $150,000.
