                                        ABSTRACT

This paper builds a 29-country numerical general equilibrium model with inside money and trade
cost to simulate and compare the effects of China and the US taking part in the Comprehensive
and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which is a high standard mega regional trade
agreement. Comparison results show that China will benefit CPTPP member countries more than
the US on trade, GDP, and manufacturing employment. China's entering the CPTPP can also
benefit most non-member countries on GDP and manufacturing employment. By joining, the US
will benefit the whole world more, as the US economic scale is larger than that of China. Our
simulation results reveal that China will be more welcomed to the CPTPP by member countries.

     Abstract: This paper builds a 29-country numerical general equilibrium model with inside
money and trade cost to simulate and compare the effects of China and the US taking part in the
Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which is a high standard mega
regional trade agreement. Comparison results show that China will benefit CPTPP member
countries more than the US on trade, GDP, and manufacturing employment. China's entering the
CPTPP can also benefit most non-member countries on GDP and manufacturing employment. By
joining, the US will benefit the whole world more, as the US economic scale is larger than that of
China.

1. Introduction

     In the context of anti-globalization trends such as populism and protectionism, promoting
regional economic integration has become an important way for countries to seek international
cooperation. On 8 March 2018, 11 economies (following the US exit) signed the Comprehensive
and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (CPTPP), which came into effect on 30
December 2018. As the first mega-free trade agreement in the Asia-Pacific region, the CPTPP
represents the standard of high-level FTAs, and it is also a new paradigm for regulatory cooperation
in regional trade agreements. Compared to previous trade agreements, the CPTPP has new features,
such as a wide range of terms, wide geographical coverage, and high standards. The birth of the
CPTPP has profound impacts on Asian trade patterns and global trade rules. In addition, the
CPTPP's conditions of entry into force are relatively loose, and the entry barriers are low, so it has
good prospects for capacity expansion. On 19 January 2019, Tokyo hosted the first ministerial
meeting of member states after the CPTPP took effect. The meeting specifically discussed the
member expansion rules and some prospective countries to join the CPTPP in the future, these
countries include Colombia, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, UK, etc.

     In recent years, China is trying to expand "friend group", for instance, actively promoting the
development of the "Belt and Road" initiative and accelerating the signing of the Regional
Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). China is not a CPTPP member, but has an open
mind about participating multilateral and regional trade cooperation, and China should seize the
chance for CPTPP expansion. Moreover, given that the CPTPP rules are less stringent than the TPP
rules and the controversial terms have been put on hold or suspended, it is easier for China to join.

                                                  2
Many CPTPP countries have expressed willingness for China's accession. In the meantime, it is
highly probably that the US will return to the CPTPP; the Trump administration has not ruled out
the possibility of rejoining. The possible reasons for the US return to CPTPP are as follows: First,
joining the CPTPP can get liberalization benefits. Second, the US tries to regain core discourse right
in multilateral trade, investment, finance, intellectual property, and other areas in the Asia-Pacific
region. Third, the US will consider making use of existing CPTPP multilateral rules to regain rule
dominance in the Asia Pacific. The above reasons have led the US government to re-examine the
value of the CPTPP.

      In the context of China-US trade frictions and the expansion of the CPTPP, if China and the
US come into the CPTPP, the economic impact on member states will receive widespread attention.
With the backdrop, this paper constructs a global general equilibrium (GE) numerical model to
simulate different scenarios for the US and China's participation in the CPTPP and quantifies the
economic effects of member states to measure which is more favored by CPTPP members. The
economic effects are mainly divided into the following aspects: GDP effect, welfare effect,
employment effect, and trade effect. In addition, we analyze the economic effects of the expansion
of the CPTPP to 16 member countries. The results show that in terms of GDP effect, employment
effect and trade effect, China's accession to the CPTPP can bring more economic benefits to
members than the US. On the contrary, if only welfare effect is taken into consideration, the benefits
of US membership in the CPTPP will be greater than China's. The contributions of this paper
include three points: First, it uses inside money to endogenously determine the trade imbalance
structure, which can increase the stability of the model and help to reflect the individual country's
preference for trade surplus. Second, introducing trade costs, including tariffs and non-tariff barriers,
into theoretical models can quantify the impact of rule and standard liberalization in CPTPP. Third,
it comprehensively quantifies and compares the impact of separately China and the US on
membership after entry into the CPTPP.

     The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review; section 3
describes the GE model, data, and parameter calibration; section 4 illustrates the results of the
quantitative analysis, which mainly compares the economic effects of China and the US after joining
the CPTPP on existing members and the expanded members; section 5 draws conclusions and
identifies policy implications.


2. Literature Review

      2.1 Theoretical Review
     Since 1995, the number of FTA negotiations involving major economies such as the US, EU,
China, and India, as well as small and medium-sized economies, have grown rapidly (Aggarwal and
Evenett, 2013). With the rise of bilateral or regional trade agreements, countries have developed a
set of complex and unmanageable accords, and each agreement has its own rules and procedures.
Various exceptions and limitations often make it difficult for companies to manage their global
supply chains, so these agreements may actually undermine rather than promote open trade.
Agreements with differing provisions and exclusions may cause the "noodle bowl" effect. In this
context, the establishment of so-called mega-FTAs can be viewed positively (Aggarwal, 2016).

                                                   3
Scholars hold different views on the compatibility of mega-FTAs with the WTO trade system. Stoler
(2014) considers that mega-FTAs have a competitive relationship with the WTO, and if all mega-
FTAs are successfully completed, the most important international goods, services, and investment
transactions of the participants would be comprehensively covered by preferential free trade
agreements, and most behind-the-border questions would be addressed through so-called "WTO-
plus" commitments. Inconsistent with this view, Urata (2016) argues that mega-FTAs and the WTO
can be complementary, as mega-FTAs can facilitate negotiations with fewer negotiating members.
Urata emphasizes the importance of extending mega-FTAs to a global level by accepting new
members and merging with other mega-FTAs. Although the existing research is rich in theoretical
evidence, most articles focus on the impact of mega-FTAs such as TPP, TTIP, and RCEP (Capling
and Ravengill, 2011; Wilson, 2015; Das, 2015; Capaldo and Izurieta, 2018; Lin et al., 2018; Steiner,
2018; Lee, 2019), and the available literature pays insufficient attention to the CPTPP. Ji and Rana
(2019) examine the role of the US in the rise and fall of the TPP, and they lay out informed conjecture
about the future of the CPTPP. Corr et al. (2019) discuss the potential impact of CPTPP's entry into
force on global trade, arguing that this includes not only country-specific implications for select
parties, but also trade development implications for non-member countries. However, these articles
only include qualitative analysis and lack quantitative evaluation.

     2.2 Empirical Review
      The numerical GE methodology is one of the most widely used techniques for evaluating the
potential economic implications of trade agreements; it is employed for the analysis of regional
trade agreement effects using real economic data (Shoven and Whalley, 1992; Gilbert and Scollay,
2000; Zhai, 2008; Areerat et al., 2012; Jean et al., 2014). This kind of quantitative research on the
economic impact of trade agreements occupies a dominant position in the existing literature, and
mega-FTAs are the focus of attention. Peter et al. (2016) estimates the effects of the TPP, suggesting
that the TPP will yield substantial gains for Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam, while the US will be the
largest beneficiary of the agreement. Gilbert et al. (2016) examines the TPP in comparison to two
other major mega-FTAs: the RCEP and the FTAAP. They also consider the implications of a possible
expansion of the TPP to include countries that have indicated an interest in joining in future. Li et
al. (2016) explores the potential impacts on both China and other major countries of possible mega
trade deals. Their simulation results reveal that the RCEP and the China-TPP will generate the
highest welfare outcomes for China. Khan et al. (2018) evaluates the likely impacts of the CPTPP
on the trade flows and other macroeconomic aggregates of Pakistan, and the results show that
Pakistan's proposed entry to the CPTPP will not only yield a wide gain but will reduce the gap
between poor and rich.

     Nevertheless, these articles rarely explore and compare the effects of alternative China and the
US joining the CPTPP. At the same time, few studies have considered the model of trade cost and
the endogenous structure of trade imbalance. Based on related research, and according to the latest
results of the CPTPP negotiations, this article evaluates the economic impact of China and the US'
accession to the CPTPP by constructing a global GE model. It also analyzes which countries will
benefit more from the participation of either China or the US in different scenarios.


3. GE Model and Data
                                                  4
     3.1 GE Model
     We build a global GE model and add a monetary structure using inside money following
Whalley et al. (2011) to endogenously determine the trade imbalance. In our global GE model with
monetary structure, we allow inter-commodity trade to coexist within the period along with trade in
debt in the form of inside money. We use a single period model where either claim on future
consumption (money holding) or future consumption liabilities (money issuance) enter the utility
function as incremental future consumption from current period savings. This is the formulation of
inside money that Archibald and Lipsey (1960) uses.

      On the production side of the model, we assume a CES technology for production of each good
in each country. On the consumption side, we use the Armington assumption of product
heterogeneity across countries and assume claims on future consumption enter preferences and are
traded between countries. Each country can thus either issue or buy claims on future consumption
using current period income. We use a nested CES utility function to capture consumption: the first
layer structure is goods selection between different products, including tradable goods, non-tradable
goods, and inside money; the second layer structure is goods selection between products produced
in different countries (see Figure 1).

   Production Functions (CES)                        Consumption Functions (Nested CES)

                                        China        US          EU       ......   ROW

             Figure 1: Nesting Structure in Production and Consumption Functions

      We introduce trade costs into the model. Trade costs include not only import tariffs but also
other non-tariff barriers such as transportation costs, language barriers, and institutional barriers.
We divide trade costs into two parts in our model: import tariffs and non-tariff trade costs. Tariffs
collect revenue and increase government income. Non-tariff barriers are different from import tariffs:
they cannot collect revenue, and importers need to use actual resources to cover the costs involved.
In the numerical model, we assume that the resource costs involved in overcoming all other non-
tariff barriers are denominated in terms of domestic non-tradable goods. We incorporate this
resource using feature through the use of non-tradable goods equal in value terms to the cost of the
barrier. We thus assume reduced non-tariff trade costs (including transportation costs) will thus
occur under trade liberalization as an increase in non-tradable goods consumption by the
representative consumer in importing countries.

     For trade imbalance modelling, we introduce the internal currency imbalance structure of
inside money. The principle is to allow the trade of products and the trade of debt expressed in
internal currency to exist simultaneously. The utility function includes the claim of future
                                                          5
consumption (holding currency). The debt of consumption (issuing currency) represents the increase
in future consumption caused by current savings. At the same time, the internal currency enters the
utility function and sets the internal currency as equal to the level of the trade imbalance. Specifically,

Yi represents both inside money (debt) held by country i and country i ' s trade imbalance.

Yi > 0 implies a trade surplus (or positive claims on future consumption); Yi < 0 implies a trade

deficit or future consumption liabilities (effectively money issuance), and Yi = 0 implies a trade

balance. For trade deficit countries, utility will decrease in inside money since they are issuers. To

capture this, given that Yi < 0 for these countries, we use an upper bound Y 0 in the utility

function in a term [ Y 0 + Yi ] and assume that Y 0 is large enough to ensure that Y 0 + Yi > 0 . We

                       =
use the transformation yi Y 0 + Yi to solve the optimization problem.

     The model equilibrium conditions include the factor market clearing, product market clearing,
global trade clearing, and zero-profit conditions in a perfectly competitive market. All markets
clearing at the same time determine the equilibrium of the model.

     3.2 Data and Parameters Calibration

     We use 2013 as our base year in building a benchmark numerical GE dataset for use in
calibration and simulation. We include 29 countries/regions in our numerical model, which are
Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, the European Union, India, Indonesia,
Japan, Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Oman, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the
Philippines, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, the US,
Vietnam, and ROW (rest of world). Production factors in our numerical models include capital (K)
and labor (L). We include only two goods in our model structures, which are tradable goods and
non-tradable goods.

      Factor input and production data for all countries are calculated from the World Bank's WDI
database. We use agriculture and service share of GDP data and GDP data to yield production data
for tradable and non-tradable goods, and we use capital/GDP ratios to yield capital and labor inputs
in production. We set the upper bound in our monetary structure as equal to 1,000 billion dollars for
all countries. We use world values minus all individual countries to generate ROW values. For the
two goods, we assume that secondary industries (manufacturing) reflect tradable goods, and primary
and tertiary industries (agriculture, extractive industries, and services) yield non-tradable goods. For
the two factor inputs, we use total labor income (wages) to denote labor values for inputs by sector.
We adjust some of the data values for mutual consistency for calibration purposes.

    Trade data between each pair of countries are from the UN Comtrade database. We use total
export and import values for individual countries to indirectly yield exports to and imports from the
ROW. Using production and trade data, we can then calculate each country's consumption values.
We calculate trade costs following the approaches in Novy (2013), and we obtain each country's

                                                    6
import tariff data from the WTO Statistics Database. We cannot obtain the ROW import tariff
directly, so we use the world average tariff rate to denote its value. We calculate non-tariff barriers
using trade costs minus import tariffs.

      There are no available estimates of elasticities for individual countries on the demand and
production sides of the model. Many of the estimates of domestic and import goods substitution
elasticity are around 2, so we set all these elasticities in our model to 2 (Whalley and Wang, 2010).
We change these elasticities in our sensitivity analysis to check their influence on simulation results.

      Using the real data listed above, we calibrate the parameters in the model by setting the
parameters in the model as variables. Assuming the variables as parameters, we use the real data to
solve the model's equilibrium and then the inverse calculation to determine the model's parameter
values. After the numerical general equilibrium model system is established, it is also necessary to
test its validity. We use the numerical model system to simulate real economic variables and
compare model simulation values with real data to check the reliability of the numerical model. Our
test reveals that the numerical model is reliable.


4. Simulation Results

     We report simulation results to check which country, China or the US, will benefit CPTPP
member countries more. We simulate the participation of China and the US separately and compare
the effects. Additionally, we compare effects after the CPTPP member expansion to 16 countries.
Finally, we perform a sensitivity analysis on elasticities and non-tariff barriers. In each scenario, we
explore both the trade cost elimination effects and the border tariff elimination effects. The trade
cost elimination simulations are our main results, and the border tariff elimination results act as a
reference. As it is difficult to accurately evaluate the non-tariff barriers elimination level by the
CPTPP, we assume the non-tariff barriers can decrease by 40% according to CPTPP rules and
standards. In order to reduce the randomness of the non-tariff barrier reduction level, we perform a
sensitivity analysis for non-tariff barriers. The results of the above simulations are analyzed in the
following sections.

     4.1 GDP Effect Comparison with China or US in CPTPP

     Table 1 illustrates the impact of China or the US' accession on GDP. Overall, China's entry
 into the CPTPP will yield more benefits to member countries. From the comparison of members,
 the countries that benefit most from China's accession are Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand,
 Singapore, Peru, and Chile. Their gains are 1.764%, 3.119%, 0.896%, 0.815%, 1.002%, and 2.115%
 respectively under trade cost eliminations condition. A possible reason for such benefits is that
 China has a large bilateral trade volume with these countries, which in turn makes these countries
 more dependent on China's market. Compared to non-members, China's accession to the CPTPP
 can reduce their GDP loss and even benefit some countries. China is an important economy in the
 Asia-Pacific region, and it can play a role in promoting economic growth with trade agreements.

     However, the benefit brought by US's accession to the whole world is significantly larger than
 that of China. As the US economic scale is larger than that of China, therefore the US taking part

                                                   7
 in CPTPP and further opening up the market can benefit the world more than China. Additionally,
 the simulation results of border tariff elimination conditions are basically consistent with the
 conclusions drawn from the results under trade cost eliminations conditions.

     4.2 Welfare Effect Comparison with China or US in CPTPP

     We use the Hicks equivalent variation (EV) as a percent share of GDP, and the Hicks
compensation variation (CV) as a percent share of GDP to indicate the welfare effect. The
definitions of EV and CV are

      EV =e( p , v( p , m )) - e( p , v( p , m )) =e( p , v( p , m )) - m
              0       1    1           0        0    0       0       1    1        0

                                                                                                                      (1)
     CV =
          e( p1 , v( p1 , m1 )) - e( p1 , v( p 0 , m0 )) =
                                                         m1 - e( p1 , v( p 0 , m0 ))

    Table 2 and Table 3 report the impact of China or the US accessing the CPTPP on welfare. In

                                                              8
general, the US will benefit more member countries than China to join the CPTPP. In terms of
members, except for Canada, Mexico, and Vietnam, the US joining CPTPP will benefit them more.
In terms of non-members, including the world, welfare effect of US participation in CPTPP is
significantly better than that of China. We take New Zealand as an example to compare effects,
when China or the US joins the CPTPP, EV as a share of GDP will separately increase 7.982% and
2.465% under trade cost elimination condition. It is obvious that the US in CPTPP will generate
more welfare gains than China in to New Zealand.

    4.3 Employment Effect Comparison with China or US in CPTPP

    Table 4 reports the impact of China or the US in CPTPP on manufacturing employment. In
general, China's participation in CPTPP will bring more benefits to both member and non-member
countries. We take the trade cost elimination condition as an example, China will benefit more
member countries of Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Peru, Brunei and Chile. For
non-member countries, most of them will lose with CPTPP, but their losses will decrease when
China in CPTPP. Simulation results under border tariff elimination conditions are nearly the same.

     In terms of world as a whole, the US' entry can increase the overall manufacturing employment
more than China in the agreement. Under trade cost elimination condition, China's in CPTPP will
increase world manufacturing employment by 0.313%, and the US in will increase by 1.275%.
Comparing the simulation results under the scenario of border tariff elimination, world
manufacturing employment with China and US in will increase separately 0.224% and 1.082%.

     4.4 Trade Effect Comparison with China or US in CPTPP

     Trade effect comparison with China or US in CPTPP shows that a little more member countries
will gain more if China in CPTPP, but most non-member countries will gain more if the US in
CPTPP. For member countries, China's in will benefit Japan, Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand,
Vietnam and Chile more on trade. For non-member countries, China's in only can benefit Brazil
more than the US in. For the world as a whole, the US in also will benefit it significantly more than
China in. Simulation results under trade cost elimination condition and border tariff elimination
condition are nearly the same. We take the trade effect of Canada and Mexico under border tariff
elimination condition as examples, Canada's trade with China in and the US in are separately
increasing by 1.162% and 9.951%, and Mexico's trade with China in and the US in are separately
increasing by 1.178% and 8.945%. The reason may be that the US is main trade partner of Canada
and Mexico (see Table 5).

     4.5 Effects Comparison with More Countries Entering CPTPP

      The CPTPP was designed to be an open and inclusive agreement. Other countries, including
Colombia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, South Korea, and Sri Lanka, have expressed interest
in joining the agreement. The UK stated that it would consider joining the CPTPP after Brexit, and
the EU also announced that it would maintain a long-term cooperative and mutually beneficial
relationship with CPTPP. At present, the countries that have formally proposed joining the CPTPP
are Colombia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and South Korea. If these countries sign the
agreement, a 16-country CPTPP will be formed. Few studies have discussed the expansion of the
CPTPP.

     Based on the development prospects of the CPTPP, we additionally compares the economic
impacts of China and the US' entry into a 16-country agreement, as displayed in Table 6 and Table
7. For member countries, simulation results under the trade cost elimination and under border tariff
elimination consistently show that China's accession can bring more benefits to member countries
on GDP effect and manufacturing employment effect, while the US' accession has more advantages
to member countries on the welfare and trade effects. Similarly, non-member countries and the
whole world will gain more from the welfare and trade effects if the US rejoins the CPTPP. The
simulation results under border tariff elimination condition show same effects, which prove the
reliability of our findings.

      4.6 Sensitivity Analysis to Elasticities and Non-Tariff Barriers

      In the numerical simulation of GE models, owing to the uncertainty of the values of some
parameters, it is usually necessary to analyze the sensitivity of the simulation results with respect to
parameter settings. If the simulation results are not very sensitive, or if they are insensitive, to
parameter changes, it means that the simulation results are reliable. Moreover, the level of reduction
of non-tariff barriers is also an important issue to be determined by simulation analysis. However,
the reduction of non-tariff barriers is a difficult problem to quantify in trade agreements, and even
if there are specific negotiation goals, it cannot be measured. Since the level of reduction of non-
tariff barriers is assumed to be random, we also need to perform a sensitivity analysis on the relevant
results.

      We perform sensitivity analysis to both elasticities and non-tariff barriers in this part. As the
elasticities of substitution in production function and demand function is set to 2 according other
references, we change the elasticities of substitution from 1.5 to 4.5. Meanwhile, we change the
level of non-tariff barriers reduction in the model to 20% and 60%. For simplicity, we just report
the sensitivity analysis results on GDP effect under trade cost elimination scenarios. Results are
shown in Table 8.

     The results of the elasticity sensitivity analysis show that although the number of countries
benefiting from China's accession to the CPTPP decreased with the increase in the value of elasticity,
China's accession still has certain advantages as a whole, so the elasticity sensitivity test is reliable.
Additionally, the non-tariff barrier sensitivity analysis results show that when the non-tariff barrier
elimination takes different values, the change in GDP effect is not obvious, which means that the
simulation results and conclusions are reliable. To sum up, both the elastic sensitivity analysis and
the non-tariff barrier sensitivity analysis prove the credibility of all of the numerical simulation
results in the paper.

5. Conclusions

     This paper builds a large numerical GE model with endogenous trade imbalance and trade cost
that can be divided into tariff and non-tariff barriers. We calibrate and estimate model parameters
with real-world economic data. Then we use the counterfactual simulation methodology to explore
and compare the related economic effects of either China or the US joining the CPTPP.

     The simulation results reveal that: (1) As far as member countries are concerned, China's entry
into the CPTPP can benefit more countries in terms of GDP effects, manufacturing employment
effects, and trade effects; (2) For non-member states and potential member states, China's accession
can benefit more countries in the GDP effect and employment effect; (3) For the world as a whole,
the returns of the US in CPTPP are larger in all specific effects, including GDP, welfare,
manufacturing employment and trade. In general, our simulation results show that China's accession
to the CPTPP will be more welcomed by member states.
