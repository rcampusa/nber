Tackling the Substance Abuse Crisis: The Role of Access to Treatment Facilities
Adriana Corredor-Waldron and Janet Currie
NBER Working Paper No. 28862
May 2021
JEL No. I12

                                         ABSTRACT

The continuing drug overdose crisis in the U.S. has highlighted the urgent need for greater access
to treatment. This paper examines the impact of openings and closings of substance abuse
treatment facilities in New Jersey on emergency room visits for substance abuse issues among
nearby residents. We find that drug-related ER visits increase by 16.6% after a facility closure
and decrease by 9.5%after an opening. The effects are largest in relatively under-served areas,
among Black residents, and among males. They are smaller for the middle aged than for either
younger or older people. The results suggest that expanding access to treatment results in
significant reductions in morbidity related to drug abuse.

U.S. deaths due to drug overdoses, mainly involving opioids, have more than tripled since 1999,

and reached 81,000 in the 12 months ending in May 2020 (CDC, 2020). The number of deaths

due to opioids dwarfs the toll from previous drug epidemics in the U.S. Currie and Schwandt

(2021) show that without these overdose deaths, U.S. life expectancy would have continued to rise

after 2013 instead of falling. Aside from the death toll, it is estimated that nearly 1 in 15 individuals

aged 12 and older (20.4 million individuals in 2019) are living with a substance abuse disorder in

the U.S. These stark statistics have fueled calls for increased access to substance abuse treatment

(US DHHS, 2016).

        Yet it is unclear what, in an ideal world, expanded access to care would look like.           In

practice, the number of inpatient psychiatric beds available for in-patient detox and care of

substance abuse patients has fallen, while the number of outpatient clinics for substance abuse has

been growing over time.       Still, there are many reports that long waiting lists remain a major

impediment to treatment (Stirling, 2014). Others argue that outpatient treatment is inadequate and

more in-patient hospital beds are needed (Mulford, 2015). In New Jersey, only 243 out of 28,350

people treated for substance abuse received in-patient treatment in 2008, while in 2015 the number

was 401 out of 34,951 individuals (N-SSATS, 2008-2015).

        However, some research suggests that there is little difference between inpatient and

residential or outpatient care in terms of treatment effectiveness so that lower cost outpatient care

is to be preferred (Mojtabai and Graff Zivin, 2003). Still, residential treatment centers and

outpatient clinics are lightly regulated in terms of treatment modalities, staff training, and fees, and

there have been reports of shoddy care and outright insurance fraud, sometimes with lethal

consequences for patients (Seville et al., 2017). Hence, it is not clear to what extent the expansion
                                                                                                    4


of substance abuse treatment facilities has actually improved the availability of effective

treatments.

        We examine this question using data on the openings and closings of substance abuse

treatment centers in New Jersey from 2005-2020, combined with information about all Emergency

Room (ER) visits from 2008-2015. Emergency room visits are an important outcome both because

drug overdoses and related morbidities place a significant burden on emergency medical services,

and because ER data offers one of the more reliable ways to track the toll of drug abuse (Samuels,

2019). McGeary and French (2000) find that chronic illicit drug use increases patient's use of ERs

by about a third. The ER data also allow us to distinguish between visits for substance abuse,

visits for mental health, visits for co-occurring mental health and substance abuse, and visits for

other reasons. Since many people have co-morbid mental health and substance abuse conditions,

it is possible that access to substance abuse treatment centers could also impact ER visits for mental

health, and to a lesser extent, illness and injury.

        We consider several dimensions of access, starting with proximity. Previous research has

suggested that patients who need to travel more than about four miles to receive substance abuse

treatment are more likely to drop out of treatment (Beardsley et al., 2003). By examining changes

in distance to the nearest clinic as well as clinic openings in previously un-served zip code

tabulation areas (ZCTAs), we verify the importance of distance. We find that drug-related ER

visits fall by 9.5% after a first clinic opening in a ZCTA. However, even in areas with several

clinics, treatment slots may be rationed. We find that clinic closures increase drug-related ER

visits by 16.6% even though the geographic clustering of clinics means that most closings occur

in areas with other clinics.
                                                                                                    5


       Another important question is whether the type of treatment matters. Over our sample

period, the majority of the substance abuse treatment facilities in New Jersey were outpatient

clinics (rather than residential facilities) and relatively few facilities offered medication assisted

treatment (MAT) even though MAT has been shown to save lives by preventing overdoses

(National Academy of Sciences, 2019). Hence our power to measure the effectiveness of different

types of treatment is limited. However, we show that our main results are robust to excluding

these types of facilities, suggesting that improving access to even ordinary outpatient treatment

facilities without MAT effectively reduces drug-related ER visits.

       Lastly, we examine the impact of openings and closings separately by demographic group.

The results suggest that Black people and youths 15-24 are most affected by proximity, in keeping

with the idea that they may face larger transportation barriers. Males are also more impacted than

females, in keeping with higher rates of ER use for drug-abuse.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides some background.

Sections 3 and 4 provide an overview of the data and empirical methods, respectively. The results

are in Section 5 and Section 6 concludes.



2. Background

       Substance abuse is now thought to be a disease that involves both physical and

psychological dependence. As such, recovery from substance abuse usually requires intensive

treatment. There are different treatment modalities, but they all typically involve frequent visits

to a facility, which suggests that proximity may be especially important for the success of

substance abuse treatment.
                                                                                                    6


       Substance abuse treatment facilities differ from the typical healthcare facility: Most care,

measured in terms of hours of service, is provided by counseling staff (66% across all facilities).

Counseling staff and other support staff (e.g. peer support staff, social workers, and care managers)

represent 42% and 21% of paid FTEs. Medical staff represents 19%. Only MAT facilities are

required to have a physician as medical director, but the physician does not need to be present at

all times (N-SSATS 2016, Health Workforce Module).

       New Jersey regulates patient-to-staff ratios. All substance abuse treatment facilities are

required to maintain an average ratio of substance abuse counselors to clients, which changes with

the type of facility. For example, outpatient facilities without MAT must maintain a 1:35 ratio

while centers with MAT are required to maintain a 1:50 ratio. (NJ 10:161B-10.1). If facilities do

not comply with these requirements their licenses may be at risk. Thus, is not evident that

surrounding facilities can take the clients from the closed facility when a facility shuts down.

       Although the effectiveness of typical community care for substance abuse is an urgent

question, it is difficult to find data that allows it to be studied. Because of the stigma associated

with drug abuse (in addition to possible legal issues for patients) the U.S. Substance Abuse and

Mental Health Services Administration has removed geographical information from its machine-

readable data sets in order to protect patient privacy. Hence, there is no existing publicly available

data set with comprehensive information about facility locations and dates of operation.

       Moreover, it is difficult to find large-scale administrative data with information about an

individual's substance abuse, care received, and subsequent outcomes. As a result, much of the

existing literature focuses on data on admissions to treatment and outcomes at the county level.

For example, Bondurant, Lindo and Swensen (2018) use county-level data to examine the impact

of the openings and closings of treatment centers on crime rates. They find some evidence that
                                                                                                   7


substance abuse centers reduced crime in the most populous counties. Swensen (2015) uses

county-year level data and also focuses on openings and closings. He finds that a 10% increase in

the number of facilities lowers a county's drug-induced mortality rate by 2%.

       Ettner et al. (2006) collected their own longitudinal data from 43 treatment centers in

California in 2000-2001 to follow 2,567 patients before and after their treatment. They used a

design in which each patient served as their own control. They find that over the following nine

months, treatment reduced arrests as well hospital days and ER visits and increased earnings.

Using the actual costs of treatment (which averaged $1583) they calculate that the ratio of social

benefits to costs was seven to one.

       Our study improves on the existing literature by using much more detailed information

about openings and closings, as well as exact locations of patients and clinics, and by examining

the impacts of clinics on the universe of ER admissions (and hospitalizations that come through

the ER) in New Jersey.



3. Data

   We have constructed a novel dataset on treatment facility locations and we use rich individual-

level data on Emergency Room visits to estimate the effect of changes in proximity to substance

abuse treatment on ER visits for substance abuse, mental health, and all other reasons. Facility

information comes from the National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Facilities,

New Jersey facilities licensing information from 2020, and New Jersey Yellow Pages from 2000-

2019. Data on patients comes from hospital uniform billings records from New Jersey for 2008 to

2015. We end the sample in 2015 because in 2016, New Jersey adopted ICD10 codes which

involved substantial changes in the way that substance abuse and mental health visits were coded.
                                                                                                  8


Fortunately, the period 2008 to 2015 involved substantial changes in the number of clinics

available, as shown below. Moreover, the fact that we have information about substance abuse

treatment centers from 2005 to 2020 offers us the ability to use areas that received a treatment

center before or after the index period as control areas.

   Figure 1 shows trends in ER visits for mental health, substance abuse, and co-occurring

substance abuse and mental health disorders. Approximately 1 in 12 ER visits are for SA

disorders. SA and MH related ER visits increased faster (a 47% increase) than all other ER

visits, which increased by 11% over our sample period. The figure indicates that ER visits for

SA, MH, and co-occurring SA and MH all grew relatively smoothly over the sample period.



3.1 Location of Substance Abuse Treatment Facilities

   Data about the location of treatment facilities comes from a number of sources. First, we use

the National Directories of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Facilities from 2005 to 2020.

These directories are created by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services

Administration (SAMHSA) every year. They include information about the location and services

offered by all federal, state, local government, and private facilities that respond to the National

Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS).

   The N-SSATS response rate has been consistently high in New Jersey, with 90% to 97% of

facilities answering the survey (N-SSATS State Profile, 2005-2019). In order to create the most

comprehensive list possible, we complemented the survey data with information on clinic license

issue dates obtained through an Open Public Records Act request to the New Jersey Division of

Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS). The DMHAS list omits some treatment

facilities operated by hospitals, primary health care facilities, and Ambulatory Care Outpatient
                                                                                                   9


Drug Treatment Facilities because they are either not required to get a separate license, or DMHAS

does not license them.

   All of the facilities listed in either source were assigned geographic coordinates and a census

block group using ArcGIS. The list was further cross-validated using the Historical Business

database available from Wharton Research Data Services. This database gathers information from

the Yellow Pages, web research, annual reports, and phone verification to provide business

addresses and names for the period 2000 to 2019. The opening year is the first year suggested by

any source and the closing year is the last year suggested by any source.

   The final facility list includes 845 substance abuse treatment facilities that ever operated in

New Jersey between 2005 and 2020. Figure 2 shows the timing of openings and closings between

2008 and 2015. Figure 2 shows the strong growth in substance abuse clinics over time since

openings exceeded closings in every year except 2013.

   An interesting feature of our data is that treatment facilities are highly clustered: The mean

distance from one facility to the next closest facility was only 1.3 miles and the maximum distance

between one facility and the next closest was only 15.8 miles. Between 2008 and 2015 most new

facilities opened in areas that were already served by at least one facility--only 24 opening

facilities were located more than 3 miles from another facility.

   Table 1 presents the demographic characteristics of those living in census block groups with

and without at least one treatment facility. Block groups with a facility are poorer, more densely

populated, and have a higher fraction of Black residents than block groups without a facility. ER

visits per 100,000 are higher across all types of visits for census block groups with a facility than

for those without one. In particular, substance-abuse related visits are noticeably higher for block

groups with a facility versus those without one: 3,696 and 2,241 respectively. This finding suggests
                                                                                                       10


a positive cross-sectional relationship between ER visits and treatment facility proximity, other

things being equal.



3.2 New Jersey Emergency Room Data

    In order to regulate hospitals, state governments maintain records on all Emergency Room

(ER) and hospital inpatient visits. We use Emergency Room data from the New Jersey Uniform

Billing Records from 2008 to 2015. These data include all visits to ERs at general medical and

surgical hospitals in New Jersey including those that involved an inpatient admission from the ER.

The sample includes individuals 15 to 64 years old and excludes events related to childbirth. We

are able to use these data to assign each patient to a census block group.

    Clinical Classification Software (CCS) was used to group related International Classification

of Disease (ICD9-CM) codes into broader categories. Appendix Table A1 shows the 12 CCS

categories used to classify substance abuse (SA) and mental health (MH) conditions. 1 Since SA

and MH are often co-morbid, many facilities offer treatment for both types of conditions so we

look separately at the effects of facilities on visits for SA, MH, and co-morbid conditions. A visit

is coded as being related to a SA or MH condition if any of the listed diagnoses belong to the

relevant CCS categories. Dementia and intellectual disability/developmental disorders are

excluded as these conditions are not generally treated in SA-MH clinics (Owens, Mutter and

Stocks, 2006). In some specifications, we also break down substance abuse into visits that

involved alcohol, and those that involved drugs. These are not coded as mutually exclusive

categories ­ many visits involve both alcohol and drugs.


1
  SA includes alcohol-related (660) and drug-related (661) conditions while MH includes adjustment
disorders (650), anxiety disorder (651), ADHD (652), disorders diagnosed in infancy (655), impulse control
disorders (656), mood disorders (657), personality disorders (658), schizophrenia (659), intentional self-
harm (662), and miscellaneous disorders (670).
                                                                                                  11


    In addition, we examine all other ER visits. Other ER visits cannot strictly be considered as a

placebo group--it is possible, for example, that substance abuse could predispose people to other

diseases such as hepatitis and HIV or to injuries from events like car crashes. However, one might

reasonably expect substance abuse clinics to have larger effects on substance abuse visits than on

other types of visits.



4. Empirical Models

    We focus on two different units of analysis. First, we collapse the ER data to obtain a panel at

the census block group-year level. We use these data to ask how ER use varies as the distance to

the nearest treatment facility changes. We compute the distance from each census block group

centroid to the closest treatment facility on a yearly basis. Specifically, for census block group c

in calendar year , the impact of facility distance on ER visits is estimated as:

                          
                   /100,000               =  +  + , + ,                        (1)
                                      ,


Where the  are census block group fixed effects, and  are calendar year fixed effects. The

census block group fixed effects control for other characteristics of neighborhoods (such as median

income and education levels), while the year dummies flexibly account for trends in ER visits over

time. Assuming that the included fixed effects adequately control for fixed characteristics of

neighborhoods and trends, and that there is sufficient variation in distance to the nearest clinic to

identify its effects, the coefficient  represents the causal effect of facility distance on ER use.

Conditional on the census block group fixed effects ( ),  is identified by clinic openings and

closings that induce changes in , . We also control for distance to the closest hospital

every year and cluster standard errors at the census block group level. All regressions are weighted

by the census block group population in 2010.
                                                                                                   12


   To allow for non-linearities in the relationship between distance and ER use, we re-estimate

equation (1) with indicator variables for each 1-mile distance band:

                          
                   /100,000                =  +  +     
                                                   =1  ,  +  ,                 (2)
                                       ,


where

                               
                                , =[( - 1) <  ,  ].


   Figure 3 gives an example of the type of variation that is used to estimate the effect of distance.

Conditional on block group fixed effects, the identifying variation comes from within-block group

facility changes, i.e. openings and closings of facilities. The census block group shown in green

in Figure 3, has three different facilities that served as the closest facility over the period 2008-

2015. From 2008-2010 the closest facility was 1.75 miles away from the centroid of the block

group. In 2011, a new facility opened, and the closest facility was 1.6 miles away. Then in 2013,

the distance became much shorter when a new facility opened 0.6 miles away.

   Our second estimation strategy groups facilities and ER patient data into zip code tabulation

area (ZCTAs) and focuses on the first time a substance abuse treatment facility opened in a ZCTA

and on the first time a facility in a ZCTA closed. New Jersey has 6320 census block groups and

595 ZCTAs, indicating that there is an average of 10.6 block groups per ZCTA. To get a sense of

size, the average New Jersey ZCTA is about five square miles.

   Figure 4 shows the distribution of facility openings (Panel A) and how we mapped them into

ZCTAs (Panel B). Some ZCTAs had facilities that opened prior to 2008, some had facilities that

opened during the 2008-2015 interval, and others only had a facility after 2015. The white areas

in the figure never had a facility: They are mainly rural and sparsely populated. We leverage

variation in the timing of changes in facility operating status, both openings and closures, to
                                                                                                  13


estimate the causal effect of having any substance abuse treatment facility in the ZCTA on ER

utilization.

    Figure 5 shows both openings and closings at the ZCTA level. This figure shows that there

were consistently more ZCTAs that had a first closure in each year than there were ZCTAs that

had a first opening. This pattern is quite different from that shown in Figure 2, which indicated

that the number of facility openings was consistently greater than the number of facility closings

in each year.

    The difference between the two figures reflects the extent of geographical clustering in facility

locations. Although many facilities opened, it was relatively rare for an opening to occur in a

ZCTA that had no other facilities. Hence, estimates using the ZCTA-level strategy emphasize

openings in areas that were facility-poor (since we look at the first opening in a ZCTA). Similarly,

although many facilities closed, it was relatively rare for a closure to occur in an area that had no

other facilities. Hence, we chose to look at the impact of the first facility to close during our

sample period rather than the last. This means that our closure measure is examining the impact

of a closure regardless of whether there were other facilities in the area. These slightly different

measures of openings and closings may help us to get at the difference between not being able to

get to a clinic (because the nearest one is far away) and not being able to get admitted to a clinic

in your area because treatment spots are scarce.

    The treatment group in these comparisons consists of ZCTAs with a first opening or closing

(as defined above) during our sample period. The control group consists of ZCTAs that do not

have a first opening or closing between 2008 and 2015. This includes ZCTAs that had a facility

prior to 2008 but that did not have an opening or closing between 2008 and 2015 and ZCTAs with

an opening/closing after 2015. We also include ZCTAs in the same hospital area as ZCTAs with
                                                                                                   14


a facility even if they had no facility themselves. This means that we have excluded 120 ZCTAs

that either never had a facility over the entire period or are located far from those ZCTAs that ever

had a facility. These tend to be the most rural and sparsely populated areas of the state. To identify

hospital areas, we take all the hospital discharge records and find the hospital that the majority of

the residents of each ZCTA went to during our sample period.

   Table 2 presents summary statistics for the treatment group and each component of the control

group. Looking at the difference between ZCTAs with an opening and those with a closure, shown

in columns 1 and 2, we observe that compared to ZCTAs with closures, those with openings were

wealthier and less densely populated areas and had a higher fraction of White Non-Hispanic

residents. ZCTAs with closures have the lowest median income and the highest SA visit rate

among all groups. Columns 3 to 5 report statistics for each sub-group in our control group. As can

be seen, ZCTAs with an opening after 2015 (column 4) and ZCTAs without a facility but in the

same hospital area as ZCTAs with a facility (column 5) are wealthier and have lower ER visit rates

than ZCTAs that ever had a facility.

   These level differences between the different areas are less concerning if each type of area

shows parallel trends in ER admissions. The validity of our research design relies on the

assumption that treatment and control areas would have shown similar growth in ER utilization

for substance abuse in the absence of facility openings/closures. Hence, before implementing our

difference-in-difference approach we test for the presence of differential pre-trends.

   We estimate event study models separately for openings and closings to investigate the validity

of this assumption. Specifically, we estimate the following model:

     
                   =  +  + +3               
                           =-3   { =  + } +   { <  - 3} +  { >  + 2} + , , (3)
     100,000   ,
                                                                                                 15


where the coefficients  show the evolution of ER visits with respect to the year before the first

substance abuse center opened or closed,  . We bin the years outside the effect window [-3,3],

represented by   < () - 3 and  > () + 2, to separate treatment and secular time

effects (Schmidheiny and Siegloch, 2019). Standard errors are clustered at the ZCTA level.

   We then estimate a difference-in-difference model that averages the year-specific effects

estimated in equation (3). The model takes the following form:

        
 /100,000                =  +  +   , +   , + ,                                                (4)
                     ,


where  , is an indicator equal to one if year t is greater than or equal to the

first year a facility is observed in ZCTA z. In contrast,  , equals one if year t is

greater than or equal to the first year a closure is observed in the ZCTA. The coefficient 

represents the causal effect of a facility opening on ER use, and  captures the effects of

closures. Equation (4) also includes calendar year  fixed effects to flexibly account for trends

in ER visits over time, and ZCTA fixed effects  to control for time-invariant characteristics.

Standard errors are clustered by ZCTA, and all regressions are population weighted using 2010

census population numbers.



5. Results

   We begin by asking how ER use varies as distance to the nearest treatment facility changes.

The identifying variation is coming from within-block group facility changes over time as equation

(1) includes block group fixed effects. Table 3 shows the results of estimating equation (1), which

also includes controls for distance to the closest hospital. As shown in column 1, each additional

mile from the closest SA facility increases the number of SA-related (SA) visits per 100,000

individuals by 46.9 yearly visits. Relative to the mean number of visits of 2,624, this represents
                                                                                                       16


an increase of approximately 1.8%. Columns 3 and 5 show the same analysis for MH and "all

other" visits. Although there is a statistically significant change for "all other" ER visits, the effects

are smaller than for SA visits in percentage terms (0.5%).

    As for the role of facility selection into neighborhoods, columns 2, 4, and 6 show estimates of

equation (1) that exclude the block group fixed effects. These estimates have the opposite sign.

Table 1 suggested that facilities are disproportionately likely to be located in poor neighborhoods

with many ER visits for substance abuse. The contrast between the OLS and fixed effects

estimates suggests that it is important to control for the selection of facilities into specific types of

neighborhoods.

    Figure 6, panel A shows the effect of distance on SA visits when we allow for non-linearities

and replace the Distancec,t variable with 1-mile distance bins (see equation (2)). These estimates

also suggest that block groups that are further from a treatment facility have higher SA visits

relative to block groups that have a facility within 1 mile.            However, SA visits are only

significantly higher in census block groups that are more than 4 miles away from a facility. The

facility effect is the same for block groups within 0-3 miles (F-statistics: 0.05). These findings are

remarkably similar to those of Beardsley et al. (2003), who found (in a much smaller sample) that

patients who had to travel more than four miles had significantly shorter length of stay in treatment

than clients who traveled less than 1 mile.

    Panel B shows the same analysis for MH visits and "all other" ER visits and shows that distance

to SA clinics has little effect on these types of ER visits. We can also split the SA visits into those

involving alcohol, and those involving drugs. Figure 7 shows that the point estimates are positive

for both substances, but that drug visits respond more strongly to proximity to a treatment facility.
                                                                                                    17


This difference could reflect the fact that people often receive treatment for alcohol abuse in

settings outside substance abuse centers such as local Alcoholics Anonymous groups.

   We also estimate the effects of openings and closings at a higher level of aggregation, the

ZCTA. We take the first opening and the first closure and examine how SA visits changed around

these events. Once again, we first examine trends in advance of the openings or closings to judge

the validity of our difference-in-differences design. Figure 8 plots the event study coefficients for

two separate regressions of equation (3). Panel A illustrates the trends around openings, and panel

B does it for closings. They both support the design's validity as the pre-trends in SA visits are

very similar in the treated and control ZCTAs. Panel A shows that treatment facility openings lead

to a decrease in SA visits in the year the facility opened and over subsequent years. Panel B shows

clear evidence that facility closings led to increased SA visits in the year of the closure and in the

following years. We replicate the analysis for drug and alcohol visits separately in Figure 9. The

estimates again suggest that visits related to drug abuse are more responsive to the presence of

substance above treatment facilities than visits related to alcohol abuse.

   Table 4 reports the pooled difference-in-difference estimates derived from equation (4). As

Figure 8 suggests, the estimates in column 1 show that facility openings decrease SA visits while

closings increase these visits. The effects are medically and economically significant as SA visits

to the ER fall by 6.7% after an opening and increase by 10.7% after a closing. It is interesting that

closures have effects that are larger in absolute value than openings even though most of these

closures are occurring in areas that had other facilities. This finding indicates that scarce treatment

spaces are a real constraint in areas that suffer closures. Closures may also have larger effects than

openings because they reflect the fully "ramped up" impact of a center, whereas new centers may

take some time to reach their full capacity.
                                                                                                  18


   Columns 2 and 3 of Table 4 show that openings have no effect on visits for MH and "all other"

ER visits. However, we do find an increase in MH and "all other" ER visits when a facility closes,

again suggesting that changes in access to spaces may be more a binding constraint on receipt of

treatment than proximity, at least in New Jersey.

   Table 5 breaks down substance abuse visits by type. The estimates for all substance abuse

visits are repeated from Table 4 in column (1) of Table 5. Column 2 shows that the estimates are

similar for patients visiting only for substance abuse (i.e. patients who do not have substance abuse

along with some other reason for the visit) and for those with co-occurring substance abuse and

mental health diagnoses (column 3). Column 4 shows that our main results are driven by drug-

related visits rather than alcohol-related visits. Drug-related ER visits increase by 16.6% after a

facility closure and decrease by 9.5% after an opening. In contrast, the effects on visits involving

alcohol are not statistically significant, and the point estimates also suggest smaller impacts

(column 5).

   The incidence of substance abuse disorders differs by demographic group and it is important

to identify those groups that are more responsive to changes in access to treatment facilities.

Proximity to treatment facilities is likely to impact ER use through decreasing transportation costs.

If this is an important channel, then sub-groups who face greater transportation barriers should

show larger responses to changes in facility location. To ask whether the effects of openings and

closings differentially affect subgroups, we re-estimated equation (1) separately by gender, race,

and age group.

   Table 6 presents the estimates by gender and race. As can be seen in panel A, treatment effects

are stronger for males and for Black individuals. In particular, the response of Black individuals

to openings is higher than for any other group, with SA visits decreasing by 9.41% for this group
                                                                                                     19


vs. 6.7% for the entire sample. Black individuals are the only ones who see larger effects for

openings than for closings. The effects on ER visits for MH and All Other ER visits (panels B-C)

are driven by non-Black individuals, while males continue to drive the results for all types of visits.

   Table 7 shows the estimates for different age groups. Panel A shows that there are larger

impacts on SA visits among young people (15 to 24) and among older adults (45 to 64), while

those in the middle age range (25-44) show the smallest effects. It is possible that people of prime

working age are more likely to seek treatment close to work, for example. Openings have larger

effects than closings on young people, suggesting that proximity may be especially important for

them. For older adults, closings have much larger effects than openings, suggesting that lack of

access to treatment spots may be most important for this group.

   There are essentially three possible types of substance abuse treatment: in-patient hospital

care, outpatient clinics, and residential treatment centers. Over our sample period, the majority

of the substance abuse treatment facilities in New Jersey were outpatient clinics. As noted

above, the number of patients treated in in-patient facilities was extremely small. The fraction of

facilities that were residential declined from 17% in 2008 to 14.6% in 2015, with the change

being driven by increases in outpatient facilities rather than decreases in residential ones. Since

residential facilities are also smaller on average, the fraction of outpatient patients treated in

residential facilities was also relatively small: 7.0% in 2008 and 9.7% in 2015. We have re-

estimated the main results from Table 4 excluding residential treatment facilities. The results,

shown in Table 8, are quite similar to those discussed above.

   It was also relatively unusual for clinics in our sample to offer medication-assisted treatment

(e.g. methadone or buprenorphine). Over this time period, a stable 10% of clinics offered

methadone, while the fraction offering buprenorphine rose from 17.4% to 24.9%. Hence our
                                                                                                    20


power to measure the effectiveness of different types of treatment is somewhat limited. An

additional difficulty is that data on whether a clinic offered MAT or not is not available for every

year. However, in Table 9 we show the results of first estimating models excluding clinics that

ever offered MAT, and second, focusing only on clinics that we know offered MAT at some

point in time. The aim is to see whether the estimated effects of openings and closings are

similar. The estimates suggest that we generally find similar effects in both subsamples, though

the standard errors are larger in the MAT sub-sample. The only exception is that openings of

clinics offering MAT are associated with reductions in ER visits for other causes as well as with

reductions in visits for substance abuse.



6. Robustness

   Finally, the evidence presented so far is "reduced form" in the sense that we show that openings

have an effect on ER visits for substance abuse, but presumably this occurs by getting people into

treatment. Hence, we would like to see evidence that openings and closings affect the probability

that individuals receive substance abuse treatment. Unfortunately, information on the number of

individuals served in substance abuse treatment facilities is available only at the county level, and

there are only 21 counties in New Jersey suggesting that county-level regressions are likely to be

underpowered.

   Table A2 shows a log-log specification where we control for county and year fixed effects.

Columns 1 and 2 use all of the available years of data. Column 1 shows that a 1% increase in the

number of facilities in a county is related to a statistically significant 27.1% increase in the number

of individuals treated. The point estimate in column 2 suggests a rise of 20.6% in admissions,

although the coefficient is not statistically significant. Columns 3 and 4 repeat the exercise for
                                                                                                  21


2008-2015 only. The point estimates are similar to those in Columns 1 and 2 but are not

statistically significant. Columns 5 to 7 show county-level estimates for ER visits. The point

estimates are remarkably similar to those shown above, but this exercise shows that we lack the

power to detect effects in county-level data. Even though in these county-level data we lack the

power to detect changes, the point estimates for ER utilization are all sizeable and negative.

   We also test the robustness of the main results to changes in specification. Table A3 shows

the results when we constrain openings and closings have symmetric effects. We replace the

opening and closing indicators in equation (2) with an indicator variable, Open2, that takes the

value of 1 when a facility opens, -1 when a facility closes, and is 0 otherwise. As it can be seen,

the main results hold with the effects on ER visits being driven by SA visits.

   Given that areas in New Jersey can vary widely in terms of population, one might be concerned

that the results in Table 4 are driven by a few larger areas. Appendix Table A4 reports unweighted

regressions. As can be seen, the estimated effects are quite similar to those reported above.

   Another possible concern is that other factors could be changing at the same time as the facility

openings/closings. To address this issue, in Appendix Table A5 we present estimates of models

similar to those above except that they also include county-specific linear trends. The coefficient

estimates for openings and closings are about 25% smaller than those in Table 4, but they convey

the same message. Thus, our estimates are economically and statistically significant even after

controlling for county-specific trends.



6. Discussion and Conclusions

       Our study confirms that access to substance abuse treatment facilities has significant effects

on drug-related ER visits. Openings in previously unserved areas had large effects: They reduced
                                                                                                  22


drug-related ER visits by 6.7% overall, while they reduced drug-related ER visits among Black

people by 9.4%. Closures had even larger effects, even in areas with other facilities, increasing

drug-related ER visits by 16.7% overall. These results suggest that constraints on the number of

available spaces in treatment facilities were an important barrier to care over our sample period.

       Given the incompleteness of the available data, it is difficult to value the care provided by

substance abuse treatment facilities. Karaca and Moore (2020) report that the cost per ER visit for

opioid use disorder was about $528 (converted to 2020 dollars). If we take the estimated number

of overdoses associated with a facility closing from Table 4 (285), it would suggest that the dollar

value of ER visits incurred when a facility closes is $150,480 (2020 dollars) per year. However,

to the extent that successful treatment prevents loss of life due to drug overdose, reduces other

outpatient and inpatient costs associated with substance abuse, and reduces social costs due to

crime and lost wages as well, this figure is clearly an extreme lower bound.

       Our results suggest that both physical proximity, and constraints on the capacity of centers

are important determinants of access. They further suggest that disruptions in treatment access

due to COVID-19 are likely to have had significant negative effects on individuals suffering from

substance abuse consistent with recent evidence (Holland et al., 2021; Hulsey, Mello and Kelly,

2020; Currie et al., 2021).

       An encouraging finding is that even "garden variety" community care without MAT was

shown to have significant positive effects in terms of reducing ER visits for substance abuse.

Hence, these results provide support for efforts to scale up the availability of outpatient substance

abuse treatment generally.
