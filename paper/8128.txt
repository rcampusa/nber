        It is widely believed that exchange rate changes have important implications for financial

decision-making and for firm profitability. But do exchange rate changes have measurable

effects on firm returns? The existing literature on the relationship between international stock

prices and exchange rates finds only weak evidence of systematic exchange rate exposure. We

argue in this paper that the absence of evidence may be due to restrictions imposed on empirical

specifications used in previous studies.

        We adopt a data-driven approach to measuring exposure and study a relatively broad

sample of countries over an eighteen-year period. The results indicate that there is considerable

exchange rate exposure at both the industry and firm level.

I. Defining Exchange Rate Exposure

        A firm is said to exhibit exchange rate exposure if its share value is influenced by

changes in currency values (Michael Adler and Bernard Dumas (1984)). There are a number of

channels through which the exchange rate might affect the profitability of a firm. Firms that

export to foreign markets may benefit from a depreciation of the local currency if its products

become more affordable to foreign consumers. On the other hand, firms that rely on imported

intermediate products may see their profits shrink as a consequence of increasing costs of

production. Even firms that do no international business may be influenced indirectly by foreign

competition. Furthermore, firms in the nontraded as well as the traded sectors of the economy

compete for factors of production, whose returns may be affected by changes in the exchange

rate.

        Although there are many explanations for the link between the exchange rate and

profitability, the link between the exchange rate and a firm‚Äôs stock price is less clear. Under the

CAPM, the expected risk premium on a company's share price is proportional to its covariance



                                                                                                      1
with the market portfolio. In theory, investors will only require a return on the non-diversifiable

portion of firm risk and no variable other than the market return should play a systematic role in

determining asset returns. Therefore, a test for exchange rate exposure involves including the

change in the exchange rate on the right-hand-side of a standard CAPM regression and testing

whether its coefficient is significantly different than zero:

                              Ri,t = Œ≤ 0,i + Œ≤ 1,i Rm, t + Œ≤ 2, i ‚àÜst + Œµ i, t     (1)

where Ri ,t is the return on firm i at time t, Rm,t is the return on the market portfolio, Œ≤1,i is the firm‚Äôs

beta, ‚àÜst is the change in the relevant exchange rate and Œ≤ 2,i measures a firm‚Äôs exposure to

exchange rate movements after taking into account the overall market‚Äôs exposure to currency

fluctuations. If Œ≤ 2,i is zero, this implies that firm i has the same exchange rate exposure as the

market portfolio (not necessarily that the firm has no exposure). Alternatively, if we reject the

hypothesis that Œ≤ 2,i is, on average, zero ‚Äì we both find evidence of exchange rate exposure and a

rejection of this specification of the CAPM.1

        If we do indeed find evidence of exchange rate exposure, this indicates the existence of

some form of market inefficiency. A rejection of no exposure suggests either that investors are not

fully diversifying their portfolios ‚Äì so that exchange rate risk remains ‚Äì or that firms themselves

are not fully hedging their exchange rate risks. Unfortunately, without more detailed data either on

investor portfolio holdings or firms' hedging practices, it is not possible to say which of these

situations is operative.




1
   It is possible, even likely, that in some countries the exchange rate and the market return are jointly
determined. Our definition of exposure will therefore understate the overall impact of a change in the
exchange rate on firm returns.


                                                                                                                2
II. Testing for Exposure

        Testing for exchange rate exposure at the firm and industry level entails taking a stand on

a number of empirical questions.

                                            A. Exchange Rates

        One of the first questions that arises when thinking about exchange rate exposure is

"Which is the relevant exchange rate to include in equation 1?" Most of the studies in the

literature use a trade-weighted exchange rate to measure exposure. The problem with using a

trade-weighted basket of currencies in exposure tests is that the results lack power if the nature of

firm exposure does not correspond to the exchange rates (and the relative weights) included in

the basket. More generally, we should expect variation in individual firm and industry exposure

to various exchange rates. Any test that restricts the measurement of exposure to one exchange

rate (whether it be a trade-weighted rate or a bilateral rate) is likely to biased downward.2

        One possible research strategy to mitigate this problem is to create firm and industry

specific exchange rates. The difficulty with this approach is that it is not clear on what basis

these exchange rates should be chosen. Firms may hedge exposure to the more obvious

currencies (for example, currencies of the countries where they export or import goods), but

remain exposed to currencies of countries with whom their goods compete on world markets (but

with whom they do no direct business). Since theory does not provide us with clear exchange

rate candidates for our exposure tests we include multiple exchange rates in our specifications.




2
  Craig Doidge, John Griffin and Rohan Williamson (2000) use both bilateral rates and trade-weighted
exchange rates but ‚Äúscore‚Äù exposure based on one rate.


                                                                                                        3
                                          B. Industry Aggregation

         The majority of exposure studies use industry level data. They do so for two reasons.

First, some hypotheses about exposure are most relevant at the industry level. For example, one

prediction is that exposure will be greatest in highly competitive industries where mark-ups are

low.3 The second reason is that cross-country industry-return data are relatively easy to obtain.

The problem with industry level aggregation is that firms within an industry need not be

homogeneous. It may be that industry-wide exposure is actually high but that individual firms

within the industry are exposed in opposite ways. An aggregation of their returns will therefore

average out the individual exposure effects. Moreover, most industry return indices (including

the widely used Datastream indices) are value weighted so that the largest firms in the industry

are given the greatest weight in the index. We therefore test for exposure at both the industry and

the firm level.

                                  C. Multinationals and Exporting Firms

         Another common empirical strategy is to test for exposure in a limited set of firms. For

example, a number of studies test for exposure in multinational firms, or in firms that actively

engage in international trade.4 However, theory does not suggest that exposure will be limited to

these firms. Indeed, one might expect that these firms would be the least likely to be exposed

since they are the most likely to have access to both operational and financial hedging strategies.5

In order to allow the data to inform us about which firms are more or less likely to be exposed

we include all firms in our empirical work.

3
    For example, Gordon Bodnar and William Gentry (1993) and Jose Campa and Linda Goldberg (1995).
4
   For example, Philippe Jorion (1990) and Jia He and Lilian Ng (1998). Dominguez and Tesar (2000)
test whether firms in industries that are involved in international trade are more likely to be exposed.
5
   Examples of operational hedges include locating production abroad and matching the currency of
invoice for both receipts and outlays.


                                                                                                           4
                      D. Equally Weighted versus Value Weighted Market Returns

        Empirical tests of the standard CAPM model generally include a country specific value-

weighted market return to proxy for ‚Äúthe market‚Äù. In a world of perfectly integrated capital

markets the ‚Äúmarket return‚Äù is best proxied by a global portfolio. But, previous empirical work

strongly suggests that country specific market returns better explain firm and industry level

returns.6 Further, Gordon Bodnar and Franco Wong (2000) explain that value-weighted market

returns are dominated by large firms that are more likely to be multinational and/or export

oriented and are more likely to experience negative cash flow reactions to home currency

appreciations than other firms. Therefore, including the value-weighted market return in an

exposure test not only removes the standard macroeconomic effects, but also the more negative

cash flow effects of larger firms. This would likely bias tests toward finding no exposure. In the

tests results reported below we use an equal-weighted market return.

                                           E. Exposure Stability

        The exposure tests are estimated using data covering the period January 1980- May 1999.

In order to test whether the results are robust over subsamples ‚Äì and whether specific subsamples

drive the full sample results - we re-estimate both firm and industry level tests over three

subperiods. Subperiods are selected on the basis of changes in the underlying currencies used for

each country.




6
   In future work we will systematically explore the impact of different CAPM specifications on our
estimates of exposure.




                                                                                                      5
III. The Empirical Specification, the Data and Results

        Augmented CAPM specifications are estimated at the firm and four-digit industry level

for eight countries (Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Thailand and the UK)

using a broad sample of firms. We use weekly (Wednesday) returns, country-specific market

portfolio returns, and three country specific exchange rates. All data are from Datastream. For

large countries (Germany, Japan and the UK) we selected a representative sample of firms (25%

of the population) based on market capitalization and industry affiliation. For the remaining

countries we include the population of firms. The samples include an average of 300 firms for

each country; Japan includes the largest number of firms at 488; Chile has the smallest number at

199. Firms with fewer than six months of data over the period 1980 to 1999 were excluded from

the sample. The number of industries varied across countries from 20 in Thailand to 39 in the

UK.

        Table 1 shows the percentages of industries and firms within a country with significant

exposure at the 5% level (based on robust standard errors). The extent of exchange rate exposure

is remarkably high and clearly above the ratios one would expect to see in a random sample. The

‚Äúany‚Äù exchange rate column shows that firm level exposure ranges from a low of 19% for Chile

to a high of 31% for Japan. At the industry level, Germany and Japan show greater than 60%

exposure and the rest of the countries show between 22-46% exposure.

        The results indicate that tests based on the trade-weighted exchange rate are likely to

yield downward biased estimates of exposure. For example, 24% of the Japanese sample

consists of firms that are not exposed to the trade-weighted exchange rate but are significantly

exposed to one of the included bilateral rates.




                                                                                                    6

Notes: The columns labeled "TW" show the percent (industries or firms) exposed to a trade-
weighted exchange rate; "any" show the percent exposed to at least one of the following: the
TW, the US dollar and an additional bilateral rate (based on direction of trade data). The final
column shows the percent of firms that are exposed to a bilateral rate, but are not exposed to the
TW exchange rate.


        The augmented CAPM regressions also provide information on the percentage of

significant positive and negative exposure (see Kathryn M. Dominguez and Linda L. Tesar

2000). In three of the countries (Chile, Germany and Italy) positive and negative exposure is

about evenly split. In another four countries (France, Japan, the Netherlands and the UK) 60-

70% of firms exhibit positive exposure (meaning that an increase in the value of the home

currency relative to other currencies results in an increase in firm share value). In contrast, 80%

of Thai firms exhibit negative exposure, suggesting that an increase in the value of the baht

generally led to a decrease in the value of Thai firm share values.

        We also calculate the average increase in the adjusted R2 when we include the exchange

rate in a traditional CAPM specification. Although the smaller countries like Chile and Thailand

show relatively lower levels of industry and firm exposure, the average increase in adjusted R2

from including an exchange rate in the CAPM specification for these countries is relatively high.

This suggests that although fewer firms in these countries are exposed, those that are exposed


                                                                                                      7
have a relatively high degree of exposure. This phenomenon also shows up in the average size

of the exposure coefficient.

        Finally, we test whether the exposure estimates obtained for the full sample of eighteen

years are robust over subsamples. While there is time-variation in exposure at the firm level, the

overall extent of exposure is not sample dependent. A complete discussion of the subsample

results is presented in Dominguez and Tesar (2000).

IV. Conclusions

        This study uses a broad sample of firm and industry returns, equal-weighted market

returns, and multiple exchange rates to test for exchange rate exposure. The results are consistent

with high degrees of exchange rate exposure at both the firm and industry level across eight

countries. In future research we will examine what kinds of country, firm and industry

characteristics best predict exposure.
