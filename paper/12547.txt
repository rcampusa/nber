Pass Through of Exchange Rates to Consumption Prices: What has Changed and Why?

                                           ABSTRACT


In this paper, we use cross-county and time series evidence to argue that retail price sensitivity to
exchange rates may have increased over the past decade. This finding applies to traded goods, as
well as to non-traded goods. We highlight three reasons for changing pass through at the level of
retail prices of goods. First, pass through may have declined at the level of import prices, but the
evidence is mixed over types of goods and countries. Second, there has been a large expansion of
imported input use across sectors. This means that the costs of imported goods as well as home
tradable goods have heightened sensitivity to import prices and exchange rates. The final channel
we consider is whether there have been changing sectoral expenditures on distribution services, with
the direction of change negatively correlated with pass through into final consumption prices. We
find that this channel, which has been a means of insulating consumption prices from import content
and exchange rates, has not systematically changed in recent years. The balance of effects weighs
in favor of increased sensitivity of consumption prices to exchange rates, even if exchange-rate
pass-through into import prices has declined for some types of goods.

1.         Introduction
           Both traded and nontraded goods prices can be sensitive to exchange rate movements.
There are a number of forces that contribute to less than complete pass through of exchange rates
into the final consumption prices of imported goods. First, pass through into prices at the border
is incomplete, and varies considerably across goods and across countries. Second, distribution
services, like local storage, transportation, and retail costs, provide some insulation of
consumption prices of traded goods, both by diluting the import content of the final consumption
good and because distributors may actively adjust profit margins to absorb currency fluctuations.
For home produced tradable goods, production costs are expected to become more sensitive to
exchange rates and import prices as production increasingly relies on imported components.
Indeed, a producer of tradable goods achieves such production cost sensitivity both through his
own reliance on imported components and through the reliance of his domestic suppliers and
distributors on imported inputs. Imported goods play a role, directly introducing sensitivity to
exchange rates in the domestic economy through costs, as in Campa and Goldberg (2006), or
alternatively by keeping pass through into import prices low in a model of foreign exporting
firms selling intermediate goods to domestic producers who compete with nontraded goods
producers, as argued by Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2003).1
           In this paper, we consider the evolution over the past decade in the predicted sensitivity
of consumption prices of imported and domestically-produced goods with respect to exchange
rates. For this work, we focus on changes in distribution margins and imported inputs use, as
well as on pass through into import prices at the border for five broad categories of goods:
manufactured, non-manufactured, food, energy, and raw materials. Thus, we build on Campa and
Goldberg (2006), who explored the role of the distribution sector and imported inputs in levels of
CPI sensitivity to exchange rates across twenty-one OECD countries. That study documented
that distribution expenditures associated with goods consumed by households are between 30
and 50 percent of the purchasers’ prices. These distribution expenditures are dominated by
wholesale and retail sector costs, with transportation and storage costs relatively low except in
the case of various raw materials and mining industries. In tradable goods production, imported
inputs are shown to account for between 10 and 48 percent of the final price. Nontradable goods

                                                                                                            1
are produced with lower shares of imported inputs, ranging from 3 percent in the United States to
22 percent in Hungary. Using this evidence across countries within a calibrated model, Campa
and Goldberg (2006) found that predicted and actual CPI sensitivity to exchange rate movements
are low, often below 10 percent of any exchange rate change.
       Yet that study did not address changes over time in the effects of exchange rates on the
consumption prices of different types of goods. With distribution expenditures partially
insulating final consumption prices from import price changes at the border, consumption price
sensitivity to exchange rates can rise if the structure of the retail and distribution sector leads to
lower distribution costs. In particular, we ask whether there has there been something like a
“Walmart effect” influencing exchange rate pass through, whereby expenditure on such services
declines as large-box retailers and distributors are increasingly present in local markets.
       One issue is the potential for changing pass through into the prices of imports at the
border. Some studies present evidence that pass-through into the import prices of industrialized
countries has declined in the past decade, particularly on finished goods [Marazzi, Sheets, and
Vigfusson (2005), Otani, Shiratsuka, and Shirota (2005), Frankel, Parsley and Wei (2005)],
while other studies dispute the magnitude and significance of such changes [Campa and
Goldberg (2005), Campa, Goldberg, Minguez Gonzalez (2005), Ihrig, Marazzi, and Rothenberg
(2006), Daly, Hellerstein, and Marsh (2006), Thomas and Marquez and (2006)].
       Another relevant issue is the growth of globalization of production over the recent
decade. If more imported components are used in production, and these components are priced as
other imports at the border, then there is more opportunity for local costs to be sensitive to
exchange rates. This growth in imported inputs could raise the sensitivity of final consumption
prices to exchange rates.
       In this paper, we pull together evidence on these three sources of changing pass through
into consumption prices of types of goods using data drawn from eighteen countries. We
compare the roles of expenditures on distribution services, use of imported inputs and
components in production, and of changes in the rate of exchange rate pass through into border
prices of goods, across countries, across sectors, and for pre- and post-1995 time periods. The
analysis yields the following observations. Pass through into the prices of imports, at the border,
is defined more by industry than by country. The notable exception is the United States, where




                                                                                                    2
pass through into import prices is unusually low. Pass through into import prices is noisiest and
least precisely measured for energy imports. Pass through into import prices of manufactured
goods and, less so, food prices, are the only categories measured with precision across countries.
Evidence of declining pass through into the border prices of imports is concentrated within some
manufactured goods categories [Marazzi and Sheets 2006, Campa, Goldberg, and Minguez-
Gonzalez (2005)], but only for some countries.
       Across countries and industries, distribution expenditures have a large industry-specific
component but are not trending in a consistent direction across these industries. Imported input
use likewise has industry characteristics, but – unlike distribution expenditures – trend changes
have been significant and widespread. Imported input use has tended to grow over time, both
across countries and across industries. These findings together will suggest that changes in
distribution margins have not been the key contributor to changing pass through into
consumption prices of goods over the past decade. By contrast, the significant expansion of
imported input use, including its use in distribution services, has increased the predicted
sensitivity of retail prices of imported goods and other tradable goods to exchange rates.

       It is important to point out that our exercise is one of generating imputed changes in
prices associated with exchange rate movements. This exercise is one of “all else equal”. The
exercise shows pressures on prices that are generated by exchange rates. However, these price
pressures may not be observable in realized consumption price data. As Gagnon and Ihrig (2005)
compellingly argue, and Gust and Sheets (2006) build into general equilibrium models, the
inflationary impetus from a home currency depreciation may be met with monetary tightening. In
this case, some of the inflationary pressures from depreciation are offset by policy.
       Section II begins our exposition by presenting evidence on industry-specific exchange
rate pass through into import prices and the (more sparse) evidence available on pass-through
into consumption prices at the level of particular industries. In Section III we delve into the
industry-specific features of distribution margins and imported input use, and focus specifically
on decomposing patterns into ones associated with specific countries, industries, and points in
time. Section IV pulls together this information and evidence on exchange rate pass through into
import prices to generate predicted values for the consumption price sensitivity to exchange rates




                                                                                                3
of different types of goods across countries. Section V concludes by summarizing key findings
and discussing implications for trade balance adjustment to exchange rates.


II.    Import Price Elasticities with Respect to Exchange Rates
       There is a large literature that has looked at the extent to which exchange rate changes
affect import prices of goods.    Most of these previous studies generally have found that pass-
through is incomplete, implying that import prices are less volatile than exchange rates.
Goldberg and Knetter (1997) present a review of the literature in this area and concluded that
pass-through into U.S. import prices was on the order of 50 percent. Large variations around this
estimate occur by industry. Antzoulatos and Yang (1996), Yang (1997) and Olivei (2002) all
perform estimation of pass-through rates into import prices at the industry level and conclude
that pass-through varies across industries. The existing evidence has been obtained by either
focusing in a subset of narrowly defined industries, using data at the firm or product level (micro
studies) or, more broadly, by looking at a cross-section of relatively aggregated industry statistics
(industry studies).
       Micro-oriented studies generally focus on pass-through from one country’s firms into
another’s and concentrate on a particular product or industry. For example, Feenstra (1989) and
Gron and Swenson (1996) examined the pass-through of movements of the yen into U.S. import
prices for Japanese shipments of cars, trucks and motorcycles. Gil-Pareja (2003) and Goldberg
and Verboven (2001) also focus on the degree of pass-through in the automobile industry by
looking at detailed product imports from different countries. In other industries, Bernhofen and
Xu (2000) examined the exchange rate pass-through into U.S. petrochemical imports from
Germany and Japan and Blonigen and Haynes (2002) looks at Canadian exports of iron and steel
into the United States.
       The cross-industry studies focus on import prices for more than one industry at a time,
often with more aggregated data than found in the micro-oriented studies. Feinberg (1989), Yang
(1997), Pollard and Coughlin (2005) provide estimates of pass-through at broader industry
classifications for imports in the manufacturing sector in the U.S. Similar evidence for five
industry categories is presented for OECD countries in Campa and Goldberg (2005, 2006),
Marazzi, Sheets, and Vigfusson (2005), Ihrig and Gagnon (2006) and, for European Union




                                                                                                   4
countries in Campa, Goldberg and González Mínguez (2006). Across the OECD countries,
industry considerations, and particularly the sectoral composition of a country’s imports, have
been more important than macroeconomic volatility in explaining changes in exchange rate pass
through into aggregated import prices.
          Table 1 reports estimated pass-through rates into import prices for all imports and for five
broad industry categories across 16 countries. The reported coefficients are the estimated pass-
through rates from a regression of changes in import prices on changes in nominal exchange
rates and foreign prices using quarterly data for the period 1976:1 to 2004:12. The reported
estimates of pass through of exchange rate changes are the contemporaneous effect and the
cumulative one-year impact from an exchange rate shock. These estimates come from a partial-
adjustment model of the form
                     −4                −4
          Δpt = α + ∑ ai Δe + ∑ bi j Δwtj−i +c j Δgdptj + ϑt j
              j             j    j
                                t −i
                     i =0              i =0


          where pt are local currency import prices or the local consumer price index, et is the

exchange rate, wt is the foreign production costs, gdpt is real GDP, and the final term is the

regression residual. The short-run relationship between exchange rates and the respective price
series of country j is given by the estimated coefficient a0j . The long run elasticity is given by

the sum of the coefficients on the contemporaneous exchange rate and four lags of exchange rate
         −4
terms ∑ aij . While the theoretical antecedents of this equation suggest a log-levels relationship
      i =0

among variables, for estimation, the variables in these equations are first differences in
logarithms to control for the possibility of unit roots (Campa and Goldberg 2006 and Osbat
2006).

*Significantly different from zero (5%), + Significantly different from one (5%). Most data are quarterly, spanning
1975 through the end of 2004. Data sources: nominal exchange rate and consumer prices come from the IFS; import
price comes from the OECD. Specific start and end dates by country are detailed in the data appendix. Long-run
elasticities (four quarters) shown.


          Across the eighteen countries for which pass through rates are presented in Table 1, the
(unweighted) average pass-through elasticity of import prices is 0.59. Consistent with the
findings of prior studies, most industries exhibit a striking degree of partial pass through. In the
“all imports” category the hypothesis of zero exchange rate pass-through is rejected for more
than half of the countries. Across industries, pass-through rates equal to 1, i.e. complete pass-
through, are strongly rejected for Manufacturing and for Food.



                                                                                                                  6
         Pass through is smaller in Manufacturing than in commodities such as Energy and Raw-
Materials. The precision of the estimates also is tightest for Manufacturing and for Food, with
dispersion of estimated rates of pass-through across countries lowest for these categories. Campa
and Goldberg (2005) reached similar conclusions for both short-run and long-run pass-through
rates in the OECD countries. These differences across industries also occur at more
disaggregated levels within manufacturing, as Yang (1997) and Pollard and Coughlin (2005)
show for manufacturing industries in the United States, and Campa, Goldberg, and González-
Minguez (2006) show for the euro-area countries. Pass-through into the import prices of Non-
Manufactured goods, Energy, and Raw Materials appears to be poorly measured by the basic
estimating equation.3
         Recent studies have debated whether pass through of exchange rates into import prices
may have declined since 1997, particularly for the United States [Marazzi et al (2005), Ihrig et al
(2006)]. Campa, Goldberg, and Minguez-Gonzalez (2005) argue that the evidence is mixed
across European countries. We replicate these tests for fifteen of the eighteen countries4 of Table
1 and find that it is difficult to make a case that pass through into import prices has
systematically declined.        Typically, the relationship between exchange rates and the local
currency import prices of Energy, Raw Materials, and Non-Manufactured goods are found to be
noisy and unstable. It is difficult to make definitive statements about whether pass-through rates
have altered meaningfully for these sectors. By contrast, for Manufactured goods estimates of
exchange rate pass through are more informative. We observe some instances of increasing pass
through of exchange rate movements into import prices and other instances of declining pass
through as we look across the sample of countries. Importantly, we stress here that the
presumption that pass-through rates have systematically declined across countries, and across a
wide spectrum of goods, is not supported. It is not yet appropriate to conclude that persistent
change has occurred in the distribution of pass through into import prices of manufactured
goods.

3
  There are many reasons why the pass-through estimation equation can generate poor results. One of these reasons
is that the proxies for production costs may be poor. Another reason could be codetermination of exchange rates
and the prices of some goods. In recent years, the dollar and petroleum prices have exhibited stronger comovement
than in the preceding decade.
4
  We are able to compare a pre-1995 period with the period from 1995 to the present for all countries, except France

III. Mapping imported inputs and distribution margins into consumption prices of goods

        One goal of the analysis is to understand the feedback between exchange rate changes
and stimuli to consumption prices or goods across countries.5 In order to move from exchange
rate sensitivity in the border prices of goods to sensitivity in retail prices, analyses need to
account for the role of the distribution sector and imported inputs used in production. For this
purpose, we use a basic approach of a two country model with wage stickiness and
monopolistically competitive producers. Our specific formulation closely follows Campa and
Goldberg (2006), and the prior studies discussed therein.


A. The mapping
This approach follows a utility-based framework that explicitly tracks the degree of
substitutability of imported and domestic products, and presents the explicit cost functions faced
by producers. C.E.S. utility functions are assumed over nontraded (n) and traded goods (t)
consumption, with both sectors producing a continuum of varieties with similar elasticities of
substitution, θ. Prices for any good i are a markup over costs ct(i), with the markup rate as
θ (1 − θ ) . Consumption of tradable and nontradable products are also governed by a constant
elasticity of substitution φ. Home (h) and foreign (f) tradable goods are imperfect substitutes in
consumption, with an elasticity of substitution of φT > 1. Bringing one unit of good i where i ε (h,
f, n) to consumers requires units of a basket of differentiated nontraded goods for distribution
services.6 We denote these distribution costs per unit of output by mt (i : e ) , where this basket of
differentiated nontraded goods includes expenditures on wholesale and retail sector services, as
well as expenditures on transportation and storage. These distribution expenditures are permitted
to be sensitive to the exchange rate e, which is defined as the domestic cost per unit of foreign
exchange. Per unit production requires domestic labor and imported inputs. Labor inputs
required per unit of output are inversely related to sectoral productivity parameters Zi. Wt refers

   Another goal of the analysis of pass through and consumption prices of categories of goods is to understand the
signal sent to consumers to induce expenditure switching between imported and home produced goods. This signal
is a critical link in trade balance sensitivity to exchange rate fluctuations. See Goldberg and Tille (2006).

  Burstein, Neves and Rebelo (2003) highlight the role that distribution margins can play in lowering exchange-rate
pass-through into consumption prices.

to the wage per unit of labor at home, and Wt * refers to foreign wages. Productivity parameters

as well as domestic and foreign wages are assumed sticky over the relevant pricing horizon.
Imported input shares per unit of output are denoted by μ t (i : e ) , for home tradable goods and

home nontradable goods. These imported cost shares also are sensitive to exchange rates.
Foreign currency variables are indicated by superscript “*”. The pricing equations Pt (i ) for home

nontradable goods n, home tradable goods h, and imported consumption goods f are given by

           Differentiating equations (1) through (3), we derive expressions for exchange-rate pass –
through elasticities into home tradable, home nontradable, and imported goods prices. The
respective pass-through rates into the consumption prices of these goods are shown in equations
(4) through (6). Notationally, η a,b terms denote elasticities of a with respect to changes in b.

           Equation (4) shows that pass through into the consumption price of nontradables occurs
only when this sector has cost sensitivity to exchange rates through its use of imported inputs.




                                                                                                                                           9
Some of the exchange rate pass through in nontradables can be mitigated to the extent that
nontradables producers can substitute away from these imported inputs as they become more
expensive, η μt ( n:e ),e < 0 .
         Equation (5) shows exchange-rate pass through into the consumption prices of tradables
produced in the home market. This pass through occurs both because home tradables use
imported inputs and also because sectoral expenditures on nontraded distribution services can be
sensitive to exchange rates. Such sensitivity can be passive, because nontradables prices can
respond to exchange rates through imported inputs (as in 4). More active sensitivity arises if
distributors strategically adjust the markups they take on home tradables that compete with
imported brands. This phenomenon, called double marginalization, is explored in Campa and
Goldberg (2006) and Hellerstein (2004).
         Pass through into the consumption prices of imports, Equation (6), differs from border
price sensitivity of imports. For the derivations of equations (4) through (6), exchange-rate pass
through at the border is assumed to be complete, i.e. equal to one. If pass through at the border is
different than one, the actual border pass through rate simply multiplies equations (4) through (6)
Whatever the border price sensitivity, local expenditures on distribution dilute the import content
of this consumption good (the first term), even more so if distributors also actively reduce the
margins changed during home currency depreciations to limit changes in market shares of the
products being distributed. One force magnifying the pass through of exchange rates, and
therefore working in the opposite direction, is that from equation (4) whereby distribution costs
rise if these services rely on imported inputs into production and have costs that are sensitive to
exchange rates.
           Equations (4) to (6) also show the impact that increases in the distribution margins have
on the expected pass-through rates of a given change in imported prices of final goods or
intermediate inputs in final consumer prices. In general, increases in the share of the distribution
sector in the final price of a good, decrease the impact on the final consumption price of the
good. For non-traded goods, this effect occurs mainly through imported inputs used in
production. For domestically-produced traded goods, the impact in equation (5) occurs through
a decrease in the foreign value added part of the product. Moreover, as the share of imported
inputs in the production of the good increases, changes in border prices of imported products




                                                                                                 10
have a higher percentage impact in the production cost of domestically produced goods. This
results in higher pass-through into consumer prices.
         The existing evidence on pass-through into import prices at the aggregate level suggests
that the pass-through may have declined in the last decade, at least in developed countries (see
Pollard and Coughlin (2005), Marazzi et al (2005) and Olivei (2002)). We have argued that such
evidence is not definitive and requires further monitoring. Yet, despite this possible change in
pass-through at the border, the outcome of the debate does not impinge on the key roles that
imported inputs and distribution costs have in the final impact of import prices on consumer
prices. Increases in imported inputs and in vertical trade that have occurred in the last decade
would suggest a rise in import price pass-through. Increases in vertical trade also raise the
likelihood that imported products have value added that originates in the home market. For
example, U.S. imports of cars from Canada could contain engines that were first produced in the
United States, exported to Canada, and ultimately re-exported to the United States. The result is
a smaller share of Canadian value-added in U.S. imports, and less Canadian content to be acted
upon by exchange rate movements. In this context, we could expect declining sensitivity to
exchange rate changes of auto import prices from Canada as Canadian content falls. At the same
time, increases in the imported input component of domestically produced goods imply a higher
exposure of domestically produced products to exchange rate changes and a higher pass-through
from import prices into final consumer prices.7 To quantify the relative size of each of these
effects and the insulating role of the distribution sector, in the next section we examine the
evolution of imported input shares and distribution margins over the last decade.

  Feenstra (1998) and Rauch (1999) show the increasing role that the vertical integration of production across
borders has on international prices and trade. This discussion has not dealt with the issue of transfer pricing, which
pertains to intra-firm pricing policies. For instance, a multinational may differentially price sales of goods to
subsidiaries versus to unrelated parties.




                                                                                                                   11
B. Patterns in Imported Input Use and Distribution Expenditures


We measure the share of imported inputs and distribution expenditures for industries by using
country-specific input-output tables.8 Our full sample of imported input data spans 16 countries,
59 homogeneous manufacturing, primary-industry, and service industry groupings, and 1 to 2
years per country-industry observation.9 The data on distribution margins span all but one of the
same countries, but with narrower availability in terms of industries. The reduced availability
occurs because, in some cases, service industry inputs into industry production are unavailable.
Details on data construction and availability are provided in Appendix Table 2.
        Our analysis extends information reported in Campa and Goldberg (2006), which looked
at the disaggregated data across countries. That study observed that industries with the highest
imported input share are Coke, Refined Petroleum Products, and Nuclear Fuel Manufacturing.
Within the manufacturing sector, the next highest imported input shares are in Computers and
Communication Equipment, at around 50 percent. More generally, industries involved in
services, agriculture, and commodity production have much lower shares of imported inputs than
industries in manufacturing. For instance, Real Estate services, and Forestry, Logging and
Related Services have average imported input shares between 6 percent and 14 percent of total
costs, respectively. By contrast, almost all manufacturing industries have imported input shares
above 20 percent. The industry within manufacturing with the lowest imported input share is
Food and Beverage manufacturing.
        The dispersion of imported input shares in production differs significantly by country. In
general, larger countries have lower shares of imported inputs while smaller countries have
higher shares. The United States has by far the lowest ratio of imported inputs into production of
all countries in our sample. Ireland, with 51 percent, has by far the largest reliance on imported
inputs with other smaller countries like Belgium, Hungary and the Netherlands also heavily
reliant on imported parts and components.
        More formally, we consider the extent to which industries versus countries versus time
explain the prevalence of import input use. We run regressions using 1,394 imported share

  Details on construction methods are in Campa and Goldberg (2006).

  Compared with Table 1, we drop Australia and Greece from the analysis due to lack of appropriate input-output
information to allow us to compute the data on imported inputs.

identify the portions of the observational variance within this data base that are attributable to
industry fixed effects, country fixed effects, or time dummies. With the exception of France,
Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom, each country included in the sample
has two years (typically five years apart) of imported input data.

Note: We define the percent of the full regression adj. R-squared explained by the industry dummies as (adjusted r-
squared from the regression including only the industry dummies)/(adj. r-squared of the full specification). The
alternative, (adj. r-squared from the regression including everything but the industry dummies)/(adj. r-squared of the
full specification), would yield slightly higher percents.


        The full regression specification accounts for 70 percent of the variation in imported
input use (Table 2). In order of importance, imported input use is determined first by industry
identity, then country, then by time. Having already discussed industry and country highlights, it
is interesting to focus attention on time trends in imported input use across countries. Of the 57
industries with enough observations to run a regression, 16 industries had time trends that were
statistically significant, at a 10 percent level. All of these trends were positive.10 On average, the
industries with significant trends had imported input use increase by 0.9 percentage points per
year. Manufacturing industries: Coke, refined petroleum products and nuclear fuel had the
largest (statistically significant) increase in imported input share, rising 3.4 percentage points per



10
    The industries with significant time trends include food, energy extraction and refining, manufacture and
servicing of computers and other machinery, and some service industries.

 percentage points per year.
           While this regression analysis has used disaggregated industry data, it also is useful to
 consider broader aggregates. The results of this aggregation are provided in Table 3. Across the
 broadly aggregated sections it is clear that Energy and Manufactured Goods have by far the
 highest imported input shares at, on average, 43 percent and 38 percent of total inputs
 respectively. Non-manufactured goods, food, raw materials, and the distribution sector all have
 average imported input shares at or just under 20 percent. Across countries we confirm the
 observation that Ireland, at 52 percent, and the United States, at 6 percent, span the spectrum of
 intensities for the group of sixteen countries.

       Comparable data analysis of expenditures on distribution services also generates
interesting observations. First, we conduct a variance decomposition exercise across the most
disaggregated industry level data (59 industries, 16 countries). As shown in Table 4, this
decomposition explains substantially less of the sample variation than was the case when we
examined patterns of imported input use. Industry fixed effects had the strongest explanatory
power. There are common patterns across countries in the incidence of high and low distribution
margin expenditures for industries. Distribution expenses are consistently high in Apparel (18),
Leather (19), Furniture manufacturing (36), and Fishing and related services (5). Distribution
expenses appear to be lowest on some commodity-type products and industries, such as
Petroleum and Natural Gas Extraction (11), uranium, thorium, and metal ore mining (12 and 13),
and non-automobile transportation equipment manufactures (35).

       Time fixed effects explain little of the variation observed in distribution expenditures.
Each country in the sample typically had two years of distribution margins data included in the
analysis. Of 30 industries with enough observations to examine trend, only 7 had statistically
significant time trends. Among these industries, 4 had positive time trends (Agriculture, Mining,
Manufacturing of Food products, and Pulp, Paper and Paper products) and 3 had negative time
trends (Manufacturing of Radio and Television, Motor Vehicles, and Medical and Precision
equipment.).Thus, the number of industries with strong distribution expenditure trends was low,
and the pattern of changes in distribution expenditures was not persistent for all industries in




                                                                                               15
either a positive or negative direction. Hungary and Finland have the lowest overall level for
distribution expenditures. On the other extreme, the United States had the largest distribution
expenditures in the sample (0.29 in 2002). This observation contrasts sharply with what was
observed for imported input use, where increasing globalization of production was readily
apparent across many industries. Over the past decade, imported input use and globalization of
production has grown substantially, while changes in distribution expenditures have been more
diffuse and bidirectional.
       One short-coming of this distribution margin data, as explained in Campa and Goldberg
(2006), is that there is a trade-off in getting information expenditure margins at the industry-level
and getting information relevant for the consumption of households. The total distribution
margins with industry-level detail encompass margins on total final consumption. This total
includes distribution margins for household consumption, investment, public sector, and export
markets. In our modelling of CPI sensitivity to exchange rates and import prices we use the
distribution expenditure specifically for the household sector, eschewing the more extensive
industry-specific information used in the variance decomposition. In part, the country-fixed
effects in the variance decomposition just discussed reflect the components of final demand in
each country. Distribution margins in fixed capital formation and exports are substantially lower
than those on household consumption.



IV. Calibrating Pass Through of Exchange Rates into Consumption Prices
       Pass through of exchange rates into consumer price indices has two main components.
First, we require information on how exchange rates pass through into import prices. This
information was presented in Section II, and in Table 1. Second, we require a model of import
price transmission into consumer prices. This model was provided in Section III A, and is based
on Campa and Goldberg (2006). In this section of the paper we focus on calibrating the model
using our information on changes in key parameters, including sectoral distribution expenditure
and imported input use. Our goal is to track, quantitatively and qualitatively, the sources of
change in predicted pass-through of exchange rates into consumption prices. We begin by
assuming relevant parameters for calibrating equations (4) to (6).




                                                                                                  16
        Assumptions are made for the values of demand elasticity ( θ ), the elasticities of
substitution among groups of products, and elasticities of response to exchange rates of
distribution margins and imported inputs.11 Our assumed estimate of the demand elasticity, θ , is
consistent with evidence on the steady state price over cost markups, defined by
markup = θ (θ − 1)
                       . Basu and Fernald (1997) find markups for United States industries in the
range of 11 percent. Oliveira Martins, Scarpetta, and Pilat (1996) find markups ranging between
10 and 35 percent, in data spanning 14 OECD countries and 36 manufacturing industries. These
markup values imply a range for θ between 10 and 4. For our calibration we assume θ = 7 .
Using higher demand elasticities would yield lower values of pass through into home tradables
and now tradeable goods prices.
        The simple model of equations (4) through (6) is able to explore many alternative
specifications on substitution elasticities, changes to industry competitive structures, and state-
contingent markups. Likewise, a range of assumptions could be made about the ability of
producers to substitute between home-produced inputs and imported inputs when exchange rates
alter the relative prices of inputs from different sources, or about pro-active adjustment of profit
margins of distributors of goods. These important themes, explored at length in Campa and
Goldberg (2006), are not emphasized here.
        Our specific goal is to explore the changes in pass-through into consumer prices that are
specifically attributable to changes in pass through at the border, changes in imported input use
and distribution sector expenditures. With this objective in mind, we “shut down” some of the
other forces which would influence exchange-rate transmission into the final consumption prices
of goods. Specifically the initial relative prices of imported and home tradables, and of home
tradables and nontradables, are assumed to be the same. Imported input shares are assumed
inelastic with respect to exchange rates and are assumed to be identical across the production of
nontradables and home tradables. Finally, distribution expenditures are assumed inelastic with

respect to exchange rates, so that η                      and η                  = 0.

   The calibrations basically shut down the role of initial conditions and substitution between tradables and
nontradables goods by setting the relative price terms to equal one in the calculations. Accordingly, values of φ do
not matter for these calibrations.




                                                                                                                 17
          We focus on data for All Industries, Manufacturing, Nonmanufacturing, Energy, Food,
and Raw Materials, which are the industry groupings for which we also have information on
import prices and exchange rate pass-through at the border. While there are eighteen countries
for which we have been able to estimate exchange rate pass-through into import prices at this
level of index disaggregation, changes in both imported input use and distribution expenditures
are available only for ten of these countries.


Calibrated pass-through. Table 5 reports the calibrated pass-through elasticities into final
prices of imports and domestically produced traded goods according to equations (5) and (6).
These pass-through coefficients imply the transmission into final prices of a given percentage
change in the import price at the border. The estimates use the imported input shares and
distribution ratios calculated as described in the previous section for the years indicated in the
second column of the table.
          The pass-through transmission to final prices of imported products is relatively high and
fluctuates for the aggregate of all industries between 0.68 for the United States and 0.9 for
Hungary and Sweden. This means that, given a change in imported goods prices at a country’s
border, nearly 70 percent of this price signal will be transmitted to the final consumption prices
of the imported goods in the United States, and nearly 90 percent in Hungary and Sweden. The
two key determinants of variations in this rate of pass-through are the share of imported inputs in
the production of non-traded services that enter the distribution sector, and the share of the
distribution sector into final prices of the product. For a given share of imported inputs into the
production of non-traded goods in the country, the higher the share of distribution costs the lower
the rate of transmission into final prices. On the other hand as the share of imported inputs into
non traded goods increases, so does the sensitivity of distribution costs to changes in import
prices.

The numbers reported in Table 5 are the estimated values of equations (5) and (6). The computation
further assumes an elasticity of demand of 7, and zero elasticities of exchange rate changes to distribution
margins in home products, and to the share of imported inputs used in production.

        Differences in calibrated pass-through across industries for a given country are relatively
small. Such differences arise due to differences in the share of distribution costs in different
sectors and these tend to be relatively small. Larger differences arise across countries. For
instance, the United States has the highest share of distribution costs in the sample (see Table 5)
and a low share of imported inputs in production in distribution services (see Table 3) leading to
the result that the predicted transmission into final prices of imported goods is the lowest. On the
other extreme, Hungary has the lowest share of distribution margins (0.07 in Table 5) and the
second highest, after Ireland, ratio of imported inputs into production (0.44 in Table 3). Its rate of
pass-through into final prices of imported products is 0.90, the highest in the sample.
        Pass-through into final prices of domestically produced traded goods is reported in the
lower panel of Table 5. Transmission rates are significantly lower than the transmission rates for
imported products. The transmission rates for all industries (column 3) fluctuate between 0.65
for Ireland and 0.07 for the U.S. Looking at equation (5), two are the key differences for the
lower transmission rates. First, and most important, is the ratio of imported inputs into the
production of domestic goods (the last term in the square brackets of equation (5)). The lower
this ratio, the less sensitive are input costs to changes in prices of imported products and the
weaker are cost pressures arising from exchange rates into the prices of domestically produced
goods. The second factor is the importance of the distribution sector and the sensitivity of this
sector to changes in import prices (the first term in the square brackets of equation (5)). The
higher the sensitivity of the distribution sector to import prices, the higher also the pass-through
into final prices of domestically produced goods.
        The U.S. shows the lowest sensitivity of domestically produced goods prices. This is due
mainly to two factors: its lowest sensitivity of final prices of imports reported above and to its
lower share of imported inputs into production of domestic goods. In contrast, Hungary again
shows the highest predicted sensitivity of the prices of domestically-produced goods to changes
in the border prices of imported goods.
        Differences across industries are much larger for the case of domestically produced
goods. Transmission rates are substantially larger for Energy and Manufacturing than for the




                                                                                                         20
other three industries in almost all countries in the sample. This is mainly due to the higher ratio
of imported inputs into the production of Manufacturing and Energy products relative to the
other industries (see Table 3).


Changes over time in calibrated pass-through. To evaluate the evolution of changes in these
transmission rates on border prices over time we compute the same transmission rates as those
reported in Table 5 using the latest available information on distribution margins and imported
input shares for each country12. Table 6 reports the difference between the estimated values for
equations (5) and (6) using data from these later years and the estimated transmission rates using
1995 data and reported in Table 5.
        Increases in the pass-through of border prices into the consumption prices of imported
products can be due, following equation (6), to decreases in the share of distribution costs in the
final price of imported products. Increases in the prices of non traded goods due to increases in
the imported inputs used in the production of non traded goods can result in an increase in pass-
through of exchange rates into final prices of imported products.
        The results in the top-panel of Table 6 indicate that there has been an increase in the
calibrated pass-through of movements in border prices of imports into the final prices of
imported and domestically-produced goods for most countries. For aggregated imported goods,
this increased transmission of border prices to final consumption prices has happened in all
countries shown, with the exception of the United States, Italy, and, to a very small degree,
Belgium and Sweden. The countries with an increase in the rate of transmission have this result
mainly because imported inputs are more extensively used in the production of non-traded goods
that factor into the costs of distribution services.

The numbers reported here are the difference between the estimated values of equations (5) and (6) for each country
using data around 1995 (reported in Table 5) and using data for the year 2000. The computation further assumes an
elasticity of demand of 4, and zero elasticities of exchange rate changes to distribution margins in home products,
and to the share of imported inputs used in production.


          For the United States and Italy, the decline in border price transmission into the final
prices of imported goods is a feature of Manufacturing, Food, and Raw Materials. For the
United States, pass through into Nonmanufactured imports and Energy imports rose, while it




                                                                                                                22
declined for these sectors in Italy. The share of imported inputs into production on non-tradables
in these countries has also increased, although relatively less than for other countries, in the last
decade. Therefore, this lower calibrated sensitivity of the final consumption prices of imported
goods has been mainly due to increases in expenditure on distribution services in these
industries. In contrast, for the United States the substantial decrease in the distribution
expenditures in Energy and Non-manufacturing (of almost 25 percent) have resulted in a
substantial increase in pass-through for those industries.
       The bottom panel of Table 6 shows the imputed changes in the pass-through of import
prices changes into the prices of domestic tradable products. Following equation (5), the two
forces that would increase this pass through are increases in the share of imported inputs in
production, whether for these goods specifically or for the distribution costs for domestically
produced goods. This pass through also would rise if distribution services fall as share of the
total production costs of the respective types of home produced goods. The results in Table 6
show that the imputed pass-through into home-produced tradable goods has increased in almost
all industries and countries. The effect is positive in all cases in Manufacturing, Food and
Energy industries. These changes have been larger in absolute value in Energy than in the other
industries.
       This rise in transmission of import price moves into the final prices of domestically-
produced goods has been mainly due to changes in the ratio of imported inputs in the production
in these industries. The increased in imported inputs in the production of these industries jointly
with the increase in the use of imported inputs in the production of non-traded goods discussed
above have both contributed to a higher sensitivity of final good prices of domestically produced
goods to changes in import prices. The United States has had the smallest overall increase in its
pass-through mainly due to its much lower pass-through rates among the countries in the sample,
as reported in Table 5 above. However, in percentage terms its pass-through for all industries has
increased by 12 percent, among the higher percentage increase of all countries in the sample.
       The share of imported inputs in the production of domestic tradables has increased in all
countries in the sample over the past decade. This increase has been proportionally larger in
Energy and Manufacturing than in the other three industries. The share of imported inputs in the
production of nontradables has also increased in the majority of countries. Only Sweden and




                                                                                                  23
Austria show a small decline in this ratio. In contrast, the change in the share of distribution
costs has not been so homogeneous across countries. This share increased for Belgium, Finland,
Italy and the U.S. The increase in distribution services has been primarily in Food (it increased
for all countries) and in Manufacturing. This pattern results in a higher growth of pass through
into the consumption prices of domestically-produced goods, in most cases, than for imported
goods (see Table 6). This is especially the case for manufactured goods. Given a change in
goods prices at the border, the implication is that an induced relative price effect is smaller. This
observation may be relevant for discussions of expenditure switching induced by exchange rate
changes.
       Goldberg and Tille (2006) argue that an adjustment process to current account imbalances
is likely to be asymmetric across the United States and its partners in trade, in particular because
price sensitivity to exchange rates is expected to be substantially less in the United States. This
would lead to relative prices of imports for the United States to move to a lesser degree with
exchange rate fluctuations than the relative prices of United States trading partners. The results
of Table 6 provide perspective on how this asymmetry has changed recently. In particularly,
focusing only on manufacturing and the all industries columns of Table 6, we observe that the
increased transmission into prices was smaller for the United States than for other countries.
This suggests that the asymmetry in adjustment to exchange rate movements may, all else equal,
have gotten larger between the United States and some trading partners in the most recent
decade.


V.     Conclusions
       This paper has explored the channels for transmission of exchange rates into the prices of
various types of consumption goods for eighteen economies. We began by highlighting the
transmission of exchange rates into the border prices of imported goods as the initial step in pass-
through into the final consumption prices of specific goods. Rates of exchange-rate pass through
into import prices are measured with considerable precision for Manufactured goods, but are less
precisely measured with respect to Non-manufactured goods, Raw materials, and Energy. The
period since 1995 may have been one of marked changes in pass through into import prices of




                                                                                                  24
Manufactured goods. Some countries have higher observed pass-through into import prices while
other countries have lower rates of pass-through over the past decade.
       Yet, these changes in transmission of exchange rates into the border prices of imports do
not directly translate into an identical level or directions of change in exchange rate transmission
into the consumption prices of the same categories of goods. The second part of the paper
addresses this theme of the transmission of these border prices into final consumption prices. The
emphasis of the model-based approach to transmission is that there are important roles played by
sectoral expenditures on imported inputs and on distribution services. We apply this model to
eighteen countries. Recent changes in import-price transmission into final consumption prices
are associated more with the evolution of imported input use in production than with changing
sectoral expenditures on distribution services. In general, use of imported inputs in production
has grown sharply since the mid-1990s, increasing the sensitivity to exchange rates of the
production costs of a broad spectrum of goods. By way of contrast, expenditures on distribution
services have not trended consistently across countries or across industries.
       The findings of generalized increases in the calibrated sensitivity of consumption prices
of domestically-produced traded goods to exchange rates are important. They provide
perspective on the potential for expenditure switching and trade adjustment to occur in the
aftermath of changes in exchange rates. As Goldberg and Tille (2006) have argued, an
adjustment process to current account imbalances involving exchange rate adjustment is likely to
be asymmetric across the United States and its partners in trade, in particular because price
sensitivity to exchange rates is expected to be substantially less in the United States than in the
partner countries. It is useful to explore if this asymmetry is likely growing over time, or
declining over time.
       Our calibration results imply that the sensitivity of consumption prices of domestically-
produced tradables is rising at a faster rate than the price sensitivity of imported goods. If this is
the case, the expenditure switching effects of exchange rate movements are weakened over time,
primarily as a result of more integrated production internationally and greater use of imported
inputs in production. All else equal, a greater movement in nominal exchange rates would be
needed to generate the same elasticity of response of real trade flows. This is an issue that
warrants further study.




                                                                                                   25
       Another implication of these findings is increases in the transmission into United States
final prices have been smaller than into final prices in other countries. With exchange rate pass
through into border prices already larger outside the United States, the changes over time have
magnified the differences in transmission into final consumption prices. With the exchange rate
as one instrument of trade balance adjustment, it may be the case that the task of expenditure-
switching induced by exchange rates now falls even more heavily on the U.S. trade partners than
on the United States. This too warrants further study.

DATA APPENDIX
OECD import price series: Source: OECD Statistical Compendium. Quarterly time series of
aggregate import price indices in local currency for 1975:Q1 to approximately 2004:Q4. We
work with the maximum amount of data available by country in our analysis.

Effective Exchange Rate Indices. The nominal exchange rate index, is the trade weighted
exchange rate index provides by the IMF. Code in IFS database: neu. The real effective
exchange rate used is code reu. Regression analysis uses the inverse of the reported series, so
that an increase in the exchange rate is a currency depreciation.

Foreign Price Index. We construct a consolidated export partners cost proxy by taking advantage
of the IFS reporting of both real (reu) and nominal (neu) exchange rate series and computing
Wt x , j = neutj ⋅ Pt j reutj by each country in our sample. This gives us a measure of trading partner
costs (over all partners x of importing country j), with each partner weighted by its importance in
the importing country’s trade. The real effective exchange rate is calculated from Unit Labour
Costs for developed countries by the IMF. Code in IFS database: reu. The consumer price
indices from the International Financial Statistics. Code in IFS database: 64.

Input-Output (I/O) databases.
The Input-Output data for the different countries come from different sources:

- Data for Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and
the United Kingdom come from the Eurostat National Accounts database. This database
computes the input-output tables for these countries and reports a supply and a use table
disaggregated to a total of 59 industries. These 59 industries include 22 manufacturing industries,
5 mining and extraction industries, 3 agriculture industries, 5 construction and energy industries,
8 trade and transport industries, and 17 service industries. We report distribution margin data for
29 manufacturing, mining and agriculture industries (we merge two mining industries into one,
given their small production values in most countries).

- Data for Australia on input-output tables comes from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The
data reports supply and final use tables for a total of 237 industries. We convert these industries
into the CPA classification of 29 manufacturing, mining and agriculture industries.

- Data for the United States on input output tables come from the “Benchmark Input Output
Accounts for the US economy” (years 1992, and 1997). The U.S. input output accounts use a
specific IO industry classification, which can then be transformed into the NIPA classification
(Nacional Income and Product Account Tables) and then aggregated into the CPA classification
of 29 manufacturing, mining and agriculture industries used in the paper.

- Data for New Zealand on input output tables come from Statistics New Zealand. The data
reports supply, use, and import tables for a total of 210 industries. We aggregate these industries
into the CPA classification of 29 manufacturing, mining and agriculture industries.




                                                                                                    29
Calculation of distribution margins:
We compute the distribution margins for total supply in the industry as the ratio of the value of
trade and transport margins to the value of total supply in the industry at purchasers’ prices.
Purchaser prices include the cost of supply at basic prices plus the distribution (retail, wholesale
and transportation) costs plus net taxes on products. To the extent that taxation differs
significantly across countries for the same industry and across industries within a country,
distribution margins may not be perfectly comparable in all cases. See Campa and Goldberg
(2006).

Calculation of imported input ratios:
The Input Output tables report the value of the use matrix broken down the use of inputs by
origin: domestic and imported. We calculate imported inputs into the production of each industry
as the ratio between the total value of imported intermediate inputs by an industry to the value of
total intermediate inputs.

Techniques to construct the imported intermediate flows matrix in the input-output tables vary by
country. Most countries used to some extent the import proportionality assumption. This
technique assumes that an industry uses an import of a particular product in proportion to its total
use of that product. This assumption is limiting since some industries might be using inputs from
domestic and import sources in different proportions than the average of the economy. Countries
made use of this assumption at very different levels of aggregation. For instance, the OECD
reports that Germany and Denmark made used of over 2000 different commodities, while the
U.S. and Japan used slightly over 500 and the United Kingdom less than 200.
