                                            ABSTRACT



In this paper, we study Ramsey-optimal fiscal and monetary policy in a medium-scale model of the
U.S. business cycle. The model features a rich array of real and nominal rigidities that have been
identified in the recent empirical literature as salient in explaining observed aggregate fluctuations.
The main result of the paper is that price stability appears to be a central goal of optimal monetary
policy. The optimal rate of inflation under an income tax regime is half a percent per year with a
volatility of 1.1 percent. This result is surprising given that the model features a number of frictions
that in isolation would call for a volatile rate of inflation---particularly nonstate-contingent nominal
public debt, no lump-sum taxes, and sticky wages. Under an income-tax regime, the optimal income
tax rate is quite stable, with a mean of 30 percent and a standard deviation of 1.1 percent. Simple
monetary and fiscal rules are shown to implement a competitive equilibrium that mimics well the
one induced by the Ramsey policy. When the fiscal authority is allowed to tax capital and labor
income at different rates, optimal fiscal policy is characterized by a large and volatile subsidy on
capital.

1       Introduction
This paper addresses a classic question in macroeconomics, namely, how should a benevolent
government conduct stabilization policy. A central characteristic of all existing studies is
that optimal policy is derived in highly stylized environments. Typically, optimal policy
is characterized for economies with a single or a very small number of deviations from the
frictionless neoclassical paradigm. A case in point are the numerous recent studies concerned
with optimal monetary policy within the context of the two-equation, one-friction, neo-
Keynesian model without capital accumulation.1 Another example of studies in which the
optimal policy design problem is analyzed within theoretical frameworks featuring a small
number of rigidities include models with flexible prices and distorting income taxes (Lucas
and Stokey, 1983; Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2004b). An advantage of this stylized approach
to optimal stabilization policy is that it facilitates understanding the ways in which policy
should respond to mitigate the distortionary effects of a particular friction in isolation.
   An important drawback of studying optimal stabilization policy one distortion at a time
is that highly simplified models are unlikely to provide a satisfactory account of cyclical
movements for more than just a few macroeconomic variables of interest. For this reason,
the usefulness of this strategy to produce policy advice for the real world is necessarily
limited.
   The approach to optimal policy that we propose in this paper departs from the literature
extant in that it is based on a rich medium-scale theoretical framework capable of explaining
observed business cycle fluctuations for a wide range of nominal and real variables. Following
the lead of Kimball (1995), the model emphasizes the importance of combining nominal as
well as real rigidities in explaining the propagation of macroeconomic shocks. Specifically,
the model features four nominal frictions, sticky prices, sticky wages, a demand for money
by households, and a cash-in-advance constraint on the wage bill of firms, and five sources
of real rigidities, investment adjustment costs, variable capacity utilization, habit formation,
imperfect competition in product and factor markets, and distortionary taxation. Aggregate
fluctuations are assumed to be driven by supply shocks, which take the form of stochastic
variations in total factor productivity, and demand shocks stemming from exogenous inno-
vations to the level of government purchases and the level of government transfers. Altig et
al. (2004) and Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) argue that the model economy for
which we seek to design optimal policy can indeed explain the observed responses of inflation,
real wages, nominal interest rates, money growth, output, investment, consumption, labor

(2003), and Clarida, Galı́, and Gertler (1999), among many others.

productivity, and real profits to productivity and monetary shocks in the postwar United
States. In this respect, the present paper aspires to be a step ahead in the research program
of generating policy evaluation that is of relevance for actual policy making.
   The government is assumed to be benevolent in the Ramsey sense, that is, it seeks to bring
about the competitive equilibrium that maximizes the lifetime utility of the representative
agent and has access to a commitment technology that allows it to honor its promises. The
policy instruments available to the government are assumed to be taxes on income, possibly,
differentiated across different sources of income, and the short-term nominal interest rate.
Public debt is assumed to be nominal and non-state contingent.
  A key finding of the paper is that price stability appears to be a central goal of optimal
monetary policy. The optimal rate of inflation under an income tax regime is 0.5 percent
per year with a volatility of 1.1 percent. In this sense, price stickiness emerges as the single
most important distortion shaping optimal policy. This result is surprising given that the
model features a number of other frictions that in isolation would call for a volatile rate of
inflation with a mean different from zero.
    Consider first the forces calling for an optimal inflation rate that is different from zero.
As is well known, the presence of a demand for money by households provides an incentive to
drive inflation down to a level consistent with the Friedman rule. In this paper, we identify
two additional reasons why the Ramsey planner may want to deviate from price stability.
First, under an income tax regime, i.e., when all sources of income are taxed at the same
rate, the Ramsey planner has an inflationary bias originating from the fact that it is less
distorting to tax labor income than it is to tax capital income. With a cash-in-advance
constraint on the wage bill of firms, inflation acts as a tax on labor income. Second, the
Ramsey planner has an incentive to tax away transfers as they represent pure rents accruing
to households. Without a direct instruments to tax transfers, the government imposes an
indirect levy on this source of household income via the inflation tax.
   Optimal policy calls for low inflation volatility in spite of the following two distortions
that by themselves call for high inflation volatility. First, the fact that nominal government
debt is non-state contingent and that regular taxes are distortionary, makes it attractive for
the Ramsey planner to use unexpected variations in inflation as a lump-sum tax on nominal
asset holdings. This is indeed the reason why in flexible price environments the optimal
inflation volatility is very high (Chari et al. 1995). Second, the fact that nominal wages
are sticky provides an incentive for the government to set the price level so as to engineer
the efficient real wage. This practice, when studied in isolation, also makes high inflation
volatility optimal.
   When the fiscal authority is allowed to tax capital and labor income at different rates,


                                               3
optimal fiscal policy is characterized by a large and volatile subsidy on capital. It is well
known from the work of Judd (2002) that in the presence of imperfect competition in product
markets optimal taxation calls for a subsidy on capital of a magnitude approximately equal
to the markup of prices over marginal cost. However, our results suggest that the optimal
capital subsidy is much larger than the one identified in the work of Judd. The reason for
this discrepancy is that capital depreciation in combination with a depreciation allowance,
which is ignored in the work of Judd, exacerbates the need to subsidize capital. This is
because the markup distorts the gross rate of return on capital whereas the subsidy applies
to the return on capital net of depreciation.
    In our model, the optimal capital subsidy is extremely volatile. Its standard deviation is
150 percent. The high volatility of capital income taxes emerges for the familiar reason that
capital is a fixed factor of production in the short run, so the fiscal authority uses unexpected
changes in the capital income tax rate as a shock absorber for innovations in its budget. We
identify two frictions capable of driving this high volatility down significantly. One is time
to tax. When tax rates are determined four quarters in advance, the optimal volatility of
the capital income tax rate falls to about 50 percent. This is because the tax elasticity of
the demand for capital increases with the number of periods between the announcement of
the tax rate and its application. The second friction that is important in understanding
the volatility of capital taxes is investment adjustment cost. Intuitively, the higher are the
impediments to adjust the level of investment, the lower is the elasticity of capital with
respect to temporary changes in tax rates. In the absence of investment adjustment costs,
the optimal volatility of the capital income tax rate falls to 65 percent. Furthermore, in
an environment with 4 periods of time to tax and no capital adjustment cost, the optimal
capital income tax has a volatility of 25 percent.
   Ramsey outcomes are mute on the issue of what policy regimes can implement them.
The information on policy one can extract from the solution to the Ramsey problem is
limited to the equilibrium behavior of policy variables such as tax rates, the nominal interest
rate, etc. as a function of the state of the economy. Even if the policymaker could observe
the state of the economy, using the equilibrium process of the policy variables to define
a policy regime would not guarantee the Ramsey outcome as the competitive equilibrium.
The problem is that such a policy regime could give rise to multiple equilibria. We address
the issue of implementation of optimal policy by limiting attention to simple monetary and
fiscal rules. These rules are defined over a small set of readily available macro indicators and
are designed to ensure local uniqueness of the rational expectations equilibrium. We find
parameterizations of such policy rules capable of inducing equilibrium dynamics fairly close
to those associated with the Ramsey equilibrium.

   Finally, a methodological contribution of this paper is the development of a set of nu-
merical tools that allow the computation of Ramsey policy in a general class of stochastic
dynamic general equilibrium models. Matlab code to implement these computations is pub-
licly available at the authors’ websites.
    The remainder of the paper is organized in seven sections. Section 2 presents the theoreti-
cal model. Section 3 describes the calibration of the model and the assumed functional forms
for preferences and technologies. Section 4 characterizes the Ramsey steady state. Section 5
studies the Ramsey dynamics in an economy where the fiscal authority is constrained to
taxing all sources of income at the same rate. Section 6 identifies simple interest-rate and
tax rules capable of mimicking well the Ramsey equilibrium dynamics. Section 7 studies the
Ramsey problem in an economy in which capital and labor can be taxed at different rates.
This section also analyzes the consequences of time to tax. Section 8 concludes.


2     The Model
The essential elements of the model economy that serves as the basis for our study of stabi-
lization policy are taken from a recent paper by Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005).
This model and variations thereof have been estimated by a number of authors in past couple
of years. The structure of the model is the standard neoclassical growth model augmented
with a number of real and nominal frictions. The nominal frictions are sticky prices, sticky
wages, a money demand by households, and a money demand by firms. The real frictions
consist of monopolistic competition in product and factor markets, habit formation, invest-
ment adjustment costs, variable capacity utilization, and distortionary taxation.


2.1    Households
The economy is assumed to be populated by a large representative family with a continuum
of members. Consumption and hours worked are identical across family members. The
household’s preferences are defined over per capita consumption, ct , and per capita labor
effort, ht , and are described by the utility function

where Et denotes the mathematical expectations operator conditional on information avail-
able at time t, β ∈ (0, 1) represents a subjective discount factor, and U is a period utility
index assumed to be strictly increasing in its first argument, strictly decreasing in its second

the parameter b ∈ [0, 1). The consumption good is assumed to be a composite made of a
continuum of differentiated goods cit indexed by i ∈ [0, 1] via the aggregator

                                                           1−1/η
                                 ct =                cit              di                ,   (2)

where the parameter η > 1 denotes the intratemporal elasticity of substitution across differ-
ent varieties of consumption goods.
   For any given level of consumption of the composite good, purchases of each individual
variety of goods i ∈ [0, 1] in period t must solve the dual problem of minimizing total
             R1
expenditure, 0 Pit cit di, subject to the aggregation constraint (2), where Pit denotes the
nominal price of a good of variety i at time t. The demand for goods of variety i is then
given by                                    −η

                                     cit =        ct ,                                 (3)
                                            Pt
where Pt is a nominal price index defined as
                                                 Z        1                 1−η
                                                                               1


                                    Pt ≡                       Pit1−η di            .       (4)
                                                      0


This price index has the property that the minimum cost of a bundle of intermediate goods
yielding ct units of the composite good is given by Pt ct .
    Labor decisions are made by a central authority within the household, a union, which
supplies labor monopolistically to a continuum of labor markets of measure 1 indexed by
                                                                                        −η̃ d
j ∈ [0, 1]. In each labor market j, the union faces a demand for labor given by Wtj /Wt     ht .
         j
Here Wt denotes the nominal wage charged by the union in labor market j at time t, Wt is
an index of nominal wages prevailing in the economy, and hdt is a measure of aggregate labor
demand by firms. We postpone a formal derivation of this labor demand function until we
consider the firm’s problem. In each particular labor market, the union takes Wt and hdt
as exogenous. The case in which the union takes aggregate labor variables as endogenous
can be interpreted as an environment with highly centralized labor unions. Higher-level
labor organizations play an important role in some European and Latin American countries,
but are less prominent in the United States. Given the wage charged in each labor market

Our setup of imperfectly competitive labor markets departs from most existing expositions
of models with nominal wage inertia. For in these models, it is assumed that each house-
hold supplies a differentiated type of labor input. This assumption introduces equilibrium
heterogeneity across households in the number of hours worked. To avoid this heterogeneity
from spilling over into consumption heterogeneity, it is typically assumed that preferences
are separable in consumption and hours and that financial markets exist that allow agents to
fully insure against employment risk. Our formulation has the advantage that it avoids the
need to assume both separability of preferences in leisure and consumption and the existence
of such insurance markets. As we will explain later in more detail, our specification gives
rise to a wage-inflation Phillips curve with a larger coefficient on the wage-markup gap that
the model with employment heterogeneity across households.
   The household is assumed to own physical capital, kt , which accumulates according to
the following law of motion
                                                                

                             kt+1   = (1 − δ)kt + it 1 − S           ,                        (7)

where it denotes gross investment and δ is a parameter denoting the rate of depreciation of
physical capital. The function S introduces investment adjustment costs and is assumed to
satisfy S(1) = S 0 (1) = 0 and S 00 (1) > 0. These assumptions imply the absence of adjustment
costs up to first order in the vicinity of the deterministic steady state.
    Owners of physical capital can control the intensity at which this factor is utilized. For-
mally, we let ut measure capacity utilization in period t. We assume that using the stock
of capital with intensity ut entails a cost of a(ut )kt units of the composite final good. The
function a is assumed to satisfy a(1) = 0, and a0 (1), a00 (1) > 0. Both the specification of cap-
ital adjustment costs and capacity utilization costs are somewhat peculiar. More standard
formulations assume that adjustment costs depend on the level of investment rather than
on its growth rate, as is assumed here. Also, costs of capacity utilization typically take the
form of a higher rate of depreciation of physical capital. The modeling choice here is guided
by the need to fit the response of investment and capacity utilization to a monetary shock
in the US economy. For further discussion of this point, see Christiano, Eichenbaum, and

   Households rent the capital stock to firms at the real rental rate rtk per unit of capital.
Thus, total income stemming from the rental of capital is given by rtk ut kt . The investment
good is assumed to be a composite good made with the aggregator function (2). Thus,
the demand for each intermediate good i ∈ [0, 1] for investment purposes, iit , is given by
iit = it (Pit /Pt )−η .
    As in earlier related work (Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2004a) and Altig et al. (2004), we
motivate a demand for money by households by assuming that purchases of consumption are
subject to a proportional transaction cost that is increasing in consumption based money
velocity. Formally, the purchase of each unit of consumption entails a cost given by `(vt ).
Here,
                                                    ct
                                            vt ≡                                              (8)
                                                    mht
is the ratio of consumption to real money balances held by the household, which we denote
by mht . The transaction cost function ` satisfies the following assumptions: (a) `(v) is
nonnegative and twice continuously differentiable; (b) There exists a level of velocity v > 0, to
which we refer as the satiation level of money, such that `(v) = `0 (v) = 0; (c) (v − v)`0 (v) > 0
for v 6= v; and (d) 2`0 (v)+v`00 (v) > 0 for all v ≥ v. Assumption (b) ensures that the Friedman
rule, i.e., a zero nominal interest rate, need not be associated with an infinite demand for
money. It also implies that both the transaction cost and the distortion it introduces vanish
when the nominal interest rate is zero. Assumption (c) guarantees that in equilibrium money
velocity is always greater than or equal to the satiation level. As will become clear shortly,
assumption (d) ensures that the demand for money is decreasing in the nominal interest rate.
(Note that assumption (d) is weaker than the more common assumption of strict convexity
of the transaction cost function.)
    Households are assumed to have access to a complete set of nominal state-contingent
assets. Specifically, each period t ≥ 0, consumers can purchase any desired state-contingent
                     h                                               h

denotes a stochastic nominal discount factor between periods t and t + 1. Households must
pay taxes on labor income, capital income, and profits. We denote by τth , τtk , and τtφ ,
respectively, the labor income tax rate, the capital income tax rate, and the profit tax rate
in period t. A tax allowance is assumed to apply to costs due to depreciation. Households
receive real lump-sum transfers from the government in the amount nt per period. The

The variable xht /πt ≡ Xth /Pt denotes the real payoff in period t of nominal state-contingent
assets purchased in period t − 1. The variable φt denotes dividends received from the own-
ership of firms, qt denotes the price of capital in terms of consumption, and πt ≡ Pt /Pt−1
denotes the gross rate of consumer-price inflation.
    We introduce wage stickiness in the model by assuming that each period the household
(or union) cannot set the nominal wage optimally in a fraction α̃ ∈ [0, 1) of randomly chosen
labor markets. In these markets, the wage rate is indexed to the previous period’s consumer-
price inflation according to the rule Wtj = Wt−1
                                              j   χ̃
                                                 πt−1 , where χ̃ is a parameter measuring the
degree of wage indexation. When χ̃ equals 0, there is no wage indexation. When χ̃ equals
1, there is full wage indexation to past consumer price inflation. In general, χ̃ can take any
value between 0 and 1.
   The household chooses processes for ct , ht , xht+1 , wtj , kt+1 , it , ut , and mht so as to maximize
the utility function (1) subject to (6)-(9), the wage stickiness friction, and a no-Ponzi-
game constraint, taking as given the processes wt , rtk , hdt , rt,t+1 , qt , πt , φt , τth , τtk , and
τtφ and the initial conditions xh0 , k0 , and mh−1 . Of course, the household’s optimal plan
must satisfy constraints (6)-(9). In addition, letting β t λt wt (1 − τth )/µ̃t , β t q̃t λt , and β t λt
denote Lagrange multipliers associated with constraints (6), (7), and (9), respectively, the

This expression states that in labor markets in which the wage rate is reoptimized in period
t, the real wage is set so as to equate the union’s future expected average after-tax marginal
revenue to the average marginal cost of supplying labor. The union’s after-taxmarginal      

would prevail in the absence of wage stickiness. The factor k=1 πt+k       in the expression
for marginal revenue reflects the fact that as time goes by without a chance to reoptimize, the
real wage declines as the price level increases when wages are imperfectly indexed. In turn,
the marginal cost of supplying labor is given by the marginal rate of substitution between
                              −Uht+s    w   (1−τ h )
consumption and leisure, or λt+s     = t+sµ̃t+s t+s . The variable µ̃t is a wedge between the
disutility of labor and the average after-tax real wage prevailing in the economy. Thus, µ̃t
can be interpreted as the average markup that unions impose on the labor market. The
weights used to compute the average difference between marginal revenue and marginal cost
are decreasing in time and increasing in the amount of labor supplied to the market.

With these definitions at hand, the wage-setting equation becomes

                                                                    ft1 = ft2 .                                                              (19)

   The household’s optimality conditions imply a liquidity preference function featuring a
negative relation between real balances and the short-term nominal interest rate. To see this,
we first note that the absence of arbitrage opportunities in financial markets requires that
the gross risk-free nominal interest rate, which we denote by Rt , be equal to the reciprocal
of the price in period t of a nominal security that pays one unit of currency in every state
of period t + 1. Formally, Rt = 1/Et rt,t+1 . This relation together with the household’s
optimality condition (11) implies that

                                                                                  λt+1
                                                            λt = βRt Et                ,                                                     (20)
                                                                                  πt+1

which is a standard Euler equation for pricing nominally risk-free assets. Combining this
expression with equations (10) and (15), we obtain

                                                                                      1

                                                                                      Rt

The right-hand side of this expression represents the opportunity cost of holding money,
which is an increasing function of the nominal interest rate. Given the assumptions regarding
the form of the transactions cost function `, the left-hand side is increasing in money velocity.
Thus, this expression defines a liquidity preference function that is decreasing in the nominal
interest rate and unit elastic in consumption.


2.2    Firms
Each variety of final goods is produced by a single firm in a monopolistically competitive
environment. Each firm i ∈ [0, 1] produces output using as factor inputs capital services, kit ,




                                                                          12
and labor services, hit . The production technology is given by

                                          zt F (kit , hit ) − ψ,

where the function F is assumed to be homogenous of degree one, concave, and strictly in-
creasing in both arguments. The variable zt denotes an aggregate, exogenous, and stochastic
productivity shock whose law of motion is given by

                                      ln zt = ρz ln zt−1 + zt ,                              (21)

where ρz ∈ (−1, 1), and zt is an i.i.d. innovation with mean zero, standard deviation σz ,
and bounded support. The parameter ψ > 0 introduces fixed costs of operating a firm in
each period. It implies that the production function exhibits increasing returns to scale. We
model fixed costs to ensure a realistic profit-to-output ratio in steady state.
  Aggregate demand for good i, which we denote by yit , is given by

                                          yit = (Pit /Pt )−η yt ,

where
                             yt ≡ ct [1 + `(vt )] + it + gt + a(ut )kt ,                      (22)

denotes aggregate absorption. The variable gt denotes government consumption of the com-
posite good in period t.
    We rationalize a demand for money by firms by imposing that wage payments be subject
to a cash-in-advance constraint of the form:

                                             mfit ≥ νwt hit ,                                 (23)

where mfit denotes the demand for real money balances by firm i in period t and ν ≥ 0 is a
parameter indicating the fraction of the wage bill that must be backed with monetary
                                                                                assets.
                                                                                        1−η

     Firms must pay capital income taxes on nondistributed operational profits,   Pt
                                                                                              yt −
rtk kit
     − wt hit − φit − (1 − Rt−1 )mfit .
                                     Here, the variable φit denotes real dividend payments
that firm i makes to households in period t. To avoid double taxation, distributed dividends
are tax exempt at the firm level. Note that the firm incurs in financial costs in the amount
(1−Rt−1 )mfit stemming from the need to hold money to satisfy the working-capital constraint.




                                                    13
The period-by-period budget constraint of firm i can then be written as

firm purchases in period t in terms of the composite good.2 We assume that the firm must
satisfy demand at the posted price. Formally, we impose
                                                                            −η

The objective of the firm is to choose contingent plans for Pit , hit , kit , xfit+1 , and mfit so as
to maximize the present discounted value of dividend payments, given by

                                                   X
                                                   ∞

                Q
where rt,t+s ≡ sk=1 rt+k−1,t+k , for s ≥ 1, denotes the stochastic nominal discount factor
between t and t + s, and rt,t ≡ 1.3 Firms are assumed to be subject to a borrowing constraint
that prevents them from engaging in Ponzi games.
    Clearly, because rt,t+s represents both the firm’s stochastic discount factor and the market
pricing kernel for financial assets, and because the firm’s objective function is linear in asset
holdings, it follows that any asset accumulation plan of the firm satisfying the no-Ponzi
constraint is optimal. Suppose, without loss of generality, that the firm manages its portfolio
so as to ensure that its financial position at the beginning of each period is nil. Formally,
assume that xfit+1 + mfit = 0 at all dates and states. Note that this financial strategy makes
xfit+1 state-noncontingent. In this case, distributed dividends take the form
                                          1−η
                                     Pit

      Implicit in this specification of the firm’s budget constraint is the assumption that firms rent capital
services from a centralized market. This is a common assumption in the related literature (e.g., Christiano
et al., 2005; Kollmann, 2003; Carlstrom and Fuerst, 2003; and Rotemberg and Woodford, 1992). A polar
assumption is that capital is sector specific, as in Woodford (2003, chapter 5.3) and Sveen and Weinke (2003).
Both assumptions are clearly extreme. A more realistic treatment of investment dynamics would incorporate
a mix of firm-specific and homogeneous capital.
    3
      Alternatively, one could assume that firms internalize the fact that household must pay taxes on dividend
income. In this case the objective of the firm would be to maximize the present discounted value of after tax
dividend payments. This alternative, which we do not pursue, would make the asset management problem
of the firm nontrivial.


                                                            14
For this expression to hold in period zero, we impose the initial condition xfi0 + mfi−1 = 0.
The last term on the right-hand side of this expression represents the firm’s financial costs
associated with the cash-in-advance constraint on wages. This financial cost is increasing
in the opportunity cost of holding money, 1 − Rt−1 , which is an increasing function of the
short-term nominal interest rate Rt .
    Throughout our analysis, we will focus on equilibria featuring a strictly positive nominal
interest rate. This implies that the cash-in-advance constraint (23) will always bind. Then,
letting rt,t+s Pt+s mcit+s be the Lagrange multiplier associated with constraint (24), the first-
order conditions of the firm’s maximization problem with respect to capital and labor services
are, respectively,                                                    
                                                                Rt − 1
                             mcit zt Fh (kit , hit ) = wt 1 + ν                           (26)
                                                                 Rt
and
                                    mcit zt Fk (kit , hit ) = rtk .                         (27)

It is clear from these optimality conditions that the presence of a working-capital requirement
introduces a financial cost of labor that is increasing in the nominal interest rate. We note
also that because all firms face the same factor prices and because they all have access to the
same production technology with the function F being linearly homogeneous, marginal costs,
mcit , are identical across firms. Indeed, because the above first-order conditions hold for all
firms independently of whether they are allowed to reset prices optimally or not, marginal
costs are identical across all firms in the economy.
   Prices are assumed to be sticky à la Calvo (1983) and Yun (1996). Specifically, each
period t ≥ 0 a fraction α ∈ [0, 1) of randomly picked firms is not allowed to optimally set
the nominal price of the good they produce. Instead, these firms index their prices to past
                                             χ
inflation according to the rule Pit = Pit−1 πt−1 . The interpretation of the parameter χ is the
same as that of its wage counterpart χ̃. The remaining 1 − α firms choose prices optimally.
Consider the price-setting problem faced by a firm that gets to reoptimize the price in period
t. This price, which we denote by P̃t , is set so as to maximize the expected present discounted
value of profits. That is, P̃t maximizes the following Lagrangian:

According to this expression, optimizing firms set nominal prices so as to equate average
future expected marginal revenues to average future expected marginal costs. The weights
used in calculating these averages are decreasing with time and increasing in the size of the
demand for the good produce by the firm. Under flexible prices (α = 0), the above optimality
condition reduces to a static relation equating marginal costs to marginal revenues period
by period.
   It will prove useful to express this first-order condition recursively. To that end, let

This wage index has the property that the minimum cost of a bundle of intermediate labor
inputs yielding hit units of the composite labor is given by Wt hit .


2.3    The Government
Each period, the government consumes gt units of the composite good. We assume that the
variable gt is exogenous and that its logarithm follows a first-order autoregressive process of
the form
                                  ln(gt /ḡ) = ρg ln(gt−1 /ḡ) + gt ,                        (35)

where ρg ∈ (−1, 1) and ḡ > 0 are parameters, and gt is an i.i.d. innovation with mean zero,
standard deviation σg , and bounded support. The parameter ḡ represents the nonstochastic
steady-state level of government absorption. We assume that the government minimizes the
cost of producing gt . As a result, public demand for each variety i ∈ [0, 1] of differentiated
goods git is given by git = (Pit /Pt )−η gt . A second source of government expenditures are
transfer payments to households in the amount nt , measured in units of the composite good.
Like government consumption, transfers are assumed to be exogenous and to follow the law
of motion
                                 ln(nt /n̄) = ρn ln(nt−1 /n̄) + nt ,                         (36)

where ρn ∈ (−1, 1) and n̄ > 0 are parameters, and nt is an i.i.d. innovation with mean zero,
standard deviation σn , and bounded support. The parameter n̄ represents the nonstochastic
steady-state level of government transfers.
     The government levies labor, capital, and profit income taxes, allowing for tax exemptions
for the cost of depreciation. Total tax revenues are given by τt ≡ τtk [rtk ut − a(ut ) − qt δ]kt +
       R1
τth hdt 0 wtj (wtj /wt )−η̃ dj + τtφ φt . The government issues money given in real terms by mt ≡

                                                         17
      R1
mht + 0 mfit di. The fiscal authority covers deficits by issuing one-period, nominally risk-free
bonds, Bt . The period-by-period budget constraint of the consolidated government is then
given by bt − (Rt−1 /πt )bt−1 + mt − mt−1 /πt = gt + nt − τt . Letting at ≡ Rt bt + mt , we can
write the government’s budget constraint as

                             at                         at−1
                                + mt (1 − Rt−1 ) + τt =      + gt + nt .                                  (37)
                             Rt                          πt

We postpone the presentation of the monetary and fiscal policy regime.


2.4     Aggregation
We limit attention to a symmetric equilibrium in which all firms that get to change their
price optimally at a given time indeed choose the same price. It then follows from (4) that
the aggregate price index can be written as Pt1−η = α(Pt−1 πt−1
                                                            χ
                                                                )1−η + (1 − α)P̃t1−η . Dividing
this expression through by Pt1−η one obtains

                                                   χ(1−η)
                                  1 = απtη−1 πt−1                  + (1 − α)p̃1−η
                                                                              t   .                       (38)

In equilibrium, the shadow value of capital, q̃t , must equal the market value of capital, qt ,

                                                   qt = q̃t .                                             (39)

2.4.1   Market Clearing in the Final Goods Market

Naturally, the set of equilibrium conditions includes a resource constraint. Such a restriction
is typically of the type zt F (kt , ht ) − ψ = ct [1 + `(vt )] + it + gt + a(ut )kt . In the present
model, however, this restriction is not valid. This is because the model implies relative price
dispersion across varieties. This price dispersion, which is induced by the assumed nature
of price stickiness, is inefficient and entails output loss. To see this, consider the following
expression stating that supply must equal demand at the firm level:
                                                                                               −η
                                                                                          Pit
                 zt F (kit , hit ) − ψ = [ct + `(vt )ct + it + gt + a(ut )kt ]                        .
                                                                                          Pt

                                  zt F (ut kt , hdt ) − ψ = [ct + `(vt )ct + it + gt + a(ut )kt ]st                                  (40)
                                                                              η
                                                               −η          πt
                                               st = (1 − α)p̃t + α         χ      st−1 ,                                             (41)
                                                                          πt−1
with s−1 given. The state variable st summarizes the resource costs induced by the inefficient
price dispersion featured in the Calvo model in equilibrium. Three observations are in order
about the price dispersion measure st . First, st is bounded below by 1. That is, price
dispersion is always a costly distortion in this model. To see that st is bounded below by 1,
let vit ≡ (Pit /Pt )1−η . It follows from the definition of the price index given in equation (4) that
hR        iη/(η−1)                                            R 1 η/(η−1)
    1
   0
      vit          = 1.  Also,  by definition we  have s t =     v
                                                               0 it
                                                                          . Then, taking into account
                                                                   hR       iη/(η−1)  R 1 η/(η−1)
                                                                      1
that η/(η − 1) > 1, Jensen’s inequality implies that 1 = 0 vit                       ≤ 0 vit      = st .
Second, in an economy where the non-stochastic level of inflation is nil (i.e., when π = 1)
or where prices are fully indexed to any variable ωt with the property that its deterministic
steady-state value equals the deterministic steady-state value of inflation (i.e., ω = π), the
variable st follows, up to first order, the univariate autoregressive process ŝt = αŝt−1 . In these


                                                                            19
cases, the price dispersion measure st has no first-order real consequences for the stationary
distribution of any endogenous variable of the model. This means that studies that restrict
attention to linear approximations to the equilibrium conditions are justified to ignore the
variable st if the model features no price dispersion in the deterministic steady state. But st
matters up to first order when the deterministic steady state features movements in relative
prices across goods varieties. More importantly, the price dispersion variable st must be
taken into account if one is interested in higher-order approximations to the equilibrium
conditions even if relative prices are stable in the deterministic steady state. Omitting st
in higher-order expansions would amount to leaving out certain higher-order terms while
including others. Finally, when prices are fully flexible, α = 0, we have that p̃t = 1 and
thus st = 1. (Obviously, in a flexible-price equilibrium there is no price dispersion across
varieties.)
   As discussed above, equilibrium marginal costs and capital-labor ratios are identical
across firms. Therefore, one can aggregate the firm’s optimality conditions with respect to
labor and capital, equations (26) and (27), as

2.4.2   Market Clearing in the Labor Market

It follows from equation (33) that the aggregate demand for labor of type j ∈ [0, 1], which
                   R1
we denote by hjt ≡ 0 hjit di, is given by

Combining this expression with equation (44), describing the demand for labor of type
j ∈ [0, 1], and with the time constraint (6), which must hold with equality, we can write

                                                                                         Qs                   !−η̃

Let s̃t ≡ (1 − α̃)    s=0   α̃                       Wt
                                                                             . The variable s̃t measures the degree of wage
dispersion across different types of labor. The above expression can be written as

                                                                  ht = s̃t hdt .                                           (45)

The state variable s̃t evolves over time according to

                                                              −η̃                     −η̃           !η̃

                          s̃t = (1 − α̃)                              + α̃                        χ̃             s̃t−1 .   (46)

We note that because all job varieties are ex-ante identical, any wage dispersion is inef-
ficient. This is reflected in the fact that s̃t is bounded below by 1. The proof of this
statement is identical to that offered earlier for st . To see this, note that s̃t can be written
        R 1  −η̃
as s̃t = 0 W  it
             Wt
                    di. This inefficiency introduces a wedge that makes the number of hours
supplied to the market, ht , larger than the number of productive units of labor input, hdt .
In an environment without long-run wage dispersion, the dead-weight loss created by wage
dispersion is nil up to first order. Formally, a first-order approximation of the law of motion
of s̃t yields a univariate autoregressive process of the form s̃ˆt = α̃s̃ˆt−1 , as long as there is
no wage dispersion in the deterministic steady state. When wages are fully flexible, α̃ = 0,
wage dispersion disappears, and thus s̃t equals 1.
   It follows from our definition of the wage index given in equation (34) that in equilibrium
the real wage rate must satisfy
                                                                                                     !1−η̃

   Aggregating the expression for firm’s profits given in equation (25) yields

In equilibrium, tax collection and real money holdings can be expressed as

2.5       Competitive Equilibrium
A stationary competitive equilibrium is a set of stationary processes ut , ct , ht , it , kt+1 , vt ,

2.6       The Ramsey Equilibrium
We assume that at t = 0 the benevolent government has been operating for an infinite number
of periods. In choosing optimal policy, the government is assumed to honor commitments
made in the past. This form of policy commitment has been referred to as ‘optimal from
the timeless perspective’ (Woodford, 2003).
   Formally, we define a Ramsey equilibrium as a set of stationary processes ut , ct , ht , it ,
kt+1 , vt , mht , mt , at , λt , πt , wt , µ̃t , qt , q̃t , rtk , φt , ft1 , ft2 , w̃t , hdt , yt , mct , x1t , x2t , p̃t , st , s̃t , τt ,

                                                       t=0


subject to the competitive equilibrium conditions (7), (8), (10), (12)-(22), (29)-(31), (37)-
(43), and (45)-(50), and Rt ≥ 1, for t > −∞, given exogenous stochastic processes {gt , zt ,
nt }∞
     t=0 , values of the variables listed above dated t < 0, and values of the Lagrange multipliers
associated with the constraints listed above dated t < 0.
  Technically, the difference between the usual Ramsey equilibrium concept and the one
employed here is that here the structure of the optimality conditions associated with the
Ramsey equilibrium is time invariant. By contrast, under the standard Ramsey equilibrium
definition, the equilibrium conditions in the initial periods are different from those applying
to later periods.



                                                                   22
   Our results concerning the business-cycle properties of Ramsey-optimal policy are com-
parable to those obtained in the existing literature under the standard definition of Ramsey
optimality (e.g., Chari, Christiano, and Kehoe, 1995). The reason is that existing studies of
business cycles under the standard Ramsey policy focus on the behavior of the economy in
the stochastic steady state (i.e., they limit attention to the properties of equilibrium time
series excluding the initial transition).


3     Calibration and Functional Forms
We use the following standard functional forms for utility and technology:
                                h                              i1−φ3
                                 (ct − bct−1 )1−φ4 (1 − ht )φ4       −1

                                                       1 − φ3

and
                                           F (k, h) = k θ h1−θ .

Following Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) we assume an investment adjustment
cost function of the form:                                           2
                                           it          κ        it
                                  S                  =                −1 .
                                          it−1         2       it−1
As in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004a) we assume that the transaction cost technology
takes the form
                                                    p
                             `(v) = φ1 v + φ2 /v − 2 φ1 φ2 .                     (51)

The money demand function implied by this transaction technology is of the form

                                                 φ2   1 Rt − 1
                                      vt2 =         +          .
                                                 φ1 φ1 Rt

Note the existence of a satiation point for consumption-based money velocity, v, equal to
p
  φ2 /φ1 . The money demand has a unit elasticity with respect to consumption expendi-
tures. This feature is a consequence of the assumption that transaction costs, c`(c/m), are
homogenous of degree one in consumption and real balances and is independent of the par-
ticular functional form assumed for `(·). Further, as the parameter φ2 approaches zero, the
transaction cost function `(·) becomes linear in velocity and the demand for money adopts
the Baumol-Tobin square root form with respect to the opportunity cost of holding money,
(R − 1)/R. That is, the log-log elasticity of money demand with respect to the opportunity

    The costs of higher capacity utilization are parameterized as follows:

                                                                       γ2

This is the parameterization estimated in Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005).
   The equilibrium conditions listed in section 2.5 contain 32 equations (without counting
the 4 restrictions defining the monetary/fiscal regime) and 36 variables: 29 endogenous
variables (ut , ct , ht , it , kt+1 , vt , mht , mt , at , λt , πt , wt , µ̃t , qt , q̃t , rtk , φt , ft1 , ft2 , w̃t , hdt , yt ,
mct , x1t , x2t , p̃t , st , s̃t , τt ), 4 policy variables (τth , τtk , τtφ , and Rt ), and 3 exogenous shocks (zt ,
gt , and nt ). In addition, the equilibrium conditions feature 27 parameters (φ1 , φ2 , φ3 , φ4 ,
γ1 , γ2 , θ, κ, b, β, δ, η̃, α̃, η, α, χ, χ̃, ψ, ν, ρz , σz , ρg , σg , , ρn , σn , ḡ, n̄). This means that
in order to obtain values for the steady-state levels of variables and for the deep structural
parameters, we need to impose 31 restrictions.
   We take from Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) the following 5 parameter values,
which they estimate:
                                                             η=6

                                                           α = 0.6

                                                          α̃ = 0.64

                                                          b = 0.65,

and
                                                          κ = 2.48.

    We draw from the estimates reported in Altig, et al. (2004) to assign values to the
following parameter:
                                                         1 ∂ ln(mh )

We follow Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) and impose the following 6 calibration

and
                                           φ3 = 1.

The last restriction implies that the period utility function is separable in consumption and
leisure.
    We set the capital share in value added at 25 percent, the discount rate at 4 percent per
year, and the Frisch elasticity of labor supply with respect to the wage rate equal to 4 (which
implies that households allocate about 20 percent of their time to remunerated work), that
is,

                                          ≡ sk = 0.25,

and
                                          h = 0.195.

These values are commonly used in business-cycle studies. Christiano, Eichenbaum, and
Evans (2005) do not estimate these parameters. We adopt these figures because we believe
they are more in line with actual data (particularly, the values for the capital share and the
real interest rate).
    Using postwar U.S. data, we measure the average money-to-output ratio as the ratio of
M1 to GDP, and set it equal to 16.95 percent per year. Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans
(2005) do not impose this calibration restriction. Instead, they assume that all of the wage
bill is subject to a cash-in-advance constraint. Our calibration implies that only 51 percent
of wage payments must be held in money.
    We measure it as gross private investment and obtain an average ratio of investment
to GDP of 0.1275. An alternative calibration strategy would be to simply assume a value
for the depreciation rate, as in Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005). We believe our
approach makes the observable implications of the model more in line with the data. We
measure nt as net transfer to private persons and obtain an average ratio of transfers to
GDP of 0.078. Government spending is measured as public consumption expenditure. We

                                              25
estimate its mean share in GDP to be 0.17. Finally, we measure inflation as the growth rate
of the GDP deflator, and obtain an average annual rate of 4.2 percent. Thus,

and
                                         π = 1.0421/4 .

    In calibrating the model, we assume that the economy is in the deterministic steady state
of a competitive equilibrium in which the capital and labor income tax rates are constant.
We follow Mendoza, Razin, and Tesar (1994) in setting values for the income tax rates:

                                          τ k = 0.407

and
                                          τ h = 0.285.

These tax rates correspond to the year 1988, which is the last year in their sample. Because
tax rates appear to have a trend, we use the last observation rather than an average over
their sample.
   Note that because profits are restricted to be nil in the competitive equilibrium at which
we calibrate the economy, the rate at which profits are taxed plays no role for the calibration.
   We do not draw from the work of Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) to calibrate
the degree of indexation in product prices and wages. The reason is that in their study
the parameters governing the degree of indexation are not estimated. They simply assume
full indexation of all prices to past product price inflation. Instead, we draw from the
econometric work of Cogley and Sbordone (2004) and Levin et al. (2005) who find no evidence
of indexation in product prices. We therefore set

                                            χ = 0.

At the same time, Levin et al. estimate a high degree of indexation in nominal wages. We


                                              26
therefore assume that
                                            χ̃ = 1.

   We estimate by OLS the processes for government purchases and transfers using data
from 1947:I to 2004:III. In the case of transfers we eliminated the years 1947-1950 because
they contain two outliers in which the government paid unusually high veteran benefits. To
obtain the cyclical behavior of all variables involved in the estimation we use the HP filter
with a parameter of 1600. We obtain

                                          ρg = 0.87,

                                         σg = 0.016,

                                          ρn = 0.78,

and
                                         σn = 0.022.

    Given the multitude of distortions in our model, a simple Solow residual is a poor measure
of the technology shock in our model. Thus, instead of relying on existing estimates for the
stochastic process of Solow residuals, we calibrate the productivity shock process as follows.
We require that the process is such, that is, ρz and σz are such that the model matches the
observed unconditional standard deviation and serial correlation of the cyclical component
of output and inflation during the postwar era. This exercise requires making assumptions
about fiscal and monetary policy. We assume that income tax rates are constant at the levels
given above (i.e, τ k = 0.407 and τ h = 0.285), and that fiscal policy is passive. Specifically,
we assume that lump-sum taxes ensure the stationarity of government assets for any on-
or off-equilibrium path of the price level. We assume that monetary policy takes the form
of a simple Taylor-type rule whereby the current nominal interest rate is set as a function
of contemporaneous inflation and output. We then pick the 4 parameters describing the
technology process and the monetary policy rule so that the model matches the volatility
and serial correlation of output and inflation observed in the postwar U.S. economy. The
resulting parameter values for the technology shock process are ρz = 0.8556 and σz = 0.0064.
    In computing Ramsey equilibria, we assume that the economy has been operating under
the Ramsey policy for a long time and that the average ratio of government debt to GDP is
42 percent per year. That is, we impose that

                                    (a − m)/R
                                              = 0.42 × 4.

in the United States between 1984 and 2003.4
    Table 1 gathers the values of the deep structural parameters of the model implied by our
calibration strategy.


4         Ramsey Steady States
Consider the long-run state of the Ramsey equilibrium in an economy without uncertainty.
We refer to this state as the Ramsey steady state. Note that the Ramsey steady state is in
general different from the allocation/policy that maximizes welfare in the steady state of a
competitive equilibrium.
   Table 2 displays the Ramsey steady-state values of inflation, the nominal interest rate,
and labor and capital income tax rates under a number of environments of interests. The
figures reported in the table correspond to the exact numerical solution to the steady-state
of the Ramsey problem.


4.1         The Optimal Level of Inflation
Consider first the case in which profits are taxed at the same rate as income from capital
(τtφ = τtk for all t). In this case, the Ramsey planner chooses to conduct monetary policy
in such a way as to nearly stabilize the price level. The optimal inflation rate is 18 basis
points per year (line 1 of table 2). It is worth noting that, although small, the steady-state
inflation rate is positive. This finding is somewhat surprising, for a well-known result in
the context of simpler versions of the new Keynesian model is that the Ramsey steady-state
level of inflation is negative and lies between the one called for by the Friedman rule and the
one corresponding to full price stabilization. In calibrated example economies, the optimal
deflation rate is, however, small (see, for instance, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2004a; and
Khan, et al., 2003). In these simpler models the optimal inflation rate is determined by the
tradeoff between minimizing the opportunity cost of holding money (which requires setting
the inflation rate equal to minus the real interest rate) and minimizing price dispersion
arising from nominal rigidities (which requires setting inflation at zero). Clearly, our finding
of a positive inflation rate suggests that in the medium-scale economy we study in this paper
there must be an additional tradeoff that the Ramsey planner faces in setting the rate of
inflation. To make the presence of the third tradeoff nitid, we consider the case of indexation
of product prices to lagged inflation, χ = 1 (line 2 of table 2). In this case, the long-run

       baseline values, given in table 1.


distortions stemming from nominal rigidities are nil. (Recall that in our calibration nominal
wages are fully indexed, i.e., χ̃ = 1.) Therefore, in this case there is no tradeoff between
the sticky-price and money-demand frictions. In the absence of any additional tradeoffs, one
should expect the Friedman rule to be optimal in this case. However, line 2 of table 2 shows
that under long-run price flexibility, the optimal rate of inflation is 4.6 percent per year, a
value even further removed from the Friedman rule than the one that is optimal under no
indexation in product markets (line 1 of table 2).
   The third tradeoff turns out to originate in the presence of government transfer payments
to households, nt . Line 3 of table 2 shows that under full indexation and in the absence of
government transfers, the Friedman rule emerges as the optimal monetary policy. That is,
the nominal interest rate is zero and the inflation rate is negative and equal to the rate of
discount in absolute value. The reason why lump-sum government transfers induce positive
inflation is that from the viewpoint of the Ramsey planner they represent pure rents accruing
to households and as such can be taxed without creating a distortion. In the absence of a
specific instrument to tax transfer income, the government chooses to tax this source of
income indirectly when it is used for consumption. Specifically, in the model consumption
purchases require money. As a result, a positive opportunity cost of holding money—i.e., a
positive nominal interest rate—acts as a tax on consumption.5
   Clearly, in the present model, if lump-sum transfers could be set optimally, they would
   5
    A formal analytical derivation of the result that the Friedman rule fails in the presence of government
transfers is given in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2005).

be set at a negative value in a magnitude sufficient to finance government expenditures
and output subsidies aimed at eliminating monopolistic distortions in product and factor
markets. But in reality government transfers are positive and large. In the United States,
they averaged 7 percent of GDP in the postwar era. Justifying this amount of government
transfers as an optimal outcome lies beyond the scope of this paper. One obvious theoretical
element that would introduce a rationale for positive government transfers would be the
introduction of some form of heterogeneity across households.
    Whether set optimally or not, government transfers must be financed. Comparing lines
1 and 4 of table 2 it follows that the government must increase the labor income tax rate by
12 percentage points to finance transfer payments of 7 percent of GDP. Thus, the economy
featuring transfers is significantly more distorted than the one without transfers. Because, in
general, optimal stabilization policy will depend on the average level of distortion present in
the economy, it is of importance for the purpose of this paper to explicitly include transfers
into the model. It is noteworthy that under the calibration shown in table 1 (particularly,
under no indexation), allowing for transfers has virtually no effect on the steady-state Ramsey
policy except for the level of the labor income tax rate. Specifically, comparing lines 1 and
4 of table 2 shows that removing transfers has virtually no bearing on the optimal rate of
inflation and capital income taxation in the steady state.
    We conclude that the tripodal tradeoff that determines the Ramsey long-run rate of
inflation is resolved in favor of price stability. In this sense, the nominal price friction
appears to dominate the money demand friction and the transfer-taxation motive in shaping
optimal monetary policy in the long run.


4.2    Optimal Tax Rates
Consider first the economy where profit income are taxed at 100 percent (τtφ = 1). In this
case, shown in line 5 of table 2, the Ramsey plan calls for subsidizing capital at the rate of
44.3 percent in the deterministic steady state. It is well known from the work of Judd (2002)
that in the presence of imperfect competition in product markets, the markup of prices over
marginal costs introduces a distortion between the private and the social returns to capital
that increases exponentially over the investment horizon. As a result, optimal policy calls
for eliminating this distortion by setting negative capital income tax rates. To gain insight
into the nature of the capital income subsidy, note that in steady state the private return
to investment is given by (1 − τ k )(uFk /µ − δ − a(u)), where µ denotes the steady-state
markup, uFk denotes the marginal product of capital, δ denotes the depreciation rate, and
a(u) denotes the cost of utilizing capital at the rate u. The social return to capital is given


                                              31
by uFk − δ − a(u). Equating the private and social returns to investment requires setting τ k
so that
                      (1 − τ k )(uFk /µ − δ − a(u)) = uFk − δ − a(u).

Because in the presence of market power in product markets, the markup is greater than
unity (µ > 1), it follows that τ k must be negative. Using the fact that in the steady state
1 = β[(1 − τ k )(uFk /µ − δ − a(u)) + 1], we can write the above expression as:
                                                                 
                                    k          (β −1 − 1)
                              1 − τ = µ −1                          .                                       (52)
                                        β − 1 − (µ − 1)(δ + a(u))

It is clear from this expression that if the depreciation rate is zero (δ=0), and capacity
utilization is fixed at unity (so that a(u) = 0), then the optimal capital income tax rate
is equal to the net markup in absolute value. The case of zero depreciation and constant
capacity utilization is the one considered in Judd (2002). We find that the introduction
of depreciation in combination with a depreciation allowance, which is clearly the case of
greatest empirical interest, magnifies significantly the size of the optimal capital subsidy. For
instance, in our economy the markup is 20 percent, the depreciation rate is 7 percent per
year, and the discount factor is 4 percent per year. In the case of no depreciation and fixed
capacity utilization, the formula in equation (52) implies a capital subsidy of 20 percent.
However, with a conservative depreciation rate of 7 percent per year and fixed capacity
utilization—which we induce by increasing γ2 by a factor of 105 —the optimal subsidy on
capital income skyrockets to 85 percent (see line 6 of table 2). The reason for this tremendous
rise in the size of the subsidy is that the government taxes the rate of return on capital net of
depreciation, whereas the markup distorts the rate of return on capital gross of depreciation.
   Allowing for variable capacity utilization (by setting γ2 at its baseline value of 0.0685),
reduces the capital subsidy from 85 percent (line 6 of table 2) to 44 percent (line 5 of table 2).
The reason why the subsidy is smaller in this case is that a(u) is negative, which results in
a lower effective depreciation rate.6
    An additional factor determining the size of the optimal subsidy on capital is the fiscal
treatment of profits. The formula given in equation (52) applies when profits are taxed at a
100 percent rate. Consider instead the case in which profit income is taxed at the same rate
as capital income (τtφ = τtk ), which is assumed in lines 1-4 of table 2. Because profits are
   6
    To see why the level of capacity utilization ut is less than one (which is necessary for (a(ut )) to be
negative) in the Ramsey equilibrium, recall that in the competitive equilibrium used for the calibration of
the function a(·), the tax rate on capital was set at 40.7 percent and ut was set at unity. In the Ramsey
equilibrium, τ k is negative, which induces a larger level of capital. With a higher capital stock, its rate of
return at full utilization falls, which induces capitalists to lower it degree of utilization. In the steady state
shown in line 5 of table2, u equals 0.85.


                                                       32
pure rents, the Ramsey planner has an incentive to confiscate them. This creates a tension
between setting τ k equal to 100 percent, so as to fully tax profits, and setting τ k at the
negative value that equates the social and private returns to investment. This explains why
when the Ramsey planner is constrained to tax profits and capital income at the same rate,
the optimal subsidy to capital is 6.3 percent, a number much smaller than the 85 percent
implied by equation (52).
   Line 7 of table 2 displays the case in which the Ramsey planner is constrained to follow
an income tax policy. That is, fiscal policy stipulates τth = τtk = τtφ . Not surprisingly, the
optimal income tax rate falls in between the values of the labor and capital income tax rates
that are optimal when the fiscal authority is allowed to set these tax rates separately (line
5 of table 2). The optimal rate of inflation under an income tax is small, half a percent
per annum, and not significantly different from the one that emerges when taxes can vary
across income sources. The reason why the inflation rate is higher than in the baseline case
is that in this way the Ramsey planner can tax labor at a higher rate than capital, a point
we discuss in detail later.


5    Ramsey Dynamics Under Income Taxation
In this section, we study the business-cycle implications of Ramsey-optimal policy when tax
rates are restricted to be identical across all sources of income. Specifically, we study the
case in which,
                                     τth = τtk = τtφ ≡ τty ,

for all t, where τty denotes the income tax rate.
    We approximate the Ramsey equilibrium dynamics by solving a first-order approximation
to the Ramsey equilibrium conditions. There is evidence that first-order approximations to
the Ramsey equilibrium conditions deliver dynamics that are fairly close to those associated
with the exact solution. For instance, in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004b) we compute the
exact solution to the Ramsey equilibrium in a flexible-price dynamic economy with money,
income taxes, and monopolistic competition in product markets. In Schmitt-Grohé and
Uribe (2004a) we then compute the solution to the exact same economy using a first-order
approximation to the Ramsey equilibrium conditions. We find that the exact solution is not
significantly different from the one based on a first-order approximation.
    It has also been shown in the context of environments with fewer distortions than the
medium-scale macroeconomic model studied here that a first-order approximation to the
Ramsey equilibrium conditions implies dynamics that are very close to the dynamics asso-

ciated with a second-order approximation to the Ramsey system. Specifically, in Schmitt-
Grohé and Uribe (2004a) we establish this result using a dynamic general equilibrium model
with money, income taxes, sticky prices in product markets, and imperfect competition.7
   Table 3 displays the standard deviation, serial correlation, and correlation with output
of a number of macroeconomic variables of interest in the Ramsey equilibrium with income
taxation. In computing these second moments, all structural parameters of the model take
the values shown in table 1. Second moments are calculated using Monte Carlo simulations.
We perform 1000 simulations of 200 quarters each. For each simulation, we compute second
moments and then average these figures over the 1000 simulations.
    An important result that emerges from table 3 is that under the optimal policy regime
inflation is remarkably stable over the business cycle. This result is akin to the one derived
in the context of models with a single distortion, namely sticky product prices and no
fiscal considerations (Goodfriend and King, 1997 among many others). In the canonical
Neo Keynesian model studied in Goodfriend and King, the optimality of price stability is
a straightforward result. For in that environment, the single cause of inefficiencies is price
dispersion due to exogenous impediments to the adjustment of nominal prices. By contrast,
  7
    More recently, Benigno and Woodford (2005) arrive at a similar conclusion in the context of optimal
taxation in the standard RBC model. They show that the first- and second-order approximations of the
Ramsey equilibrium conditions are similar to the approximation based on a minimum-weighted-residual
method reported in Chari et al. (1995).



                                                  34
the medium-scale model studied here features, in addition to price stickiness, distortions
that in isolation would call for a highly volatile inflation rate under the Ramsey plan.
   First, the fact that the government does not have access to lump-sum taxation provides
an incentive for the Ramsey planner to use unexpected variations in the inflation rate as a
capital levy on private holdings of nominal assets to finance innovations in the fiscal deficit. In
effect, Chari et al. (1995) show in the context of a flexible-price model that the optimal rate
of inflation volatility is extremely high (above 10 percent per year). So in setting the optimal
level of inflation volatility, the Ramsey planner faces a tradeoff between using inflation as
a capital levy and minimizing the dispersion of nominal prices. For plausible calibrations,
this tradeoff has been shown to be resolved overwhelmingly in favor of price stability. For
example, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004a) show within a sticky-price model with distorting
taxes that a miniscule amount of price stickiness suffices to induce the Ramsey planner
to abandon the use of inflation as a fiscal instrument in favor of virtually complete price
stability. Table 3 shows that this result survives in the much richer environment studied
here, featuring a relatively large number of nominal and real rigidities.
   Second, the fact that our model features sticky wages introduces an incentive for the
Ramsey planner to adjust prices so as to bring about efficient real wage movements. As will
be shown shortly, nominal wage stickiness in isolation calls for the Ramsey inflation rate to
be highly volatile.
   With the inflation rate not playing the role of absorber of fiscal shocks, the Ramsey
planner must finance fiscal disturbances via deficits or changes in tax rates or both. Table 3
shows that in our model the role of shock absorber is picked up to a large extent by fiscal
deficits (i.e., by adjustments in the level of public debt). Total government liabilities, at ,
are relatively volatile and display a near-unit-root behavior. The standard deviation of
government liabilities is 4.4 percent per quarter and the serial correlation is 0.99 in our
simulated sample paths. By contrast tax rates do not vary much over the business cycle.
The Ramsey planner is able to implement tax smoothing by allowing public liabilities to
vary in response to fiscal shocks.


5.1    Nominal Rigidities and Optimal Policy
Table 4 presents the effects of changing the degree of wage or price stickiness on the behavior
of policy variables. Panel A considers the case of no transfers (nt = 0 for all t). This case is
of interest because it removes the government’s incentive to tax transfers through long-run
inflation, making the economy more comparable to existing related studies. When product
and factor prices are fully flexible (α = α̃ = 0), the optimal policy features high inflation

volatility (5.8 percentage points per quarter at an annual rate) and relatively stable tax
rates, with a standard deviation of 0.1 percent. In this case, as discussed earlier, variations
in inflation are used as a state-contingent tax on nominal government liabilities, allowing the
Ramsey planner to smooth taxes. Public debt is stationary with a serial correlation of 0.84.
  When prices are sticky but wages are flexible (α = 0.6 and α̃ = 0), the optimal inflation
volatility falls dramatically from 5.8 percent to less than 0.1 percent. Because prices are
costly to adjust, the Ramsey planner relinquishes the use of surprise inflation as a fiscal
shock absorber. Instead, he uses variations in fiscal deficits and some small adjustments in
the income tax rate to guarantee fiscal solvency. This practice results in a drastic increase
in the serial correlation in government assets, which become a (near) random-walk process.
These effects of price stickiness on optimal monetary and fiscal policy are known to emerge in
the context of models without capital and fewer nominal and real frictions (see, for instance,
Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2004a).
    In the benchmark case, where both prices and wages are sticky (α = 0.6 and α̃ = 0.64),
inflation is more volatile than under product price stickiness alone. As stressed by Erceg et
al. (2000) in the context of a much simpler model without a fiscal sector or capital, the reason
for the increased volatility of inflation in the case of both price and wage stickiness relative to
the case of price stickiness alone, is that the central bank faces a tradeoff between minimizing
relative product price dispersion and minimizing relative wage dispersion. Quantitatively,
however, this tradeoff appears to be resolved in favor of minimizing product price dispersion
rather than wage dispersion. In effect, under price stickiness alone, the volatility of inflation
is 0.09 percent, whereas under wage stickiness alone it is 5.8 percent.8 When both nominal
rigidities are present, the optimal inflation volatility falls in between these two values, but,
at 1.1 percent, is much closer to the lower one. Interestingly, this result obtains even if
one assumes that nominal wages are not indexed to past inflation (χ̃ = 0). In this case, the
optimal inflation volatility is 0.9 percent, which is even lower than under full wage indexation
(see table 5 and the discussion around it). We note that indexation to past consumer price
inflation, being an arbitrary scheme, may not necessarily be welfare improving in our model.
   8
     The result that inflation volatility rises significantly when product prices are allowed to be flexible but
wages are sticky is sensitive to the battery of shocks driving business cycles. Chugh (2005) shows that when
the sole source of uncertainty is innovations in government spending, then the Ramsey outcome implies
low inflation volatility when prices are flexible but wages are sticky. Indeed, in our model, when prices are
flexible but wages are sticky, the volatility of inflation is 5.8 percent in the environment with productivity
and government spending shocks but only 0.3 percent in an environment with only government purchases
shocks. The intuition for why adding productivity shocks increases the optimal volatility of inflation when
prices are flexible and wages are sticky, stems from the fact that in response to productivity shocks, the real
wage tends to move more than in response to government spending shocks and that the role of inflation is
to bring real wages closer to their efficient level. It follows that the high volatility of inflation in the case of
sticky wages and flexible prices is not fiscal in nature.



                                                        37
   Panel B of table 4 considers the baseline case of positive transfers. All of the results
obtained under the assumption of no transfers carry over to the economy with transfers.9 In
particular, it continues to be the case that inflation stability is the dominant characteristic
of Ramsey-optimal policy. It is of interest that the optimality of inflation stability obtains in
spite of the fact that nominal wages are set optimally less frequently than are product prices.
As will be clear shortly, the fact that wages are assumed to be fully indexed to past inflation
is not the crucial factor behind this result. Panel B of table 4 presents a further robustness
check of our main result. It displays the case in which wages are reoptimized every 8 quarters
(α̃ = 0.87) instead of every 3 quarters (α̃ = 0.64), as in the baseline calibration. In this case
the optimal inflation volatility is 1.8 percent. This number is higher than the corresponding
number under the baseline calibration (1.1 percent), but still relatively small.10
    The reason why we pick a value of 0.87 for the parameter α̃ in our robustness test is that
this number makes our model of wage rigidities comparable with the formulation in which
wage stickiness results in employment heterogeneity across households introduced by Erceg
et al. (2000). In effect, it can shown that up to first-order both specifications give rise to a
Phillips curve relating current wage inflation to future expected wage inflation and the wage
markup. The difference between the two specifications is that the coefficient on the wage
markup is smaller in the Erceg et al. model. A value of α̃ equal to 0.87 ensures that the
coefficient on the wage markup in our model is equal to that implied by the Erceg et al.
model.11
   We close this section with a digression. One may wonder why in the case of fully flexible
product and factor prices and no transfers (α = α̃ = nt = 0), the Friedman rule fails to
be Ramsey optimal. The reason is that under an income-tax regime a positive nominal
interest rate allows the Ramsey planner to effectively tax labor at a higher rate than capital.
The planner engineers this differential effective tax rate by exploiting the fact that firms are
subject to a cash-in-advance constraint on the wage bill. The reason why it is optimal for the
planner to tax labor at a higher rate than capital is clear from our analysis of the Ramsey
   9
      One exception is the fact that the mean rate of inflation increases dramatically when product prices are
flexible. As discussed earlier in section 4.1, the reason why the Ramsey planner chooses to inflate when all
prices are flexible, is that inflation is an indirect tax on transfer payments.
   10
      Under this higher level of wage stickiness and price flexibility (i.e., α̃ = 0.87 and α = 0), the optimal
inflation volatility is 7.8 percent. On the other hand, under sticky prices and flexible wages (i.e., α̃ = 0 and
α = 0.6), the optimal inflation volatility is 0.2 percent. Hence, when price stickiness takes its baseline value
but wage stickiness is higher than in the baseline case (i.e., α̃ = 0.87 and α = 0.6), the inflation volatility is
closer to the figure associated with product-price rigidity alone.

      Formally, the wage-inflation Phillips curve can be written up to first order as π̂tW = βEt π̂t+1W
                                                                                                          − κµ̃ˆt ,

where πt ≡ Wt /Wt−1 denotes wage inflation and µ̃t denotes the wage markup. The difference between our
approach to modeling the labor market and the one adopted in Erceg et al. (2000) is the size of the parameter
κ. Under our specification, we have that κ = κSGU ≡ (1 − α̃)(1 − α̃β)/α̃. The Erceg et al. specification
implies that κ = κSGU /(1 + EHL), where EHL is a positive constant.

steady state in the case in which labor and capital income can be taxed at different rates
(section 4). In this case, the Ramsey planner selects to subsidize capital and to tax labor.
Under the income-tax regime studied here, the planner is unable to set different tax rates
across sources of income. But he does so indirectly by levying an inflation tax on labor.
   In the flexible-price economy, the inflation bias introduced by the combination of an
income tax and a cash-in-advance constraint on wages is large, above 4 percent per year. If
in an economy without nominal rigidities and without government transfers one were to lift
the cash-in-advance constraint on wage payment by setting the parameter ν equal to zero, the
Friedman rule would reemerge as the Ramsey outcome. But the inflation bias introduced by
government transfers and the working capital constraint is small in an economy with sticky
prices. In effect, under our assumed degree of price stickiness (α = 0.6), the steady-state level
of inflation falls from 0.51 percent per annum in the economy with transfers and a working-
capital constraint on wage payments to -0.19 percent in an economy without transfers and
without a working-capital constraint. We conclude that in our model, the dominant force
determining the long-run level of inflation is not the presence of government transfers, nor
the demand for money by firms, nor the demand for money by households, but rather the
existence of long-run frictions in the adjustment of nominal product prices.


5.2    Indexation and Optimal Policy
An important policy implication of our analysis of optimal fiscal and monetary policy in a
medium-scale model under income taxation is the desirability of price stability. Because our
benchmark calibration assumes full indexation in factor prices but no indexation in product
prices, one may worry that our central policy result may be driven too much by the assumed
indexation scheme. But this turns out not to be the case.
    Consider a symmetric indexation specification in which neither factor nor good prices are
indexed (χ = χ̃ = 0). This case is shown in line 1 of table 5. In the non-indexed economy
the Ramsey plan calls for even more emphasis on price stability than in the environment
with factor price indexation. The mean and standard deviation of inflation both fall from
0.51 and 1.1, respectively, in the economy with wage indexation to 0.11 and 0.94 in the
economy without any type of indexation. The reason why the average inflation rate is lower
in the absence of indexation is that removing wage indexation creates an additional source
of long-run inefficiency stemming from inflation, namely, wage dispersion. The reason why
inflation volatility also falls when one removes wage indexation is less clear. We simply note,
as we did before, that the indexation scheme assumed here, namely indexing to past price
inflation, being arbitrary, may or may not be welfare improving in the short run.

      Note: See note to table 3.


   Consider now the case that prices are fully indexed but wages are not (χ = 1 and
χ̃ = 0). If our main result, namely the optimality of inflation stabilization, was driven by
our indexation assumption, then the indexation scheme considered now would stack the deck
against short-run price stability. Line 2 of table 5 shows that even when prices are indexed
and wages are not, the Ramsey plan calls for the same low level of inflation volatility as under
the reverse indexation scheme considered in the benchmark economy (line 3 of table 5). The
reason is that if the planner were to move prices around over the business cycle so as to
minimize the distortions introduced by nominal wage stickiness, then such price movements
still would lead to important inefficiencies in the product market because prices although
indexed are still sticky. Indexation removes the distortions associated with nominal rigidities
only in the long run, not necessarily in the short run.
   The fact that indexation removes the long-run inefficiencies associated with nominal
product and factor price dispersion due to price stickiness is illustrated in line 4 of table 5,
displaying the case of indexation in both product and factor markets. The Ramsey-optimal
mean inflation rate is in this case 17 percent per year. This large number is driven by two
fiscal policy factors identified earlier in this paper: high inflation allows the Ramsey planner
to tax transfers indirectly and at the same time provides an opportunity to tax labor income
at a higher rate than capital income.

6      Optimized Policy Rules
Ramsey outcomes are mute on the issue of what policy regimes can implement them. The
information on policy one can extract from the solution to the Ramsey problem is limited to
the equilibrium behavior of policy variables such as tax rates and the nominal interest rate.
But this information is in general of little use for central banks or fiscal authorities seeking
to implement the Ramsey equilibrium. Specifically, the equilibrium process of policy vari-
ables in the Ramsey equilibrium is a function of all of the states of the Ramsey equilibrium.
These state variables include all of the exogenous driving forces and all of the endogenous
predetermined variables. Among this second set of variables are past values of the Lagrange
multipliers associated with the constraints of the Ramsey problem. Even if the policymaker
could observe the state of all of these variables, using the equilibrium process of the policy
variables to define a policy regime would not guarantee the Ramsey outcome as the com-
petitive equilibrium. The problem is that such a policy regime could give rise to multiple
equilibria.
  In this section, we do not attempt to resolve the issue of what policy implements the
Ramsey equilibrium in the medium-scale model under study. Rather, we focus on finding
parameterizations of monetary and fiscal rules that satisfy the following 3 conditions: (a)
They are simple, in the sense that they involve only a few observable macroeconomic vari-
ables; (b) They guarantee local uniqueness of the rational expectations equilibrium; and (c)
They minimize some distance (to be specified shortly) between the competitive equilibrium
they induce and the Ramsey equilibrium. We refer to rules that satisfy criteria (a) and (b)
as implementable. We refer to implementable rules that satisfy criterion (c) as optimized
rules.12
    We define the distance between the competitive equilibrium induced by an implementable
                                                  R
rule and the Ramsey equilibrium as follows. Let IRT,S,Y denote the impulse response function
associated with the Ramsey equilibrium of length T quarters, for shocks in the set S, and
                                          CE
variables in the set Y . Similarly, let IRT,S,Y denote the impulse responses associated with
                                                                                      R
the competitive equilibrium induced by a particular policy rule. Let x ≡ vec(IRT,S,Y      −
   CE
IRT,S,Y ). Then, we define the distance between the Ramsey equilibrium and the competitive
equilibrium associated with a particular implementable rule as x0 x.
   An alternative definition of the distance between the competitive equilibrium induced
by an implementable rule and the Ramsey equilibrium is given by the difference in the
  12
    A further criterion one could impose is that the nominal interest rate not violate the zero bound. In
Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004c), we approximate this constraint by requiring that in the competitive
equilibrium the standard deviation be less than a fraction of the steady-state value of the nominal interest
rate.



                                                    41
associated welfare levels. This definition of an optimized rule is equivalent to selecting
policy-rule coefficients within the set of implementable rules so as to maximize the level of
welfare associated with the resulting competitive equilibrium. We adopt this definition in
Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004c,e). In general, a policy rule that is optimal under this
definition will not coincide with the one that is optimal according to criteria (a), (b), and
(c). It is clear, however, from the quantitative welfare analysis reported later in this section
that the gains from following such a strategy in lieu of the one adopted here are small.
    In the present analysis, we take as reference the Ramsey equilibrium under the restric-
tion of an income tax. We compute impulse response functions from a first-order accurate
approximation to the Ramsey and competitive equilibria. We set the length of the impulse
response function at 20 quarters (T = 20). The set of shocks is given by the three shocks that
drive business cycles in the model presented above, productivity, government consumption,
and government transfers shocks. That is, S = {zt , gt , nt }. Finally, we include in the set Y
17 endogenous variables. Namely, we let Y = {ct , hdt , πt , Rt , yt , it , wt , τty , qt , λt , ft2 , x2t , ut , s̃t ,
st , at , kt }. Up to first order, all variables listed in the definition of a competitive equilibrium
given in section 2.5 can be obtained as a linear combination of the elements of the sets Y and
S. Of course, adding variables to the set Y would not be in general inconsequential, for it
would amount to altering the weights assigned to each impulse response in the criterion that
is minimized. However, as will be clear from the discussion that follows, expanding the set
Y or altering the weights given to each individual variable would result at best in negligible
welfare gains.
    The family of rules that we consider here consists of an interest-rule and a tax-rate rule.
In the interest-rate rule, the nominal interest rate depends linearly on its own lag, the rates
of price and wage inflation, and the log deviation of output from its steady state value. The
tax-rate rule features the tax rate depending linearly on its own lag and log deviations of
government liabilities and output from their respective steady-state values. Formally, the
interest-rate and tax-rate rules are given by

           ln(Rt /R∗ ) = απ ln(πt /π ∗ ) + αW ln(πtW /π ∗ ) + αy ln(yt /y ∗ ) + αR ln(Rt−1 /R∗ )

and
                     τty − τ y∗ = βa ln(at−1 /a∗ ) + βy ln(yt /y ∗ ) + βτ ln(τt−1
                                                                              y
                                                                                  − τ y∗ ).

The target values R∗ , π ∗ , y ∗ , τ y∗ , and a∗ are assumed to be the Ramsey steady-state values
of their associated endogenous variables, given in the second column of table 3. The variable
πtW ≡ Wt /Wt−1 denotes wage inflation. It follows that in our search for the optimized policy
rule, we pick 7 parameters so as to minimize the Euclidean norm of the vector x containing


                                                          42
1020 elements. We set the initial impulse equal to 1 standard deviation of the innovation in
the corresponding shock. That is, for impulse   r responses q associated with shocks zt , gt , and
                                    q 2             2

   The optimized rule is given by

      ln(Rt /R∗ ) = 0.37 ln(πt /π ∗ ) − 0.16 ln(πtW /π ∗ ) − 0.06 ln(yt /y ∗ ) + 0.55 ln(Rt−1 /R∗ )   (53)

and
                τty − τ y∗ = −0.06 ln(at−1 /a∗ ) + 0.02 ln(yt /y ∗ ) + 1.88 ln(τt−1
                                                                                y
                                                                                    − τ y∗ ).         (54)

The optimized interest-rate rule turns out to be passive, with the sum of the product-
price and wage inflation coefficients less than unity. Under this rule, variation in aggregate
activity do not trigger a monetary policy response, as can be seen from the fact that the
output coefficient is close to zero. The optimized monetary rule exhibits interest rate inertia
implying long-run reactions to deviations of inflation from target twice the size of the short-
run response.
   The optimized tax-rate rule calls for a mute response to variations in output or govern-
ment liabilities. In addition, it is superinertial with a coefficient on lagged tax rates of about
2. In equilibrium, this rule induces tax rates that are virtually constant over the business
cycle.


6.1      Welfare Under the Optimized Rule
We measure the level of utility associated with a particular monetary/fiscal policy specifica-
tion as follows. Let the equilibrium processes for consumption and hours associated with a
particular policy regime be denoted by {ct , ht }. Then we measure welfare as the conditional
expectation of lifetime utility as of time zero evaluated at {ct , ht }. We denote this welfare
measure by V0 . Formally, V0 is given by

                                              X
                                              ∞
                                    V0 ≡ E0          β t U (ct − bct−1 , ht ).                        (55)
                                               t=0


In addition, we assume that at time zero all state variables of the economy, including c−1 ,
equal their respective Ramsey-steady-state values.
    We compute the welfare cost of a particular monetary/fiscal regime relative to the
Ramsey-optimal regime as follows. Consider two policy regimes, the Ramsey-optimal policy
regime denoted by r and an alternative policy regime denoted by a. Then we define the



                                                       43
welfare level associated with the Ramsey policy regime as

                                              X
                                              ∞
                                 V0r   = E0         β t U (crt − bcrt−1 , hrt ),
                                              t=0


where crt and hrt denote the contingent plans for consumption and hours under the Ramsey
policy regime. Similarly, define the welfare level associated with policy regime a as

                                              X
                                              ∞
                                 V0a   = E0         β t U (cat − bcat−1 , hat ).
                                              t=0


Let λ denote the welfare cost of adopting policy regime a instead of the Ramsey policy regime
r. We measure λ as the fraction of the Ramsey consumption process that a household would
be willing to give up to be as well off under regime a as under the Ramsey regime. That is,
λ is implicitly defined by

                                                            X
                                                            ∞
             V0a = U (cr0 (1 − λ) − bcr−1 , hr0 ) + E0            β t U ((crt − bcrt−1 )(1 − λ), hrt ).   (56)
                                                            t=1


Note that we do not apply the factor (1 − λ) to cr−1 , because this variable is predetermined
at the time of the policy evaluation. Using the particular functional form assumed for the
period utility function and taking into account that we calibrate φ3 to unity (so that U is
log-linear in habit-adjusted consumption), equation (56) can be written as

              V0a − V0r                              β
                        = ln[(1 − λ)cr0 − bcr−1 ] +     ln(1 − λ) − ln(cr0 − bcr−1 ).
               1 − φ4                               1−β

Resorting to the notation introduced in the appendix, let V0a = g va (xa0 , σ), V0r = g vr (xr0 , σ),
and ln cr0 = g cr (xr0 , σ), where xa0 and xr0 denote the values of the state vector in period zero
under regimes a and r, respectively, and σ is a parameter scaling the standard deviation of
the exogenous shocks. Then we can rewrite the above expression as

 g va (xa0 , σ) − g vr (xr0 , σ)             cr r                β               cr r
                                 = ln[(1−λ)eg (x0 ,σ) −bcr−1 ]+     ln(1−λ)−ln(eg (x0 ,σ) −bcr−1 ). (57)
             1 − φ4                                             1−β

It is clear from this expression that λ is a function of x0 ≡ [xr0 ; xa0 ], and σ, which we write as

                                              λ = Λ(x0 , σ).

Consider a second-order approximation of the function Λ around the point x0 = x and σ = 0,
where x is defined by setting all elements of x0 at their Ramsey-steady-state values. Because

                                                       44
we wish to characterize welfare conditional upon the initial state being the deterministic
Ramsey steady state, that is, x0 = x, in performing the second-order expansion of λ only its
first and second derivatives with respect to σ have to be considered. Formally, we have

                                                          Λσσ (x, 0) 2
                            λ ≈ Λ(x, 0) + Λσ (x, 0)σ +              σ .
                                                              2

Because, by construction, the deterministic steady-state level of welfare is the same in regimes
a and r, it follows that λ vanishes at the point (x0 , σ) = (x, 0). Formally,

                                          Λ(x, 0) = 0.

Totally differentiating equation (57) with respect to σ and evaluating the result at (x0 , σ) =
(x, 0) one obtains

     gσva (x, 0) − gσvr (x, 0)    1                               β               1 cr
                               =     [gσcr (x, 0) − Λσ (x, 0)] +     Λσ (x, 0) −    g (x, 0).
              1 − φ4             1−b                             1−β             1−b σ

Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004d) show that the first derivatives of the policy functions with
respect to σ evaluated at xt = x and σ = 0 are nil (so gσva = gσvr = gσcr = 0). It follows
immediately from the above expression that

                                         Λσ (x, 0) = 0.

Now totally differentiating (57) twice with respect to σ and evaluating the result at (x0 , σ) =
(x, 0) yields
                                            g va (x, 0) − gσσ

                                                              (x, 0)
                             Λσσ (x, 0) = − σσ         h           i.
                                                         β      1
                                            (1 − φ4 ) 1−β + 1−b

Thus, our welfare cost measure, in percentage terms, is given by
                                          va           vr

Applying this formula to evaluate the welfare cost of following the optimized policy rules
given in equations (53) and (54) instead of implementing the Ramsey-optimal policy, we
obtain a cost of 0.017 percent of the Ramsey consumption process. Using figures for personal
consumption expenditures per person in the United States in 2003, the welfare cost amounts
to 4.42 dollars per person per annum.

6.2    Ramsey and Optimized Impulse Responses
To provide a sense of how close the dynamics induced by the Ramsey policy and the optimized
rule are, in this section we present theoretical impulse responses to the three shocks driving
business cycles in our model economy. Figure 1, displays impulse response functions to a
one-standard-deviation increase in productivity (ln z1 = 1.2 percent). Solid lines correspond
to the Ramsey equilibrium, and broken lines correspond to the optimized policy rules.
    Remarkably, in response to an increase in productivity, hours worked fall (indeed more
than one for one). The reason for this sharp decline in labor effort is the presence of signifi-
cant costs of adjustment in investment and consumption. Notice that neither consumption
nor investment move much on impact. As a result, the increase in productivity must be
accompanied by an increase in leisure large enough to ensure that output remains little
changed on impact. The contraction in hours following a positive productivity shock is in
line with recent econometric studies using data from the U. S. economy (see, for example,
Galı́ and Rabanal, 2004).
    The equilibrium dynamics of endogenous nonpolicy variables induced by the optimized
policy rules mimic those associated with the Ramsey economy quite well. Surprisingly, these
responses are induced with settings for the policy variables that are remarkably different from
those associated with the Ramsey equilibrium. In particular, the response of the income tax
rate is virtually flat in the competitive equilibrium whereas under the Ramsey policy tax rates
increase sharply initially and then quickly fall to below-average levels. At the same time, the
Ramsey planner responds to the productivity shock by tightening money market conditions,
whereas the policy rule calls for a significant easing. It follows that the initial deceleration in
inflation is a not a consequence of the monetary policy action—which is expansionary—but
rather a reaction to forces that are fiscal in nature. In effect, the optimized rule leaves the
income tax rate unchanged. At the same time output is expected to increase, so that the
expected value of tax revenues increases. As a result a higher level of government liabilities
can be supported in equilibrium. The initial deflation, therefore, serves as a mechanism to
boost the real value of outstanding government liabilities.
   Figures 2 and 3 display impulse responses to a government spending shock and a gov-
ernment transfer shock, respectively. In both cases, the size of the initial impulse equals one
standard deviation of the shock (3.2 percent for the government spending shock, and 3.5
percent for the government transfer shock). The equilibrium dynamics under the optimized
policy rule appear to mimic those associated with the Ramsey policy not as closely as in
the case of a productivity shock. This is understandable, however, if one takes into account
that these two shocks explain only a small fraction of aggregate fluctuations. In effect, pro-
ductivity shocks alone explain over 90 percent of variations in aggregate activity under the

weight on fitting the dynamics induced by gt and nt .


6.3    Ramsey Policy With A Single Instrument
In this section we ask how optimal policy changes if the government is restricted to setting
optimally either monetary or fiscal policy but not both. Of course, the answer to this
question may in principle be sensitive to the details of the policy that is assumed to be set
non optimally.
   We consider two cases. In one, fiscal policy is set optimally, while the monetary authority
follows a simple Taylor rule with an inflation coefficient of 1.5, that is, Rt /R = (πt /π)1.5 .
Here, the parameters R and π correspond to the steady-state values of Rt and πt in the Ram-
sey equilibrium with optimal monetary and fiscal policy. We pick this particular specification
for monetary policy because it has been widely used in related empirical and theoretical stud-
ies. The other policy regime we consider is one in which monetary policy is determined in
a Ramsey optimal fashion but fiscal policy consists in keeping real government liabilities
constant over time. That is, at = a, where a denotes the deterministic steady-state value of
at in the Ramsey equilibrium with optimal fiscal and monetary policy. Our choice of fiscal
policy in this case is motivated by the fact that in most existing studies of monetary policy
it is typically assumed implicitly or explicitly that the fiscal authority ensures fiscal solvency
under all possible (equilibrium and off-equilibrium) paths of the price level.
   Table 6 displays second moments of endogenous variables of interest and welfare of the
representative agent conditional on the initial state being the Ramsey steady state with op-
timal fiscal and monetary policy. The economy with nonoptimal fiscal policy is significantly
more volatile than the economy with nonoptimal monetary policy. The reason is that in the
economy with nonoptimal fiscal policy the government is forced to adjust tax rates over the
business cycle so as to ensure constancy of real public liabilities. Higher volatility of real
variables, however, is not associated with lower welfare. On the contrary, the welfare cost of
not being able to conduct optimal monetary policy are much larger than the welfare cost of
not being able to conduct optimal fiscal policy.


7     Capital and Labor Taxation
In this section, we characterize dynamic Ramsey policy under the assumption that the fiscal
authority has access to three tax instruments, taxes on capital income (τtk ), taxes on labor
income (τth ), and taxes on pure profits (τtφ ). Clearly, the optimal tax rate on profits is 100

    Note: In the case of optimal fiscal policy only, monetary policy takes the form
    of a Taylor rule, Rt /R = (πt /π)1.5 (in this formula, we use the notation used in
    the exposition of the paper, so that Rt and πt are expressed in gross quarterly
    rates), where R and π denote, respectively, the steady-state values of Rt and πt
    in the Ramsey equilibrium with optimal fiscal and monetary policy. In the case
    of optimal monetary policy only, fiscal policy consists in keeping real government
    liabilities constant, that is, at = a, where a denotes the steady-state value of at in
    the Ramsey equilibrium with optimal fiscal and monetary policy. The variables
    Rt and πt are expressed in percent per year, and τty is expressed in percent. The
    standard deviations and serial correlations of output, consumption, investment,
    hours, wages, and government liabilities correspond to percent deviations from
    their steady-state values. The welfare cost is measured in dollars of 2003 per
    person per year and is defined as the compensation needed to make the repre-
    sentative agent indifferent between living in a world with the policy indicated in
    the respective column heading and living in a world where both monetary and
    fiscal policy are Ramsey optimal.

percent. We thus set τtφ = 1 for all t for the remainder of the section.
    We analyzed the Ramsey steady state of this economy earlier in section 4. As shown on
line 5 of table 2, in the Ramsey steady state the labor income tax rate is 38.2 percent and the
capital subsidy is 44.3 percent. For the calibration shown in table 1, we find that the standard
deviation of the capital income tax rate under the Ramsey policy is 148 percent. The natural
reaction to this number is that in this economy the constraint that capital subsidies and
taxes should be less than 100 percent will be frequently violated and in this regard the
optimal policy makes little economic sense.13 Qualitatively, however, the intuition for why
the volatility of the capital income tax is high is clear. Because capital is a predetermined
state variable, unexpected variations in the capital income tax rate act as a nondistorting
levy, which the fiscal authority uses to finance innovations in the government budget. The
(population) serial correlation of capital tax rates is very close to zero at -0.07. When
capital income tax rates can play the role of a fiscal shock absorber, government liabilities
no longer display the near random walk behavior as in the case of an income tax. In fact,
the (population) serial correlation of at now is only 0.6.
   To put the number we obtain for the optimal volatility of τtk into perspective, we use as
a point of reference two simpler but related economies. First, Chari et. al. (1995), study
optimal taxation in a standard real-business-cycle model with exogenous long-run growth
and report a standard deviation of the capital income tax rate of 40 percentage points for
the stochastic steady state of the Ramsey equilibrium.14
   The second economy we study as a point of reference is a stationary version of the RBC
model of Chari et al. (1995). We find that if one assumes no long-run growth in the Chari et
al. economy, the standard deviation of capital income taxes shoots up to about 60 percent
(assuming that the level of government assets in the steady state is the same as in the
economy with growth). This result illustrates that relatively minor modifications in the
economic environment can lead to drastic changes in the optimal volatility of capital income
tax rates. Still, these values are not as high as the ones we find in our much more complex
model economy. In what follows we complete the reconciliation of our finding with those
available in the existing literature.
  13
     Our computational strategy does not allow us to consider the case that tax rates are bounded above
and below explicitly. But even if one were to use an alternative computational method, one should find that
Ramsey capital income tax rates vary significantly over the business cycle.
  14
     Chari et. al. consider an annual calibration (that is somewhat different from the one considered here)
with business cycles driven by government purchases and technology shocks. Recently, Benigno and Wood-
ford (2005) using a different numerical technique replicate this finding. As a test of our numerical procedure,
we also study this economy and are able to reproduce the numbers reported in Benigno and Woodford.




                                                      52
7.1    Time To Tax
Two modifications to our medium-scale macroeconomic model allow us to drive the optimal
volatility of capital tax rates down to a level that is comparable to the one that obtains in
the standard real business cycle model without growth. First, the model studied by Chari
et al. features no impediments to adjusting the level of investment over the business cycle,
whereas our model economy incorporates significant investment adjustment costs. Lowering
the investment adjustment cost parameter κ by a factor of 1,000 reduces the optimal capital
income tax volatility from 148 percent to 66 percent which is close to the volatility of the RBC
model without growth. If in addition we assume that tax rates are set one period in advance,
then the optimal capital tax volatility falls to 20 percent. The reason why adjustment costs
induce a higher optimal volatility of the capital income tax is that investment adjustment
costs make capital more akin to a fixed factor of production thereby making movements in
the capital tax rate less distorting.
    Second, the time unit in the Chari et al. model is one year. By contrast, the time unit
in our model is one quarter. Our choice of a time unit is guided by the fact that we study
optimal monetary policy as well as optimal fiscal policy. It is unrealistic to assume that the
government adjusts monetary policy only once a year. For example, in the United States
the FOMC meets every 8 weeks. At the same time, it is equally unrealistic to assume that
tax rates change every quarter. One possible way to resolve this conflict is to continue to
assume that the time unit is one quarter and to impose that tax rates are determined several
quarters in advance, that is, that there are tax lags.
   Figure 4 depicts the standard deviation of the capital income tax as a function of the
number of tax lags. It shows the results for the economy calibrated using the parameter
values shown in table 1. The graph illustrates that the optimal volatility of the capital
income tax rate falls steadily with the number of tax lags. Under the assumption that tax
rates are determined four quarters in advance, the optimal volatility of capital taxes is driven
down to about 49 percentage points. This level of volatility is lower than the values obtained
in a non-growing RBC model.


7.2    Capital Tax Volatility and Cost of Varying Capacity Utiliza-
       tion
Another difference between the simple RBC model of Chari et al. (1995) and the model
studied here, is that our model economy incorporates variable capacity utilization. One may
think that the presence of variable capacity utilization could induce lower capital income tax
volatility. For in this case the effective stock of capital is no longer predetermined. As a result,

one would expect that variations in the capital income tax rate should be more distorting
and hence used less. It turns out, however, that the volatility of the capital income tax rate
is not significantly affected when the cost of varying the intensity of capacity utilization falls
(in our model, when γ2 is reduced). For example, when we hold γ1 constant and reduce γ2
by a factor of 2, the optimal capital tax volatility increases from 149 percent to 153 percent.


8     Conclusion
We study Ramsey-optimal fiscal and monetary policy in a medium-scale model of the U.S.
business cycle. The model features a rich array of real and nominal rigidities that have
been identified in the recent empirical literature as salient in explaining observed aggregate
fluctuations.
   We find that price stability appears to be a central goal of optimal monetary policy. The
optimal rate of inflation under an income tax regime is half a percent per year with a standard
deviation of 1.1 percent. This result is somewhat surprising given that the model features a
number of frictions that in isolation would call for a volatile rate of inflation—particularly
nonstate-contingent nominal public debt, no lump-sum taxes, and sticky wages.
    Under an income-tax regime, the Ramsey-optimal income tax rate is quite stable, with
a standard deviation of 1.1 percent around a mean of 30 percent. In addition, the Ramsey
outcome features a near random walk in real public debt. Taken together, these results
suggest that shocks to the fiscal budget are financed neither through surprise inflation (as in
models with flexible nominal prices), nor through adjustments in the income tax rate, but
rather through variations in the fiscal deficit. It follows that the Ramsey equilibrium has
little resemblance to a world operating under a balanced-budget rule.
     We show that simple monetary and fiscal rules implement a competitive equilibrium that
mimics well the one induced by the Ramsey policy. These rules bring about welfare levels
that are virtually identical to the ones associated with the Ramsey policy. The optimized
interest-rate rule is passive, in the sense that the inflation coefficient is less than unity, and
features a mute response to output and a mild degree of interest-rate inertia. At the same
time, the optimized fiscal-policy rule is acyclical, in the sense that tax rates do not respond
to changes in either output or the level of public debt. The fiscal rule is super inertial, with a
coefficient on the lagged tax rate of about 2. Thus, for example an increase in taxes today is
expected to be followed by further tax increases in the future. In equilibrium, this property
of the fiscal rule renders tax rates virtually constant over the business cycle.
    When the fiscal authority is allowed to tax capital and labor income at different rates,
optimal fiscal policy is characterized by a large capital subsidy of over 40 percent with an

                                               55
enormous volatility of about 150 percent. The introduction of four quarters of time to tax
brings this volatility down to 50 percent. While significant, this decline leaves the Ramsey-
optimal capital-income-tax volatility impractically large.
    The present study could be extended in a number of directions. One is to allow for a
richer set of underlying shocks. Altig et al. (2004), for instance, allow for an additional
productivity shock that is specific to the investment sector. Also, Smets and Wouters (2004)
estimate a model with 10 shocks. Additionally, one could assume that the shocks driving
business cycles are nonstationary, as in Altig et al. (2004). These extensions are of interest
because optimal stabilization policy will in general be shaped by the number and nature of
the exogenous shocks generating aggregate fluctuations. A word of caution, however, is in
order before taking this route. In econometrically estimated versions of the model studied
in this paper (or variations thereof), it is often the case that a large number of shocks is
estimated as a byproduct. A number of these shocks are difficult to interpret economically.
In effect, these shocks, to a large extent, represent simple econometric residuals reflecting
the distance between model and data. A case in point are shocks to Euler equations or
uncovered interest parity conditions. Before incorporating this type of residual as driving
forces, it is perhaps more productive to give theory a chance to get closer to the data.
    Possibly the most urgent step in this research program, however, is to characterize credible
policy in large macroeconomic models. The Ramsey plans derived in the present study are
time inconsistent, in the sense that at each point in time, a social planner that cares about
the welfare of people from that moment on, has incentives to abandon promises made from
a timeless perspective. In the past two decades, a growing literature in macroeconomics
has been focusing on game-theoretic approaches to policy making. This literature focuses
on identifying credible punishment schemes by the public should the government default on
its policy promises. The aim is to find credible policies that maximize welfare. Thus far,
applications of this line of research to fiscal and monetary policy has been limited to highly
stylized, small-scale models. Extending the study of credible monetary and fiscal policy to
large-scale models would be an important milestone for the theory of stabilization policy.

Appendix
The welfare comparison of section 6.1 is based on a second-order accurate approximation
to the equilibrium welfare function, which involves a second-order approximation of the
competitive and Ramsey equilibria. Here, we briefly explain the approximation method.
The set of equilibrium conditions (whether it is the Ramsey equilibrium or the competitive
equilibrium induced by a particular monetary/fiscal policy rule) can be written as

                                     Et f (yt+1 , yt , xt+1 , xt ) = 0,                           (58)

where the vector xt contains the predetermined, or state variables and is of size nx , and
the vector yt contains the nonpredetermined variables of the model and is of size ny . Let
n = nx + ny . The state vector xt can be partitioned as xt = [x1t ; x2t ]0 . The vector x1t consists
of endogenous predetermined state variables and the vector x2t consists of exogenous state
variables. Specifically, we assume that x2t follows the exogenous stochastic process given by

                                       x2t+1 = Λx2t + η̃σt+1 ,                                  (59)

where both the vector x2t and the innovation t are of order n × 1. The vector t is assumed
to have a bounded support and to be independently and identically distributed, with mean
zero and variance/covariance matrix I. The scalar σ ≥ 0 and the n × n matrix η̃ are
known parameters. All eigenvalues of the matrix Λ are assumed to have modulus less than
one. The solution to the model given in equation (58) is of the form:

                                             yt = g(xt , σ)

and
                                     xt+1 = h(xt , σ) + η σt+1 ,

where g maps Rnx × R+ into Rny and h maps Rnx × R+ into Rnx . The matrix η is of order
nx × n and is given by                             "         #
                                                         ∅
                                             η =                 .

We use the methodology and computer code developed in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004d)
to compute a second-order approximation of the functions g and h around the non-stochastic
steady state, xt = x and σ = 0.15 The deterministic steady state of the model, (x, y), is the
