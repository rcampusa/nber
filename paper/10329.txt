Good versus Bad Deflation: Lessons from the Gold Standard Era
Michael D. Bordo, John Landon Lane, and Angela Redish
NBER Working Paper No. 10329
February 2004
JEL No. E3, N20

                                           ABSTRACT

Deflation has had a bad rap, largely based on the experience of the 1930's when deflation was

synonymous with depression. Recent experience with declining prices in Japan and China together

with the concern over deflation in Europe and the United States has led to renewed attention to the

topic of deflation. In this paper we focus our attention on the deflation experience of the United

States, the United Kingdom, and Germany in the late nineteenth century during a period

characterized by low deflation, rapid productivity growth, positive output growth, and where many

nations had a credible nominal anchor based on gold: circumstances which have resonance with the

world of today. We identify aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and money supply shocks using

a structural panel vector autoregression. We then use historical decompositions to investigate the

impact that these structural shocks had on output and prices. Our findings are that the deflation of

the late nineteenth century reflected both positive aggregate supply shocks and negative money

supply shocks. However, the negative money supply shocks had little effect on output. This we posit

is because the aggregate supply curve was very steep in the short run during this period. This

contrasts greatly with the deflation experience during the Great Depression. Thus our empirical

evidence suggests that deflation in the nineteenth century was primarily good.

I. Introduction

       Recent concerns by the FOMC at its meeting in May 2003 that the "balance of
risks in the US had shifted in favor of deflation", similar concerns raised by an IMF
Report on Deflation (2003) over the risk of deflation in Europe, especially Germany and
Switzerland, and the experience of declining price levels in China and Japan has sparked
new interest in the subject of deflation. In this paper we examine the issue from an
historical perspective. We focus on the experience of deflation in the late nineteenth
century when most of the countries of the world adhered to the classical gold standard.
The period 1880-1914 was characterized by two decades of secular deflation followed by
two decades of secular inflation.

       The price level experience of the pre-1914 period has considerable resonance for
recent concerns over the possibility of deflation’s re-emergence. Four elements of the
earlier experience are relevant for today’s environment: deflation was relatively low (1-
3% in most countries); productivity advance was rapid; the real economy was growing;
and the price level was anchored by a credible nominal anchor – adherence to gold
convertibility.

       Deflation has had a ‘bad rap’. Possibly as a consequence of the combination of
deflation and depression in the 1930s, deflation is associated with (for some, connotes)
depression. In contrast, a basic tenet of monetary theory – the Friedman rule – suggests
that deflation (albeit perfectly anticipated) is an outcome of optimal monetary policy. On
the face of it, the evidence from the late 19th century was mixed: on the one hand, the
mild deflation in the period 1870 - 1896 was accompanied by positive growth in many
countries, however, growth accelerated during the period of inflation after 1896.

       We distinguish between good and bad deflations. In the former case, falling prices
may be caused by aggregate supply (possibly driven by technology advances) increasing
more rapidly than aggregate demand. In the latter case, declines in aggregate demand
outpace any expansion in aggregate supply. For example, negative money shocks that are



                                                                                        1
non-neutral over a significant period would generate a ‘bad’ deflation. This was the
experience in the Great Depression (1929-33), the recession of 1919-21, and may be the
case in Japan today.1 There is also a third possibility – the Classical case where deflation
– for example caused by negative money shocks - is neutral, as when monetary neutrality
holds.2

          We focus on the price level and growth experience of the United States, the U.K.
and Germany from 1880-1913. All three countries adhered to the international gold
standard, under which the world price level was determined by the demand and supply of
monetary gold, and each member followed the rule of maintaining convertibility of its
national currency into a fixed weight of gold. This meant that the domestic price level
was largely determined by international (exogenous) forces.

          We proceed by identifying separate ‘supply’ shocks, money supply shocks and
‘non-monetary’ demand shocks using a Blanchard-Quah methodology. We identify the
shocks by imposing long run restrictions on the impact of the shocks on output and
prices, and then do a historical decomposition to examine the impact of each shock on
output and the price level.3 We present three sets of empirical results: firstly, results for
each country from estimating a panel over the period 1880-1913, then results from
estimating a panel over only the deflationary period, 1880-96, and finally results from the
entire period in a model in which gold supply shocks are included as an exogenous
variable. Contrasting the first two series of results enables us to discuss the symmetry
between the deflationary and inflationary period, while in the third set we separate money
supply shocks coming from gold shocks from those coming from intermediation shocks.


1
  The traditional explanation for this non-neutrality is nominal rigidities and more recently balance sheet
effects are also ascribed an important role (Bernanke, 1983).
2
  Many people take issue with the term “good” deflation on the view that any departures from price
stability are problematic. An alternative set of terms that we could use are “benign” versus “malignant”
deflation or “the good, the bad and the ugly” as used by Borio and Filardo (2003). These terms connote:
productivity driven deflation as used by us; low deflation and stagnation as has been the case in Japan; and
the interwar experience.
3
  A similar methodology is followed in Bordo and Redish (2004). The results of the historical
decompositions for the money stock, as well as the results from forecast error variance decompositions, are
not presented in this paper for space reasons, but are available from the authors on request. The results are
consistent with those reported in this text.


                                                                                                            2
        The paper begins by briefly describing the data and historical environment. We
then discuss the empirical methodology to be used. Our empirical analysis is presented in
the next three sections, and the final section discusses the results and their implications
and limitations.

        Focussing on our interest in the deflationary episode, our results in a nutshell
suggest that the deflation was generated by monetary factors, but that these monetary
factors do not explain much of the behaviour of output. Output was determined by non-
monetary factors and the deflation was essentially good or neutral.

II. The context

        Figure 1 illustrates the behaviour of the money stock, prices (GDP deflators) and
real incomes in the three countries over the period 1880 - 1913. We use broad money
(M2) as our measure of money stock, real GDP as our measure of real income and the
GDP deflator as our measure of prices.4 While there are differences in the patterns there
are a few common trends: price levels declined – more in the U.S. than elsewhere - over
the period 1880 to the mid 1890s, and subsequently rose. The money stock rose secularly,
the most pronounced rise occurring in Germany, and in the U.S. the growth rate increased
after 1896. Income levels rose with a slight acceleration in the US and UK after the
1890s, but German output growth decelerated (very slightly) from its very rapid post-
1870s rate after the mid-1890s.

        The period 1880-1913, encompassed myriad economic events. Technological
changes occurred rapidly, and earlier changes were implemented at the production level.
German and US growth outpaced that of England. Early historians had described the
period before 1896 as a ‘great depression’ but more recent historiography has recast the
period as one of deflation without depression (Craig and Fisher, 2000). Although there
were very severe recessions, particularly in the early 1890s, secularly incomes rose.

(1998); Germany – Prices: Sommariva and Tullio (1987); GDP: Mitchell (1998); Money: Deutsche
Bundesbank (1976). Real output is denominated in 1913 pounds sterling while nominal money supply is
denominated in current pounds sterling. The GDP deflators are used as the price series and these are based
in 1913.


                                                                                                             3
Particularly noteworthy is the transmission of business cycles across economies, with all
three of our economies experiencing common cycles.5

         At the monetary level there were also secular trends and cyclical fluctuations. The
gold standard tied the quantity of money to the stock of gold. Figure 2 shows that world
gold production was constant and relatively low from 1870 to 1890 while after the early
1890s it grew. The growth reflected gold discoveries in South Africa as well as Australia
and North America.

III. Methodology

         Our empirical analysis is grounded by a model of money supply under the gold
standard. The appropriate modeling strategy depends on the time horizon of interest,
whether one is interested in the very long run, the long run or business cycle frequency.
The ‘very long run’ we consider to be a period long enough for the quantity of gold
mined to respond endogenously to macroeconomic variables.6 Given the short span of
data available for our empirical analysis, we do not attempt to capture effects over this
period, and restrict ourselves to long run and business cycle frequencies.

         The long run is defined here as a period over which purchasing power parity
holds, and we model a world comprising several gold standard economies linked together
by trade in gold, goods and capital. We assume that in each economy the quantity of
money is a stable function of the country’s stock of monetary gold, but the function is
allowed to vary across countries reflecting, for example, the existence or not of a central
bank, required reserve ratios, the degree of monetization and the nature of the banking
system. The world price level is determined by the world demand for money (based on
the determinants of velocity and aggregate income) and the supply of money (the supply
being determined by stocks of gold and the nature of intermediation). Individual
economies take the world price level as exogenous. For each country we identify three
5
 See IMF (2002) and Bergman, Bordo and Jonung (1998).

 For example, models in Bordo and Ellson (1985) and Dowd and Chappell (1997) allow the quantity of
gold mined to respond endogenously to the price level, through investment in refining technologies and
exploration. See also, Barro (1979) and Rockoff (1984). Rockoff argues that the increased gold production
of the late 19th century was a response to the incentive of the high real price of gold (i.e. low price level).


                                                                                                              4
shocks that drive the joint behaviour of prices, output and the money stock: a money
supply shock, a technology shock, and a non-monetary demand shock, where the
definition of each shock is implicit in the identifying assumptions described below.

       We model output, prices and money supply using the following tri-variate VAR
in differences:

                                      p
       (1)             ∆yt = Dtα + ∑ B j ∆yt − j + ε t ,
                                     j =1



where yt = ( pricet , GDPt , M t ) and Dt is a matrix of deterministic variables that includes

a constant and possibly a time trend. The data are tested for the presence of a unit root
and are differenced to make them stationary.

       Underlying the reduced form specification, (1), is a set of structural innovations,
ut, that are orthogonal to each other and are related to the reduced form innovations in (1)
by

       (2)             ε t = Cut .


       Our aim is to identify orthogonal shocks, ut, that can be interpreted as an
aggregate supply shock, a nominal money supply shock and a non-monetary aggregate
demand shock. To this end, we identify C by imposing long-run restrictions on the
structural impulse response functions implied by (1). These long-run restrictions are
imposed using the method described in Blanchard and Quah (1989).

       In order to exactly identify C for each country, we need to impose at least three
independent long-run restrictions on the impulse response functions from (1). Our
preferred identification is as follows: An aggregate demand shock is assumed to have
zero long-run impact on output and prices. That is, the demand shock has no permanent
impact on prices or output. We also assume that the aggregate supply shock, in the
context of the gold standard, has no permanent impact on prices. That is, the long-run
impact of an aggregate supply shock on price is zero.


                                                                                            5
       This identifying restriction follows from the fact that the countries in our sample
were all strictly adhering to the gold standard during the sample period. An aggregate
supply shock would be expected to initially lower the price level and increase real output.
The decline in the price level would lead in turn to a gold inflow via the current account,
hence raising the money supply and price level. Thus, gold flows will have the effect of
causing price levels, in the absence of further shocks, to return to their original levels.

       These three long-run restrictions are enough to exactly identify C and hence
identify the structural shocks, ut. We thus impose no restrictions on the impact of the
third shock. This is the only long run influence on the price level and can be interpreted
as a world price level shock or, in the context of our model, as a money supply shock.
The aggregate demand shocks are presumably an aggregate of money demand shocks and
temporary spending shocks, which cannot be disentangled. The effect of such an
aggregate on prices and output in the short run would depend on its component mix, and
we essentially treat this as a reduced form construct.

       A summary of our preferred identifying restrictions is:
 1.    An aggregate supply shock has no long-run impact on prices.
 2.    An aggregate demand shock (combining the impact of velocity and spending
       shocks) has no long-run impact on either prices or output.
 3.    The long run (and short run) impact of a nominal money supply shock on money,
       output and prices is unrestricted.

The long-run impact of shocks to ut, the structural innovation vector, is

       (3)              LR = ( I − A(1)) −1 C ,

where A( L) = I − A1 L − K − A p L p and A(1) = I − ∑ pj=1 A j . Assuming that the structural

innovation vector is ordered as u t = (money shock t , supply shock t , demand shock t )′ then

the long-run impact matrix is




                                                                                              6
                               LR11     0       0 
        (4)             LR =  LR21    LR22     0  .
                               LR31   LR32    LR33 


        In addition to our preferred identification there are other possible long-run
restrictions that could have been imposed. The most likely additional restriction is money
neutrality, which would imply that the long-run impact of a money shock on output is
zero. The addition of this long-run restriction leads to the long-run impact matrix

                               LR11      0      0 
        (5)             LR =  0       LR22     0  .
                               LR31   LR32    LR33 


        Clearly this leads to an over-identified system. Following the method described in
Amisano and Giannini (1997), the over-identifying restrictions imposed in (5) can be
tested. If this extra long-run identification cannot be rejected it will be imposed.
However, we prefer not to impose money neutrality but rather allow the data to tell us if
money neutrality holds during this sample. Only then do we impose this additional long-
run restriction.

        Another possible combination of the four long-run restrictions given in (4) and (5)
would be

                               LR11    LR12    0 
        (6)             LR =  0       LR22    0  .
                               LR31   LR32   LR33 


In this specification money neutrality would be imposed while the impact of the supply
shock would be unconstrained. The set of constraints given in (6) exactly identify the
structural shocks. If (5) is rejected we are left with a decision on whether to use (4) or (6),
and opt for (4) on the basis of the historical context.

        Given the small sample size inherent in the data there are efficiency gains from
pooling the data and estimating a panel VAR (PVAR) given by


                                                                                             7
                                          p
       (7)             ∆y it = Dt α i + ∑ Bij ∆y it − j + ε it ε it ~ N (0, Σ i ) .
                                         j =1




       The maintained assumption in this exercise is that the slope coefficient matrices,
Bij, are common across the countries in the panel. Different growth rates between
countries and periods are allowed by permitting the constant terms in each VAR to be
different. Also, the variance-covariance matrix of the innovations for each country
specific VAR, ∑ i , is allowed to differ across countries. This assumption allows for cross-

sectional heteroscedasticity in the data. One implication of permitting cross-sectional
heteroscedasticity is that individual countries are not constrained to have the same
responses to structural shocks. All that is being assumed is that all countries have the
same slope coefficient matrices in the reduced form VAR. Also, the values of the slope
coefficients do not change throughout the sample. These two assumptions are tested and
the results of these tests are reported in Table 1 and Table 2.

       The PVAR in (7) is estimated using the standard seemingly unrelated regression
estimator (SURE) with cross-equation restrictions imposed as defined above. This allows
us to exploit the panel structure and any contemporaneous correlation in shocks between
countries to improve the efficiency of our estimates. After estimating our PVAR we then
estimate Ci for each country using the scoring algorithm defined in Amisano and
Giannini (1997) and use these estimates to calculate structural impulse response functions
for each country. Once we have Ci we are also able to construct the structural shocks
implied by (2).

       The structural impulse response functions isolate the impact of each of our
identified shocks on each variable. Since we impose no restrictions on the impact effects
of the shocks, we can use consistency between the theoretical predictions for the impact
effects and the estimated impulse response functions to make the case that our economic
interpretation of the estimated shock is valid. Having made that case, the historical
decompositions allow us to do the counterfactual analysis that is inherent in our
questions: How would output and prices have evolved if there had been no monetary



                                                                                          8
shocks? What were the relative contributions of money and real shocks to the late 19th
century deflation? These results are reported in the next Sections.

IV. Results – Full Sample

        Prior to estimation we analyzed the time series properties of the data and
concluded that all the series were I(1) and we therefore estimated the model in first
differences. That is, we estimated (7). Information criteria tests suggested that a model
with two lags fit the data well (that is p=2), and we included a trend break in all series in
1896. Given that the series are all non-stationary and that we estimated (7), the break in
trend is handled by putting a dummy variable that takes the value of 0 before 1897 and
takes the value of 1 from 1897 until 1913. Clearly using two lags in (7) would have
severely affected the degrees of freedom of the estimator for the individual estimation.
Table 1 reports tests of slope parameter equality across the countries in the sample. That
is, Table 1 reports Wald test results for the test given in (8):

                        H 0 : Bij = Bkj ∀i, k for each j
        (8)             vs.
                        H A : Bij ≠ Bkj for some i, k and for some j.


        This test was performed using data from the whole sample (1880-1913) and using
data for the deflationary sample (1880-1896). In both cases the null hypothesis could not
be rejected so that our assumption of similar short-run dynamics across the countries in
our panel is not rejected by the data. Given that there appears to be a trend break in 1896
a test was performed to see if there was also a structural break in the short-run dynamics
of the VAR. That is, we tested to see if the estimates of Bij were significantly different for
the two different periods. Results from these tests are reported in Table 2. For each
country individually and for the panel estimate there is no evidence of a structural break
in the short-run dynamics of the system. Therefore, we account for the break in trend
with intercept adjustments only.

        Structural impulse response functions were estimated using identifications (4) and
(5). The over-identifying restrictions in (5) were tested and these results can be found in


                                                                                            9
Table 3. Estimating (1) using data from each country individually we see that the over-
identifying restrictions are rejected for each country. When we estimate (7) using the
panel estimator we see that neutrality is rejected for the US and the UK but not for
Germany. Therefore we do not impose neutrality and so use identification (4) to compute
the structural impulse response functions.

           Structural impulse response functions showing the impact of a 1% shock are
reported in Figures 3 through 5. Standard error bands show 90% approximate asymptotic
confidence intervals calculated using the method described in Amisano and Giannini
(1997).7 We observe for all countries that the money supply shock has a large positive
impact on output in the short run, and a much smaller (zero for Germany) long run
positive impact. In the US, prices and the money stock rise proportionately in response to
the money shock, though in the other countries the price effect is larger. In each case the
supply shock is observed to cause a significant temporary decline in prices (recall that the
long run impact is imposed to be zero). In the US, the long run income elasticity of
money is roughly unitary (that is, the money stock increases proportionately with
increases in income) while in Germany and the UK it is somewhat less that unitary.
Consistently with the interpretation as a demand shock, the direction of the impact of the
third shock is the same for prices and output. In each case the shock has a negative short
run impact on prices and output, and a positive impact on money stocks, which is
consistent with an interpretation that velocity shocks dominated the demand influences.

           Historical decompositions for each shock are reported in Figures 6 through 8.
The three panels each contain plots of three series: the actual path of the variable, a
baseline – which incorporates trends and shocks before the estimated period but none of
the shocks during the estimated period; and a line showing the baseline plus the effect of
one of the structural shocks. If the third line lies essentially on top of the baseline, then
the isolated shock had no effect on the variable, while if the third line lies on top of the
actual line, it shows that the isolated shock accounts for the behaviour of the variable.

    In fact probably less than 90% given our small sample size.


                                                                                            10
       In all three countries the behaviour of the price level is driven by the money
shock. That is, while the impulse response functions show that supply shocks have short
run price effects, the quantitative impact of those effects is negligible. More germane to
our interests is the behaviour of output. In the UK and Germany supply shocks explain
virtually all output fluctuations. In the United States, supply shocks are the dominant
driving force, however, in a number of years money supply shocks have a noticeable
impact. This is consistent with the conventional wisdom that US monetary institutions
exacerbated output volatility in these periods. In all countries the impact of the demand
shocks was small.

       The estimated structural shocks are shown in Figure 9. Consistently with our
interpretation of the history of the period, the money supply shocks are correlated across
the three countries, as are the supply shocks. The demand shocks are uncorrelated,
suggesting that there was a significant idiosyncratic component to the temporary shocks.

       Two sensitivity analyses were carried out to check the robustness of our results.
First we replaced M2 with M0, the monetary base, as our measure of money stock.
Second we included dummy variables for 1907 and 1908, a period of financial crisis for
the countries in our sample, in the VAR. In both cases, while the magnitudes of the
impulse response functions were slightly different, the qualitative results described above
remain. This was the case for the benchmark VAR for the entire period and the
subsequent VAR where we add in the world gold stock as an exogenous variable.

V. Deflationary Period Results

       Using the panel consisting of the three core countries, a PVAR is estimated using
data from the period 1880-1896. This period saw a substantial price deflation as seen in
Figure 1. Taking into account the first three periods that are lost due to first differencing
the data and the two lags used in the PVAR, there are 14 observations for each country.
Clearly, this would not be enough data to estimate the VAR for each individual country
in the sample. However, in the PVAR data are pooled from the three countries in the
panel so that we have a total of 42 observations at our disposal. The test statistic of the


                                                                                          11
test of slope coefficient equality across countries is 35.75 with a p-value of 0.481 (see
Table 1). This means that there is no statistical evidence to suggest that we cannot pool
the data for the deflationary period.

       We began by testing for the over-identifying restrictions in (5), and the results are
reported in Table 3. Similar to the full sample case we see that the test is rejected for the
US and is not rejected for Germany. However, for the UK the p-value is now 0.08. Using
the full sample in the PVAR the p-value for the UK was smaller than 0.001. Given that
the point estimate of the long run impact of money on output is similar, at about 0.5%,
the change in the p-value is most likely due to the smaller sample size, and hence larger
standard errors, rather than there being anything different for the UK in the deflationary
period. We therefore proceeded by estimating the model without monetary neutrality
(that is, the model of equation (4)). Figures 10-12 report the structural impulse response
functions for each country.

       Overall, the impulse response functions for the deflationary period have the same
qualitative appearance as in the full sample. In particular, for the US and UK the impulse
responses show that a money supply shock which has a given effect on the long run
money stock has the same estimated impact on output in both the full sample and the
deflationary sample. This is an implicit test of the symmetry of the responses in the
deflationary period and inflationary period, and suggests that, for the late nineteenth/early
twentieth period that we are examining, responses were symmetric in the two eras.

       Finally the results of the historical decompositions of output are shown in Figures
13-15. While the sample sizes for the individual countries are small, it is clear for each
country that the behaviour of prices was driven by the money shock. That is, the deflation
of the late nineteenth century was generated by negative monetary shocks. The behaviour
of output is again largely driven by supply shocks, although in the mid-1880s US output
reflected the impact of all three types of shocks.




                                                                                          12
VI. Results for the full period with exogenous gold shocks

          Our preferred identification, (5), is driven by the fact that during the period of our
sample, the countries in our panel were all on the gold standard. We are therefore
interested in knowing what role, if any, gold shocks played during this period. The model
that is estimated is

                                                          p               m
          (9)              ∆y it = α i 0 + α i1 D1896t + ∑ B j ∆y it − j + ∑ γ k ∆Gold t −k + ε it ,
                                                         j =1            k =0




where Goldt is the total world gold stock.8 In this specification gold is completely
exogenous to the system. As noted in Section 3, at very long horizons the world gold
stock may be endogenous, but given the time span of our data exogeneity is a reasonable
assumption. Table 4 shows the results of a Hausman type test for exogeneity. For all
countries and all variables we cannot reject the hypothesis that gold is exogenous to our
variables.9 A panel VAR is estimated using (9) with slope coefficients, Bj, and the impact
coefficients of gold, γj constrained to be equal across countries. Table 1 contains the
results of the Wald test that tests whether the coefficients on gold in (9) are common
across the countries in the panel. The reported p-value for this test is 0.63 so the
hypothesis that the gold coefficients are common across countries cannot be rejected.

          Figures 16 to 18 depict the structural impulse response functions calculated using
the estimates of (9). These figures are qualitatively similar to the previous impulse
response functions when gold was not included into the VAR.10 Figures 20 to 22 depict
the historical decompositions. Again we see that money contributes most to prices and
the supply shock explains most of the observed variation in output. It is interesting to
note that gold does not play an important role in the observed variation of prices and
output.

  Note that the Hausman test is really a test of whether ordinary least squares provide consistent estimates
of (12). To conduct the Hausman test we use ∆gold t − 2 as the instrument for ∆gold t .
10
   The only qualitative difference is that the monetary shock has a small long run negative impact on
German output (when we estimate over only the deflationary sample this result is overturned – see below).


                                                                                                          13
           We have also re-estimated the model for the deflation sample alone (1880-1896),
but for space reasons do not include the figures here.11 The historical decompositions for
prices show that, as in the case without gold, supply shocks and the non-monetary
demand shock contribute little to the behaviour of prices. But now the price level is
explained in part by gold shocks and in part by domestic money shocks. Gold shocks
however explain little of the output fluctuations.

           Figure 19 shows the impact of a 1% increase in gold supply on prices, output and
money supply. We see that the long run impact of this gold shock is what we would
expect under the gold standard. That is, the long-run impact of a 1% increase in gold
supply is a 1% increase in prices, a 1% increase in money supply and no increase in
output. This result suggests that our assumptions based on the gold standard are not
unrealistic.

           However, there is a puzzling result in that the initial impact of the gold shock on
prices is negative. One reason for this may be that the gold shocks that we are observing
could be price led rather than being exogenous to the system. That is, lower prices lead to
gold flows that appear in the data as positive gold supply shocks. This last observation
would suggest that gold is not entirely exogenous and the possible endogeneity between
price and gold should be modeled explicitly. How best to model this endogeneity is a
difficult question as gold supply most probably has an endogenous component and an
exogenous component. This problem is left for future research.

VII Conclusions
           Inflation rates around the globe have fallen from historically high levels in the
1970s and 1980s to numbers close to zero as the 20th century ended. Indeed some
countries have experienced actual deflation. Yet output growth rates remain positive. Not
since the turn of the 19th century, have economies experienced such low inflation
associated with non-negative growth, and it seems natural to turn to that period to learn
about macro behaviour in low inflation or possibly deflationary environments.

           Deflation can reflect the impact of positive aggregate supply shocks (in the
absence of offsetting positive demand shocks) or negative demand shocks. In the latter
case, if the aggregate supply curve is non-vertical, the deflation will be ‘bad’ in that it
will be accompanied by negative output effects.

           Our results show that the deflation in the late nineteenth century gold standard era
in three key countries reflected both positive aggregate supply and negative money
supply shocks. Yet the negative money shock had only a minor effect on output. This we
posit is because the aggregate supply curve was very steep in the short run. Thus our
empirical evidence suggests that deflation in the late nineteenth century was primarily
good.

           Important issues for today’s environment arise from our findings. We need to be
clear about what was different between the late nineteenth century environment and that
of the twentieth and twenty first centuries. First, the historical era we analyze was the
classical gold standard regime under which all three countries were linked together via
common adherence to the gold standard convertibility rule and all faced a common
money shock – the vagaries of the gold standard.

           Second, aggregate supply seems to have been an important source of the shocks
that we identify. This is likely in contrast to the other major deflationary episodes of the
the twentieth century including: 1920-21, 1929-33, and Japan in the 1990s, which many
observers posit reflected the consequences of severe monetary contraction.12 Today’s
environment in the US, Canada and the EU may indeed be closer to the pre-1914 era than
the earlier twentieth century episodes.

           Third the short run aggregate supply seems to have been very steep pre-1913.
This meant that negative demand shocks did not have much of a contractionary bite. This
result is in sharp contrast to the experience of 1929-33. Many attribute the catastrophic

declines of output in the face of monetary contraction then to the presence of nominal
rigidities, in particular sticky wages (Bordo, Erceg and Evans, 2000).

        Our analysis does not deal with many important issues that resonate in today’s
policy debate over what to do about the spectre of deflation. These include the zero
nominal bound problem -- that very low inflation by reducing nominal interest rates
makes it difficult to conduct monetary policy by conventional means (Orphanides, 2001).
In contrast to today, in the pre-1914 era, little emphasis was placed by the policy makers
in countries, like the UK and Germany, which had central banks, in using monetary
policy to stimulate the real economy. Hence the zero nominal bound was not viewed as a
problem.

        We also do not explicitly distinguish between the effects of actual versus expected
price level changes. It is unexpected deflation that produces negative consequences.
However the steep slope of the aggregate supply curve revealed in our work suggests that
price level changes were large anticipated. We also do not consider the efficiency aspects
of deflation. According to Friedman (1969), the optimum holding of money would occur
at a rate of deflation equal to the long run growth rate of real output.

        Finally, although we find that pre-1914 deflation was primarily of the good
variety, it doesn’t mean that people felt good about it. The common perception of the
1880s and 1890s in all three countries was that deflation was depressing. This in turn may
reflect the fact that deflation was largely unanticipated. It may also have reflected money
illusion.13 This was reflected in labor strife and political turbulence. This perception can
be seen in the views of US farmers who believed that the terms of trade had turned
against them and workers in all three countries who did not view falling money wages as
being compensated by even more rapidly falling commodity prices. It is doubtful if a true
deflation today would be any less unpopular.

13
  Friedman and Schwartz ( 1963; 41-2) compare the U.S. experience of the 1870s when money growth
exceeded the growth of the labor force but not the growth of real output so that nominal wages were rising,
with the 1880s when money growth was less than the growth of the labor force and of real growth and
money wages declined. They then relate these facts to the increase in labor unrest and agitation over the
monetary standard.
